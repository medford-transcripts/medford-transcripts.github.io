1
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:07,275
A regular meeting of the Medford City Council will please come to order.

2
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:24,691
Mr. Clerk, if you would, call the roll.

3
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:29,256
Present with the six present, one absent, please rise to salute the flag.

4
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:50,130
Chair recognizes Vice President Arnold Kern for suspension of the rules to take petition of citizen Castanetti.

5
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,471
All those in favor?

6
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,391
All those opposed?

7
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:55,672
Motion carries.

8
00:00:55,752 --> 00:01:01,633
The chair invites forward Mr. Andrew Castanetti to make his petition.

9
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:08,255
15-794 petition by Andrew P. Castanetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

10
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:16,652
asking the Council to adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 58, for Owner-Occupied Real Estate Exemption.

11
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:18,814
Citizen Castaneda.

12
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:21,216
Thank you, Councilor De La Ruza.

13
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:27,442
Andrew Castaneda, 23 Cushion Street, Method Mass.

14
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:28,403
My phone number is 396-TIPS.

15
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:29,223
Thank you.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,222
and allow me to express myself under our first amendment rights.

17
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:44,846
Um, first of all, it's not apathy when there's only a few people here at the council meetings.

18
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:51,490
It's more like people have given up fighting the city hall, figuring they're probably going to do what they want anyways.

19
00:01:52,531 --> 00:02:02,718
Um, my petition actually read Andrew P Castanetti petitioning the city council and the mayor to adopt mass general laws, chapter 59,

20
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:05,691
Chapter 59.

21
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,974
Is it okay?

22
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:15,719
Test, test, test, test.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,122
Thank you anyway, just look for it.

24
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,984
My petition actually read the following.

25
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:33,032
It's the Andrew P Castaneda petition, not just the city council, but in the mayor to adopt mass general laws, chapter 59, section five C.

26
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:43,411
for the maximum 20% owner-occupied real estate tax exemption to lower the real estate tax for the middle-class homeowner.

27
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:55,795
Please allow me to quote my open-ended letter in the method transcript published on October 15th.

28
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,517
I sent this to Nell Escobar Coakley, the editor.

29
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:03,078
Please publish my great question before this Thursday's

30
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:06,704
great debate on October 15th of this year.

31
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:16,932
The letter stated, question for all of city of Medford political candidates.

32
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:22,396
Are you for or against the home owner occupied real estate tax exemption?

33
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:28,961
Go to the Commonwealth Massachusetts website and refer to a mass general laws chapter 59 section five C one.

34
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:39,385
Massachusetts cities are already presenting this real estate tax savings to its owner-occupied homeowners.

35
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:45,627
This includes three bordering cities, such as Malden, Everett, and Somerville.

36
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,749
My question is, why not here in Medford?

37
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:57,032
For the past 40 or more years, our real estate tax bill in Medford has increased over 2.5 percent per annum.

38
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,533
However, if this automatic

39
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,454
20% exemption outlining mass general laws, 59 section five C is adopted.

40
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:16,043
The average owner occupied homeowner would receive a $200 savings per year instead of the usual $200 increase.

41
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,465
That's a large swing of a difference.

42
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:23,550
Again, I'm asking why not here in Medford?

43
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:27,093
I'm asking all city council and mayor candidates.

44
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:41,184
to respond to this question before the upcoming election so that the voters have ample time to read your responses and cast their ballots for candidates who support tax relief for the citizens of our city.

45
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:47,890
Please send your written response to the method transcript, letters to the editor, and so we the people.

46
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:50,232
Thank you for your attention and response.

47
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:54,235
APC.

48
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:56,637
My question was not asked at the great debate.

49
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:07,083
And as of tonight, December 8th, 2015, I have not seen any replies of communication in the method transcript as requested.

50
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:17,367
Maybe you are not aware of this, come with the Massachusetts law or whatever.

51
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:25,891
I took some time today and I prepared a sampling of all the city appraised valuations.

52
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:38,050
some of them, most of the city counselors, homes in the mirrors, and all of these city appraised valuations are below 539,000.

53
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:52,484
Even if all of these home values increase 10% next year, they will still see their real estate tax bill go down up to $600 a year.

54
00:05:56,494 --> 00:06:06,159
instead of the usual $130 to $390 increase every year, after year, after year, and so on.

55
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:14,183
The one exception is one of the counselors, and it may go up a whopping $7.

56
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:25,069
Bottom line, nine of 10 owner-occupied average homeowners will save

57
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:30,305
about $200 a year instead of the usual $200 increase.

58
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:31,646
That's a big swing.

59
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:34,567
Again, why not here?

60
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,408
And I'm under the weather.

61
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:43,289
I'm not feeling so good, so I never finished the rest of my spiel.

62
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:51,472
But basically, I hope when you do the allocation that you will

63
00:06:54,254 --> 00:07:01,358
give the average owner, occupied homeowner who lives in their one house only the full 20 percent.

64
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,619
That's all I have to say.

65
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,061
I request for the sixth consecutive year.

66
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,622
Thank you for listening.

67
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,384
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

68
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:16,466
Good evening.

69
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:19,107
Please state your name and address for the record.

70
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:20,508
29 Garfield Avenue in Medford.

71
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,510
We'll talk about taxes.

72
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:33,978
I don't know whether people realize it or not, but 22% of the American workforce works for either city, state, or federal government.

73
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,401
And it seems like somebody's not doing their job.

74
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,184
We have a lot of illegal apartments in the city.

75
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:46,948
We have hundreds of cars that are registered out of state.

76
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:50,991
We're losing the excise tax.

77
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:55,585
and all the rest of the taxes that go along with owning an automobile.

78
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,709
Somebody's sitting on their hands and not doing their job.

79
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,251
It's easy to tax the person that pays their taxes.

80
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:07,636
But we need the government to start doing their jobs and get after these people.

81
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:14,182
You get a car registered out of state, you get caught, that car should be confiscated and auctioned off.

82
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:17,549
not sit on our hands.

83
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,313
I brought this up to a police officer, and he told me, well, the car's parked in the driveway.

84
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:29,340
The guy lives in Massachusetts, and the car's registered in New Hampshire.

85
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:33,143
In New Hampshire, it's not required to have insurance.

86
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,648
That's why most of them register their cars in New Hampshire.

87
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:42,212
We have to start getting after these people that are doing illegal stuff.

88
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,563
Never mind hitting the homeowner that pays his taxes faithfully every year.

89
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:54,425
We have to get these agents, there are agencies out there that are supposed to be doing their job.

90
00:08:56,346 --> 00:09:00,767
With 22% of the American workforce, there has to be an agency for everything.

91
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,889
They can come cockroaches, they can get after these illegal cars and apartments and everything else.

92
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:13,251
We have to lay off the homeowners that pay their taxes and get after these illegal people.

93
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,384
that are breaking the law and getting away with it on our backs.

94
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:22,467
On our backs.

95
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:27,371
My pension doesn't go up as fast as the taxes are going up.

96
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:33,097
So that means I have to cut something in order to pay my taxes.

97
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,442
And these other people are getting away with murder and laughing at you.

98
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,604
And they know it.

99
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,690
We have to get after these people that are doing illegal stuff.

100
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,510
I mean, there are agencies.

101
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,390
Let's push them.

102
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:53,171
Thank you.

103
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,191
That's all I have to say.

104
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:55,792
Thank you very much.

105
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:57,432
Chair awaits a motion.

106
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,373
Mr. President.

107
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:03,653
Councilor Pinto.

108
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,914
Can we incorporate the comments of the prior two speakers?

109
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:15,810
and have on the suspension, bring in the paper for the purposes of tonight of making the request for sending the tax rate.

110
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:28,080
Well, we can motion that these two, um, uh, comments on this paper be, uh, attached to the, uh, uh, public hearing and return to the regular order of business.

111
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,481
Is that your motion?

112
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:29,801
Yes.

113
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:30,602
Very good.

114
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:34,925
So on the motion of council Penta, all those in favor, all those opposed, the motion carries.

115
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,122
back in the regular order of business, a public hearing, 15-757.

116
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:54,606
A public hearing will be held of the Medford City Council and the Howard F. Alden Memorial Chamber's City Hall Medford Mass on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 7 p.m.

117
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:55,586
The purpose of the hearing

118
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:08,066
is to hear the Board of Assessors on the following items for the purpose of allocation of the fiscal year 2016 property tax.

119
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:12,711
One, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2016.

120
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:16,935
Two, select an open space discount.

121
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,877
Three, select a residential exemption.

122
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:23,160
Four, select a small commercial exemption.

123
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:36,806
Call 781-393-2425 for any aids, accommodations, et cetera, by order of the Medford City Council, Medford, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk.

124
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:45,690
The chair declares the public hearing opened and invites the assessor to address the council.

125
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,671
Please state your name and address for the record.

126
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:49,572
Thank you, Mr. President.

127
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:51,208
My name is Ed O'Neill.

128
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:55,829
I'm the chief assessor appraiser and also the chairman of the board of assessors for the city of Medford.

129
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:08,812
And I am here respectfully appearing before your honorable body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2016 property tax.

130
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:19,295
Number one, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2016 by selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy,

131
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:25,367
will be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

132
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:33,473
This results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

133
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:37,115
Historically, the council has chosen the minimum residential factor.

134
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:43,740
If this is once again the council choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.897446.

135
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,823
Number two, to adopt an open space discount.

136
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,590
This does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required.

137
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:54,853
Number three, to adopt a residential exemption.

138
00:12:55,554 --> 00:13:02,220
If adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value.

139
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:10,248
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

140
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:13,471
Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate,

141
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:18,445
a number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase in their tax bills.

142
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,846
Number four, to adopt a small commercial exemption.

143
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:32,628
If adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than a million dollars may receive an exemption of up to 10% of the recessed value.

144
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:41,710
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to other commercial and or industrial properties.

145
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,650
Since this shift causes a higher

146
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:50,276
commercial industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

147
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:57,897
As part of this hearing tonight, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity.

148
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,418
Fiscal year 2016, excess levy capacity is $25,391.53.

149
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:08,039
Please refer to the handout from last week at the committee of the whole meeting.

150
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:21,121
And Mr. President, Councilor Lengelkorn asked for the abbreviated version of the presentation.

151
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:24,885
Mr. President?

152
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,867
Chair recognizes Vice President Lengelkorn.

153
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,090
Are we under public hearing or can I?

154
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,693
I just want to bring in 15795.

155
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,538
I'm sorry, we're still in the public hearing, I apologize.

156
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:44,360
So all those in favor of this matter, please present yourselves and speak.

157
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,521
All those in favor?

158
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,923
Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed.

159
00:14:51,603 --> 00:15:04,928
All those in opposition, and we noted that two were earlier, as was moved by Councilor Penta, but anybody else in opposition, please present yourself to the podium.

160
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:15,527
and state your opposition to this, and then we'll have time for discussion to follow.

161
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:31,398
So, Doctor, as you know, under the rules of the public hearing, you just state your opposition if you are opposed, and then you'll have time to present once we enter into the discussion phase.

162
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,131
Thank you, Mr. President.

163
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:35,073
This is in opposition to what?

164
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,734
Would you state that specifically?

165
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:58,271
In opposition to the matter as presented in the public hearing as outlined by the assessor, Mr. O'Neill, the four-point plan to, one, determine the residential factor to be used, two, adopt an open space discount, three, adopt a residential exemption, four, adopt a small commercial exemption.

166
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,652
No, I'm not in opposition to that.

167
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:01,373
I do want that discussed thoroughly.

168
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:02,284
Thank you.

169
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,128
Anybody else in opposition?

170
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,091
Hearing and seeing none.

171
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:10,977
Good evening.

172
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:12,659
Please state your name and address for the record.

173
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,342
My name is Michael Leggero.

174
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:17,727
I wish to speak in opposition of this plan.

175
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:19,029
Thank you.

176
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:24,891
And we'll have time for discussion as the public hearing portion closes.

177
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:34,433
Hearing and seeing none other in opposition, we declare that portion of the meeting closed and now enter the discussion phase.

178
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,814
And I invite the vice president to speak.

179
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:38,274
Thank you, President De La Russo.

180
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:47,717
I'd just like to bring in paper 15795 in coordination with the public hearing so that we can

181
00:16:48,989 --> 00:17:07,298
On the motion to merge 15-795 into this discussion, it reads, offered by Vice President Longo-Kern, be it resolved that the proposed tax levy be reduced by $1 million, which is less than half of the amount we put into free cash from last year's budget.

182
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,659
All those in favor?

183
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,480
To merge it?

184
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,561
To merge it in.

185
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:13,261
Yes.

186
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:21,768
to merge this discussion into the discussion phase of the tax discussion.

187
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,669
All those in favor to merge this matter in with it.

188
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,290
All those in favor.

189
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,231
All those opposed.

190
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,472
So the papers are merged.

191
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:33,114
Mr. President.

192
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,361
It will have to be voted on separately.

193
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:39,881
Right.

194
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:40,201
Yeah.

195
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,461
Move it as an amendment.

196
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,602
Um, once we discuss, you know, obviously we're going to all discuss that.

197
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:45,303
So very good.

198
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:48,384
So the chair recognizes, uh, counselor lungo current for discussion.

199
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:55,666
I'll yield to the, um, thank you.

200
00:17:55,966 --> 00:18:06,090
Point before we get into that, uh, Mr. O'Neill point of information for the assessor before you start suddenly.

201
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:10,038
You were asked last week to forward us information.

202
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:18,060
You indicated there was 1,569 parcels of land that are over the $580,000 assessed value.

203
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,562
And we asked for a breakdown of that 580 going up in increments of $50,000 per piece.

204
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:26,302
We never got that.

205
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:36,505
It was distributed according to the clerk and the packages we received over the weekend on Friday afternoon.

206
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:45,290
That's not— For you, Mr. President, I gave that to the clerk Thursday late afternoon.

207
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,153
I may have some additional copies.

208
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,937
In my package, it was paper clipped.

209
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:03,117
paper-clipped to the piece that began with the long-awaited explanation of the parking revenue.

210
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:20,228
Through the chair, yeah, it was actually paper-clipped to something irrelevant to the tax hearing, so it was a little... The clerk has pointed out that it was part of the committee report that we had requested, therefore it was connected all as one.

211
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:32,005
then through the chair, if I may, President De La Russo, Mr. O'Neill, if we can, while the other counselors are viewing that, I did take a look at it myself.

212
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:48,077
If you could just explain how it's broken down as a, it is hard to grasp all the numbers, but what we were looking for, and I think it must be in here, is the increase to, yeah, the dollar amount increase.

213
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:49,258
I don't, I don't really see that.

214
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:59,689
And if I could, just for the viewing public, I know Mr. O'Neill or myself or one councillor every year kind of explains the problem we have with the shift.

215
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:10,936
I don't know, you always seem, probably will say it better than I do, but the issue I have as a councillor to shift to non-occupied is that this year there'll be over 16,000, 16.

216
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:10,936
1569.

217
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:11,216
1569, 1,569 homes

218
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:23,556
that are valued at 580 or above that will also see the shift.

219
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:27,979
They will also get increases in taxes that other homes will not get.

220
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,020
So that's where the problem is always lied.

221
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:42,468
That's the reason the way it's worded and the way the legislature worded it becomes an issue for, you know, how can we create a shift for 15 to 16 homes when we're not creating it for everybody?

222
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,590
So that's where always I've had a problem.

223
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,032
So at our last meeting, we did discuss it.

224
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:48,653
We discussed it in the committee of the whole.

225
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,129
Mr. O'Neill to break it down.

226
00:20:53,149 --> 00:21:02,392
The average home of 580,000 or more, what type of shift would that create for these homes, which is, you know, that's a good amount of homes.

227
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:09,374
I think it was out of 12,000, there was almost 1,600 homes that are going to be affected if we ever approve the shift.

228
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:18,837
So this breakdown, if you could just kind of clarify which each category, each column represents and the actual dollar figure for the increase, depending on

229
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:21,147
the value of the 580 or above.

230
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:22,910
That would be helpful for me.

231
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:43,701
After the committee, the committee of the whole meeting on Tuesday, uh, the council had requested, uh, more detailed analysis, uh, and increments of 25,000 or so in value, uh, you know, above the break even point of five 80, 100.

232
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,725
So I did a couple before that for started at 400,000 to 500 to five 25, five 50, five 80, um, all the way up to a million point two.

233
00:21:55,822 --> 00:22:03,166
I did the analysis on adopting a 10% exemption, a 15%, and a 20%, which is currently allowed by law.

234
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:12,290
We'll start with the 10%, and that's in the original packet, plus the handout that was given to the council on Thursday afternoon.

235
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:18,773
So basically, if you look at, and I believe everybody has that now?

236
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:19,634
Yep.

237
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:21,575
Folks in the audience as well, okay.

238
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:27,966
So there's small increases after 580 to 600.

239
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:34,308
So at a 10% adoption of the exemption, it'd be a $20 increase.

240
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:36,428
Now this is on top of the regular increase of 125, 130, 140.

241
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,869
That's an additional.

242
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:41,270
So you go up to 625, it's about 42 more dollars.

243
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,870
675, it's about $88.

244
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,870
Say 750 is 156.

245
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:54,825
then it starts to increase.

246
00:22:55,305 --> 00:23:01,270
You get $800,000, there'll be an additional $202 plus the regular $150.

247
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:06,915
So it's a significant impact as you go up the line in the value.

248
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,197
So... Just a point of clarification.

249
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:09,597
Sure.

250
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:20,165
As you're making this assumption that the values, as they go up significantly, even if you took a house that's valued at $800,000, they're going to get an increase of $202.

251
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:20,546
Correct.

252
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,542
over and beyond whatever the tax rate's gonna be.

253
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:30,407
But if you go to a house that's only valued at $400,000, they're gonna get a decrease of 161.91.

254
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:33,549
Correct, that's why I put that in there.

255
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:38,473
The council only asked for anything above 580, but just for illustration purposes.

256
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:47,480
I wouldn't want anyone to think that the same type of value going up doesn't correspond to the devaluation going down, because there is merit that goes both ways.

257
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:50,843
It's quite obvious that under the 580, going backwards,

258
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:55,871
and lower amount, the rate is even higher giving back than going forward.

259
00:23:56,452 --> 00:24:04,195
And if you're only talking about 1,569 votes, you know, to me, I think this is an important time to really take into consideration.

260
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:12,820
Maybe it's about time we start looking at this and giving rate payers in this community a break because, you know, they're just going to get saddled now with the CPA tax.

261
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,101
You know, whether you voted for it or not, every house is going to get stuck with it.

262
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:16,882
So.

263
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:18,042
Fiscal 17 for that.

264
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:18,662
Pardon me?

265
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:19,183
Fiscal 17.

266
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:22,206
But they're still going to get stuck with it for five years.

267
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:29,991
And for the next five years, they're going to be stuck with a tax that, whether you voted for it or against it, you're going to be stuck with it.

268
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:36,635
So I think if there's a way to look at a break here for the homeowners, it's giving that exemption, whether it's 10, 15, or 20%.

269
00:24:36,995 --> 00:24:42,538
And I'm leaning toward that, because I think if you can afford a house that's $800,000,

270
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:48,889
You can afford to pay maybe another couple hundred dollars more a year.

271
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,233
I don't know how many houses in the city are worth $800,000.

272
00:24:52,954 --> 00:24:57,358
So you've got 1,569 houses broken down from 580 going forward.

273
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,284
You've got 9,000 and something from 580 going backwards.

274
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:05,868
And it sort of tells me that the majority should rule in something like this.

275
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,929
That's why I put that in the illustration.

276
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,671
Again, it's in the packet every year.

277
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:22,398
The majority would get a reduction at the expense of the non-owner occupied apartment buildings and owner occupied above the 580.

278
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:25,700
That's why I did the illustration so you can actually see that.

279
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,683
So there's 1,569 properties that would still pay more.

280
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,825
It would be incremental depending upon their assessment, correct?

281
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:53,142
So based on the information, Mr. Assessor, that you provided to us, I know the city of Somerville, the city of Malden has implemented residential exemptions.

282
00:25:54,842 --> 00:26:01,626
I assume that their non-owner occupied class is much higher than ours, is that correct?

283
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:04,168
In the housing population?

284
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,502
They have a higher Cambridge, Somerville, Malden.

285
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,584
Yeah, I've done a little more research on that.

286
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:21,332
Somerville and Malden, I believe we have more single family housing stock is comprised of, I think it's 7,800 single family homes.

287
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:27,057
In Somerville, I believe their primary housing stock is a two family or a condominium.

288
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:31,200
And their condominium, their conversions are back

289
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:32,816
They're greater than ours.

290
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:35,177
Malden, to a lesser degree.

291
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:44,559
The history on Malden, they implemented the trash fee one year, maybe four years ago.

292
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:51,180
Then they went to a 5% residential exemption because of the, I guess, the resistance to the trash fee.

293
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,580
So they threw a 5% residential exemption out.

294
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:56,001
So they still had some properties that did go up.

295
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,141
I don't know the numbers on them.

296
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:59,322
The second year, they went up to 10%.

297
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:00,362
Next year, they went up to 20%.

298
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:02,585
So, they've done it gradually.

299
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:03,606
Right.

300
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:15,849
So, my opinion on this, and it's been this way for the last several years, is I have no problem shifting it from owner-occupied to non-owner-occupied.

301
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,790
I think that's a great idea, and I think it's something that we should move towards.

302
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:31,133
The issue that I have, and I agree with some of my colleagues, is the fact that because we don't have a large percentage of non-owner-occupied in the community,

303
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,432
that we have to shift some of the burden also to assess values at over $580,000.

304
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:55,519
And I take a little bit different approach than my council colleague that you could have a widow living in a property assessed at, a house assessed at 800,000 and on a fixed income, just because you're in a house that's assessed at 800,000 doesn't necessarily mean you're rolling in money.

305
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:59,520
And so I have a little difference of opinion that

306
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:01,754
These are the people that we should go after.

307
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:07,736
Now, if it was a straight split between owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied, I have no problem.

308
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:26,081
At what point or what will it take for us to see a shift from this 1,569 owner-occupied properties that would currently get taxed at a higher tax rate based on the residential exemption?

309
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,135
What do we need to do?

310
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:27,555
What?

311
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:32,058
We need to add more condos to the housing stock, more apartments.

312
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:40,325
What needs to take place so we can see that shift move away from going after people that are owner-occupied?

313
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,406
Mr. Sperling.

314
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:43,487
Through you, Mr. President.

315
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:44,608
Please.

316
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:48,891
I think most folks know that the apartment sector is booming.

317
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,774
Not just condo conversions are

318
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,134
It's large apartment buildings.

319
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:58,094
They found their way into Medford.

320
00:28:58,174 --> 00:28:59,575
It's a great location for it.

321
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,936
The costs are, interest rates are good.

322
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:06,017
There's a demand for it with the younger generation.

323
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:13,359
I mean, I don't necessarily think that would be the answer, have less or more.

324
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,740
What's happened in the past, last year the cutoff was 543 and it was 1319.

325
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,978
The year before it was 501, now we're 1063.

326
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:26,619
So it's driven by the value part of it.

327
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:37,442
Now what we do on a proactive basis in our database, we daily make changes and research and validate property ownership.

328
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:39,702
We do it a number of different ways.

329
00:29:39,742 --> 00:29:41,403
We have databases that we can look at.

330
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:43,643
So we're updating that continuously.

331
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:47,264
I think we've increased it 200 and some odd from last year.

332
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:49,565
So we're looking to try to increase that

333
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:51,850
uh, accuracy, if you will.

334
00:29:52,810 --> 00:30:01,974
So currently it is qualified about 12,264 out of a total of 16,367 residential parcels.

335
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,435
And that also includes land.

336
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:07,277
So you have to take all the residential, all the properties, all of them.

337
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:10,438
So we do, we do the analysis every year.

338
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:12,359
We do, we do update the database.

339
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:18,442
Um, you know, honestly, it's probably just a matter of taking the boat and just, and,

340
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:20,849
between 10%, 15%, 20%.

341
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,894
Keep in mind, in the residential tax levy itself, it's a pool of money.

342
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:31,758
If you give somebody a break, someone else covers that, pays for that.

343
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:44,527
So you might, as we've discussed in prior years, the apartment owners may start to increase rents on people that have been there, you know, years, the smaller, older housing stock apartment buildings.

344
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:48,130
We do hear a lot, people that are property rich,

345
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,086
They live up in the higher value properties.

346
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:53,187
We hear from them on the exemptions.

347
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:54,948
We try to help them with that.

348
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,808
We try to help them with the circuit breaker.

349
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:02,311
And then they get to a point where we just had a lady a couple weeks ago, she says, well, I just have to sell it.

350
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:03,491
I just can't.

351
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:08,033
My husband died, and I just can't afford it anymore.

352
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:13,316
And to make that vote and put that burden on that person, that's another.

353
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:17,417
So the residential tax levy gets pushed on someone.

354
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:31,711
a matter of tax policy for the city to say, look, this is best for everybody, one rate, or do we want to start picking and choosing constituencies or people that, well, they can afford more, they have a larger property value.

355
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,772
It's up to the body to make that decision.

356
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:43,996
So if someone has a two-family home and they live in one side and they rent out the other, is that house classified as non-owner occupied?

357
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:47,958
No, the owner lives there, they would get that, yes.

358
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,980
So that would be considered?

359
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:51,001
It would go with all the property.

360
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:51,921
Owner-occupied.

361
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:54,402
So it would be two units or one unit?

362
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:55,222
It would be one unit.

363
00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:56,323
They would get one exemption.

364
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:59,084
And then the other unit would be considered non-owner-occupied?

365
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:00,924
No, unless it was a condo.

366
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,105
Condominiums would.

367
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:08,507
It's one ownership for two families, so the two-family would get the residential exemption.

368
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:10,247
All you have to do is live there to get it.

369
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,268
So if I had a three-family, the same would apply?

370
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:17,070
Sure.

371
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,330
Yeah.

372
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:17,930
If you live in it,

373
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:18,897
Absolutely.

374
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:19,558
If you live in it.

375
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:33,343
So yeah, but now another thing we, uh, two years ago we discussed this, I think through council Penter, we compiled the apartment list and the majority of the folks who own the apartments do not live in Medford.

376
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:34,884
So that we looked at that too.

377
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:37,525
The owner occupied some live in them.

378
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:46,149
Majority of them don't four units and up, obviously not the big, you know, the big units, the big, large complexes, but the smaller four to eight units.

379
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:50,451
Most don't live in Medford, so they wouldn't enjoy that.

380
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:56,956
They would still get an additional increase, which may be passed on to the tenants.

381
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:03,500
I just want to make sure everybody understands the impact before the vote, if that's the way that the council's gonna go with this.

382
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,623
So if we were to implement this, it will take effect?

383
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:10,464
January's bill.

384
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:11,085
Correct.

385
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:12,145
In January's bill.

386
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:12,425
Right.

387
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:16,108
And how soon will we be able to see what the shift is

388
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:17,613
what the impact is.

389
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,034
Are we going to take six months?

390
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:20,955
Is it going to take a year?

391
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:25,838
Well, the people that are above the breaking will see their taxes increased greater.

392
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,259
Right.

393
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:39,108
But based on some of these numbers and based on how we send out the tax bill, if the rate is only increased or the dollar amount $20 for the year, you may not even you may not even see that really.

394
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:42,910
Well, 20 plus the original plus plus whatever the original 175 shift.

395
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:51,749
And if you could refer it to the handout, page nine, the average single family would be $130,000 on average.

396
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,050
So it would be $130,000 plus the $20,000.

397
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,453
But that's for the $424,000, the average value.

398
00:33:57,473 --> 00:34:02,677
And if you're talking $600,000 to $700,000 value, that would even be more than that.

399
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,801
So it might be $250,000, $300,000 total increase.

400
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:10,644
So we would hear about that.

401
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:12,245
Bless you.

402
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:14,856
Thank you, Mr. President.

403
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:16,737
Thank you, Counselor Marks.

404
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:21,678
Vice President Langel-Kern.

405
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:24,618
Thank you, President De La Russo.

406
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:40,481
Just with regards to my motion that I have on the agenda, I think that the exemption is one way you can help reduce the levy, help reduce the tax rate for, you know, a certain portion of people in the city.

407
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:43,782
But I think another way we can reduce the tax burden

408
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:46,640
is through decreasing the levy.

409
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:53,685
Now, the tax levy is going to go up, as proposed, $4.5 million from last year.

410
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:59,669
But last year, we put $2.1 million from our budget into free cash.

411
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:01,830
Do I have those numbers correct?

412
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:05,213
Yes.

413
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:07,153
I have those.

414
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:10,255
From the documents I have, I believe I have those correct.

415
00:35:10,535 --> 00:35:13,497
So $2.1 million was put into free cash from our last year's budget.

416
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:18,099
The way I see it is that the people were overtaxed $2.1 million.

417
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,901
This has happened repeatedly year after year.

418
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:25,583
2014, almost $1 million was put into free cash.

419
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:26,124
2013, $1.88 million.

420
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:26,644
2012, almost $2.5 million.

421
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:40,861
June of 2011, 1.735 million.

422
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:47,426
So we are each and every year overtaxing and taxing to the max.

423
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,426
I bring it up every year.

424
00:35:48,446 --> 00:36:00,275
You can tax the 2.5 percent, which are allowed by law, or you can — I've asked the mayor's office and the administration to not tax to the max, especially where we're putting so much into free cash.

425
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:02,277
I do understand we need reserves,

426
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:07,098
but to the point where you're putting over $2 million in free cash, I feel like it's stealing.

427
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:16,180
So that's why I have the proposal on to reduce, just like I did last year, I think it was $900,000, because that was half of what we put in the year before.

428
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:29,402
But I believe that we should, one of two things, either reduce the tax levy to reduce the burden on each and every taxpayer, each and every homeowner, not just 75% of them or 90% of them, although I understand that argument,

429
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:35,439
I think we have to do something as a council.

430
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,560
We only had three votes last year.

431
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:40,382
We failed by one vote to reduce the tax levy.

432
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:44,065
And I'm asking that we reduce the tax levy again this year.

433
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,026
It only makes sense.

434
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:58,055
And the two ways you can go with it, and the way I see it, is you reduce the tax levy because you're not using the $2.1 million you're putting into free cash, or you start using it effectively.

435
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:07,162
Complaint after complaint, we don't staff our departments, any, almost any of our departments appropriately.

436
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:09,704
Our DPW department, our police department.

437
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:17,370
I was at the traffic commission meeting today and I complained, you know, head on that there is no, you know, enforcement is lacking.

438
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,331
And I was told that they're understaffed.

439
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:26,216
Well, we need to be able to say we're using our funds appropriately.

440
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:36,634
Complaints after complaints come in, our roads are broken, our streets need repaving, our sidewalks are a mess, our teachers barely get a stipend to buy supplies for the students.

441
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:50,296
There's definitely money out there because last night I understand that the school committee and I think Mr. Wilson and the mayor proposed a new position for 85,000 in the school for PR, I believe.

442
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:55,297
I'm not quite sure, but there's money out there and we're obviously not spending it wisely.

443
00:37:57,787 --> 00:38:04,891
I think it's something that needs to be discussed, and I think, you know, city services need to be improved upon.

444
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,413
We get street sweeping once a year, twice a year.

445
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:11,255
We asked as a council for a leaf pickup, maybe an extra time.

446
00:38:11,435 --> 00:38:12,556
No, we don't have the money for it.

447
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,456
Of course we do.

448
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:15,958
The residents want another leaf pickup.

449
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:18,900
We picked up leaves before the leaves even fell.

450
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,882
You know, we need to get it together, and I hope in January we really do get it together.

451
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:26,504
Enforcement is a whole other ballgame.

452
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,606
because we lack enforcement in every area in this city.

453
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,026
Accountability needs to be discussed.

454
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:39,487
I really hope for some positive changes come January, and I think this is one thing the council can do to alleviate the tax burden.

455
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:42,948
We have almost $10 million in free cash to date.

456
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:50,390
We added over $2 million this past year to free cash overtaxing our residents.

457
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,630
I think we need to alleviate that burden.

458
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,284
Times are tough for a lot of people.

459
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:58,466
The economy is better, but times are still tough.

460
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:05,792
And this city is just getting richer on the backs of the people that are paying the property taxes.

461
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:07,933
So that's my proposal to the council.

462
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:12,016
I hope you really think about it, whether that number can be discussed or negotiated.

463
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:15,399
But we do need to do something.

464
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,720
I agree with Mr. Castanetti.

465
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,403
I agree with the residents who email me on a yearly, if not

466
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:28,532
You know, I get weekly e-mails about people not being able, especially come January, about once the tax increase hits, we all get the e-mails.

467
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:34,955
We all hear the sad stories about people having to move or senior citizens being forced out of their homes.

468
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:36,876
We just heard one from the assessor tonight.

469
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:38,796
It happens.

470
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:43,118
I get the e-mails and they almost break your heart, but it's the truth.

471
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,239
People are having a tough time.

472
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,480
Not everybody is getting raises.

473
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,201
Not everybody can keep up with the tax rate and the increase.

474
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:50,582
Let's do something.

475
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:53,074
to help alleviate that problem.

476
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,596
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

477
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:57,277
The chair recognizes Councilor Pinto.

478
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:08,365
Mr. President, Mr. O'Neill, on this handout that you gave us, you used a tax rate of $11.19, but then you went over to, with the residential exemption, you increased the tax rate to $12.10.

479
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,046
Now, why'd you do that?

480
00:40:25,638 --> 00:40:32,662
Through you, Mr. President, because that's what happens in the page before that.

481
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:46,930
So in the packet from last Tuesday, it should be, it's page 12, the residential exemption package, which is about page four, page five of that.

482
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,853
So that would be like 12E.

483
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,978
When you do that shift, it increases the tax rate.

484
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:02,501
So that's how we come up with the break even point.

485
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:11,830
So even though one property would get the exemption over 580, with the higher tax rate, the likelihood that they would be paying more.

486
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:15,688
So it's just part of the analysis that we provide annually.

487
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:25,694
It's, it's in the formula to arrive at, um, the, the dollar amount for the residential exemption and the actual new tax rate.

488
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:30,998
Why can't the council do, let's just say we talked for hypothetical.

489
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:39,663
We take the 10% exemption and at the, at the same time, can we go after non owner occupied residences and charge them at a higher rate?

490
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:41,364
Well, they would pay the same rate.

491
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:41,465
So 10%,

492
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:49,352
would change the tax rate from a proposed $1,119 to $1,210.

493
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,894
So everybody in residential class would pay $1,210.

494
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:58,598
If you adopted the 15%, the rate would jump to $1,261.

495
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,940
If you adopted 20%, it goes up.

496
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:03,762
So that would be $1,316.

497
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:06,123
So they would pay more.

498
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:11,707
But I'm talking about an out-of-towner that owns multiple pieces of property.

499
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:14,449
So where do they fit into this?

500
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,169
You can't call them.

501
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:16,250
Sure.

502
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,211
They would pay the same rate.

503
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:21,213
If you adopt hypothetically, how come other cities and towns can charge a higher rate?

504
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:25,256
Everybody pays the same rate.

505
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:28,498
There's 13 communities that have adopted the residential exemption.

506
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:32,500
You know, if it works for every community, there'd be more than 13 out of 351.

507
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,842
So that's the way the formula works.

508
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,764
And that's what some have referred to it as a flaw.

509
00:42:39,544 --> 00:42:40,165
I believe in,

510
00:42:41,910 --> 00:43:00,933
1998, then Councilor Burke proposed to have the average, some language inserted, and it was, went to committee and it was not voted on favorably item in 1998, which would have made it across the board for owner occupied to get a different rate.

511
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:08,054
So again, if there were more, if it was that easy, more communities would adopt it.

512
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,935
It's a complicated formula.

513
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:11,727
that we do.

514
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:12,668
Okay.

515
00:43:12,688 --> 00:43:21,771
So for example, the, the average right now, if we tack the 1119, the average house is going to go up approximately $130.

516
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,811
Is that what you're saying?

517
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:25,292
Single family paid page nine in the handout.

518
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:33,515
That's what that, that would be if the council adopted the historic residential factor, shifting it to one 75%, that would be the,

519
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:41,750
That's the scenario on page 9, correct, from the average value last year to the average values this year by class.

520
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,890
And how much would it be if it was the $12.10?

521
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:46,992
It wouldn't be $130.

522
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:48,812
How much would it be?

523
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:52,534
Yeah, well, see, you can't analyze it because not everybody would get the same.

524
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,695
Some would get it with the residential exemption.

525
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:55,195
Some wouldn't.

526
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,315
They'd be paying the same rate.

527
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:57,316
No, no, no.

528
00:43:58,036 --> 00:43:59,036
The average house you said is 340.

529
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:03,094
The average single family is 424.

530
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:07,615
So what's 424 at 1119 and 424 at 1210?

531
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:21,399
But you're not taking out, refer to the spreadsheet that Larry gave you tonight, which I gave to the clerk on Thursday for the handout, and your various percentages, 10, 15, and 20%, you'll see it going across on the matrix.

532
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,780
Do the 10%.

533
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:31,131
If you're not taking the residential valuation decrease down with it, you're just talking straight tax rate will be higher.

534
00:44:32,051 --> 00:44:33,372
So then these numbers are incorrect.

535
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:37,034
They are correct.

536
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:43,198
That's page nine is as historic residential factor shifting the 175%.

537
00:44:43,618 --> 00:44:46,980
That's the sheet we get every year that we look at.

538
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,144
If you could refer to page 12, the residential exemption packet, probably five pages in,

539
00:44:55,306 --> 00:45:02,831
you'll start to see the analysis and the different rates at 10%, at 15%, at 20%.

540
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:07,213
You have to take off the residential value reduction.

541
00:45:07,494 --> 00:45:12,417
So at 10%, the residential valuation reduction would be $43,464.

542
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:17,580
You have to take that off your value, then multiply it by the new tax rate.

543
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,583
If you follow it across from left to right in the matrix at each percentage, you'll see that.

544
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:31,288
Do we have anything on the books right now that designates a condominium in the city of Medford from a two family house being converted over?

545
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,074
Um, we get master deeds and unit deeds from the registry, but we have no law on the books.

546
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:41,317
It talks about a two or three family house into a condominium.

547
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:47,782
Uh, like a moratorium to, no, we have any kind of law that addresses this in the city.

548
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:50,745
Well, I think that would be just no state law.

549
00:45:51,104 --> 00:45:53,805
So you would know nothing unless you get something from the registry of deeds?

550
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,986
Chapter 183, I believe, is the condominium law.

551
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,306
So you would get nothing from the registry?

552
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:04,828
Unless you got it from the registry of deeds, people could be living in two houses, condo in and out, and the city would not know.

553
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,670
Well, they can't record them at the registry.

554
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,211
They can't create the legal entity unless it's recorded.

555
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,631
So where are they going to record it?

556
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:13,871
At the registry.

557
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,112
You can't sell it unless you have a unit deed.

558
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:18,653
You can't sell it.

559
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:33,645
They also have to be subdivided within a condo association which has to be recorded prior to doing anything in the building department because there's so many standards as far as

560
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:37,048
water meters and everything else, common areas.

561
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:40,471
But the city has nothing on the books right now that addresses legally.

562
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:42,793
Councillor Knight had a paper around a month ago to address this.

563
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,974
We're going back for years.

564
00:46:43,994 --> 00:46:44,775
This has been going on.

565
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:56,064
We still have nothing officially on the books that talks about two, three and four family houses being converted to condominiums, other than if they're bought and sold and you get the information from the register.

566
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:03,023
I think by right, the property owner, once they purchase a two-family, can convert to condos.

567
00:47:03,063 --> 00:47:04,603
Or the current owner could do it as well.

568
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:10,764
But we're governed by state law, condominium law, I think chapter 183, I believe.

569
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,305
Mr. Sessor, if you could just speak into the microphone.

570
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:17,646
Ian Baker, the finance director.

571
00:47:18,066 --> 00:47:22,367
I think what you're trying to say is, I hope, maybe I'm trying to help.

572
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:24,027
If they convert something to condos,

573
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:30,234
They cannot sell it as condos unless they record the master deed at the registry of deeds.

574
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:35,516
So it does no good to record it as two separated as condos if you can't sell it as a condo.

575
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:43,579
So for example, if I owned a house, two family house, and I wanted to sell the second floor, first time selling.

576
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:53,143
But I work out a deal with the tenant, I mean the person upstairs, so it won't be recorded as a condo and be assessed at a higher rate than if it was a regular two family house.

577
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:56,463
then you're still renting.

578
00:47:56,723 --> 00:47:58,444
Whatever your side deal is, you're still renting.

579
00:47:58,524 --> 00:48:01,825
So the city's only assessing that piece of property as a rental piece of property.

580
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:02,966
Because it still is a rental property.

581
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,487
Unless it's recorded at the registry of deeds, it still is a rental property.

582
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,288
I mean, you may make a deal with a guy, but you're still paying rent.

583
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:12,349
He gets no benefits of the tax write-off for paying taxes or anything, because he's still only paying rent.

584
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:12,870
Right.

585
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,772
Mortgage companies are not going to give you a mortgage either, unless it's a deeded property.

586
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,614
Are you all satisfied, Councilor Penter, at this point?

587
00:48:22,914 --> 00:48:23,234
Thank you.

588
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,754
Thank you, Councilor.

589
00:48:24,774 --> 00:48:26,975
The chair recognizes the speaker at the podium.

590
00:48:27,395 --> 00:48:29,016
Please state your name and address for the record.

591
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:30,396
Thank you, Mr. President.

592
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:31,797
My name is John Sterrella.

593
00:48:31,817 --> 00:48:33,858
I reside at 20 Medcoff Street.

594
00:48:34,718 --> 00:48:44,101
I want to bring up the proposal recently presented by the vice president, and her proposal is that a million dollars be cut from the tax levy.

595
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:46,442
That has no legal standing.

596
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,103
The time to do that was during the budget.

597
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:50,708
discussions in June.

598
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,369
At that time, she could have reduced the budget by a million dollars.

599
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,889
It would have been effective.

600
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,309
Cannot do it now.

601
00:48:57,689 --> 00:48:58,890
You need the mayor's approval.

602
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,070
It's too late.

603
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,631
Through the chair, Madam Vice President.

604
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,932
The chair recognizes the vice president.

605
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:14,812
The chair recognizes the vice president.

606
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:19,332
Go right ahead.

607
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:25,636
We can vote to request the mayor reduce the tax levy by a million dollars.

608
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:26,837
We can send that message.

609
00:49:27,557 --> 00:49:28,138
Absolutely.

610
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:38,084
We, we tried to do it last year and I, as one counselor didn't vote for the budget this past June, so I would never have had the votes to decrease the budget by a million dollars at that point.

611
00:49:39,465 --> 00:49:47,270
You will get an opportunity to do that from now to as far as the, I can see in the future when we discuss, uh, the, uh,

612
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:50,810
the rate.

613
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:56,936
When we discuss the rate, you can bring that up, and we can talk about a single rate versus a dual rate.

614
00:49:58,016 --> 00:49:59,778
That's another discussion for another day.

615
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:10,787
In the last 10 years, every time I bring up this type of matter during budget deliberations, they tell me to do it in December, and then when you bring it up in December, they tell you to do it in June.

616
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:16,212
So this is finally, as of last year, the best way I could figure out to relieve the burden for the taxpayer.

617
00:50:17,196 --> 00:50:18,556
We almost had the votes last year.

618
00:50:19,237 --> 00:50:20,757
So I'd like to try to move that again.

619
00:50:25,998 --> 00:50:27,698
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

620
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:30,519
Move the question and the floor passes.

621
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:35,800
So on the motion, move the question.

622
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,381
Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

623
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,021
Hello, my name is Michael Ruggiero.

624
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:42,481
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

625
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:45,102
I want to address a couple of concerns I have really quick.

626
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:56,654
While I appreciate that the rate has decreased, this is still ending up, because property values have increased, this is ending up as a net increase in taxes for the average citizen in Medford.

627
00:50:56,674 --> 00:50:57,755
I think we all agree there.

628
00:50:58,195 --> 00:51:00,177
I just want to make that point perfectly clear.

629
00:51:00,878 --> 00:51:02,780
So here's my concern.

630
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,242
We're not talking about income here.

631
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:10,547
It's not like the average house owner or widow, as we mentioned before, just now made, oh,

632
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:15,445
Now they have $30,000, $40,000 extra in their pocket that they get to spend.

633
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:16,485
This is not income.

634
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:17,746
This is property.

635
00:51:18,546 --> 00:51:25,570
So I would suggest strongly that we do not increase actual tax level on the citizens of Medford.

636
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:32,373
Just because the property value goes up and the rate goes down, it's one of those six dozen of one, half of the other.

637
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,913
This is still a tax increase on a number of people in Medford that are struggling.

638
00:51:37,574 --> 00:51:41,056
So let's consider this vote very carefully as you make it tonight.

639
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:41,877
Thank you.

640
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:42,938
Thank you.

641
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:44,219
Sir.

642
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,381
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

643
00:51:48,182 --> 00:51:56,628
I'm not sure which question you're moving, so I had a few notations and I didn't want to interrupt prior, so I'd like to just blurt them out if I may.

644
00:51:56,648 --> 00:51:58,370
Yeah.

645
00:52:01,895 --> 00:52:08,542
The Mass General Law 56-5C is flawed on a Massachusetts state level.

646
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:14,107
But don't forget, at least the state did something right to try to help the middle class.

647
00:52:14,988 --> 00:52:16,589
Let's not lose that perspective.

648
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,393
So why are we not adopting it?

649
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:22,916
Boston's at 37.5%.

650
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:27,813
My information here is inaccurate at 30%.

651
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,494
Some of those inaccurate in my packet.

652
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:32,414
It's not 30, it's 35%.

653
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:36,495
I'm just shooting for the 20 maximum by law.

654
00:52:36,775 --> 00:52:52,098
Not only does this city, this body, city council have to approve it by a majority vote, also the mayor, whatever mayor has to also approve it or else the state won't automatically give it to you.

655
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:09,123
So that's why my amendment, or my whatever you want to call it, petition, never petitioned in my life, asked for both to adopt it, or else it just gets filed in the basket.

656
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:21,025
Meanwhile, I would like to fix the state law, however,

657
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:26,558
That will be my final mission as far as city hall business.

658
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:29,680
After the second mission, which I'm not divulging right now.

659
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,542
And the first mission, this is at hand right now.

660
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:37,645
Let's get this one done today for the middle class while they still exist.

661
00:53:40,867 --> 00:53:42,908
By the way, the law is flawed.

662
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:47,871
And I believe somebody applied for a home rule petitioner from what I understand.

663
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:49,152
I never saw the document.

664
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:49,872
I asked for it.

665
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:50,893
I don't know.

666
00:53:52,677 --> 00:53:58,160
And there should be a flat, I believe, if you can make the mathematics work, according to the formulas.

667
00:53:59,181 --> 00:54:08,227
Maybe a flat, whatever it is, 10% off your real tax dollars, period, for every single owner occupied, if you live in one house.

668
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:18,593
And to clarify something from Mr. Marks, if you live in one family, two, three, four, condo, or a hundred unit building, you will get

669
00:54:19,717 --> 00:54:22,119
under this master law, blah, blah, blah, blah.

670
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:35,648
The owner occupied exclusion providing the city council majority at the opposite and the mirror or mirrors at least one at the right time.

671
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:45,956
So having said all that, the more the law is flawed, but as we speak, like 12,000,

672
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:49,685
The number is staggering.

673
00:54:50,225 --> 00:54:50,906
Who gets this?

674
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:54,126
Let's not lose fact of that.

675
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:54,947
12,000 is it?

676
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:54,947
11,000?

677
00:54:56,987 --> 00:55:00,288
Let's see.

678
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,169
16,000 plus owner occupied.

679
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,650
That includes real estate, land also.

680
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:15,812
So let's deal with the projected Ed O'Neill number that he believes estimate of 12,000 and change are owner occupied.

681
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:23,352
Yeah, 1,569 will go up because the law is flawed, granted.

682
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:33,758
But don't forget, you're talking about 10,695 that will see a decrease versus the usual 100-year standard increases per annum.

683
00:55:33,778 --> 00:55:36,660
It's huge.

684
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:41,704
So back to Councilor Marks.

685
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:45,926
So you get the way the formula works, the way I understand

686
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:50,700
high school education, 68, 11 went to forestry.

687
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:58,263
The thing is, it's 20% of a shift, I believe Ed told me, and what I read in the law.

688
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:08,609
So the shift of, let's say, about $96 million it was last year, went up like 3.5%, so much for Prop 2.5, that's a fallacy.

689
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:17,113
And this year it's going over $100 million, that's over 4.5% increase right now that they're talking, mind you.

690
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:19,468
But the point is, it's a shift.

691
00:56:19,548 --> 00:56:24,710
And they're divided into, I guess, the 12,000 possible owner-occupieds.

692
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:30,111
And that comes out to a grand total, at the full 20% I'm asking for, of about $87,000.

693
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:35,353
Is that correct, Mr. Ed?

694
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:36,053
It is.

695
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:36,053
$87,000.

696
00:56:36,113 --> 00:56:37,433
Thank you.

697
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:40,374
Thanks, John.

698
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:42,615
$87,000 value reduction from your appraised value.

699
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:47,076
So therefore, if you have a Marauder 100-unit building and you do live there,

700
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:57,507
you can only deduct the 87,000 council marks, not the 99 units that you don't live in.

701
00:56:58,488 --> 00:57:00,529
It's only pertaining to your unit, I believe.

702
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:16,376
Furthermore, so therefore eight out of nine, or maybe 11 out of 12, the numbers are kind of blurred.

703
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:21,501
But it's like 90% of owner-occupies are going to save versus the usual increase.

704
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:28,665
Last year, I think I put a dollar coin here, and I put nine coins here.

705
00:57:29,586 --> 00:57:31,167
After five, I get tired of counting.

706
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:32,387
I just drop the whole package.

707
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:33,948
10 to 1 save.

708
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,851
I don't know how to say it diplomatically.

709
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:44,274
Clarify to Mr. Marks, $87,000.

710
00:57:47,445 --> 00:57:50,086
And by the way, new growth, what is this?

711
00:57:51,127 --> 00:57:53,088
What's the word, panacea, panacea?

712
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:56,029
The new growth, or is it a fallacy?

713
00:57:56,069 --> 00:58:00,211
It's supposed to help our parents pay their real estate taxes.

714
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:01,612
Now the parents are gone.

715
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:03,092
We become the elders, as they say.

716
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,514
So what happened to all this new growth that's supposed to help?

717
00:58:06,614 --> 00:58:14,298
Station Lenin, for one example, Lemire and Nishmir, and then you have

718
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:17,638
to River Edge or something to that effect.

719
00:58:17,678 --> 00:58:22,079
We destroyed a bunch of buildings, lost a lot of commercial tax revenue when that was done.

720
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:26,520
And then we had an economic crash, no fault of my own or your own probably.

721
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,421
And we didn't recoup at all.

722
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,381
Now, I hope we have.

723
00:58:30,861 --> 00:58:36,222
But the new growth is not helping the average taxpayer for real estate.

724
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:37,382
I don't see it.

725
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:40,343
Maybe I should have went to college more than high school.

726
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:41,903
I don't see it.

727
00:58:42,524 --> 00:58:44,764
And then I'm told, well, that has to get done.

728
00:58:45,197 --> 00:58:48,158
in June, July, whenever the budget is presented.

729
00:58:48,978 --> 00:58:50,539
Well, then what came first?

730
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:53,100
I don't mind the chicken and egg, the cat or the horse.

731
00:58:53,620 --> 00:59:01,463
Isn't that the time to have this new growth, take some of the edge off the middle class so they can still exist, maybe.

732
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:11,447
So therefore, I keep on ranting about requesting my full 20%.

733
00:59:14,756 --> 00:59:26,778
Because also, according to Ed O'Neill in his documents, I should say, the cutoff, I call it the push, is $580,000 at 10%, 15%, or 20%.

734
00:59:27,098 --> 00:59:34,119
So it's not going to go any higher that you pay more, so why not go for the full 20?

735
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,501
I won't even get into going for special legislation or exemption to go for the Somerville telephone numbers in Boston even higher.

736
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:49,553
If you can't do the 20, meet me halfway and give us the 10 cents on the total.

737
00:59:51,013 --> 00:59:57,815
By the way, the circuit breaker he mentioned, Mr. O'Neill, that's on a state level, real estate income tax, I should say.

738
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:14,278
I think the formula, what they used to do for my mom when she was alive, I believe it's like you take 10% of your adjusted gross income and you take half your water bill, I believe, and your real estate, total it up,

739
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:24,317
And every dollar above whatever the formula is, you get back dollar for dollar, up to a max at that time was $900, and today it's over $1,000 easily.

740
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:29,978
And you don't have to pay any Massachusetts income tax to get it.

741
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,859
A lot of accountants I speak to, even CPAs, don't know what I'm talking about.

742
01:00:34,879 --> 01:00:38,200
But it's a fact that it exists, and a lot of people might get it.

743
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,160
Thank you.

744
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:39,500
Good night.

745
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,360
Thanks, Ian.

746
01:00:43,126 --> 01:00:49,991
And Mr. Cappucci, before you speak, I just want to clean up two matters of procedure.

747
01:00:51,612 --> 01:01:04,602
The petition that Mr. Castanetti presented this evening by a motion of Council Penta was received and placed into the opposition portion of the public hearing.

748
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:12,848
And so that matter is disposed of and Mr. Castanetti had ample opportunity to present his views in addition to that.

749
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:26,363
We also took, for the purpose of discussion, the resolve of Vice President Longo Kern, 15795, regarding reduction of $1 million.

750
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:41,514
So before we hear from the citizen and then proceed to vote, if that's what we're going to do, I think we'll take the Vice President's paper as the separate motion that it actually is.

751
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:53,387
even though that it was discussed previously, and then we'll bring it under suspension and subsequently take it up to vote in that process.

752
01:01:53,768 --> 01:02:00,033
Does that bring clarity to this, Madam Vice President, or am I speaking in riddles?

753
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:00,273
Ms.

754
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:00,573
DeParley.

755
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:02,555
If you let me digest that and let the citizen speak.

756
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:03,055
Mr. Kessler.

757
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:03,516
Very good.

758
01:02:04,256 --> 01:02:05,638
Mr. Citizen, you're welcome to speak.

759
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:07,539
Please state your name and address for the record.

760
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:08,340
Mr. Capucci.

761
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,821
Thank you, President de la Ruzo.

762
01:02:09,881 --> 01:02:10,862
I'm Robert Capucci.

763
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:13,270
71 Evans Street.

764
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:38,183
Another matter in this property tax that hasn't been discussed, coming up in July, the property owners in this city are going to have to start paying the surcharge on the property tax through the voter approved, even though 2,453 blank ballots were cast on the Community Preservation Act.

765
01:02:38,323 --> 01:02:39,064
That's number one.

766
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:50,362
We've seen a property tax increase, and what was discussed earlier was the impact on rents, such as myself.

767
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:50,942
I'm a renter.

768
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:52,642
I've probably seen my rent rates go up.

769
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:56,143
But there are other impacts on this.

770
01:02:57,304 --> 01:03:04,086
Any time the city or the state or the government taxes people, that's money actually being taken out of the economy.

771
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:10,188
And as Councillor, through the Chair, as Councillor Brianna Lungo-Kern

772
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:20,022
specified through the emails that she and you all are receiving, we're not getting the services for the tax dollars that we're paying.

773
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:25,345
An understaffed police force, I mean streets and roads that are going neglected.

774
01:03:26,225 --> 01:03:33,129
The park, I live near Morrison Park, hasn't had any work done on it in three, four, maybe five years now.

775
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:39,312
There hasn't even been an American flag waving in Morrison Park for at least four years now.

776
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:45,173
These impacts on the city are more than just the rents.

777
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:51,375
It's people leaving these small businesses that are going to see property tax increases as well.

778
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,136
This is money taken out of their pockets.

779
01:03:55,536 --> 01:04:08,859
This is a young child's dance lessons that they might not get, a young child's baseball team that he might not get to play on, a family, two or three, that might have been planning on going to Disney World that they won't be going to now.

780
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:22,705
I rise in strong favour of Councillor Wong-Tam's resolution to do any tax reduction that you can because when you do that, you're actually putting money back into the economy.

781
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:37,472
You're helping these small businesses that are disappearing by the score from the corner of Salem Street and the Felsway beyond West Medford Square and all points beyond in all five of our business districts.

782
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:46,301
It's a shame to see this property tax go up again for the 29th consecutive year, is it?

783
01:04:46,501 --> 01:05:01,631
And now the added CPA surcharge that's coming, barreling down, added to the water tax that I believe is going up by another 7 to 10% from the last committee of the whole meeting last week or the week before, plus the excise taxes, sales taxes, all these other taxes.

784
01:05:02,052 --> 01:05:06,835
And this is why Massachusetts is known throughout the nation as tax-a-chooses.

785
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:09,019
It's literally outrageous.

786
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:10,400
It really is.

787
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:16,383
And I'm trying to articulate the rage that people that are watching that are feeling.

788
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:19,124
And I hope they know that there are people that understand.

789
01:05:19,464 --> 01:05:24,587
Maybe it will take a state rep or a state senator candidate or the next one.

790
01:05:24,993 --> 01:05:33,180
to start proposing legislation at the state level to reduce surcharges on property taxes, which are in the end run around Prop 2.5.

791
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:41,647
You know, the Moody's report that was just discussed in the committee of the whole meeting prior to this meeting,

792
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:49,075
stated that, you know, they look at the surpluses here in Medford as great city management.

793
01:05:49,415 --> 01:05:51,757
Did Moody's ever walk through this building and look at that?

794
01:05:52,758 --> 01:05:59,843
I mean, seriously, if all they're going to do is look at the money, well then, yeah, the taxes keep going up every year in Medford.

795
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,725
We have almost $20 million in surplus.

796
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:05,667
If that's all they're going to look at, yeah, then that's great city management.

797
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:07,929
But if they actually physically walk through this

798
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:19,758
town, the city of Oz that I grew up in now for 45 years and saw the condition of the police station, the understaffed, the fire departments, the stations that can't even email each other.

799
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:26,023
Seriously, do whatever you can to reduce at least one tax in this city.

800
01:06:26,123 --> 01:06:27,044
Thank you, Mr. President.

801
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:28,405
Thank you.

802
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:29,646
Good evening.

803
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:31,527
Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

804
01:06:32,248 --> 01:06:35,490
Joe Villalon, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

805
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:36,771
Thank you, Mr. Cappucci.

806
01:06:36,891 --> 01:06:37,652
You read my mind.

807
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:41,477
I was thinking the very same thing about the ceiling.

808
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:43,818
I have it written right here, and you stated it.

809
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:45,719
Just went over to the men's room.

810
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:51,102
It is in deplorable condition to have, what, $10 million in free cash?

811
01:06:51,602 --> 01:07:06,250
And how can you have the mayor's final speech pack this auditorium and have people walk into that men's room to see caution tape and see this big black rubber thing in a toilet

812
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:08,968
And then a caution tape across the hall.

813
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:16,993
How do we, as citizens of Medford, feel good about this administration when hundreds of people come in here and see that?

814
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:24,198
Now, there are 11 citizens here that I counted tonight, outside of the newspaperman and the government officials here.

815
01:07:25,158 --> 01:07:25,499
11 people.

816
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:28,500
We get reverse 911 calls on festivities.

817
01:07:29,181 --> 01:07:33,964
Was there a reverse 911 call on this very important topic and this vote?

818
01:07:35,617 --> 01:07:40,179
There are citizens out there that don't understand the process, a majority of the citizens.

819
01:07:40,219 --> 01:07:47,682
Thus, the 11 people you see here, they're the faces that you've seen here month after month after month.

820
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:55,285
There's no discussion of this important topic on AXS TV because we pay for AXS TV that we don't get.

821
01:07:55,645 --> 01:08:04,649
Well, that is a reflection of these taxes going up and city services, broken roads, reflecting that the city services are absent.

822
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:11,038
This council better vote its conscience, and not the way a certain person in the Conner office wants it to vote.

823
01:08:11,538 --> 01:08:13,539
This city council better vote its conscience.

824
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:26,686
On the motion to sever the four questions, Chair awaits an interpretation from the Vice President.

825
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:30,709
I would request that my motion be voted on first.

826
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:33,630
So if I have to table the public hearing, then so.

827
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:41,050
could be taken as an amendment to the public hearing so that it could be voted on first?

828
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:42,930
We can do it as an amendment.

829
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:44,691
Yes.

830
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:49,252
Either way.

831
01:08:49,552 --> 01:08:51,732
OK.

832
01:08:52,192 --> 01:08:55,053
Chair, we have a couple of people in queue.

833
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:55,953
Counselor Penta.

834
01:08:56,593 --> 01:08:57,733
Mr. O'Neill, question?

835
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:04,515
With the change in the tax rate to $11.19 from last year to this year,

836
01:09:06,255 --> 01:09:11,236
What's the net dollar amount increase that the city will be gaining with this new tax rate?

837
01:09:15,497 --> 01:09:15,897
Councilor?

838
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:17,578
Oh, I'm sorry.

839
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:18,658
Mr. Redd.

840
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,999
Thank you, Mr. President.

841
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,220
Uh, Councilor Penta referred to page two of the handout on the levy limit.

842
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,441
So, uh, yes, uh, as,

843
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:33,196
to the 2.5% is $2,412,608 added to last year's levy limit.

844
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:38,098
The new growth is $1,937,392, so it's just a $4.3 million increase from last year.

845
01:09:38,118 --> 01:09:38,738
The levy itself.

846
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:39,278
You said page 2.

847
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:40,279
I don't have that on page 2.

848
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,220
Of the handout from the committee of the whole meeting.

849
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:44,740
I didn't say that.

850
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:06,904
Do you have that?

851
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,711
It's this handout here from last Tuesday.

852
01:10:17,912 --> 01:10:19,133
You just said you can read the whole thing.

853
01:10:19,213 --> 01:10:19,673
All right.

854
01:10:19,813 --> 01:10:20,434
I am on page 2.

855
01:10:20,494 --> 01:10:22,475
The Medford Mustangs handout.

856
01:10:23,696 --> 01:10:25,297
And on page 2, I don't have what you have.

857
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:27,799
That's page 3.

858
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:28,699
Is this 2?

859
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:31,621
Ed.

860
01:10:32,122 --> 01:10:32,842
What does it look like?

861
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:33,983
Are you sure it's 2?

862
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:37,101
Yeah.

863
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:40,323
It's a circle too, yeah.

864
01:10:40,463 --> 01:10:41,903
So let me limit calculation.

865
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:43,844
What was he talking about?

866
01:10:45,485 --> 01:10:46,305
Brianna, do you have it?

867
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,025
Where's the 4 million?

868
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:47,505
Yes.

869
01:10:49,426 --> 01:10:50,547
Are you missing 4 million?

870
01:10:53,568 --> 01:10:54,148
Yeah, he doesn't.

871
01:10:59,130 --> 01:10:59,250
No.

872
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:07,071
Hi, you can't come in behind the, sir.

873
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:08,071
Where's the number?

874
01:11:08,191 --> 01:11:08,591
$4 million.

875
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:14,253
You can barely see him.

876
01:11:14,273 --> 01:11:15,233
That's why.

877
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:18,594
You can't really see him on his sheet.

878
01:11:18,614 --> 01:11:19,274
96,504 to increase to $100,018,000.

879
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,661
$100,854,000 would be the new levy limit.

880
01:11:37,402 --> 01:11:40,423
But what's the actual difference in from last year?

881
01:11:40,503 --> 01:11:42,424
Are we raising $2 million, $3 million, $4 million?

882
01:11:42,444 --> 01:11:42,944
$4,350,000 in the levy.

883
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:42,944
$4,350,000.

884
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:46,886
It's in the middle of the page on the levy limit calculation page two with a circle on it.

885
01:11:46,926 --> 01:11:47,867
There's no $4,350,000 on this page two.

886
01:12:02,453 --> 01:12:10,898
It's $2.4 million for the 2.5%, and then the new growth is $1.9 million, equals $4.3 million.

887
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:17,823
That's the allowable increase every year based on the levy limit.

888
01:12:17,863 --> 01:12:22,346
So you're saying from last year to this year, with the tax rate that you have set, it's going to be $4,350,000?

889
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:22,566
Correct.

890
01:12:22,586 --> 01:12:22,946
Correct.

891
01:12:23,086 --> 01:12:25,087
And will Councilor Langel-Kern has

892
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:32,974
alluding to that if we knock off a million dollars of that, that brings it down to $3,350,000, correct?

893
01:12:34,294 --> 01:12:34,494
Yes.

894
01:12:34,895 --> 01:12:44,039
And on an annual basis, it's historical for the last 6.7 years that we've had nothing less than a million dollars left over in free cash each and every year.

895
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:46,940
We're close to $7 million in free cash, Ann?

896
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,622
How much do we have in free cash right now?

897
01:12:53,609 --> 01:13:00,733
Oh 9.6 9.6 million in free cash, mr. Counselor so Why should we want to keep?

898
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:19,843
Beating up the method taxpayer if they knew that they have such large reason we're making the city rich Without doing anything about it and the taxpayers are paying for it Now when we talk about having a 10% exemption to get whatever the exemption might be 10 15 or 20 percent the fact of the matter is

899
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:30,362
If you're saying that $580,100 is the cutoff point and bringing it forward up to $1.2 million, it's an increase of $566.09.

900
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:34,966
I don't know how many people in this city own a house for $1.2 million.

901
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:35,747
That's number one.

902
01:13:36,447 --> 01:13:41,592
I know a lot of people own maybe between $580,000 to $700,000, and that may be nothing more from $1.98 to $111 more per year.

903
01:13:41,612 --> 01:13:43,254
But if we follow the mindset that why do we keep

904
01:13:49,225 --> 01:14:04,811
If we can reduce that limit by even another million dollars and knowing you're going to be getting the million dollars in in June, as we have historically for the last seven years, it makes sense at least to give the taxpayers some kind of a break, even if you were to try this thing out for a year to see where we're going.

905
01:14:06,312 --> 01:14:14,555
It makes no, you've had 29 years in a row of tax rate increases here in the city and you have the same problems now, if not larger now than you've had before.

906
01:14:15,215 --> 01:14:17,516
You have a police department that's understaffed by 10 people.

907
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:20,476
You have an office of community development that's one and a half people.

908
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:27,779
You have a city hall building that's in deplorable, disgusting shape when you walk out into the corridors and you go into the men's room and the ladies' room.

909
01:14:28,139 --> 01:14:32,521
You have a ceiling ready to come down on top of you that's running almost three years growing.

910
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:37,203
And we talk about the wonderful financial thing that Moody says we have a great bond rating.

911
01:14:37,803 --> 01:14:46,527
And to paraphrase Mr. Capucci and Mr. Viglione, the fact of the matter is, what are we having all this money for if we're not spending the taxpayers' money?

912
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:51,299
just so the city can look good, and a Moody's bond rating.

913
01:14:51,919 --> 01:14:57,301
I'd rather spend the money and have the city look better, knowing that the taxpayers' money is being used.

914
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:07,484
And if we can work out, if we can start to figure out now, whether it's this year or next year, that you develop a tax exemption, a residential exemption, that can work, then we should be doing this.

915
01:15:08,265 --> 01:15:12,426
We shouldn't be just saying, well, we're going to take what we've done in the past, go to 1.175%, and give it the lowest residential factor.

916
01:15:15,186 --> 01:15:21,152
If we were going to give it the lowest residential factor possible, then there should be no tax rate increase at all.

917
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:23,114
We've got all this money sitting in the bank.

918
01:15:24,555 --> 01:15:30,741
Why would you want to go out there and bang the taxpayer anywhere from $135 up for whatever?

919
01:15:32,022 --> 01:15:35,065
The problem, as I see it, Mr. O'Neill and Ms.

920
01:15:35,085 --> 01:15:36,126
Baker and Ms.

921
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:40,170
Miller, is there's been absolutely no discussion with this council

922
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:55,930
This legislative body, as it relates to prior to you folks setting a tax, having any discussion on how to change some of these things, having any discussion on when I'm going to Beacon Hill, bringing our state reps and senators in to say, what can we do to play with this thing?

923
01:15:56,931 --> 01:15:58,392
We haven't had at least strike.

924
01:15:58,452 --> 01:15:59,313
I'll speak for myself.

925
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:00,794
I have never been asked once.

926
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:09,081
I have called, but I have never been asked once to be part of a circle of discussion on any of these tax rate increases or proposals or whatever they might be.

927
01:16:09,642 --> 01:16:21,669
even to get into the merit of tax rate exemptions, even to get into the non-owner-occupier who comes into this community, and we have to give them the service of fire, police, public works, and sometimes even schooling.

928
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:23,611
For what?

929
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:26,192
So the Medford taxpayer winds up paying for it.

930
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:31,295
The guy who legitimately pays his taxes each and every year winds up paying for all of this.

931
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:37,659
And for 29 years in a row, the tax rate in this community has increased under the President's administration.

932
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:39,100
And what do we still have?

933
01:16:39,372 --> 01:16:41,815
We still have a deplorable infrastructure.

934
01:16:42,215 --> 01:16:43,977
We have water and sewer concerns.

935
01:16:44,277 --> 01:16:49,443
We have a public building here that needs, that's historically, you know, it needs a lot of help.

936
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:53,768
You have a police department and a fire department that needs all kinds of work.

937
01:16:54,303 --> 01:17:05,170
And then what do we have, as Councilor Longo just alluded to, you have a school department still creating more jobs as they did last night, $85,000 for a brand new position to have a public relations person.

938
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:09,453
That's what the superintendent gets $160,000 for, to do the public relations.

939
01:17:10,073 --> 01:17:13,776
And then you can't find enough teachers to teach a class because we don't have enough money in the budget.

940
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:18,939
And then we're starting to think about maybe security in the buildings because it's now becoming an ongoing problem.

941
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:40,787
But when teachers don't have enough pencils, and teachers don't have enough books, and they don't have enough classroom help, and PTOs are always asking for support from the administration, and this is the fifth, sixth job that they've created in the last year that's in excess of $85,000 to $90,000 a year, and we still cannot have that resolved to the point that it's political patronage.

942
01:17:40,807 --> 01:17:41,747
That's all that it is.

943
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:43,869
It's not educational patronage.

944
01:17:44,089 --> 01:17:46,071
It's political patronage, and it's wrong.

945
01:17:46,892 --> 01:17:51,074
And hopefully this new administration comes in and recognizes this, because it's wrong.

946
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:54,955
It serves no purpose for the value and the quality of this community.

947
01:17:55,515 --> 01:17:58,776
Those jobs don't add anything to Moody's bond rating.

948
01:17:58,816 --> 01:17:59,657
You know what they add to?

949
01:17:59,957 --> 01:18:02,218
They add to people saying you can't beat City Hall.

950
01:18:02,518 --> 01:18:05,359
They're all in bed with each other, and every politician is crooked.

951
01:18:05,999 --> 01:18:09,120
That's what they say, because you can't beat City Hall with nothing.

952
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,221
We're trying to, slowly but surely.

953
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:14,222
I thought it was going to take place, but it didn't.

954
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:29,307
But when we have a tax rate that's ready to go and set to go, and we know we're sitting on almost $9 million in free cash, $7.5 million in your water and sewer account, and there's still no plan in front of you, and you're still not part of the program, then there's something wrong around here.

955
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,387
Something's terribly wrong.

956
01:18:31,427 --> 01:18:39,589
And I hope the taxpayers wake up and finally realize that they've got to come to this real, and they have to talk about it.

957
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,298
The chair recognizes Councilor Carrofiello.

958
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:48,359
Thank you, Mr. President.

959
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:56,580
Mr. O'Neill, could you explain the ramifications of Councilor Longo's motion of putting the million dollars away, what that does?

960
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:02,621
I defer to Ian Baker and Louise Miller on this budgetary.

961
01:19:02,641 --> 01:19:12,343
I don't know exactly what, if the million dollars is taken off the tax, if the million dollars is taken off, obviously the

962
01:19:13,956 --> 01:19:15,957
tax rate would go down, and I believe you have those numbers.

963
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:18,839
At what percentage would it go down?

964
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:33,611
So if you took the medium, if you go by the average prices here, so on the average single family of $394, how much would the tax rate go down with the million dollars put in there?

965
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:39,235
Those numbers weren't prepared as far as what the effect of the $1 million would be.

966
01:19:40,313 --> 01:19:46,274
But the tax rate is set to cover the operating budget, which is a little over $150 million.

967
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:53,255
So the reduction of $1 million is a very small percentage of the total budget.

968
01:19:53,855 --> 01:20:07,738
The other thing is I did discuss today with the mayor the councilor's proposal, and he is not proposing coming back to the council with a request to use free cash to supplement the budget.

969
01:20:13,459 --> 01:20:22,022
Thank you.

970
01:20:22,102 --> 01:20:23,482
Madam Vice President.

971
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:23,923
Thank you.

972
01:20:24,043 --> 01:20:30,805
If you look at page nine, I mean, you're talking about a $2.4 million increase on property taxes.

973
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:34,946
So I'm proposing almost half, not quite.

974
01:20:35,487 --> 01:20:38,708
And if you look at the figures and a single family average value at 424,

975
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:51,236
is proposed to go up $130, increased from last year, a two-family, $329, three-family, $310, and each commercial industrial property, $312.

976
01:20:52,117 --> 01:21:00,322
So with regards to the single-family condos, two-families and three-families especially, you're going to see almost a 50% decrease with that $1 million.

977
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:03,364
Oh, commercial went down.

978
01:21:03,384 --> 01:21:04,065
Sorry, down $312.

979
01:21:08,528 --> 01:21:15,112
Yes, because the burden on the property owners is only going up 2.4, because you have 1.9 in new growth.

980
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:17,613
Almost 50%.

981
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:19,834
They wouldn't go down.

982
01:21:19,854 --> 01:21:23,096
The increase would be reduced from what is being proposed.

983
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:26,878
Our taxes are not going down with a million dollar decrease to the levy.

984
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,320
That can be verified.

985
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,721
Those are the numbers.

986
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:33,062
Well, this vote will have no bind.

987
01:21:37,863 --> 01:21:38,624
I hear what you said.

988
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:39,724
What did you say?

989
01:21:44,788 --> 01:21:45,168
Almost 50%.

990
01:21:45,869 --> 01:21:45,168
50%?

991
01:21:45,889 --> 01:21:49,691
Did you say 50?

992
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:59,558
No, I'm saying if the $1 million is taken out of the tax levy based on property value portion,

993
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:04,959
then the proposed increase would go down by almost 50%.

994
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:06,900
There's no reduction in taxes.

995
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,384
The only way we can reduce taxes is if we take $4 million out of the budget.

996
01:22:12,284 --> 01:22:14,026
Yeah, this is still going to be an increase.

997
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:29,197
We're increasing taxes, but the administration is proposing that we increase taxes by $2.4 million in total over what was proposed, what the tax levy was last year.

998
01:22:30,642 --> 01:22:38,367
moving to reduce that by a million, you'd almost reduce by 50, almost by 50%, probably by 40, I would say more like 40%.

999
01:22:38,508 --> 01:22:41,950
I mean, you're giving the taxpayer a break.

1000
01:22:42,751 --> 01:22:53,818
If I may speak, this, this million dollar motion that you're making is separate and apart from what we're trying to, what the, what were the reason we're here for is to set the minimum residential factor.

1001
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:59,102
So the minimum residential factor can be set apart from this motion.

1002
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,041
if they wanted to do that.

1003
01:23:02,121 --> 01:23:10,346
Councillor, you're all set?

1004
01:23:11,146 --> 01:23:12,347
Madam Vice President, you're all set?

1005
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:12,707
Thank you.

1006
01:23:13,247 --> 01:23:16,209
Then the question has been moved by Councillor Camuso.

1007
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:23,273
So what do you want to do with your paper, Madam Vice President?

1008
01:23:23,293 --> 01:23:26,455
I have one more question for the assessor, if you don't mind.

1009
01:23:27,356 --> 01:23:30,618
Mr. Assessor, if we wanted to vote to not increase the levy

1010
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:38,502
to not increase property taxes for our residents, period, how would we take that vote tonight?

1011
01:23:39,903 --> 01:23:41,204
On the minimum residential factor?

1012
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:42,845
Right, I mean, we'd have to.

1013
01:23:42,865 --> 01:23:45,867
She wants to reduce the levy.

1014
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:47,268
My motion is to reduce the levy.

1015
01:23:47,308 --> 01:23:56,114
If I didn't want to increase, but whether or not that passes, if I didn't want to increase the levy, period, how do I vote?

1016
01:24:05,302 --> 01:24:13,284
So you can still vote the minimum residential factor the same way you voted it in the past several years.

1017
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:15,085
You voted to shift it 175%.

1018
01:24:36,898 --> 01:24:39,180
And that would be what you're here to do tonight.

1019
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:45,804
Then the $1 million recommendation to the mayor would stand by itself.

1020
01:24:48,285 --> 01:24:49,886
And then the mayor would act on it.

1021
01:24:50,467 --> 01:24:51,708
How do you want to vote on that?

1022
01:24:51,728 --> 01:24:53,529
Do you want to vote that on a separate paper?

1023
01:24:54,129 --> 01:24:55,730
Please, if we can move my motion first.

1024
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:56,451
All right.

1025
01:24:56,511 --> 01:25:00,093
So on the motion of Vice President Luggo-Kern as a B paper.

1026
01:25:01,174 --> 01:25:02,675
Mr. President, if I may.

1027
01:25:02,715 --> 01:25:02,875
Yes.

1028
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:10,091
I just, I do want to say I did discuss this with... Order.

1029
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:24,223
I did discuss this with the mayor today and he is not planning on bringing a paper before council to request that free cash... Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

1030
01:25:25,525 --> 01:25:29,248
That certainly is the will of the mayor if he has the opportunity.

1031
01:25:29,328 --> 01:25:36,053
I think Councillor Langel-Kern is asking for a vote to ask him to bring the million dollars according to municipal finance.

1032
01:25:36,093 --> 01:25:39,635
That's the only way that a money paper can be initiated.

1033
01:25:39,695 --> 01:25:44,299
It's with the official mayor bringing it forward to the legislative body.

1034
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:46,060
So let's just take the vote on hers.

1035
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,783
Whatever, if it fails, if it passes, and we move forward on the rest of the questions.

1036
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:50,223
Okay.

1037
01:25:50,423 --> 01:25:51,644
The question has been called.

1038
01:25:52,284 --> 01:25:52,925
Roll call vote.

1039
01:25:53,274 --> 01:26:09,660
A roll call vote has been requested on the B paper by Vice President Longo-Curran that a resolution that the proposed tax levy be reduced by $1 million, which is less than half of the amount we put into free cash from last year's budget.

1040
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:11,841
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1041
01:26:17,203 --> 01:26:18,684
Please call the roll, Mr. Chief.

1042
01:26:19,004 --> 01:26:19,784
Councilor Camuso.

1043
01:26:19,984 --> 01:26:20,204
No.

1044
01:26:21,465 --> 01:26:22,225
Councilor Caviello.

1045
01:26:23,575 --> 01:26:26,097
Councilor Knight, Vice President Longo Kern.

1046
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:26,377
Yes.

1047
01:26:26,978 --> 01:26:27,598
Councilor Mox.

1048
01:26:27,818 --> 01:26:28,058
Yes.

1049
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:29,540
Councilor Penta.

1050
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:29,860
Yes.

1051
01:26:31,081 --> 01:26:31,901
President DelaRusso.

1052
01:26:33,182 --> 01:26:33,362
No.

1053
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:41,709
With the vote of three in the affirmative, three in the negative, the paper fails.

1054
01:26:41,809 --> 01:26:42,770
Move to four questions.

1055
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,723
On the motion of Councilor Camuso to move the four questions.

1056
01:26:47,423 --> 01:27:06,358
Number one, to determine the residential factor to be used for the fiscal year 2016 by selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy will be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

1057
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:17,815
This results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial and personal property taxpayers.

1058
01:27:18,476 --> 01:27:22,938
Historically, the Council has chosen the minimum residential factor

1059
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:31,320
If this is once again, the council choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.897446.

1060
01:27:33,761 --> 01:27:39,582
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the motion for approval by councilor Camuso on that question.

1061
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:40,403
Councilor Penta.

1062
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:45,924
Um, Ed, I don't think he answered the question.

1063
01:27:45,964 --> 01:27:47,224
The question is simply this.

1064
01:27:47,504 --> 01:27:53,126
If we would have just leave the rate the same as it was last year with no increase, what would it be?

1065
01:27:58,984 --> 01:28:03,225
Through you, Mr. President, the levy limit calculation has already been approved by DOR.

1066
01:28:03,905 --> 01:28:11,287
So it's an automatic two and a half percent, which correlated to the budget presentation in May and June.

1067
01:28:11,927 --> 01:28:20,369
The new growth was a moving estimate from early spring to summer to the fall, and that number increased.

1068
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:27,911
And with that additional growth, we were able to take care of that snow and ice deficit, which I believe Ann will speak on.

1069
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:34,589
Well, you can't leave the rate the same because everything is driven by the budget.

1070
01:28:35,329 --> 01:28:39,193
So we can't meet the budget with the rate being the same as it was.

1071
01:28:40,934 --> 01:28:43,677
All the calculations start with the budget.

1072
01:28:49,142 --> 01:28:50,082
To you, Mr. President,

1073
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:53,170
Well, the paper is before us, as it is.

1074
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:53,691
It is.

1075
01:28:53,771 --> 01:29:06,454
But during the budget season, I was not asked to do any analysis on keeping the rate the same, increasing it 2.5%, adding the new growth.

1076
01:29:07,434 --> 01:29:12,476
We used that in the budget process, which was distributed to the council for revenue projections.

1077
01:29:13,036 --> 01:29:16,417
But I was not asked by the council to do any impact at that point.

1078
01:29:16,997 --> 01:29:17,277
Thank you.

1079
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,521
On the motion.

1080
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:31,208
But the question could be answered, that if you were going to, since the assessed values have gone up from last year to this year, and to keep everything to be the, I mean.

1081
01:29:32,249 --> 01:29:33,290
It can't stay the same.

1082
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:34,410
It doesn't.

1083
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,192
It can't stay the same, the values have gone up.

1084
01:29:36,752 --> 01:29:41,995
So if the values have gone up and you kept it at last year's rate, wouldn't that still cover you for the budget?

1085
01:29:43,056 --> 01:29:44,517
No, because we routed 4.2 million.

1086
01:29:46,396 --> 01:29:48,817
There's nothing in the law that says you have to go to the max.

1087
01:29:49,057 --> 01:29:49,537
That's correct.

1088
01:29:49,577 --> 01:29:50,697
But you don't address it tonight.

1089
01:29:50,717 --> 01:29:52,858
You've addressed it at the budget session.

1090
01:29:54,098 --> 01:30:13,423
So all the council Longo was trying to propose was if you took, if you knocked off a million dollars, which is a million off of the $4 million and you're going to be getting that money back in June anyway, when free cash is certified, you'd have a better understanding of how this budget, you know, works better for the taxpayer.

1091
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:14,463
I'll defer it to Louise Miller.

1092
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:20,548
We actually don't know what the free cash that is certified will be until the end of the fiscal year.

1093
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:31,975
So, um, the fact that there were some good years of free cash in the past few years is great for the city, but there also were years when free cash was not so good.

1094
01:30:32,475 --> 01:30:40,820
And in this instance, um, when we set the budget, we assume that 2.5% increase in a certain new growth.

1095
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:43,162
And then last week when we met in the council of the whole,

1096
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:50,455
We also address the snow and ice deficit, which we are now able to move forward without a deficit in the city.

1097
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:53,217
But the council, I think we agree with that.

1098
01:30:53,377 --> 01:30:53,637
OK.

1099
01:30:54,698 --> 01:30:57,120
We have $9.6 million in free cash, correct?

1100
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:57,760
That is correct.

1101
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,442
We have $9.6 million in free cash.

1102
01:30:59,802 --> 01:31:12,291
And if you folks were, if the council were agreeable to knock the million dollars off, if in fact the worst thing that could happen, if you couldn't meet your debt obligation, when June, the end of May, June comes, you still have free cash.

1103
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,713
to balance out whatever needs to be done.

1104
01:31:15,113 --> 01:31:19,954
So all Councilor Longo Kern was trying to do, if I understand it correctly, was to knock off a million dollars right now.

1105
01:31:20,514 --> 01:31:31,316
And if it works, all things being equal, there would be the tax rate increase, would be by 40% less, instead of 130 on the house for 424, it would be $70 or $60.

1106
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:33,957
It isn't like you're wiping it out.

1107
01:31:34,317 --> 01:31:36,237
You're just keeping all things being equal.

1108
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:39,578
You know, a few years back, it was Councilor Marks to his credit.

1109
01:31:40,038 --> 01:31:41,238
The only one that didn't vote

1110
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:45,803
to take the money out of the Water and Sewer account because the mayor underfunded the budget by a million one.

1111
01:31:46,764 --> 01:31:52,067
And they took the money out of the Water and Sewer account and you had to go to the legislature for a special act of the legislature.

1112
01:31:52,327 --> 01:31:53,308
And no one else ever did it.

1113
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:57,731
No other city in town in there would ever do it again, because that was the wrong thing to do.

1114
01:31:58,692 --> 01:32:00,953
But we're sitting on nine and a half million dollars.

1115
01:32:01,614 --> 01:32:07,238
Why is the city so reluctant to try out something and see where it takes us?

1116
01:32:09,059 --> 01:32:10,180
No, no, no, we're talking about

1117
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:19,335
I know you're talking about it, but at the same time, I think it needs to be explained better to the point that, you know, we're not cash-strapped poor.

1118
01:32:19,795 --> 01:32:30,823
We're sitting on $9.5 million, and even if we get another six or seven or rate of $900,000 this year, that will offset whatever the million dollars you're taking off the increase in the override by a million dollars.

1119
01:32:31,544 --> 01:32:33,865
I mean, what is so hard to understand this for?

1120
01:32:33,885 --> 01:32:34,586
I don't understand.

1121
01:32:34,606 --> 01:32:37,608
No, no, I certainly understand what you're saying, that it is—

1122
01:32:38,145 --> 01:32:46,869
It really is the same thing as what occurred a few years ago with the water and sewer, where in order to meet the budget, money was taken out of reserves.

1123
01:32:47,149 --> 01:32:51,911
And that's essentially what we would be doing here if we were to take money out of free cash.

1124
01:32:51,931 --> 01:32:55,592
You'd be taking out of free cash, though, Louise, not the reserves of the water and sewer account.

1125
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:56,053
No, no, no.

1126
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,233
But free cash is the general fund reserve.

1127
01:32:58,253 --> 01:32:58,413
Right.

1128
01:32:58,433 --> 01:33:00,174
That's what that is.

1129
01:33:00,194 --> 01:33:02,775
So if you have $9.5 million and it keeps increasing each and every year.

1130
01:33:02,795 --> 01:33:04,916
Point of information, Mr. President.

1131
01:33:04,936 --> 01:33:06,477
Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

1132
01:33:07,856 --> 01:33:11,117
We're still talking about that million dollars that the council took a vote.

1133
01:33:11,637 --> 01:33:13,737
No, we're talking about the question that he didn't answer.

1134
01:33:14,217 --> 01:33:17,418
What would it be to keep the tax rate the same as it was last year?

1135
01:33:17,438 --> 01:33:18,858
It'd be 2.4 million.

1136
01:33:20,098 --> 01:33:21,818
Half of what Councilor Lungo proposed.

1137
01:33:21,858 --> 01:33:22,399
You double it.

1138
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:23,439
Well, a little bit more, 2.4.

1139
01:33:23,499 --> 01:33:27,419
This is all semantics.

1140
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:28,540
We just took a vote on this.

1141
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,080
Yes.

1142
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,240
We need to resolve this.

1143
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,541
The motion has been called.

1144
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:36,621
Can we let her speak, please?

1145
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:45,704
I was just going to say that regardless of the question of free cash or no free cash, the residential rate is unaffected by it.

1146
01:33:45,784 --> 01:33:47,966
The residential factor, I'm sorry, is unaffected by it.

1147
01:33:48,126 --> 01:33:49,066
It is a separate vote.

1148
01:33:50,107 --> 01:33:50,307
Right.

1149
01:33:51,027 --> 01:33:54,089
So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1150
01:33:54,809 --> 01:33:57,911
Mr. President, I have an answer for the council's question.

1151
01:33:58,471 --> 01:33:59,892
Please, briefly, sir.

1152
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:00,432
Thank you.

1153
01:34:01,973 --> 01:34:03,314
This is definitely the way to do it.

1154
01:34:03,814 --> 01:34:05,875
When it comes time to vote for the shift,

1155
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:07,904
That's what I'm talking about.

1156
01:34:08,265 --> 01:34:11,166
We talk about generally about a 75% shift.

1157
01:34:11,767 --> 01:34:21,332
When we do that, what we're doing is charging the CIPs, the commercial people, the people who provide the jobs in this community, the people who invest their own money.

1158
01:34:21,752 --> 01:34:25,934
We're asking them to pay 75% more than they would normally.

1159
01:34:26,514 --> 01:34:31,157
Now, you have to keep your eye on the ball, and the ball is

1160
01:34:32,843 --> 01:34:33,764
$101 million.

1161
01:34:34,444 --> 01:34:36,724
Now, what is this figure, $101 million?

1162
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:40,545
This is actually the tax levy limit.

1163
01:34:41,565 --> 01:34:44,366
In Medford, the tax levy limit is the tax levy.

1164
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:50,407
So now what Councilor Pinto wants to do is keep the rate the same.

1165
01:34:50,447 --> 01:34:52,828
You can do that by instead of shifting

1166
01:34:54,925 --> 01:35:00,448
But 175 last year, the rate was, was, uh, what?

1167
01:35:00,468 --> 01:35:00,448
1170.

1168
01:35:00,488 --> 01:35:13,054
Well, all you have to do is go over to this sheet here, go over and it tells you, then you have to just go to, and instead of a shift of 175, have a shift of 145.

1169
01:35:14,234 --> 01:35:15,155
That's all you have to do.

1170
01:35:15,235 --> 01:35:17,576
Counselor Penner and you can do what you want to do.

1171
01:35:18,096 --> 01:35:19,377
Now I'm not in favor of that.

1172
01:35:20,037 --> 01:35:21,078
I'm in favor of a,

1173
01:35:22,457 --> 01:35:24,159
of the same tax for all people.

1174
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:25,500
That's what is really fair.

1175
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:36,589
Because what we're doing is we're charging our own people who come here, in fact some of them are residents, so we're charging them 75% more than they should pay.

1176
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:40,513
What they should pay is you take all of the money

1177
01:35:41,526 --> 01:35:45,190
all the property in Meffitt, which is $8 billion worth.

1178
01:35:45,831 --> 01:35:46,171
Okay.

1179
01:35:46,211 --> 01:35:49,034
Now the commercials have only 1 billion of that.

1180
01:35:49,595 --> 01:35:51,217
And the residents have 7 billion.

1181
01:35:51,617 --> 01:35:57,524
You divide that 8 billion into the 101 and you get the standard rate.

1182
01:35:57,824 --> 01:35:59,326
And the standard rate is, uh,

1183
01:36:04,578 --> 01:36:07,020
$12.47.

1184
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:07,020
That's what everybody should be paying, $12.47.

1185
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:09,562
That's fair.

1186
01:36:09,982 --> 01:36:17,569
Not only that, that will reduce the rate of increase in taxes all the way into the future.

1187
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:21,212
Every year, we will pay $250,000 less in taxes.

1188
01:36:21,232 --> 01:36:27,076
For instance, a few years ago, our tax levy was

1189
01:36:28,803 --> 01:36:29,984
was $90 million.

1190
01:36:30,024 --> 01:36:34,087
Well, now, only three years later, it's $100 million.

1191
01:36:34,367 --> 01:36:43,913
So, you can see, answering Councilor Pender's question, the tax levy increases by $3 to $4 million every year, like clockwork.

1192
01:36:44,814 --> 01:36:49,637
And the only way to reduce that is to have one standard single rate, and that's the only fair thing to do.

1193
01:36:50,057 --> 01:36:54,300
If we did to the residents of this city what we're doing to the merchants, it would be a pity.

1194
01:36:54,941 --> 01:36:56,582
If you're paying, on an average, $5,000 in taxes,

1195
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:02,588
On your real estate, on the house that you own, you're a homeowner, right?

1196
01:37:03,229 --> 01:37:05,530
Imagine increasing that by 75 percent.

1197
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:10,372
Now, instead of $5,000, you're asking a homeowner to pay $8,500.

1198
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:13,713
Is that conscionable?

1199
01:37:14,153 --> 01:37:14,973
Would you do that?

1200
01:37:15,714 --> 01:37:19,935
Would you do that to your — your — the people who support you?

1201
01:37:20,396 --> 01:37:21,736
But you're doing that to the merchants.

1202
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:25,798
You love to do that to the merchants because you think it's coming from nowhere.

1203
01:37:26,058 --> 01:37:26,558
Well, it isn't.

1204
01:37:27,323 --> 01:37:29,825
That's why you see so many empty storefronts around here.

1205
01:37:30,305 --> 01:37:31,146
The merchants are having trouble.

1206
01:37:31,186 --> 01:37:35,169
That's why you see Arcadia being torn down over taxation.

1207
01:37:35,529 --> 01:37:41,794
You can get away from all of that just by going to the single rate, and the single rate is $12.47.

1208
01:37:42,414 --> 01:37:48,199
Yes, it'll be higher the first year, but every year thereafter, it'll be lower than it would have been.

1209
01:37:48,499 --> 01:37:49,439
Taxes will go up.

1210
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,722
They will always go up, but they won't go up as much.

1211
01:37:55,595 --> 01:37:56,035
Max?

1212
01:37:58,156 --> 01:37:58,456
Yes.

1213
01:37:58,636 --> 01:38:09,301
I appreciate Dr. Stirello's knowledge on this, but I believe it was Ed O'Neill back last year or the prior year that stated with the single tax rate, it would take roughly 25 to 30 years.

1214
01:38:09,981 --> 01:38:11,842
No, it would not.

1215
01:38:11,922 --> 01:38:16,604
You're saying the first year will go up, and the second year it'll start reducing.

1216
01:38:16,764 --> 01:38:17,385
By $250,000 every year.

1217
01:38:17,425 --> 01:38:17,845
Citywide.

1218
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:18,245
Citywide.

1219
01:38:18,285 --> 01:38:19,886
So my taxes, if I, let's get this straight now.

1220
01:38:25,123 --> 01:38:37,666
If we went to the single rate at 1267 that you're talking about, my taxes and every other single family home in this community and every other two-family home in this community is going to go up drastically over the next 20 years.

1221
01:38:38,106 --> 01:38:40,286
And at some point, it will level off.

1222
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:42,647
But it's not what you're saying, Dr. Stroh.

1223
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:43,527
It's not what you're saying.

1224
01:38:43,807 --> 01:38:45,808
And then it's year two, year three, year four.

1225
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:52,369
Now, you might get a small reduction year two, three, four, five, but it's still a dramatic increase.

1226
01:38:52,976 --> 01:38:55,599
over what you would have paid with this shift.

1227
01:38:56,099 --> 01:38:57,220
And I agree with you.

1228
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,802
At some point, we have to look at the commercial.

1229
01:38:59,342 --> 01:39:07,910
But if someone's running a commercial business in this community, no one's going to tell me that a residential person should pay the same tax rate.

1230
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:08,951
That's your opinion.

1231
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:10,833
I don't share that opinion.

1232
01:39:11,233 --> 01:39:14,056
If you're making money in this community, you should pay more.

1233
01:39:14,897 --> 01:39:15,858
That's the way I feel.

1234
01:39:16,779 --> 01:39:17,059
Thank you.

1235
01:39:17,415 --> 01:39:23,239
Pardon me for disagreeing, but what you don't realize is that every year we're adding on new growth.

1236
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:31,286
And the new growth of the commercials is much higher, sometimes two times higher, than the new growth of the residentials.

1237
01:39:31,766 --> 01:39:38,211
Now you're adding that to the tax levy limit, and what you're asking is for the residents to pay that.

1238
01:39:39,025 --> 01:39:40,166
twice as much rate.

1239
01:39:40,986 --> 01:39:42,367
And that goes on there.

1240
01:39:42,447 --> 01:39:46,050
And that's why taxes will keep going higher.

1241
01:39:47,971 --> 01:39:48,652
Thank you, doctor.

1242
01:39:48,872 --> 01:39:49,292
OK.

1243
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:50,233
You're welcome.

1244
01:39:50,573 --> 01:39:50,933
Thank you.

1245
01:39:51,654 --> 01:39:54,776
On the motion of Councilor Camuso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1246
01:39:55,336 --> 01:39:56,097
Councilor Camuso.

1247
01:39:56,137 --> 01:39:56,397
Yes.

1248
01:39:57,798 --> 01:39:58,598
Councilor Caviello.

1249
01:39:58,799 --> 01:39:59,019
Yes.

1250
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:00,920
Councilor Knight.

1251
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,561
Vice President Longo Kern.

1252
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:02,641
Yes.

1253
01:40:03,562 --> 01:40:04,202
Councilor Mox.

1254
01:40:04,523 --> 01:40:04,663
Yes.

1255
01:40:05,143 --> 01:40:05,823
Councilor Penta.

1256
01:40:05,883 --> 01:40:06,104
Yes.

1257
01:40:07,124 --> 01:40:07,865
President DelaRusso.

1258
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:14,500
Yes, with the vote of six in the affirmative and one absent.

1259
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,301
The motion carries.

1260
01:40:19,704 --> 01:40:20,204
Number two.

1261
01:40:20,725 --> 01:40:21,525
Motion to vote no.

1262
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:26,509
To adopt an open space discount.

1263
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:28,791
This does not apply to the city of Medford.

1264
01:40:29,131 --> 01:40:32,494
We're not eligible for that, but a no vote is required.

1265
01:40:33,575 --> 01:40:35,116
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1266
01:40:37,723 --> 01:40:38,504
Councilor Camuso?

1267
01:40:38,844 --> 01:40:39,064
No.

1268
01:40:39,965 --> 01:40:40,765
Councilor Caviello?

1269
01:40:40,805 --> 01:40:40,845
No.

1270
01:40:42,226 --> 01:40:42,847
Councilor Knight?

1271
01:40:43,467 --> 01:40:43,507
No.

1272
01:40:43,527 --> 01:40:44,328
Vice-President Leno-Kern?

1273
01:40:44,348 --> 01:40:44,448
No.

1274
01:40:45,509 --> 01:40:46,109
Councilor Mox?

1275
01:40:46,189 --> 01:40:46,489
No.

1276
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:47,830
Councilor Penta?

1277
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:48,091
No.

1278
01:40:48,891 --> 01:40:49,712
President Del Russo?

1279
01:40:50,132 --> 01:40:50,372
No.

1280
01:40:51,053 --> 01:40:58,038
With the vote of six in the negative and one absent, the adoption fails.

1281
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:02,941
Number three, adopt a residential exemption.

1282
01:41:03,642 --> 01:41:06,544
If adopted, owner-occupied residential properties

1283
01:41:06,951 --> 01:41:11,192
may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value.

1284
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:20,014
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

1285
01:41:20,534 --> 01:41:31,256
Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, the number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase in their tax rate, tax bills.

1286
01:41:33,076 --> 01:41:34,016
Question, Mr. President.

1287
01:41:35,937 --> 01:41:36,617
Councillor Penta.

1288
01:41:37,544 --> 01:41:40,566
On the line there where it says a substantial, who wrote this?

1289
01:41:41,066 --> 01:41:41,966
Is this state wording?

1290
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:47,789
Mr. O'Neill, who wrote number three, adopt a residential exemption?

1291
01:41:52,392 --> 01:41:53,432
On the letter to the council.

1292
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:59,536
And your letter to the council dated November 23rd, when you have the four things, it says adopt a residential exemption.

1293
01:42:00,956 --> 01:42:02,617
Who wrote the wording for these four things?

1294
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:04,158
Was that the original handout?

1295
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:05,780
for the committee as a whole.

1296
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:06,941
It's dated November 25th.

1297
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:08,001
Probably I did.

1298
01:42:08,221 --> 01:42:10,403
I did.

1299
01:42:10,503 --> 01:42:11,604
I did the one tonight.

1300
01:42:11,744 --> 01:42:11,904
Yeah.

1301
01:42:12,904 --> 01:42:13,385
It's a vote.

1302
01:42:13,485 --> 01:42:13,945
Yeah.

1303
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:17,147
It's the same language every year.

1304
01:42:17,247 --> 01:42:18,168
Just the numbers change.

1305
01:42:18,388 --> 01:42:20,409
So it's a vote not to adopt.

1306
01:42:20,429 --> 01:42:25,313
Well, I would make a suggestion that the word substantial is eliminated because it is not a substantial.

1307
01:42:25,893 --> 01:42:27,594
The $1,569 doesn't compare anywhere to $9,000, close to $10,000.

1308
01:42:27,714 --> 01:42:28,675
And it gives the impression that

1309
01:42:32,311 --> 01:42:36,833
a substantial number of people are going to be paying higher, because... Duly noted, Counselor.

1310
01:42:36,853 --> 01:42:37,073
Pardon me?

1311
01:42:37,333 --> 01:42:37,974
Duly noted.

1312
01:42:38,454 --> 01:42:38,594
Yeah.

1313
01:42:39,094 --> 01:42:47,418
Because according to what you gave us over this past weekend and tonight, you know, it's quite obvious that, you know, it's not substantial.

1314
01:42:48,339 --> 01:42:52,000
It's a progression from 580 or whatever that number in the future is going to be.

1315
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:52,100
Okay.

1316
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:52,380
All right.

1317
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:52,741
Will do.

1318
01:42:53,761 --> 01:42:54,101
Thank you.

1319
01:42:54,582 --> 01:42:57,723
On that motion... Excuse me.

1320
01:42:57,943 --> 01:42:59,064
Sir, you've debated this.

1321
01:42:59,704 --> 01:43:00,564
We're taking a vote.

1322
01:43:02,416 --> 01:43:05,138
Those two points brought up, and this is very important.

1323
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:07,359
Councilor DelaRusso, president.

1324
01:43:11,562 --> 01:43:11,902
Proceed.

1325
01:43:12,282 --> 01:43:12,662
Thank you.

1326
01:43:14,143 --> 01:43:15,024
Name's not important.

1327
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:17,325
Thank you.

1328
01:43:17,365 --> 01:43:24,250
Councilor Peta for bringing up who wrote up number three on the owner occupied selection.

1329
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:28,012
Um, through the chair, I'd like to ask Ed O'Neill,

1330
01:43:31,438 --> 01:43:39,181
How many properties will have a savings versus the $1,569 of the owner-occupies?

1331
01:43:39,941 --> 01:43:40,581
It would go up.

1332
01:43:41,101 --> 01:43:42,642
That was discussed earlier.

1333
01:43:42,922 --> 01:43:44,103
I would like a straight answer.

1334
01:43:44,143 --> 01:43:46,343
Mr. O'Neill, you're welcome to answer that if you'd like.

1335
01:43:46,563 --> 01:43:47,704
I would like a straight answer.

1336
01:43:48,004 --> 01:43:48,884
He never said it.

1337
01:43:50,685 --> 01:43:57,147
He never told me how many properties are going to go down in value versus the $1,569 owner-occupies that would go up.

1338
01:43:57,507 --> 01:43:59,148
Can I get a straight answer as a citizen?

1339
01:43:59,903 --> 01:44:01,324
For Matt O'Neill, please, through the chair.

1340
01:44:03,086 --> 01:44:06,268
It was answered several times, but Mr. O'Neill, you're welcome to answer that.

1341
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:07,569
Mr. O'Neill, would you answer the question, please?

1342
01:44:07,629 --> 01:44:10,612
Could you please vacate the podium so this gentleman can speak?

1343
01:44:10,632 --> 01:44:11,212
I would be happy to.

1344
01:44:11,272 --> 01:44:14,194
Thank you very much.

1345
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:21,400
Through you, Mr. President, the total amount of qualified owner-occupiers would be $12,264.

1346
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:21,500
So

1347
01:44:27,088 --> 01:44:30,091
we, we did address it, um, in a number of other ways.

1348
01:44:30,151 --> 01:44:44,102
But so if you took the 1569, uh, I think a counselor Penta may have said just over 10,000 that would, uh, experience a decrease in taxes.

1349
01:44:45,123 --> 01:44:45,524
Thank you.

1350
01:44:47,025 --> 01:44:48,646
Again, lower than the five 80.

1351
01:44:49,347 --> 01:44:49,707
Thank you.

1352
01:44:49,967 --> 01:44:52,049
Plus the apartment buildings would go up as well.

1353
01:44:52,690 --> 01:44:53,010
Thank you.

1354
01:44:56,666 --> 01:45:03,108
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the, please state your name and address for the record.

1355
01:45:03,308 --> 01:45:04,229
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1356
01:45:04,269 --> 01:45:05,589
I live at 281 Park street.

1357
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:07,630
It's a single family home.

1358
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:11,932
I live in with my husband and my seven year old daughter, my older daughters in college.

1359
01:45:12,952 --> 01:45:19,354
Um, I talked to the assessor and my home value is going to increase approximately 10% this year.

1360
01:45:19,834 --> 01:45:21,775
My home is not worth $500,000 but if it was worth 500 it would be now worth

1361
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:42,167
$550,000, which means that even if you gave me an exemption, my property taxes will increase $500 a year, plus the wonderful CPA, which means that my home will now cost me a minimum of $50 extra per month, even with the residential exemption.

1362
01:45:42,187 --> 01:45:49,190
I think it's important to note that, that you're not giving me a property tax reduction, even if you give me a residential exemption.

1363
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,911
I have no tenant that I can turn to and say,

1364
01:45:52,422 --> 01:45:57,163
Can you give me an extra $25 a month so that I can pay only $25 more?

1365
01:45:57,603 --> 01:46:02,924
Because I know a lot of the renters in this town think that we're all sitting on a money pile.

1366
01:46:03,404 --> 01:46:05,445
I owe the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1367
01:46:05,965 --> 01:46:07,545
My home is not going to give me any money.

1368
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:14,627
I won't be able to afford to do the new roof on my garage that I need because I'll be paying the city more.

1369
01:46:15,007 --> 01:46:17,327
So I think you need to factor that in.

1370
01:46:17,387 --> 01:46:20,328
People need to understand that homeowners aren't getting a reduction.

1371
01:46:20,688 --> 01:46:21,048
Thank you.

1372
01:46:21,993 --> 01:46:22,574
Thank you, ma'am.

1373
01:46:23,054 --> 01:46:24,255
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1374
01:46:27,078 --> 01:46:40,510
Councilor Camuso, Councilor Caviello, Councilor Knight, Vice President Lowell-Curran, Councilor Mox, Councilor Penta, President Del Russo.

1375
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:41,150
No.

1376
01:46:41,511 --> 01:46:44,493
With the vote of six in the negative, one absent.

1377
01:46:45,174 --> 01:46:46,135
Uh, the motion fails.

1378
01:46:49,385 --> 01:46:54,599
Number four, adopt a small commercial exemption if adopted, commercial properties

1379
01:46:55,735 --> 01:47:05,740
housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than $1 million may receive an exemption of up to 10 percent of their assessed value.

1380
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:16,105
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to the other commercial and or industrial properties.

1381
01:47:16,685 --> 01:47:23,328
Since this shift causes a high commercial and industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption

1382
01:47:23,748 --> 01:47:25,648
would see an increase in their tax bills.

1383
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:27,349
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1384
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,690
Councilor Camuso?

1385
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:32,730
Councilor Caviello?

1386
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:34,231
Councilor Knight?

1387
01:47:34,611 --> 01:47:35,551
Vice-President Levin-Curran?

1388
01:47:35,571 --> 01:47:38,672
Yes.

1389
01:47:38,692 --> 01:47:39,192
Councilor Mox?

1390
01:47:39,252 --> 01:47:39,292
No.

1391
01:47:40,712 --> 01:47:41,232
Councilor Penta?

1392
01:47:41,252 --> 01:47:41,352
No.

1393
01:47:42,793 --> 01:47:43,613
President Del Rosso?

1394
01:47:43,853 --> 01:47:44,113
No.

1395
01:47:45,313 --> 01:47:51,555
On the vote of five in the negative, one in the affirmative, one absent, the motion fails.

1396
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:55,010
Thank you all for your patience in this matter.

1397
01:48:04,192 --> 01:48:14,514
Mr. O'Neill, could you please approach the podium and entertain through the chair the inquiry of Counselor Penta?

1398
01:48:14,854 --> 01:48:21,235
On the small commercial exemption, you indicate here in the wording that you shift the portion from

1399
01:48:22,573 --> 01:48:23,974
one group to another.

1400
01:48:24,755 --> 01:48:35,483
And since this shift causes a higher commercial and industrial tax rate, all commercial and industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

1401
01:48:36,244 --> 01:48:44,310
When you use the purpose of somebody having 10 or more people and the value is less than a million dollars, they can receive the exemption.

1402
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:48,373
Is that state statute that says that?

1403
01:48:48,654 --> 01:48:49,534
That's correct, yes.

1404
01:48:51,121 --> 01:48:53,522
So how many of these properties exist in the city of Medford?

1405
01:49:00,183 --> 01:49:01,844
That's for you, Mr. President.

1406
01:49:01,904 --> 01:49:03,784
That is part of the annual handout.

1407
01:49:03,804 --> 01:49:06,865
We go over this annually.

1408
01:49:06,945 --> 01:49:12,007
Currently, there's 10 communities that have adopted it.

1409
01:49:12,387 --> 01:49:13,007
No, no, no, no.

1410
01:49:13,327 --> 01:49:13,927
In Medford?

1411
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:14,607
Yep, yep.

1412
01:49:14,747 --> 01:49:16,108
How many people does this affect?

1413
01:49:16,488 --> 01:49:16,728
Yes.

1414
01:49:17,128 --> 01:49:18,809
It should be on the handout.

1415
01:49:21,708 --> 01:49:26,772
of 450 small businesses with less than 10 employees.

1416
01:49:27,613 --> 01:49:29,874
The number of owner-occupied would be 72.

1417
01:49:31,336 --> 01:49:36,059
An example of the impact on eligible owner-occupied would be 56 parcels.

1418
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:41,523
And if you look at the various columns, you see the percentages with 1, 5, and 10%.

1419
01:49:42,404 --> 01:49:43,425
So the rate would go up.

1420
01:49:43,665 --> 01:49:46,187
So the small amount that would get the exemption.

1421
01:49:47,990 --> 01:50:00,332
the rest of the commercial, industrial, personal property tax levy would get shifted to them, and also the industrial properties do not, they're not allowed to get this exemption, so that they would pay a higher tax rate.

1422
01:50:00,972 --> 01:50:02,513
Same thing as the residential.

1423
01:50:02,533 --> 01:50:09,134
So you're saying that there's 450 small businesses that would be eligible for this, correct?

1424
01:50:11,394 --> 01:50:15,635
But the ones that are occupied would be 72 out of that.

1425
01:50:17,078 --> 01:50:22,420
72 owner occupies, that would be 10 or less people, 450 that have the small business.

1426
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,661
So how many of the ones over that?

1427
01:50:25,141 --> 01:50:34,304
How many- They're reciprocal of that, so that would be non-owner occupied, about 193 that we've identified.

1428
01:50:36,385 --> 01:50:42,187
We get a list from one of the departments of, I think, employment and training.

1429
01:50:43,368 --> 01:50:43,908
Thank you.

1430
01:50:43,988 --> 01:50:44,568
Annual report.

1431
01:50:45,328 --> 01:50:46,449
That's OK, Counselor?

1432
01:50:46,869 --> 01:50:47,569
Thank you very much.

1433
01:50:48,369 --> 01:50:51,911
On the motion of Vice President, I'll go to turn to address two papers out of order.

1434
01:50:51,931 --> 01:50:53,552
15-784, committee report.

1435
01:50:56,645 --> 01:51:03,427
Committee of the Whole, meeting report from December 1, 2015, on fiscal year 2016 tax rate.

1436
01:51:04,088 --> 01:51:08,409
Although we've just addressed the tax rate, we had asked for several papers out of committee.

1437
01:51:08,789 --> 01:51:12,110
These all have been addressed and used in our discussions tonight.

1438
01:51:12,411 --> 01:51:14,191
So on the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1439
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:15,552
All those opposed?

1440
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:16,272
Motion carries.

1441
01:51:16,932 --> 01:51:43,002
and 15 796 to the honorable president and members of the medford city council communication from the mayor uh dear president and city councillors i respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve transfers from the overlay surplus to rate valuation account 0 1 0 1 4 1 5 3 1 0 totaling 250 000 as outlined in the attached memo from the city assessor and the board of assessors this amount will be

1442
01:51:43,762 --> 01:51:53,005
will fund the state mandated revaluation of all real and personal property in the city required by the Bureau of Local Assessment of the Department of Revenue.

1443
01:51:53,365 --> 01:52:01,988
The City Assessor Ed O'Neill and City Auditor Ian Baker will present this evening to answer, be present this evening to answer any questions.

1444
01:52:02,489 --> 01:52:04,969
Very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn.

1445
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:06,650
Mr. Assessor.

1446
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:08,851
Thank you, Mr. President.

1447
01:52:10,648 --> 01:52:18,754
This is to fund the three-year revaluation, just to give the council an update on what's happening.

1448
01:52:18,814 --> 01:52:25,659
I know we have come before them for other funding sources for the inspection program, which is a nine-year program.

1449
01:52:25,899 --> 01:52:27,160
We are just about done.

1450
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:35,106
As of this week, we'll have finished all of the first inspections, and in the next couple of months, we'll be sending letters out to do interiors.

1451
01:52:38,738 --> 01:52:42,060
um, less than maybe 500 interiors to do, and that will be it.

1452
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,683
So we have satisfied the DOI's requirement for nine year inspection program.

1453
01:52:47,584 --> 01:52:56,990
Um, this, so at this point, um, for fiscal 17, this, this is for the reval, which will then be fiscal 17, 20, uh, 2023.

1454
01:52:57,930 --> 01:53:06,396
Um, so we went out to bid on these, um, and, uh, we addressed this as a committee, the whole meeting with council of marks on, on, uh,

1455
01:53:07,621 --> 01:53:11,623
inserting comparative criteria to evaluate the vendors, and we did that.

1456
01:53:11,743 --> 01:53:13,364
We've had a number of inquiries on it.

1457
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:19,327
At the end of the day, we had one bidder on each, one for real property and one for personal property.

1458
01:53:20,528 --> 01:53:27,672
And Louise Miller, when she has free time, will be awarding those contracts shortly, because we have to start that in January.

1459
01:53:36,764 --> 01:53:37,304
Quick question.

1460
01:53:37,564 --> 01:53:40,645
When you came before us for the budget, how come this wasn't introduced?

1461
01:53:41,085 --> 01:53:42,545
You knew what the dollar amount was going to be.

1462
01:53:42,725 --> 01:53:44,185
We did not, because we have to go off a bid.

1463
01:53:44,365 --> 01:53:47,366
We don't have a, that's a moving number.

1464
01:53:47,426 --> 01:53:49,586
So is this bid going to cover us until when?

1465
01:53:50,267 --> 01:53:52,007
This will be for the fiscal 17 rebate.

1466
01:53:53,527 --> 01:53:59,728
And then what we do in the interim years, we do the statistical update, which we cover that in my budget, my annual budget.

1467
01:54:00,728 --> 01:54:03,409
So does this dollar amount start from January,

1468
01:54:04,105 --> 01:54:07,747
of this year and then goes to June and then start to jump the end of July.

1469
01:54:07,787 --> 01:54:18,933
It's fiscal year, fiscal year, July 17, which July one, 2016 we'll, we'll start it, but we'll start, we'll start doing the analysis and testing the sales in January.

1470
01:54:18,953 --> 01:54:26,216
Um, we were still inserting the sales and just so the council knows the 2015 sales are going up again.

1471
01:54:27,437 --> 01:54:27,577
So,

1472
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:30,761
The interest rates are still very good.

1473
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:31,922
People are still buying.

1474
01:54:32,582 --> 01:54:35,503
And we haven't seen a decrease in now beyond 24, 30 months.

1475
01:54:35,523 --> 01:54:38,825
So I just want to let everybody know that.

1476
01:54:40,966 --> 01:54:44,167
The motion for approval by Councilor Marks.

1477
01:54:44,988 --> 01:54:48,269
Mr. O'Neill, what was the cost of the last reavail?

1478
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:50,330
The last three years?

1479
01:54:50,891 --> 01:54:54,032
So that would be fiscal 14.

1480
01:54:54,112 --> 01:54:55,273
I don't have those handy.

1481
01:54:55,313 --> 01:54:56,153
I can get that to you.

1482
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:58,390
Was it in the same?

1483
01:54:58,410 --> 01:54:59,231
Very similar, yeah.

1484
01:54:59,491 --> 01:55:00,591
Was it in the same dollar amount?

1485
01:55:00,911 --> 01:55:01,632
It's very similar.

1486
01:55:01,792 --> 01:55:02,792
Yes, it's in that amount.

1487
01:55:02,892 --> 01:55:03,953
And do we expend the full?

1488
01:55:03,973 --> 01:55:05,893
Like two thirds, around 220 something.

1489
01:55:06,133 --> 01:55:08,674
This is like, yeah, this is very close to it.

1490
01:55:09,114 --> 01:55:10,495
And was the full amount expended?

1491
01:55:11,455 --> 01:55:11,715
Oh, yeah.

1492
01:55:12,276 --> 01:55:12,456
Yeah.

1493
01:55:13,616 --> 01:55:13,796
Yeah.

1494
01:55:14,316 --> 01:55:18,478
So what we typically do is we do a transfer out of the overlay surplus.

1495
01:55:19,498 --> 01:55:23,420
Once we declare a surplus in that account for abatements and exemptions.

1496
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:26,801
So we really self fund it.

1497
01:55:27,357 --> 01:55:28,937
but obviously with the council's vote.

1498
01:55:30,458 --> 01:55:38,999
So the Board of Assessors met and voted that out, approved the transfer to surplus.

1499
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,820
Now it's before you tonight.

1500
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:48,981
Mr. President, just if I could, we have Louise.

1501
01:55:49,001 --> 01:55:51,202
Can I ask Louise a question?

1502
01:55:54,272 --> 01:55:58,698
When we were in Committee of the Whole, we were talking about the different surpluses in the city.

1503
01:55:59,559 --> 01:56:05,306
The overlay surplus, is that part of the overall $20 million that's looked at?

1504
01:56:05,326 --> 01:56:08,690
For you, Mr. President, we have

1505
01:56:12,839 --> 01:56:15,821
Maybe five or six years of overlay reserve.

1506
01:56:17,302 --> 01:56:18,402
We keep those in there.

1507
01:56:18,822 --> 01:56:25,166
Historically, they've done it that way here, and I think it's a good idea because we do have some court cases.

1508
01:56:25,246 --> 01:56:31,409
We do have uncollectibles and personal property, so we need those funds to actually abate anything that's uncollectible.

1509
01:56:31,927 --> 01:56:33,149
on the personal property side.

1510
01:56:33,329 --> 01:56:35,031
But is this part of the reserves?

1511
01:56:35,091 --> 01:56:35,892
No, it was not.

1512
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:36,532
It is not.

1513
01:56:36,693 --> 01:56:44,902
Currently, as of November, the overlay balance after including this, taking this vote money out was about $490,000.

1514
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:48,607
Now, why would this be outside of reserves?

1515
01:56:48,687 --> 01:56:49,788
If this is something that's kept

1516
01:56:50,345 --> 01:56:51,526
2, 3, 4, 5 years.

1517
01:56:51,606 --> 01:56:57,930
This is an account the assessors maintain by statute to allow for exemptions and abatements.

1518
01:56:59,091 --> 01:57:03,234
So we have a monthly report that we reconcile between three different departments.

1519
01:57:03,254 --> 01:57:04,735
So it has nothing to do with the bond rating.

1520
01:57:05,195 --> 01:57:09,158
They don't look at this when they come in and look at our bond rating?

1521
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:09,598
No.

1522
01:57:09,658 --> 01:57:13,601
They may ask it, but I don't think it's typically not a big number anyway.

1523
01:57:15,291 --> 01:57:17,932
What do we have in the account now?

1524
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:19,553
$490,000 as of November, end of November.

1525
01:57:20,153 --> 01:57:21,033
Our last board meeting, $490,000.

1526
01:57:22,514 --> 01:57:25,415
So taking the $250,000 out, there's $490,000 left.

1527
01:57:26,756 --> 01:57:28,636
And then what do we anticipate for July 1st?

1528
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:33,858
We're putting in, what are we putting in for the overlay?

1529
01:57:33,878 --> 01:57:35,019
$574,000 on the recap.

1530
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:41,482
So that will bring us up to three quarters of a million in that account?

1531
01:57:42,782 --> 01:57:44,983
We have to give the exemptions out.

1532
01:57:45,003 --> 01:57:48,365
There's about 200 and some thousand of those come January in the bill.

1533
01:57:49,406 --> 01:57:50,386
So that will come off of that.

1534
01:57:50,826 --> 01:57:55,188
So out of the 575, we got 200 and some odd that will come off automatically.

1535
01:57:55,208 --> 01:57:56,889
So that will leave 300 plus the 490.

1536
01:57:57,710 --> 01:57:59,231
Then we'll have abatements in January.

1537
01:57:59,251 --> 01:58:02,972
So it's a continuous account that we have.

1538
01:58:03,753 --> 01:58:07,955
And monies in the overlay surplus can only be used for what purpose?

1539
01:58:08,969 --> 01:58:27,466
Um, well overlay reserve until we, the statute says that the board of assessors and or the CEO of the municipality in this case, the mayor could petition the board of assessors to release declare surplus and release it, which we've used in the past for snow and ice deficits as well as rebel dollars.

1540
01:58:28,347 --> 01:58:33,492
So we don't budget the rebel, um, the inspection program or the three year rebel.

1541
01:58:33,512 --> 01:58:34,513
We take it out of the overlay.

1542
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:39,374
And you don't need, uh, that doesn't require approval of the council if the CEO.

1543
01:58:40,215 --> 01:58:40,835
Oh, it still does.

1544
01:58:41,075 --> 01:58:41,316
Oh yeah.

1545
01:58:41,676 --> 01:58:42,036
Yeah.

1546
01:58:42,056 --> 01:58:47,201
He can request the board of assessors to release overlay reserves to surplus and it goes before the council.

1547
01:58:47,882 --> 01:58:49,643
Oh yeah.

1548
01:58:49,663 --> 01:58:50,924
When's the last time that's been done?

1549
01:58:51,865 --> 01:58:55,488
Um, we've had two votes last December of 14, December of 13.

1550
01:58:56,389 --> 01:59:00,273
And we've asked the council to the board of assessors voted, um,

1551
01:59:01,496 --> 01:59:04,919
So this is the past, uh, got December 13 and 14.

1552
01:59:05,539 --> 01:59:12,824
Um, the assessors voted and came before the council with a paper to vote for the inspections.

1553
01:59:12,864 --> 01:59:14,686
And this is for the, for the three year rebel.

1554
01:59:15,506 --> 01:59:20,590
So if you look in your documents from the last two Decembers, you'll see the papers before you.

1555
01:59:22,361 --> 01:59:27,225
And you said there's 500 homes right now that we haven't done a revalidate?

1556
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:31,288
Well, the interiors, they've gone out and they finished up this week.

1557
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:35,872
We did the last reverse 9-1-1 to let folks know, and it was like four or five streets left.

1558
01:59:36,753 --> 01:59:40,516
And we'll send letters out and set up appointments for walk-throughs for the interiors.

1559
01:59:41,357 --> 01:59:44,019
And what happens ultimately if someone refuses to allow someone in?

1560
01:59:44,039 --> 01:59:45,420
As a taxpayer, they can refuse it.

1561
01:59:46,401 --> 01:59:47,001
They don't have to.

1562
01:59:48,669 --> 01:59:55,935
You know, so what happens is the assessment will be based on the data that's in the system, and if the data's incorrect, you can have an incorrect assessment.

1563
01:59:56,435 --> 01:59:59,518
So it's always good to make sure we have right information on properties.

1564
02:00:00,879 --> 02:00:01,239
Thank you.

1565
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:03,561
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1566
02:00:05,903 --> 02:00:06,383
Are you all set?

1567
02:00:07,564 --> 02:00:08,105
Yes, thank you.

1568
02:00:08,285 --> 02:00:08,966
Thank you, Councilor.

1569
02:00:09,266 --> 02:00:10,687
Chair recognizes Councilor Pinto.

1570
02:00:11,267 --> 02:00:11,468
Ed.

1571
02:00:12,849 --> 02:00:17,893
You just said that the money's used, it's put in the overlay surplus.

1572
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:20,427
Is this accumulated each and every year?

1573
02:00:20,527 --> 02:00:21,347
Is it carryover money?

1574
02:00:23,209 --> 02:00:24,870
For you, Mr. President, yes, it does.

1575
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:32,415
We have a, uh, it's on page, uh, two of the recap, uh, probably getting close to the top.

1576
02:00:32,595 --> 02:00:38,139
It's a, it's an allowance for, for, if you look at page 11 on the handout from last committee, the whole meeting.

1577
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:44,604
So this is well, the reserve does.

1578
02:00:45,164 --> 02:00:45,845
Yeah.

1579
02:00:46,165 --> 02:00:46,285
Yeah.

1580
02:00:47,316 --> 02:00:52,378
Historically, what does the city usually pay out in this account during the course of a year?

1581
02:00:54,299 --> 02:00:57,560
Let me just show you where it's on the recap.

1582
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:02,762
It's page two of the recap, line number 2D.

1583
02:01:03,643 --> 02:01:12,606
That's in there annually, an appropriation that we make on the assessors with the consultation of the budget director, finance director.

1584
02:01:13,607 --> 02:01:16,888
An estimate of what we think we need for exemptions,

1585
02:01:17,499 --> 02:01:25,123
We track the exemptions and abatements annually, and we do a monthly report that's reconciled with the auditor's office.

1586
02:01:25,143 --> 02:01:27,064
So what's the dollar amount, so the people can hear it?

1587
02:01:27,745 --> 02:01:28,065
For what?

1588
02:01:28,645 --> 02:01:28,785
It's $574,608.47.

1589
02:01:28,845 --> 02:01:31,787
And this is a budget appropriation each and every year, correct?

1590
02:01:32,367 --> 02:01:33,108
It goes in the recap.

1591
02:01:33,148 --> 02:01:35,289
It goes into the recap and then it goes into the surplus.

1592
02:01:41,310 --> 02:01:42,170
the overlay surplus?

1593
02:01:42,911 --> 02:01:47,272
It stays in reserves until either the mayor petitions us to release it as surplus.

1594
02:01:47,332 --> 02:01:50,793
If in fact we deem it to be, or we release it ourselves.

1595
02:01:51,353 --> 02:01:51,634
Okay.

1596
02:01:51,874 --> 02:01:56,795
So we have to do our own little analysis to say fiscal year 2013, we have 10,000 in there.

1597
02:01:56,835 --> 02:01:59,876
Is that, is that enough to be released as surplus?

1598
02:02:00,136 --> 02:02:00,797
That's how we do it.

1599
02:02:01,577 --> 02:02:10,660
Well, I don't understand if Louise, you just got through saying that this, when council Max asked the question that this has nothing to do with our bond rating, but now all of a sudden,

1600
02:02:11,246 --> 02:02:20,514
This can be taken out, I think, if you said by the executive of the community, in use for other city expenses, which is a direct reflection upon the budget.

1601
02:02:21,414 --> 02:02:23,156
No, only the surplus can be.

1602
02:02:23,176 --> 02:02:24,217
That's what we're talking about, the surplus.

1603
02:02:24,237 --> 02:02:26,158
And just the surplus.

1604
02:02:26,919 --> 02:02:32,083
We have to declare it, take it out of reserve, and declare it surplus by a vote of the Board of Assessors.

1605
02:02:33,064 --> 02:02:34,005
By statute.

1606
02:02:34,325 --> 02:02:35,266
By statute, correct.

1607
02:02:35,286 --> 02:02:36,807
Or the mayor can make a request to take it.

1608
02:02:36,847 --> 02:02:37,547
Oh, he makes a request.

1609
02:02:37,567 --> 02:02:38,308
We still have to vote.

1610
02:02:38,608 --> 02:02:40,670
OK, so when you take a vote on, you say yes to do it.

1611
02:02:40,929 --> 02:02:42,830
It now goes into a budgetary item, correct?

1612
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:44,631
It can be appropriated, correct.

1613
02:02:44,651 --> 02:02:51,614
So if it's appropriated for a budgetary item, then why wouldn't that, in and of itself, the surplus in and of itself, be considered part of a bond rating?

1614
02:02:51,974 --> 02:02:53,475
Because what if you had no money in there at all?

1615
02:02:53,775 --> 02:02:54,295
What would you do?

1616
02:02:55,316 --> 02:02:58,337
Well, we have to have a sufficient amount of money to cover for abatements.

1617
02:02:59,197 --> 02:03:01,278
But let's just say you fell short.

1618
02:03:01,318 --> 02:03:01,839
What would you do?

1619
02:03:02,619 --> 02:03:06,521
Well, yeah, you can run a deficit out of the count.

1620
02:03:06,981 --> 02:03:07,481
We haven't.

1621
02:03:07,581 --> 02:03:09,142
We've been fortunate enough to manage it.

1622
02:03:10,184 --> 02:03:14,566
the Board of Assessors and the Assessing Office, to manage it so that we're not in a deficit.

1623
02:03:15,206 --> 02:03:21,448
I think a few years back, we had some deficits for some old personal property accounts that weren't collected many, many years ago.

1624
02:03:22,289 --> 02:03:24,249
But how do you accumulate a $490,000 balance right now?

1625
02:03:24,269 --> 02:03:25,370
So it's probably—it would be $720,000.

1626
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:27,691
As of right now, tonight, before this vote, there's $720,000 in that account.

1627
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:28,371
How much do you— No, no, no.

1628
02:03:37,442 --> 02:03:37,942
That's separate.

1629
02:03:37,982 --> 02:03:39,223
That has to be approved by DOI.

1630
02:03:39,243 --> 02:03:41,545
That goes in tonight, tomorrow, or the end of the week.

1631
02:03:42,045 --> 02:03:43,506
That has to be approved.

1632
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:44,987
That's not allowable now.

1633
02:03:45,748 --> 02:03:47,088
You just said there's $490,000 left.

1634
02:03:47,129 --> 02:03:53,033
There's currently, as of November, $490,000 left in the account.

1635
02:03:53,133 --> 02:03:54,053
After this $250,000 goes out.

1636
02:03:54,094 --> 02:03:58,517
We still have some real estate taxes that have not been paid in the past couple of years.

1637
02:03:58,917 --> 02:04:04,861
We still have some uncollectible personal property accounts that businesses went out of business, or they moved, they didn't pay the tax.

1638
02:04:06,384 --> 02:04:08,505
take that account and just deplete it.

1639
02:04:08,785 --> 02:04:09,666
We have to manage it.

1640
02:04:09,726 --> 02:04:15,509
We work with the collector's office to see what we have for- But real estate taxes in the city go into the general fund of the city.

1641
02:04:15,529 --> 02:04:17,070
It doesn't go into an overlay surplus.

1642
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:17,851
Correct.

1643
02:04:19,511 --> 02:04:20,732
So why would that be part of this?

1644
02:04:21,132 --> 02:04:22,973
You're waiting to collect on real estate taxes.

1645
02:04:27,136 --> 02:04:30,638
It's the same account that we've used every year as part of the statute.

1646
02:04:31,471 --> 02:04:36,492
it's part of the recap, which goes to a process with local assessment through all accounts to get approved.

1647
02:04:37,772 --> 02:04:40,653
Um, I think it might be, what is it?

1648
02:04:40,673 --> 02:04:43,534
1% of the book, probably less than that on the budget.

1649
02:04:43,594 --> 02:04:44,254
That's 1%.

1650
02:04:44,294 --> 02:04:44,514
Yeah.

1651
02:04:45,734 --> 02:04:51,995
Louise, you mentioned in the community, the whole that, you know, you're going to be having some new financial restructuring and consideration.

1652
02:04:52,015 --> 02:04:54,196
You have two new councils coming on.

1653
02:04:54,296 --> 02:04:58,857
I think it would be beneficial to have the entire council sit down and understand some of this because

1654
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:03,401
This can be confusing, and at the same time, it becomes contradictory, too.

1655
02:05:03,701 --> 02:05:14,305
You can't have a real estate account that's going to put money in there, which is part of the general fund, and then once the money goes into the overlay surplus, it's not to be considered part of, you know, Standard Moody's, you know, standard.

1656
02:05:14,385 --> 02:05:15,305
I understand this.

1657
02:05:18,066 --> 02:05:19,166
It's moving money around.

1658
02:05:19,266 --> 02:05:21,827
It's the old shell game, huh?

1659
02:05:21,887 --> 02:05:24,168
Well, we have to — For you, Mr. President, it's a process.

1660
02:05:24,208 --> 02:05:28,189
The Board of Assessors, by statute, has to vote it, declare it surplus, vote it out.

1661
02:05:28,866 --> 02:05:32,848
The paper goes to the mayor, the mayor sends it to the council, so we have the checks and balances in place.

1662
02:05:33,408 --> 02:05:36,090
We have discussion on every single transfer of funds.

1663
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:36,730
Thank you.

1664
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:38,231
There was a motion for approval on this.

1665
02:05:38,451 --> 02:05:49,657
I was just going to say, Ann Baker reminded me that a couple of years ago, the surplus was actually used to fund a snow and ice deficit.

1666
02:05:49,697 --> 02:05:58,021
So the surplus does get used to fund city budgets or deficits when necessary as well.

1667
02:05:59,157 --> 02:05:59,479
Thank you.

1668
02:06:00,162 --> 02:06:03,739
On the motion for approval by Councillor Camuso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1669
02:06:13,965 --> 02:06:17,826
Yes, with a vote of 6 in the affirmative and none in the negative.

1670
02:06:18,566 --> 02:06:19,986
The motion carries.

1671
02:06:20,026 --> 02:06:20,706
Congratulations.

1672
02:06:20,746 --> 02:06:21,627
Thank you.

1673
02:06:22,167 --> 02:06:28,488
While we're under suspension, there was a committee meeting today, and we voted to report out of the committee.

1674
02:06:29,268 --> 02:06:38,570
We discussed the bond request for $300,000 on the motion to accept the paper out and to table it.

1675
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:39,330
All those in favor?

1676
02:06:40,054 --> 02:06:40,774
All those opposed?

1677
02:06:41,135 --> 02:06:41,855
Motion carries.

1678
02:06:42,235 --> 02:06:47,658
On the motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Vice President L'Engle Kern, all those in favor?

1679
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:48,819
All those opposed?

1680
02:06:48,879 --> 02:06:49,600
Motion carries.

1681
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:51,841
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1682
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:58,625
15788 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that a representative from Tufts University meet with the Council to explain the function of

1683
02:06:59,045 --> 02:07:06,652
T. E. M. S. Be it further resolved that representatives from the Police Department, Fire Department, and Armstrong Ambulance be requested to attend.

1684
02:07:07,032 --> 02:07:13,037
On the motion of Councilor Langel-Curran to table, all those in favor, all those opposed, the matter is tabled.

1685
02:07:13,057 --> 02:07:17,481
15-789, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Traffic Commission forward

1686
02:07:17,781 --> 02:07:22,706
to the Council an update on the deliberations regarding citywide resident permit parking.

1687
02:07:22,766 --> 02:07:26,550
On the motion of Councilor Langel-Kern, that the matter be tabled.

1688
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:27,751
All those in favor?

1689
02:07:28,111 --> 02:07:28,852
All those opposed?

1690
02:07:28,892 --> 02:07:30,414
The matter is tabled.

1691
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:33,937
15-790, offered by Vice President Langel-Kern.

1692
02:07:34,338 --> 02:07:38,562
Be it resolved that the Office of Energy and Environment update the City Council with regard

1693
02:07:39,002 --> 02:07:46,083
to what has been done and what is scheduled to be done from the city standpoint regarding water conservation within city buildings.

1694
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:47,524
Madam Vice President.

1695
02:07:47,804 --> 02:07:49,184
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1696
02:07:49,344 --> 02:07:51,585
Last week, we had an extensive conversation.

1697
02:07:51,985 --> 02:08:07,008
We had a committee of the whole meeting, and then we had an extensive conversation on the floor, the council floor, with regards to the deficit in the water and sewer budgets and how the city was going to overcome that.

1698
02:08:08,996 --> 02:08:12,097
good hour to two discussion with regards to a few different points.

1699
02:08:12,598 --> 02:08:22,722
Within that discussion, we discussed the city buildings and the probably lack of update with regards to water conservation.

1700
02:08:23,102 --> 02:08:37,628
So if we could get a report back from Alicia Hunt, our Director of Energy and Environment, with regards to what has the city done within the last five to 10 years with regards to conservation within our city buildings, and what is the plan moving forward?

1701
02:08:38,439 --> 02:08:42,920
I think it's important that the, you know, obviously the rate payers are conserving.

1702
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:44,420
That was proven.

1703
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:49,281
But we also want to make sure we conserve on the city side as well.

1704
02:08:49,361 --> 02:08:51,841
And I'm sure a number of updates need to be made.

1705
02:08:51,921 --> 02:08:56,182
So I'd like to just have any information with regards to water conservation.

1706
02:08:56,202 --> 02:09:05,744
And I'd also like to be updated if any grants are out there or if we've tried to apply for any grants to help conserve within our buildings.

1707
02:09:08,224 --> 02:09:08,604
Very good.

1708
02:09:08,904 --> 02:09:12,845
It's one of the motion for approval by vice president Lugo Kern.

1709
02:09:13,346 --> 02:09:14,106
All those in favor.

1710
02:09:14,686 --> 02:09:15,346
All those opposed.

1711
02:09:15,946 --> 02:09:25,049
Motion passes 15 dash seven 91 offered by counselor Penta be resolved that one's freedom to speak at or before a city council meeting be discussed.

1712
02:09:25,149 --> 02:09:25,789
Counselor Penta.

1713
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:27,410
Mr. President.

1714
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:30,731
Um, most recently, uh, last week we had a situation here.

1715
02:09:31,011 --> 02:09:31,071
Um,

1716
02:09:31,886 --> 02:09:43,070
where a commentary was made by one of my colleagues, who's not here tonight, as it relates to he wanted to congratulate somebody for his recent appointment within a union position.

1717
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:44,451
And that's all well and good.

1718
02:09:45,151 --> 02:09:49,152
And I tried to give my opinion as to why I didn't think it was a good idea.

1719
02:09:50,213 --> 02:09:56,755
And my commentary was somewhat repressed by you sitting in the chair, Mr. President, because, you know, it's my right to speak.

1720
02:09:57,347 --> 02:10:06,355
We have every one of these counselors over here, men and women, give resolutions on any one given Tuesday night as it relates to who they want to congratulate and what have you.

1721
02:10:06,475 --> 02:10:10,599
And if somebody has a different point of view, that likewise should be entertained.

1722
02:10:10,819 --> 02:10:13,522
I wasn't speaking on behalf of anyone but myself.

1723
02:10:14,302 --> 02:10:22,850
And while somebody is being praised for their promotion, I just did not feel it was correct because that same one person who you were praising for his promotion was the same person.

1724
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:28,931
who went into a municipal building and lied and told mistruths about me during this past campaign.

1725
02:10:28,971 --> 02:10:29,991
And I didn't think that was true.

1726
02:10:30,191 --> 02:10:30,511
And right.

1727
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:32,232
And I think the people ought to know this.

1728
02:10:32,812 --> 02:10:40,013
If you're going to take advantage of sitting here and trying to acknowledge someone, you need to take the opposite side if somebody has a different point of view.

1729
02:10:40,553 --> 02:10:43,393
There are people that come before this podium that try to express themselves.

1730
02:10:43,894 --> 02:10:45,134
And sometimes they get shut off.

1731
02:10:45,174 --> 02:10:46,174
Sometimes they're ignored.

1732
02:10:46,654 --> 02:10:48,894
And sometimes they're being told enough is enough.

1733
02:10:49,274 --> 02:10:52,215
You know, this is the only forum in the entire community of Medford

1734
02:10:52,798 --> 02:10:54,619
that people have an opportunity to come and speak.

1735
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:59,783
You have a newspaper that's a week late, and that doesn't serve any purpose.

1736
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:10,191
You also have a school committee that meets biweekly, and sometimes that doesn't serve any purpose, because by the time you get the news after the fact, whatever takes place has already been done.

1737
02:11:10,911 --> 02:11:16,516
But whether you agree or disagree with the purpose of that podium, it's there to allow the people to come and speak.

1738
02:11:17,536 --> 02:11:20,579
And my commentary last week was, I did not vote for

1739
02:11:22,738 --> 02:11:33,366
Nor would I approve of commending anybody who gets a promotion in their union job, who took advantage of his position, to come and bash another elected official.

1740
02:11:33,626 --> 02:11:34,667
I just think it was wrong.

1741
02:11:35,647 --> 02:11:39,350
I'm a big boy, and I can stand here, and I can take any abuse that anyone wants to give.

1742
02:11:39,831 --> 02:11:47,876
But when they lie and distort the truth and misrepresent, and they get promoted on those principles, that's not the principles of hard and good work.

1743
02:11:48,397 --> 02:11:49,998
That's just the principles of somebody

1744
02:11:50,308 --> 02:11:56,012
who is just a bad person, as far as I'm concerned, as it relates to them doing a job that they did not do well.

1745
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:57,733
Counselor, we don't address people's characters here.

1746
02:11:57,753 --> 02:11:58,133
Pardon me?

1747
02:11:58,173 --> 02:11:59,894
We don't address people's characters.

1748
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:05,958
Well, my character was addressed by that gentleman that you voted for, that you wanted to commend, Counselor De La Russo.

1749
02:12:06,318 --> 02:12:08,499
So if you don't like it, then you shouldn't have voted for it.

1750
02:12:08,519 --> 02:12:09,580
And we're free to not vote for the resolution.

1751
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,941
And probably it shouldn't have been here.

1752
02:12:11,161 --> 02:12:17,825
Are we going to commend and congratulate every single person in this community that gets a promotion in their job or graduates from a college?

1753
02:12:19,457 --> 02:12:20,157
Are we going to do that?

1754
02:12:20,177 --> 02:12:21,258
We might as well start doing that.

1755
02:12:21,838 --> 02:12:32,124
There's a lot of people who are left out, who live in side streets, main streets, up in the hillside, West Method, South Method, in your own neighborhood, who are wonderful people and they've done great things here in this city.

1756
02:12:32,524 --> 02:12:34,585
Never see them getting commended and congratulated.

1757
02:12:35,385 --> 02:12:44,030
But when you go out of your way to pick a particular person, to congratulate that person who intentionally went out of their way to attack a councilor by

1758
02:12:44,574 --> 02:12:46,855
saying untruths, mistruths, and lies.

1759
02:12:47,556 --> 02:12:52,238
I am never going to sit here and let that get by on anyone, whether I agreed with you or disagreed.

1760
02:12:52,458 --> 02:12:54,899
I would be defending your position, Councilor De La Russa.

1761
02:12:55,219 --> 02:12:59,501
I wouldn't let anybody do that to you, especially if I knew it was untruth and it was a lie.

1762
02:12:59,982 --> 02:13:04,164
Having a difference of opinion is one thing, but telling a lie I will not stand for.

1763
02:13:05,985 --> 02:13:13,048
Listen, I've served 39 years as an elected official in this community, and there isn't one person that will be able to come to that rail and say I lied about them.

1764
02:13:13,542 --> 02:13:14,763
I lied about what I was doing.

1765
02:13:15,343 --> 02:13:16,083
I don't believe in that.

1766
02:13:16,143 --> 02:13:16,984
I don't have to do that.

1767
02:13:17,684 --> 02:13:21,106
And I don't need to have that done to me as it was in this past campaign.

1768
02:13:21,606 --> 02:13:25,888
And I don't need to have people think that that's what took place, when, in fact, it did take place.

1769
02:13:27,149 --> 02:13:29,090
So you can sit there all you want, Mr. President.

1770
02:13:29,110 --> 02:13:39,535
And I would hope next year, whoever sits in that chair — I think it's your turn, Rick, to sit in the chair — I would hope whoever sits in that chair, if it's you, you allow people to come and speak, and you'll let them know what the truth is.

1771
02:13:39,925 --> 02:13:44,107
Because that's the only forum in the city of Medford that allows somebody here to come.

1772
02:13:44,648 --> 02:13:45,608
Try to go to City Hall.

1773
02:13:45,888 --> 02:13:46,889
Try to go meet with the mayor.

1774
02:13:47,289 --> 02:13:48,570
Get to the four secretaries.

1775
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:49,490
Good luck to you.

1776
02:13:49,610 --> 02:13:51,551
And try to get your opinion expressed around here.

1777
02:13:51,992 --> 02:13:52,592
It's right there.

1778
02:13:52,752 --> 02:13:54,833
There's the podium where it all begins and where it ends.

1779
02:13:54,913 --> 02:13:57,975
And hopefully that stays that way because that's the people's forum.

1780
02:13:58,325 --> 02:14:05,933
And that's what we're getting paid to do, to represent the people, not to represent ourselves and to give out jobs and take care of each other with political appointments.

1781
02:14:06,173 --> 02:14:07,295
No, that's not what we're here for.

1782
02:14:07,555 --> 02:14:08,696
That's not what I'm here for.

1783
02:14:09,117 --> 02:14:16,845
And I will never ever allow anyone in this community to stand there and lie about me in public or in private, knowing when it's false, it's not true.

1784
02:14:17,085 --> 02:14:18,827
And I would stand here and defend any one of you.

1785
02:14:19,686 --> 02:14:23,847
And those sitting on that community, out in that audience, because that's not the way government should be run.

1786
02:14:24,307 --> 02:14:26,467
If you want to win an election, do it the right way.

1787
02:14:26,527 --> 02:14:27,588
Do it the honest way.

1788
02:14:28,188 --> 02:14:32,969
Don't go in there and lie about someone to try to generate votes, because that's what took place.

1789
02:14:33,609 --> 02:14:34,949
You can say all you want.

1790
02:14:35,269 --> 02:14:41,030
You can say all you want about the resolution that Mr. Knight and the gentleman that he wanted to congratulate last week.

1791
02:14:41,470 --> 02:14:42,231
But I don't buy it.

1792
02:14:42,251 --> 02:14:42,991
I don't accept it.

1793
02:14:43,391 --> 02:14:49,212
And I think it was a terrible, terrible act that that gentleman committed here in the city of Medford, trying to con

1794
02:14:49,985 --> 02:14:58,029
union members into this community, making them believe bad things about me during this past campaign, and I will not stand for it, and I do not accept it.

1795
02:14:58,469 --> 02:15:01,630
Thank you.

1796
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:03,391
Thank you, Mr. President.

1797
02:15:04,011 --> 02:15:09,934
Unfortunately, this has been a nice meeting, I thought, and I still do.

1798
02:15:11,172 --> 02:15:16,913
You know, I'm not going to sit here and just let the Medford resident be bashed, to be quite frank.

1799
02:15:17,653 --> 02:15:19,914
We're all entitled to our opinion, as Councillor Penta said.

1800
02:15:20,754 --> 02:15:26,415
A campaign took place for several offices in the community, and nobody knows what happened in this particular matter.

1801
02:15:26,755 --> 02:15:27,075
Nobody.

1802
02:15:28,075 --> 02:15:35,337
But what happened last week during a congratulatory citation

1803
02:15:35,961 --> 02:15:41,765
When family members, young kids that happen to maybe be watching this, it was classless.

1804
02:15:42,186 --> 02:15:44,327
It was absolutely classless, in my opinion.

1805
02:15:44,968 --> 02:15:48,170
And I understand the frustrations possibly, but this is right up there.

1806
02:15:49,231 --> 02:15:59,198
When the same counsellor talked about a freshman captain on the girls hockey team and berated her and said that she, the girls didn't even want her to be captain.

1807
02:15:59,539 --> 02:16:01,240
And the mother came storming down here.

1808
02:16:03,248 --> 02:16:03,989
It's classless.

1809
02:16:04,630 --> 02:16:06,071
It's classless, Mr. President.

1810
02:16:06,692 --> 02:16:12,218
We don't know what happened in that particular matter, nor will anyone that was other than the people that were in that room may not know what happened.

1811
02:16:12,899 --> 02:16:13,960
And I agree with the counselor.

1812
02:16:14,801 --> 02:16:19,467
We can all put any resolutions on and this and that and thank people, but last week,

1813
02:16:20,592 --> 02:16:23,393
when it was a resolution of just to say congratulations.

1814
02:16:23,413 --> 02:16:28,255
There's resolutions that every single member of this council have put on over the years.

1815
02:16:28,395 --> 02:16:31,337
Maybe it was congratulating someone that was convicted of a crime.

1816
02:16:31,677 --> 02:16:33,037
Maybe it was other stuff.

1817
02:16:33,558 --> 02:16:41,961
And there's been instances where maybe people have been uneasy about supporting a congratulatory resolution or something along those lines.

1818
02:16:42,461 --> 02:16:43,522
But the fact of the matter is,

1819
02:16:44,412 --> 02:16:45,813
It just wasn't the appropriate time.

1820
02:16:46,213 --> 02:16:49,554
If the gentleman has a problem with anyone, maybe pick up the phone and call him.

1821
02:16:50,035 --> 02:16:52,476
I just wish it didn't get to this evening.

1822
02:16:52,536 --> 02:17:00,940
I was hoping that last week was the end of it, but I just can't sit here and... And here's the other piece of it too.

1823
02:17:02,681 --> 02:17:10,064
It is a big, the particular promotion that this gentleman received is a very, very, very big promotion.

1824
02:17:10,785 --> 02:17:11,565
The vice president

1825
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:15,931
of the Teamsters, who the President is Sean O'Brien, that we know.

1826
02:17:16,392 --> 02:17:21,674
But there's over 500 members of the Teamsters Local 25 right here in this community.

1827
02:17:21,934 --> 02:17:23,174
It's not the City Hall employees.

1828
02:17:23,234 --> 02:17:24,515
It's not the secretaries.

1829
02:17:24,595 --> 02:17:26,275
It's not the DPW only.

1830
02:17:26,935 --> 02:17:30,177
You got many, many, many, many, many Teamsters that live in this community.

1831
02:17:30,597 --> 02:17:33,518
And like I said, Mr. President, this is America.

1832
02:17:34,118 --> 02:17:36,319
Councillor Penter is certainly entitled to his opinion.

1833
02:17:36,792 --> 02:17:47,698
But I just think last week wasn't the time nor the place during a congratulations for a gentleman that, like I said, we don't know really what happened in the situation.

1834
02:17:48,179 --> 02:17:49,539
There's two sides to every story.

1835
02:17:50,100 --> 02:18:00,065
But I just couldn't sit here and I just wish that this didn't come up another week because it's unfortunate that this took place.

1836
02:18:02,996 --> 02:18:03,836
That's all I got to say.

1837
02:18:04,617 --> 02:18:15,022
You know, I just, uh, uh, other than that, I'm really, I'm really just speechless that, uh, that during a congratulations, this would come up, but consular pent is certainly entitled to his right to say anything he wants.

1838
02:18:15,082 --> 02:18:16,223
And he's got to stick by it.

1839
02:18:17,103 --> 02:18:17,964
He's got to stick by it.

1840
02:18:18,384 --> 02:18:21,685
If he, uh, if he's asked questions on it or what happened or anything.

1841
02:18:22,006 --> 02:18:24,167
So, uh, there's really nothing else I can say.

1842
02:18:27,688 --> 02:18:28,049
Thank you.

1843
02:18:28,089 --> 02:18:29,689
Please state your name and address for the record.

1844
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:30,730
Uh, Joe Villalon.

1845
02:18:31,707 --> 02:18:32,947
59 Garfield Avenue for Mass.

1846
02:18:33,528 --> 02:18:38,509
Albuquerque, New Mexico, December 15, 2009, six years ago, next week.

1847
02:18:39,509 --> 02:18:49,172
The commission there, for two months, from October to December, was having the residents of Albuquerque go up and submit what they were going to discuss.

1848
02:18:49,912 --> 02:18:54,874
And the council decided if they would entertain the citizens or not.

1849
02:18:55,754 --> 02:18:59,735
The ACLU fought with the citizens and slammed that down.

1850
02:19:01,437 --> 02:19:03,037
It's pervasive across the country.

1851
02:19:03,077 --> 02:19:05,178
You can Google it and you can find these lawsuits.

1852
02:19:05,598 --> 02:19:18,520
New York, there's a similar case in New York of people like myself coming to the council and getting censored with the gavel or point of information or anything to throw you off balance so that you can't speak.

1853
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:20,421
Now, I commend Councilor Penta.

1854
02:19:20,541 --> 02:19:22,141
I agree with him a thousand percent.

1855
02:19:23,541 --> 02:19:27,302
I, and I would appreciate not being interrupted because I didn't interrupt you.

1856
02:19:28,609 --> 02:19:29,290
I heard you, sir.

1857
02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:29,810
I heard you.

1858
02:19:29,850 --> 02:19:31,191
And it was condescending and it was wrong.

1859
02:19:31,291 --> 02:19:33,833
And people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

1860
02:19:38,157 --> 02:19:40,879
Again, see, this is how people are censored.

1861
02:19:40,919 --> 02:19:45,522
So people watching, this is how people are censored when you're interrupted by counselors.

1862
02:19:45,562 --> 02:19:49,445
So now you can consider the source and see what's just happened to me.

1863
02:19:49,846 --> 02:19:52,668
And you understand that counselor Penta was a thousand percent right.

1864
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:59,552
It was wrong of one councillor to keep putting commendations on when there were motions and resolutions.

1865
02:20:00,273 --> 02:20:02,353
Now, look at the track record of every councillor.

1866
02:20:02,553 --> 02:20:10,777
Councillor Marx, council president, I believe council president might have two or three motions in the past six years, while Councillor Marx does a lot of hard work.

1867
02:20:11,717 --> 02:20:17,740
The citizens, and again, I'm being censored again, because when someone laughs and jokes and snickers,

1868
02:20:18,826 --> 02:20:20,587
That's what this is all about, free speech.

1869
02:20:21,047 --> 02:20:22,909
That's what happened to Councillor Penta last week.

1870
02:20:22,949 --> 02:20:25,090
Forget the topic, forget the individual.

1871
02:20:26,131 --> 02:20:31,354
This Councillor started raising his voice, talking over Councillor Penta and censoring him.

1872
02:20:32,254 --> 02:20:38,338
Now, in a conversation, not a monologue, you hear from one individual, you hear from another, then you hear from another.

1873
02:20:38,398 --> 02:20:39,279
That's a conversation.

1874
02:20:39,319 --> 02:20:40,659
We're having that conversation.

1875
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:45,683
The Councillor here was totally wrong, talking over Councillor Penta.

1876
02:20:46,323 --> 02:20:47,784
That has happened to him a number of times.

1877
02:20:49,836 --> 02:21:03,891
This 10 minutes that we get here at the City Council with no access TV, paying for access TV, watching as only 11 citizens come out week after week because one citizen here said to me, it's not apathy, Joe.

1878
02:21:04,051 --> 02:21:04,672
It's not apathy.

1879
02:21:04,692 --> 02:21:06,634
They're afraid that you can't fight City Hall.

1880
02:21:07,915 --> 02:21:10,278
And it has come to this, that a councilor has to put it on

1881
02:21:11,415 --> 02:21:13,636
on the agenda so that we can have free speech.

1882
02:21:14,417 --> 02:21:25,863
I submit that councilors elect Scarpelli and Falco, consider this very carefully, councilors elect Scarpelli and Falco should know next year that we the people want to talk to you.

1883
02:21:26,744 --> 02:21:28,725
You're the public servants and we're the public.

1884
02:21:29,365 --> 02:21:37,650
We want to have uninhibited free speech with our city councils to talk about taxes, to talk about public access TV, to talk about decorum.

1885
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:41,862
And if you treat us well, you will find that we will treat you well in return.

1886
02:21:42,522 --> 02:21:46,445
Treat us poorly, we'll put the mirror up.

1887
02:21:46,925 --> 02:21:47,906
So thank you very much.

1888
02:21:48,046 --> 02:21:50,868
Albuquerque, New Mexico, look it up on Google.

1889
02:21:51,288 --> 02:21:53,830
I'll put a tiny URL out there so people can read about it.

1890
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:55,851
Councilor Penta, God bless you.

1891
02:21:56,791 --> 02:21:57,812
You're absolutely right.

1892
02:22:02,455 --> 02:22:02,815
Thank you.

1893
02:22:02,875 --> 02:22:04,476
Please state your name and address for the record.

1894
02:22:04,496 --> 02:22:06,117
My name is Anthony D'Antonio.

1895
02:22:06,177 --> 02:22:07,198
I live at 12 Yale street.

1896
02:22:08,013 --> 02:22:13,817
And I just want to make a comment regarding the statement that Mr. Penta brought up.

1897
02:22:14,998 --> 02:22:25,406
Um, I felt myself not having been a candidate this year that that was a very inappropriate acknowledgement that evening because everybody in the city knew what happened.

1898
02:22:26,167 --> 02:22:29,369
It was even self admitted by the individual who was being acknowledged.

1899
02:22:30,089 --> 02:22:37,495
And then Mr. Penta was besmirched saying that he did something that he did not do because I was there when Bob Penta went up to defend his name.

1900
02:22:38,213 --> 02:22:40,534
So it was inappropriate, there was no place for it.

1901
02:22:40,554 --> 02:22:43,254
If you want to acknowledge him, send him a bloody card.

1902
02:22:43,654 --> 02:22:44,034
Thank you.

1903
02:22:46,835 --> 02:22:47,275
Thank you.

1904
02:22:48,475 --> 02:22:49,976
Please state your name and address for the record.

1905
02:22:50,996 --> 02:22:52,116
Thank you, Mr. President.

1906
02:22:52,196 --> 02:22:57,058
Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

1907
02:22:57,078 --> 02:23:06,940
I used to teach public speaking at a university in southeast Kansas, and I have to say that

1908
02:23:08,062 --> 02:23:12,444
We want to try to bring more citizens to this open forum.

1909
02:23:12,564 --> 02:23:24,229
I actually looked up in the last week what the policies are in regarding the decorum and the rules, the Roberts rules that we follow in council meetings.

1910
02:23:24,629 --> 02:23:27,530
And as a member of a state committee, we follow Roberts rules.

1911
02:23:27,610 --> 02:23:31,292
But unfortunately, the rules aren't always followed.

1912
02:23:31,732 --> 02:23:34,793
And coming to this podium,

1913
02:23:35,530 --> 02:23:38,911
Oftentimes, people ask me, why do you subject yourself to that?

1914
02:23:39,251 --> 02:23:43,172
Because I'm watching at home, and I see the counselors aren't really listening to you.

1915
02:23:43,972 --> 02:23:56,695
A few weeks ago, we were discussing, I forget what it was, but I brought up a comment by former president, God rest his soul, Reagan, about the nine scariest words he ever heard.

1916
02:23:58,015 --> 02:23:59,436
And as I recited it,

1917
02:24:01,121 --> 02:24:06,265
With all due respect, Mr. President, you were laughing at me from behind the podium.

1918
02:24:06,425 --> 02:24:12,550
And people mentioned that to me days later, saying that was pretty disrespectful and rude.

1919
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:21,257
So I would like to see more people come to this podium, especially with a new council coming in and a new mayoral administration coming in.

1920
02:24:21,678 --> 02:24:26,842
We're literally going to need all the voices we can get at this podium.

1921
02:24:27,683 --> 02:24:29,384
And I want to thank Councilor Penta

1922
02:24:29,808 --> 02:24:33,392
for his years of dedicated service and for bringing up this issue tonight.

1923
02:24:33,852 --> 02:24:35,915
And thank you for your time, Mr. President.

1924
02:24:46,526 --> 02:24:48,128
Please state your name and address for the record.

1925
02:24:48,148 --> 02:24:49,709
Castaneri, 20 Cushing Street.

1926
02:24:50,857 --> 02:25:01,084
Once upon a time, the unions served a really good cause when my grandfather was digging a ditch to build the pumping station on Spa Pond so they could pump that water up to the Hidden Res.

1927
02:25:02,765 --> 02:25:05,246
These days, I'm not sure what's going on with the unions.

1928
02:25:06,767 --> 02:25:13,872
Maybe it's a bit out of control, nothing to do with the other side of Jimmy Hoffa Stadium, but gotta put things in perspective, I think.

1929
02:25:26,898 --> 02:25:35,502
15-792 offered by Councilor Penta be resolved that the matter of the school department cafeteria employees that was discussed at a budget meetings be reviewed.

1930
02:25:35,803 --> 02:25:37,503
What was that matter Councilor Penta?

1931
02:25:37,784 --> 02:25:39,525
Mr. President, the matter was simply this.

1932
02:25:39,685 --> 02:25:44,187
There are not too many of these folks that work in the school department.

1933
02:25:44,227 --> 02:25:46,368
I don't think they've seen a raise in eight to nine years.

1934
02:25:46,728 --> 02:25:48,109
Um, our superintendent,

1935
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:54,223
If the budget turned around, he said he would investigate it, look into it, and if they needed to get one, strike that.

1936
02:25:54,704 --> 02:25:56,985
If that be the case, that he would take care of it.

1937
02:25:57,045 --> 02:26:05,390
Well, nothing's been taken care of as we speak here tonight, other than a new $90,000 job being given out to the school committee last week.

1938
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:05,931
Mr. President.

1939
02:26:05,951 --> 02:26:07,692
Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

1940
02:26:08,272 --> 02:26:08,532
Yes.

1941
02:26:08,773 --> 02:26:17,278
I believe the matter was reported to the school committee last evening, late in the meeting, but they actually negotiated a raise.

1942
02:26:17,751 --> 02:26:18,972
with the cafeteria workers.

1943
02:26:19,032 --> 02:26:22,295
So Councilor Penta is, in fact, not correct.

1944
02:26:22,596 --> 02:26:26,199
No, that's not true either, because if that be the case, there's been no communication.

1945
02:26:26,739 --> 02:26:27,720
This thing will strike that.

1946
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:28,981
I've got the floor, Paul, all right?

1947
02:26:29,582 --> 02:26:30,823
The superintendent was going to the floor.

1948
02:26:30,843 --> 02:26:33,446
No, Paul, I'm going to the floor.

1949
02:26:33,466 --> 02:26:34,647
Councilor Penta has the floor.

1950
02:26:34,667 --> 02:26:35,067
Pardon me, sir?

1951
02:26:35,107 --> 02:26:35,708
Say that again?

1952
02:26:35,768 --> 02:26:36,448
Say it again louder.

1953
02:26:36,488 --> 02:26:37,009
I didn't hear you.

1954
02:26:37,029 --> 02:26:38,290
Councilor Penta has the floor.

1955
02:26:40,867 --> 02:26:44,528
If you spoke up, maybe we could understand what's going on around here and you wouldn't be so rude.

1956
02:26:44,968 --> 02:26:45,348
Okay.

1957
02:26:45,908 --> 02:26:47,328
The fact of the matter is simply this.

1958
02:26:47,348 --> 02:26:49,689
These workers have been waiting for almost eight and a half years.

1959
02:26:50,549 --> 02:26:51,909
Can you please tell him to keep quiet?

1960
02:26:52,649 --> 02:26:53,950
Counselor, you have the floor.

1961
02:26:54,570 --> 02:26:55,550
We'll restrain ourselves.

1962
02:26:56,810 --> 02:26:58,291
This has been going on for eight and a half years.

1963
02:26:58,371 --> 02:27:00,391
It took place at the last budgetary hearing.

1964
02:27:00,751 --> 02:27:04,432
Superintendent Sunday was going to get back to us whether this took place last night or not.

1965
02:27:04,512 --> 02:27:04,952
I don't know.

1966
02:27:05,351 --> 02:27:06,331
Still waiting for an answer.

1967
02:27:06,832 --> 02:27:08,212
If it did, well, we could to school.

1968
02:27:08,232 --> 02:27:09,813
Can we, did they vote this last night?

1969
02:27:10,973 --> 02:27:11,794
They gave a 10% raise?

1970
02:27:11,874 --> 02:27:13,795
The gentleman may not speak from behind the rail.

1971
02:27:14,835 --> 02:27:15,115
Pardon me?

1972
02:27:18,077 --> 02:27:18,917
Can't ask them a question.

1973
02:27:18,937 --> 02:27:20,938
They're going to be your future colleagues in January.

1974
02:27:21,478 --> 02:27:26,000
Um, two of the colleagues who are going to be on this board next year just indicated that they got a pay raise.

1975
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:29,622
So with that being said, I accept their acknowledgement to that.

1976
02:27:30,042 --> 02:27:32,903
Um, they seem to be more creditable than anyone else around here tonight.

1977
02:27:33,377 --> 02:27:35,477
So I thank you for that information.

1978
02:27:43,099 --> 02:27:45,159
Chair recognizes Councilor Longo-Kern.

1979
02:27:45,219 --> 02:27:46,419
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1980
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:56,261
On this issue, at that time, we also brought up the discussion with regards to kindergarten aides and their $0.07 an hour raise and trying to look into that as well.

1981
02:27:56,541 --> 02:27:57,942
We know administrators were getting $0.07, $0.08, $0.09.

1982
02:27:59,898 --> 02:28:01,419
plus $1,000 raises.

1983
02:28:01,499 --> 02:28:07,702
So at our budget meetings in June, we did ask the superintendent to also look into kindergarten aides.

1984
02:28:08,403 --> 02:28:12,645
The other issue was that some kindergarten aides weren't allowed to work the full day.

1985
02:28:12,685 --> 02:28:16,187
Their hours were kept to, I believe, half a day.

1986
02:28:16,207 --> 02:28:24,751
So if we could maybe get an update on that with regards to the increase in more than $0.07 per hour.

1987
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:30,191
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1988
02:28:30,571 --> 02:28:36,513
So before we receive this and place it on file, I'd just like to say once again that the councilor was not correct.

1989
02:28:37,494 --> 02:28:37,834
Thank you.

1990
02:28:37,954 --> 02:28:39,135
On the motion of the councilor.

1991
02:28:41,736 --> 02:28:42,996
That's not what the resolution says.

1992
02:28:43,056 --> 02:28:44,017
The resolution says.

1993
02:28:44,037 --> 02:28:46,238
No, no, I'm talking about your dissertation.

1994
02:28:47,979 --> 02:28:51,740
Mr. President, are we going to be able to speak without being interrupted?

1995
02:28:52,180 --> 02:28:54,221
Are you going to rule them out of order?

1996
02:28:54,261 --> 02:28:54,561
Please.

1997
02:28:54,882 --> 02:28:57,503
Councilor, may I read the resolution again for clarity?

1998
02:28:57,523 --> 02:28:57,803
Read it, please.

1999
02:29:00,063 --> 02:29:01,444
15-792 offered by Councilor Penta.

2000
02:29:02,125 --> 02:29:09,790
Be it resolved that the matter of the school department cafeteria employees that was discussed at our budget meetings be reviewed.

2001
02:29:10,130 --> 02:29:11,711
And that's what we talked about being reviewed.

2002
02:29:11,751 --> 02:29:20,297
And as I realized until coming in here tonight and just a couple of minutes ago, nothing came across my desk telling me that they have been gotten their raise.

2003
02:29:20,618 --> 02:29:24,981
I just asked our two new colleagues coming on in January that they got their raise last night.

2004
02:29:25,341 --> 02:29:28,203
So I thank them for the information again for the second time.

2005
02:29:29,046 --> 02:29:29,426
Thank you.

2006
02:29:29,766 --> 02:29:30,167
Thank you.

2007
02:29:30,327 --> 02:29:34,009
On the motion of Councilor Penta that the paper be received and put it on file.

2008
02:29:34,109 --> 02:29:34,369
Yes.

2009
02:29:34,569 --> 02:29:35,470
All those in favor?

2010
02:29:35,490 --> 02:29:35,550
Aye.

2011
02:29:35,610 --> 02:29:37,551
No, I have it.

2012
02:29:37,571 --> 02:29:38,151
She amended it.

2013
02:29:38,532 --> 02:29:43,434
Oh, and your amendment was that the- Superintendent report back on the pay raises for kindergarten aides.

2014
02:29:44,355 --> 02:29:51,999
So that, then that will be the motion that the superintendent report back on the pay raises for kindergarten aides.

2015
02:29:54,421 --> 02:29:55,321
Are we going to vote on this?

2016
02:29:56,442 --> 02:29:56,702
May we?

2017
02:29:58,387 --> 02:29:59,067
Let's merge.

2018
02:29:59,528 --> 02:30:05,872
While we're discussing school issues, I just wanted to see if we could bring my motion under suspension up.

2019
02:30:06,572 --> 02:30:14,597
On the motion of Vice President Mango Kern to take this paper off the hands of the clerk.

2020
02:30:15,477 --> 02:30:16,298
All those in favor?

2021
02:30:16,318 --> 02:30:17,198
Aye.

2022
02:30:17,679 --> 02:30:18,499
All those opposed?

2023
02:30:18,619 --> 02:30:24,082
To merge it with the aforementioned revised motion of Councilor Penta.

2024
02:30:24,142 --> 02:30:24,943
Be it resolved.

2025
02:30:25,341 --> 02:30:40,750
that the Medford City Council be updated on with regard to the new PR position that was put into their budget as of last night's vote in executive session.

2026
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:41,831
Madam Vice President.

2027
02:30:42,411 --> 02:30:44,632
Thank you, President De La Russo.

2028
02:30:44,772 --> 02:30:52,557
It came to my attention about seven o'clock last night from a few people who were kind of upset about a possible new position.

2029
02:30:53,238 --> 02:30:55,319
I watched the school committee meeting for a while.

2030
02:30:55,399 --> 02:31:08,342
From what I understand, and I can be corrected if I'm wrong, in executive session, there was a vote to take place for a new position worth $85,000 with regards to PR within the schools.

2031
02:31:09,142 --> 02:31:12,343
This is something that was not on the agenda for the school committee.

2032
02:31:12,483 --> 02:31:17,884
I believe it was something that was thrown in front of them at the last hour.

2033
02:31:17,904 --> 02:31:21,885
I hear that it was sold pretty well, but at the same time,

2034
02:31:22,526 --> 02:31:24,688
We're, you know, we're going to have to discuss this in June.

2035
02:31:25,048 --> 02:31:29,952
The school department over ran by over a million last June.

2036
02:31:30,092 --> 02:31:33,035
So it's, it is relevant to the, to the city council.

2037
02:31:33,075 --> 02:31:39,480
It's relevant to our deliberations in June and what we'll have to vote on with regards to the city budget and the school budget.

2038
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,082
You know, people are upset.

2039
02:31:41,222 --> 02:31:43,183
Um, it sounds like it's a backroom.

2040
02:31:44,204 --> 02:31:47,247
The school committee heard them out and voted the way they did.

2041
02:31:47,705 --> 02:31:55,788
But my concern is more with the administration and how it was brought on and how it was, you know, kind of not on the agenda.

2042
02:31:55,848 --> 02:31:57,409
It was done in an executive session.

2043
02:31:57,489 --> 02:32:00,090
It all seemed a little sketchy, seems a little sketchy.

2044
02:32:00,190 --> 02:32:08,894
And people are, you know, there are people upset and people calling and putting this in my lap and asking me to, you know, ask the proper questions.

2045
02:32:08,974 --> 02:32:11,295
And I think that's something we need to know about.

2046
02:32:11,355 --> 02:32:12,856
It's very important.

2047
02:32:13,296 --> 02:32:13,896
I've spoke up.

2048
02:32:15,383 --> 02:32:27,732
A few months ago with regards to the five new positions that were implemented in the school system worth almost $100,000 each, that's half a million, and they were implemented within the last 18 months.

2049
02:32:27,752 --> 02:32:30,874
I believe the superintendent verified that.

2050
02:32:31,375 --> 02:32:39,781
That's money that we could be using to do other things within our schools or money that, do we need a PR person?

2051
02:32:39,801 --> 02:32:44,504
I think that's something that the city council should have been apprised of and definitely,

2052
02:32:46,709 --> 02:32:50,611
definitely where the administration was involved, we need to know more about.

2053
02:32:50,771 --> 02:32:55,593
So if we could have the superintendent report back, what is the job description?

2054
02:32:56,013 --> 02:32:57,614
What is the actual salary?

2055
02:32:58,294 --> 02:32:59,735
You know, what will this person do?

2056
02:32:59,755 --> 02:33:01,056
Who will they work under?

2057
02:33:01,676 --> 02:33:03,617
Where will their office be located?

2058
02:33:03,637 --> 02:33:12,801
And, you know, why is this position needed when we, you know, it's been discussed other things that we need, obviously, in the school.

2059
02:33:13,441 --> 02:33:14,422
I mentioned it before.

2060
02:33:15,258 --> 02:33:17,500
don't get much money for supplies.

2061
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:19,141
They pay for their own supplies.

2062
02:33:19,861 --> 02:33:25,505
Raises at the lower levels are minimal, if not at all, for years.

2063
02:33:25,525 --> 02:33:35,993
I just really would like some information on it, and as soon as possible before this position, whether or not they know who's going to go in there.

2064
02:33:36,013 --> 02:33:37,414
I do hear rumors.

2065
02:33:37,954 --> 02:33:41,217
But is this job going to go out to bid?

2066
02:33:41,637 --> 02:33:42,718
Will this be publicized?

2067
02:33:44,398 --> 02:33:48,142
Will anybody have a shot at it, or is this kind of a done deal?

2068
02:33:49,183 --> 02:33:49,563
Thank you.

2069
02:33:49,643 --> 02:33:50,805
So that's an amendment.

2070
02:33:51,185 --> 02:33:55,629
Mr. President, Penta's paper 15 792, which was a discussion.

2071
02:33:56,250 --> 02:34:01,876
And so that having been discussed, we've amended that to resolve asking the report back.

2072
02:34:02,685 --> 02:34:10,988
uh, from the superintendent of schools to give us an update on the salary increases for kindergarten needs.

2073
02:34:11,748 --> 02:34:27,053
And, uh, also for an update on the, uh, newly created, uh, position that we know of, uh, Mr. President, other means, Mr. President, Councilor Camuso.

2074
02:34:27,413 --> 02:34:28,314
Thank you, Mr. President.

2075
02:34:28,594 --> 02:34:31,995
Um, first of all, um, just a couple of minor corrections.

2076
02:34:32,357 --> 02:34:37,319
The school department has not ran on a deficit the last, I would say, at least five years, as long as I can remember.

2077
02:34:37,339 --> 02:34:39,840
We have Louise Miller here who can verify that.

2078
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:42,842
The councillor stated that a million dollars overrun last year.

2079
02:34:43,242 --> 02:34:48,204
We haven't bailed them out, I would say, since 2004 or 2005.

2080
02:34:48,264 --> 02:34:52,566
That's probably the last time that they had to be bailed out, and it was during tough economic times.

2081
02:34:53,386 --> 02:35:01,890
The second thing is, this was done actually in open session, because I saw the same point where the cafeteria workers were discussed, so that was not true as well.

2082
02:35:02,361 --> 02:35:11,545
The last thing is, I think the sketchy part of this whole thing is someone's talking about negotiation and legal matters out of executive session.

2083
02:35:11,605 --> 02:35:12,865
I mean, that should be investigated.

2084
02:35:13,185 --> 02:35:18,307
Obviously, the councillor has her ear to the ground and someone is reporting to her about executive session stuff.

2085
02:35:18,347 --> 02:35:25,730
Until that is approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting, the minutes and stuff, it's not something I think, I mean, that's the sketchy part of this whole thing.

2086
02:35:26,130 --> 02:35:29,892
So maybe we could ask the superintendent of schools to maybe look into that as well.

2087
02:35:30,677 --> 02:35:41,606
With that being said, I'm being facetious on that, but obviously there's a purpose for executive session, and that's for negotiation and legal matters.

2088
02:35:42,367 --> 02:35:53,396
And that's to discuss the pay raises, negotiation, legal matters, whether the teachers, the custodians, the secretaries get a contract.

2089
02:35:54,216 --> 02:35:58,299
So like I said, obviously there was a lot discussed last night.

2090
02:35:59,475 --> 02:36:05,819
in negotiation and legal matters, as it appeared to be after the fact when it was back in open session.

2091
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:09,001
So I just wanted to point those few things out.

2092
02:36:09,261 --> 02:36:13,163
The biggest thing was, though, that the school department has not been a million dollars in deficit.

2093
02:36:14,044 --> 02:36:19,047
I'm glad to see the two new counselors over there shaking their head, because they know the budget.

2094
02:36:19,247 --> 02:36:25,911
They've been around for quite some time, and that has not been overrun in at least, at least, I would say, six or seven years.

2095
02:36:25,971 --> 02:36:28,873
I don't want to go any further, because I know there was a rough patch where

2096
02:36:29,524 --> 02:36:30,365
We did have to bail them out.

2097
02:36:30,385 --> 02:36:31,987
I believe it was before Louise Milleville.

2098
02:36:32,627 --> 02:36:34,009
And Louise, you've been here how many years now?

2099
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:35,590
Four years now.

2100
02:36:36,031 --> 02:36:41,356
So, but I think that those few factual things I just wanted to point out.

2101
02:36:41,396 --> 02:36:42,617
Here's the other thing, last but not least.

2102
02:36:42,998 --> 02:36:52,267
I don't know much about the position, but a lot of people have been talking about we have to make the Medford Public Schools more attractable to people and stuff.

2103
02:36:53,396 --> 02:37:01,598
And if this is a public relations, it's going to get people back from charter schools, get people back from maybe Minuteman, from other schools that we're actually doing.

2104
02:37:01,898 --> 02:37:03,499
I mean, this position could pay for itself.

2105
02:37:04,039 --> 02:37:15,802
But like I said, as I have in all matters, since I've been on this city council, I do believe the school department and the school committee are tasked by the taxpayers.

2106
02:37:16,322 --> 02:37:20,003
And if it's something that they're saying they need, then I support it wholeheartedly.

2107
02:37:20,963 --> 02:37:21,723
Thank you, counselor.

2108
02:37:23,196 --> 02:37:25,839
Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

2109
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:26,781
Thank you.

2110
02:37:26,861 --> 02:37:28,503
Please state your name and address for the record.

2111
02:37:28,643 --> 02:37:28,923
Welcome.

2112
02:37:28,943 --> 02:37:31,527
Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street, and my blood pressure is going through the roof again.

2113
02:37:32,148 --> 02:37:35,272
This is unessential spending.

2114
02:37:36,213 --> 02:37:37,615
First of all, word of mouth.

2115
02:37:38,197 --> 02:37:48,619
If we have a technical high school that has awesome stuff in it, because we have a building fund that puts money into the building, the word of mouth is going to be, oh, man, Medford High has a great tech school.

2116
02:37:49,279 --> 02:37:50,179
That's going to be word of mouth.

2117
02:37:50,219 --> 02:37:52,140
I hire construction people.

2118
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:55,060
I hire plumbers and electricians from my house.

2119
02:37:55,661 --> 02:37:57,101
And word of mouth is the best.

2120
02:37:57,561 --> 02:37:59,481
Not the ads, not the fancy ads.

2121
02:37:59,521 --> 02:38:01,902
You talk to people and you say, did you use Mike?

2122
02:38:01,942 --> 02:38:02,482
How did he go?

2123
02:38:03,122 --> 02:38:03,662
That's what you do.

2124
02:38:04,102 --> 02:38:07,403
And when he gets reputation after reputation, then you go with Mike.

2125
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:08,660
It's that simple.

2126
02:38:09,461 --> 02:38:15,386
And so what I'm saying is, with all due respect, we're hiring a spin doctor for our schools.

2127
02:38:15,906 --> 02:38:16,646
That's what you're doing.

2128
02:38:16,687 --> 02:38:17,727
You're hiring a spin doctor.

2129
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:21,590
And you're going to put a spin, and you're going to try to put a nice package on something.

2130
02:38:21,970 --> 02:38:23,792
Well, let the package speak for itself.

2131
02:38:24,352 --> 02:38:24,552
OK?

2132
02:38:24,592 --> 02:38:26,694
This is an excessive amount of money.

2133
02:38:27,234 --> 02:38:32,238
And I mean, I pick on other issues, too, in the city of excessive spending.

2134
02:38:32,318 --> 02:38:37,302
And this is just one position that we do not need and should not be had.

2135
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:38,384
by the city.

2136
02:38:38,944 --> 02:38:41,505
And it has nothing to do with the quality of education.

2137
02:38:42,125 --> 02:38:44,046
And it's absolutely absurd.

2138
02:38:44,926 --> 02:38:46,847
So thank you for listening to me.

2139
02:38:47,327 --> 02:38:51,328
There's very few issues that get my blood up more than ridiculous spending.

2140
02:38:51,848 --> 02:38:58,550
So let's put a marquee on the theater and not hire this guy.

2141
02:38:58,730 --> 02:38:59,051
Thank you.

2142
02:38:59,351 --> 02:38:59,731
Thank you.

2143
02:39:00,151 --> 02:39:01,951
Chair recognizes Vice President Ludlow-Crank.

2144
02:39:02,572 --> 02:39:03,732
I think I'm good.

2145
02:39:03,812 --> 02:39:06,453
I just wanted to point, I didn't mean to say deficit.

2146
02:39:09,553 --> 02:39:12,994
The school department's budget was increased by over a million last year.

2147
02:39:13,154 --> 02:39:13,594
Increased.

2148
02:39:13,614 --> 02:39:16,995
It was not running a deficit, but I believe it was increased.

2149
02:39:17,455 --> 02:39:18,435
Yes.

2150
02:39:18,455 --> 02:39:18,435
2.2?

2151
02:39:18,475 --> 02:39:19,896
1.2?

2152
02:39:19,696 --> 02:39:19,896
Yeah.

2153
02:39:21,876 --> 02:39:23,497
Chair recognizes Councillor Camuso.

2154
02:39:23,757 --> 02:39:33,200
I would just hope that this doesn't have to do with other unions and union leadership that may be bucking up at the school system, whether the secretary's union wants this in

2155
02:39:33,906 --> 02:39:47,834
association or other unions, because that certainly could be a person of the general... I want to use my wording correctly.

2156
02:39:47,854 --> 02:39:55,999
A person of the general mind could think that this is the union issue, similar to the Teamsters that we just talked about a few minutes ago.

2157
02:39:56,619 --> 02:40:01,402
But with that being said, I just want to say if the school committee and the school department

2158
02:40:01,957 --> 02:40:03,698
I think it's needed, and I support them.

2159
02:40:03,718 --> 02:40:07,141
They were elected by the citizens of Medford, as were we.

2160
02:40:09,203 --> 02:40:09,984
Very good, Councilor.

2161
02:40:10,004 --> 02:40:11,885
So on the motion, Councilor Marks.

2162
02:40:12,926 --> 02:40:13,907
Thank you, Mr. President.

2163
02:40:14,868 --> 02:40:25,697
I, as one member of the Council, would be interested to see where this particular funding came from the budget that was established in July for the school department.

2164
02:40:26,437 --> 02:40:30,461
Secondly, we met with the superintendent two doors down.

2165
02:40:31,457 --> 02:40:33,658
We went over his budget, took us hours, Mr. President.

2166
02:40:33,698 --> 02:40:37,000
You were president and every member of this council was president.

2167
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:44,204
I don't remember one word uttered by the superintendent of schools saying he needed a position of this nature.

2168
02:40:45,785 --> 02:40:47,085
And that's fine.

2169
02:40:47,606 --> 02:40:58,832
All of a sudden, six months after the budget, two weeks before the mayor leaves office, they decide to put an $85,000 administrative position on the school side.

2170
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:08,282
And I can almost guarantee, and I will guarantee, Mr. President, there will not be a nationwide search.

2171
02:41:10,103 --> 02:41:14,564
That person will be found very close to this building.

2172
02:41:14,924 --> 02:41:17,445
That person may even work in this building right now.

2173
02:41:18,465 --> 02:41:25,887
And I can guarantee you, Mr. President, and I'm not privy to any inside information, but I can guarantee you, Mr. President, what's going to happen.

2174
02:41:26,488 --> 02:41:27,508
And I think it's a shame.

2175
02:41:28,194 --> 02:41:29,955
that it's going to go down this way, Mr. President.

2176
02:41:30,296 --> 02:41:30,836
I really do.

2177
02:41:30,876 --> 02:41:31,697
I think it's a shame.

2178
02:41:32,437 --> 02:41:42,525
You know, when we talk about education, it was already mentioned about the lack of supplies in the school system, the fact that our new schools, which are 15 years old, need millions of dollars in repair.

2179
02:41:43,126 --> 02:41:46,248
And, you know, we have sports teams that can't get uniforms.

2180
02:41:46,889 --> 02:41:50,071
And here we are creating another administrative position.

2181
02:41:50,491 --> 02:41:52,473
Yeah, it sounds great, Mr. President.

2182
02:41:53,854 --> 02:41:55,195
Am I talking too long, Mr. President?

2183
02:41:55,295 --> 02:41:56,656
No, I'm agreeing with you.

2184
02:41:59,266 --> 02:42:07,229
It sounds great with the position, Mr. President, but, you know, how many times has this council said we'd like to see another code enforcement officer?

2185
02:42:07,529 --> 02:42:17,412
How many times have we, like, mentioned about putting on — Councilor Pentland mentions all the time about new police cars every year, making sure we have three or four new police cars every year.

2186
02:42:18,112 --> 02:42:19,192
It never gets looked upon.

2187
02:42:19,533 --> 02:42:25,894
But all of a sudden, there's a need to place someone — because this administration is leaving — place them in another position.

2188
02:42:26,535 --> 02:42:26,935
Bango.

2189
02:42:27,864 --> 02:42:29,785
We found an $85,000 job.

2190
02:42:30,105 --> 02:42:31,586
Just happens to be what you're making now.

2191
02:42:31,907 --> 02:42:33,488
We'll just move you over, lateral move.

2192
02:42:34,308 --> 02:42:35,329
No one will be the wiser.

2193
02:42:35,769 --> 02:42:37,150
That's a shame, Mr. President.

2194
02:42:37,466 --> 02:42:38,426
It really is a shame.

2195
02:42:38,866 --> 02:42:42,568
And, you know, I'd like to know, maybe the school department budget is bloated.

2196
02:42:43,228 --> 02:43:02,834
If they can find $85,000, $90,000 like that at a whim, maybe it's bloated and maybe this council hasn't done their due diligence and their homework when it comes up for budget review to make sure we scrutinize that budget and make sure there's not hundreds of thousands of dollars left so they can play games with it, Mr. President.

2197
02:43:03,415 --> 02:43:04,895
That concerns me, Mr. President.

2198
02:43:05,155 --> 02:43:07,496
You know, we just had a security scare.

2199
02:43:07,716 --> 02:43:11,696
We had a woman walking around rubbing eight pocketbooks at the McGlynn School.

2200
02:43:12,377 --> 02:43:15,037
And then the school department came out, and good for them.

2201
02:43:15,097 --> 02:43:18,078
Now they're going to be passing out ID badges and so forth.

2202
02:43:18,458 --> 02:43:19,318
And I hope it works.

2203
02:43:19,958 --> 02:43:20,638
I hope it works.

2204
02:43:20,958 --> 02:43:24,019
But I don't think we need an $85,000 PR position.

2205
02:43:24,299 --> 02:43:31,961
I think we need 85,000 security people walking around our buildings, Mr. President, and making sure our kids are safe in those buildings.

2206
02:43:32,821 --> 02:43:39,164
and not a PR person that's going to sit in an administrative office and do nothing, Mr. President, because that's what's going to happen.

2207
02:43:40,024 --> 02:43:47,947
The only PR person that school system has had for the last 15 to 20 years has been a great PR person, and it's the superintendent of schools.

2208
02:43:48,228 --> 02:43:50,048
You can't find a better PR person.

2209
02:43:50,709 --> 02:43:52,649
You can't find a better PR person.

2210
02:43:53,390 --> 02:43:55,351
So, you know, it is what it is.

2211
02:43:55,791 --> 02:43:57,832
It's a shame that government has to work this way.

2212
02:43:58,212 --> 02:44:01,173
It's everything that I hate about government, Mr. President.

2213
02:44:01,585 --> 02:44:10,747
And it's a shame, a couple of weeks before this administration is leaving, that he's trying to create all these positions and these golden handshakes before he leaves.

2214
02:44:11,928 --> 02:44:17,529
Maybe the mayor should create his own business and hire these people to work for him.

2215
02:44:17,649 --> 02:44:24,431
Maybe the mayor should hire these people, Mr. President, and not put it on the back of the taxpayers in this community.

2216
02:44:25,291 --> 02:44:26,172
Thank you, Mr. President.

2217
02:44:31,062 --> 02:44:33,062
Thank you, Joseph Villion, 59 Garfield Ave.

2218
02:44:33,082 --> 02:44:34,463
I want to thank Councilor Marks.

2219
02:44:35,223 --> 02:44:35,963
Very accurate.

2220
02:44:36,663 --> 02:44:45,446
That October 30th robbery at the McGlynn School wasn't announced until November 3rd, strangely, two hours after the election.

2221
02:44:45,966 --> 02:44:46,606
That was very odd.

2222
02:44:46,646 --> 02:44:55,308
But the police sent out a press release last week about a woman getting on a school bus and

2223
02:44:56,565 --> 02:44:59,568
sitting down with the students and telling them that her baby had died.

2224
02:45:00,208 --> 02:45:04,431
Now, how can a school bus driver let someone come on a bus?

2225
02:45:05,252 --> 02:45:08,855
This is the second incident within a month or a month and a half.

2226
02:45:09,836 --> 02:45:11,597
So Councilor Marks is right.

2227
02:45:11,857 --> 02:45:19,063
That $85,000 must go to security because if we're going to have public access TV up at the high school, I certainly don't want a PR person.

2228
02:45:19,203 --> 02:45:21,445
I want a security team up there.

2229
02:45:22,045 --> 02:45:23,867
God knows what can happen up that dark alley.

2230
02:45:26,182 --> 02:45:29,944
On the motion of Vice President Lugo-Kern as amended, all those in favor?

2231
02:45:31,124 --> 02:45:32,565
Roll call vote has been requested.

2232
02:45:33,085 --> 02:45:34,306
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2233
02:45:43,350 --> 02:45:43,610
Yes.

2234
02:45:47,932 --> 02:45:49,493
That was the motion for the report.

2235
02:45:49,933 --> 02:45:55,256
That was the finished motion or the clarified motion of Councilor Penter, actually.

2236
02:46:02,044 --> 02:46:23,180
Yes Yes Yes with a vote of six in the affirmative one absent the motion embarrasses 15-7 39 offered by councillor Penta beat resolved that Medford residents Henri and Evelyn miller in be awarded a council citation for

2237
02:46:23,554 --> 02:46:30,719
for the continuing supporting work within the disability community within Medford and with surrounding communities.

2238
02:46:31,339 --> 02:46:43,168
Their efforts were most recently recognized at the November meeting of ARC, a nationally recognized organization that deals with the intellectual and physical disabilities of those less fortunate.

2239
02:46:43,768 --> 02:46:45,209
Counselor Penta.

2240
02:46:46,210 --> 02:46:50,893
Mr. President, Henry and his wife Evelyn have done a tremendous amount of work in this particular area.

2241
02:46:51,595 --> 02:46:53,276
and it's nice to see them get recognized.

2242
02:46:53,576 --> 02:46:56,497
These are the type of resolutions that belong before the council.

2243
02:46:56,537 --> 02:47:06,722
These are the type of acknowledgements of letting our people in the community know that folks such as this are doing this as works of humanity and for community awareness.

2244
02:47:07,763 --> 02:47:16,807
The ARC community recognizes folks such as Henry, the national, Henry and his wife, because it's just not in the city of Medford.

2245
02:47:16,827 --> 02:47:19,609
They go to other communities and they work with the intellectual

2246
02:47:20,730 --> 02:47:24,533
physical disabilities of people that just unfortunately just don't have it.

2247
02:47:25,133 --> 02:47:27,135
Um, they're very quiet unassuming folks.

2248
02:47:27,175 --> 02:47:29,877
They don't go out there and beat their chest and say, look at me.

2249
02:47:29,917 --> 02:47:32,679
They're just wonderful people who live here in the city of Medford.

2250
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:37,923
And I just think it's great to give them the acknowledgement that they deserve and for the work that they do.

2251
02:47:38,664 --> 02:47:38,984
Thank you.

2252
02:47:39,024 --> 02:47:39,405
Counselor.

2253
02:47:39,485 --> 02:47:40,265
Counselor.

2254
02:47:40,525 --> 02:47:41,226
Thank you, Mr. President.

2255
02:47:41,286 --> 02:47:43,788
I want to commend councilor Penta for putting his on it tonight.

2256
02:47:44,569 --> 02:47:46,290
Um, having a, uh,

2257
02:47:47,205 --> 02:47:50,747
a person in my own family that's intellectually and physically disabled.

2258
02:47:51,468 --> 02:47:58,652
I know the work that Henry and his wife have put in in helping these people with these type of problems.

2259
02:47:58,732 --> 02:48:05,236
And just this weekend, I was able to reach out to Henry for some assistance in helping a veteran over the weekend.

2260
02:48:05,676 --> 02:48:13,200
And again, I want to thank Henry and his wife for their good work and their continued success of their work.

2261
02:48:14,221 --> 02:48:16,102
Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

2262
02:48:17,173 --> 02:48:20,616
On the motion for approval by Councilor Penta, all those in, Councilor Marks.

2263
02:48:21,496 --> 02:48:22,437
Thank you, Mr. President.

2264
02:48:22,497 --> 02:48:25,019
I, too, want to thank Councilor Penta for putting this on.

2265
02:48:25,499 --> 02:48:41,231
I believe it was about six or eight months ago that Henry received another award, a statewide award, in this community for his work with the disability community and his outreach to not only Method, but many other surrounding communities.

2266
02:48:41,331 --> 02:48:46,015
And he really is a source of pride for every resident in this community.

2267
02:48:46,863 --> 02:49:00,647
I personally would like to thank him and Evelyn for their work on behalf of all the different segments of the disabled community throughout Method and throughout the state.

2268
02:49:01,207 --> 02:49:02,927
Very generous people.

2269
02:49:03,007 --> 02:49:03,848
Councillor Longo-Kurt.

2270
02:49:03,868 --> 02:49:05,008
Thank you, President De La Russo.

2271
02:49:05,148 --> 02:49:08,149
I want to just echo the comments of my colleagues.

2272
02:49:09,945 --> 02:49:17,449
a wonderful couple and they do so much for this community and statewide, so I just want to thank them for all their service.

2273
02:49:17,610 --> 02:49:19,331
It's done from the heart.

2274
02:49:19,391 --> 02:49:24,073
They don't do it for any other reason, but they're very good people.

2275
02:49:24,594 --> 02:49:24,994
Very good.

2276
02:49:25,974 --> 02:49:28,396
On the motion approved by Councillor Pantra, all those in favour?

2277
02:49:28,976 --> 02:49:29,617
All those opposed?

2278
02:49:29,677 --> 02:49:30,277
Motion carries.

2279
02:49:32,978 --> 02:49:38,866
Motion for suspension of the rules to take papers in the hand of the clerk, uh, offered by council, uh, Mongo Kern.

2280
02:49:38,906 --> 02:49:39,607
All those in favor.

2281
02:49:39,967 --> 02:49:40,668
All those opposed.

2282
02:49:41,008 --> 02:49:41,689
Motion carries.

2283
02:49:42,430 --> 02:49:47,557
Offered under suspension by Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford city council commend

2284
02:49:48,012 --> 02:49:50,593
congratulate and welcome home Jimmy Granara.

2285
02:49:50,993 --> 02:49:55,774
Jimmy finished off his tour of duty of eight years with the United States Air Force.

2286
02:49:56,254 --> 02:49:59,475
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

2287
02:49:59,935 --> 02:50:00,015
Aye.

2288
02:50:00,035 --> 02:50:00,735
All those opposed?

2289
02:50:01,096 --> 02:50:01,876
Motion carries.

2290
02:50:02,356 --> 02:50:14,919
And finally, offered by the entire membership of the Medford City Council, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer its sincere condolences to the family of Alfonso Alfreza on his recent passing.

2291
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:17,560
If I may, from the chair, state that

2292
02:50:18,443 --> 02:50:24,146
Mr. Fraser died yesterday or early this morning after an accident.

2293
02:50:25,026 --> 02:50:34,911
Al was the longtime managing editor of the Medford Daily Mercury when it was an engaged, active, and considerate newspaper in the community.

2294
02:50:35,792 --> 02:50:48,078
He served as a kingmaker in many ways for many of the young local athletes for generations, making sure that they were acknowledged for their athletic achievement and prowess and also for their good sportsmanship.

2295
02:50:48,767 --> 02:51:13,158
Al finished out his career after years in the newspaper by serving as chief of staff to longtime president of the, I'm sorry, speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, George Kaverian, and also served for several years as a legislative liaison for the Environmental Protection Agency.

2296
02:51:13,858 --> 02:51:18,300
Al was 89 years old, I think, and was a good man to this community.

2297
02:51:18,890 --> 02:51:21,732
So if you would all join me in rising for a moment of silence.

2298
02:51:22,172 --> 02:51:22,772
Councillor Pinto.

2299
02:51:23,333 --> 02:51:41,042
Al was the unassuming type of a fellow that, be it politics or sports, he was the guy, he was like the go-to guy to go to here in the city of Medford because in his early days when he worked at the Method Mercury, which happened to be the old Mystic Bakery location, he was an interesting fellow.

2300
02:51:41,102 --> 02:51:45,725
You could walk into there and you'd talk about sports and you'd talk about your local politics and you would,

2301
02:51:46,377 --> 02:51:47,819
And you get a pretty good answer.

2302
02:51:47,959 --> 02:51:49,381
And he was a pretty honest reporter.

2303
02:51:49,781 --> 02:51:52,044
And he was pretty fair in how he reported.

2304
02:51:52,644 --> 02:51:55,528
But the best part that I think about Al, he would always talk to you.

2305
02:51:56,429 --> 02:51:58,931
He always, in his opinion, really meant something.

2306
02:51:59,332 --> 02:52:05,719
And he was appreciative of the fact that you would take the time and either shake his hand or go to talk to him.

2307
02:52:06,265 --> 02:52:11,829
You know, he's the type of a staple here in the city of Medford that you don't see very often, you know.

2308
02:52:11,949 --> 02:52:13,990
And unfortunately, he's no longer with us.

2309
02:52:14,430 --> 02:52:20,114
But I would hope that his family and friends that did love him and did respect him understand that, you know, it's a part of your life.

2310
02:52:20,174 --> 02:52:21,195
It's a part of our city.

2311
02:52:21,755 --> 02:52:29,361
And as Council President DelaRusso alluded to, when he was writing for the Medford Mercury, he was a pretty fair guy, very hard to find in today's journalism.

2312
02:52:29,821 --> 02:52:32,863
And so with that being said, I think we'll take a moment of silence.

2313
02:52:36,269 --> 02:52:37,150
Thank you, Mr. President.

2314
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:41,333
I would be remissed if I didn't say a few words about this gentleman.

2315
02:52:42,014 --> 02:52:49,039
You know, when I came on the school committee scene back in 1999, I didn't really know Mr. Fresa.

2316
02:52:49,740 --> 02:53:01,850
But when I met him, he was one of those guys that you pick up the phone, you make sure you go see, like Paul Kavanaugh, Honorable Justice Adam Alden, and just a real, real nice guy.

2317
02:53:02,350 --> 02:53:04,772
I had the opportunity of getting close with Mr. Fresa

2318
02:53:05,317 --> 02:53:08,119
through my wife's uncle, Bob Mayorko.

2319
02:53:08,659 --> 02:53:24,529
And so for the past 10 or 12 years, serving with Uncle Bob here on the city council, I got pretty close with Mr. Frazer to the point where I'd have coffee on Sunday nights once in a while with him and Justice Kavanaugh down at Brigham's.

2320
02:53:24,589 --> 02:53:26,951
And just a real good guy, you know?

2321
02:53:27,471 --> 02:53:32,194
But when I got the call this morning, it's one of those things that you just didn't want to believe, you know?

2322
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:42,803
because just this past weekend he was out and about, stopping shop, doing his shopping with former President Mayocko and just a really good guy.

2323
02:53:44,023 --> 02:53:50,385
I'd also like to acknowledge, you know, Bob Mayocko was very, very good.

2324
02:53:51,278 --> 02:53:54,159
to Mr. Frazer, especially after he couldn't drive anymore and stuff.

2325
02:53:55,019 --> 02:53:55,859
Just a real gentleman.

2326
02:53:56,079 --> 02:54:01,701
I mean, you didn't see Al if you didn't see Paul Kavanaugh or Bob Mayorko on his arm.

2327
02:54:02,381 --> 02:54:07,143
So for that, I'm sure that the Frazer family is very appreciative.

2328
02:54:07,263 --> 02:54:13,385
Where Al's family, a lot of them were out of town, but he certainly had his Medford family.

2329
02:54:13,925 --> 02:54:19,326
And I know I'll miss him over at Bob and Cheryl's house on some of the holidays and things of that nature.

2330
02:54:19,386 --> 02:54:20,887
So may he rest in peace.

2331
02:54:23,445 --> 02:54:24,065
Thank you, Mr. President.

2332
02:54:24,085 --> 02:54:28,448
Again, I've known Mr. Fraser since I was a child.

2333
02:54:29,488 --> 02:54:33,350
Mr. Fraser was a very close friend of the Caraviello family for many, many years.

2334
02:54:33,450 --> 02:54:48,638
And not a day goes by that I, when I see him in Colleen's, I would always stop, have coffee with him, and just listen to the wisdom that he would give to me, myself, and just anyone who was there.

2335
02:54:49,098 --> 02:54:52,700
Again, same as Ben Everbrook.

2336
02:54:54,229 --> 02:54:58,334
While he counts, those type of men just aren't there anymore.

2337
02:54:59,135 --> 02:55:01,378
And he'll surely be missing this community.

2338
02:55:20,182 --> 02:55:24,964
The records of the meeting of December 1st, 2015 were passed to Counselor Caviello.

2339
02:55:25,524 --> 02:55:27,404
Counselor, have you had a chance to inspect the records?

2340
02:55:35,751 --> 02:55:56,405
So noted this meeting is held by the motion of council Caviello in memory of alfresco and also counselor recommends the approval of the meeting minutes Yes, so on the motion of approval of the minutes all those in favor all those opposed motion for adjourn by vice president Longo current all those in favor All those opposed.

2341
02:55:56,566 --> 02:55:56,866
Thank you
