    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=11.681s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=20.367s">May</a>  1st, 2023, our regular meeting at the Howard Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall via Zoom, and in person at six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=31.815s">You</a>  can watch by Zoom or on Medford Community Media, or you can call in by dialing 1305-224-9000. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=40.322s">You</a>  can enter meeting ID 945-8662-7148 when prompted. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=42.903s">Member</a>  Rousseau, if you could call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=52.987s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=54.587s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=56.048s">Member</a>  Hays? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=58.108s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=59.129s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=60.489s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=61.69s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=63.67s">Member</a>  Mustone is not here yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=68.3s">Member</a>  Rousseau, present. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=69.741s">Mayor</a>  Longo, present.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=71.102s">Six</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=72.522s">For</a>  now, please all rise to salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=74.483s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=86.429s">I</a>  don't believe we have any student representatives on tonight yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=96.518s">Okay,</a>  Mr. Bruno will be here shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=99.579s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=100.54s">We</a>  have number three good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=103.681s">Anybody</a>  have any comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=105.902s">Member</a>  Hays.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=109.504s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=110.244s">I</a>  did have a I guess a question for longer term members about a policy I came across as I was looking at some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=119.13s">the</a>  updated policies on mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=122.111s">There's</a>  a policy, JIB, Student Involvement and Decision Making, about having us meet with a student advisory council once every other month or some such thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=134.817s">And</a>  I didn't know if that ever existed or whether it's something we need to look into how we create this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=142.176s">I</a>  was hoping someone might know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=142.936s">Repeat</a>  what it is one more time, student. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=144.916s">It's</a>  called Student Involvement in Decision Making, and it says, as required by state law, the committee will meet at least once every other month while school is in session with its student advisory committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=157.599s">J-I-B.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=161.579s">Now,</a>  member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=163.58s">I</a>  have not heard of that previously, and I think it's a great idea, and I thank you for noticing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=170.761s">So</a>  I would <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=172.277s">obviously</a>  be, I don't think we need to make a motion if it's already in policy, but I would be wanting to ensure that we're doing that starting in September.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=184.022s">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=193.927s">The</a>  district has been meeting with students on a student advisory council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=197.468s">I</a>  just shared the <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=199.795s">definition</a>  roster with you first member Hays, and I'll share it with everybody else when I go back to my seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=204.677s">But</a>  we have about 25 to 30 members at the middle school level, which is not required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=208.879s">We</a>  have about 25 or so at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=212.901s">From</a>  that, we pull the rotating members, four or five, for the students who come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=221.485s">So</a>  most school committees have delegated to district leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=227.307s">And</a>  so we do meet and have conversations focused on student needs and helping them to be part of the decisions in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=237.449s">So</a>  I did just share the description with you and I'll share it with everybody else.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=241.351s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=243.291s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=244.811s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, if Member Hays is done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=249.144s">I</a>  guess I'm not clear on whether that well satisfies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=253.306s">Yes,</a>  I'm not sure when it says that it's required by law that the committee meets with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=257.828s">I</a>  guess I don't know historically, is that something that the committee decided sometime in the past that it would be the responsibility of the school administration to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=266.311s">And</a>  if so, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=267.912s">I</a>  just, I didn't know anything about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=270.093s">And</a>  so I was just curious if anyone had the history on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=276.235s">I'm</a>  point point information because member mobile phone is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=282.218s">Unless</a>  Dr. Edward was going to answer so I don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=287.866s">My</a>  answer was going to be that this to my knowledge, at least since I've been here the students did not meet with the school committee members I know that Dr. Cushing has been, but since there is a standing schedule in place, I don't see why it happens during the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=303.392s">So,</a>  depending on availability or flexibility I don't see why we can't extend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=309.614s">to</a>  school committee members, I'd have to go back and look at the policy, and I don't know if it's one member or if it should be a rotating member, but we definitely could add that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=322.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=323.283s">That</a>  was actually what I was going to suggest. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=325.284s">So</a>  thank you, Dr. Avey, that if we could have either rotating membership, or I don't think the students necessarily want seven school committee members coming into their meeting on an every other month basis, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=338.948s">know,</a>  a rotating visit would be really nice so that we can hear directly from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=344.25s">And</a>  I know that you this was really sort of implemented last year, a year before last, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=348.892s">Because</a>  I last year, last year, I think member Ruseau made a motion about two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=354.134s">And</a>  I could be off on my timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=357.576s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=359.056s">Member</a>  Graham, the member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=362.217s">I</a>  was just going to suggest that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=364.723s">As</a>  a committee, we should probably just revisit the policy and make sure that we still agree that it's the right policy for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=371.445s">Any</a>  delegation of that to the administration predates more than likely every person here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=376.947s">So</a>  I don't think we can assume we know what their intentions were or what the dynamics were, but I do think our students always have really valuable things to say, and I don't wanna like interrupt what is happening <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=392.699s">already,</a>  but I don't think that necessarily is the same as a collaboration with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=397.361s">So</a>  I think, you know, at some point we should put a resolution on to have the rules committee, take a look at that policy and figure out like, what do we recommend going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=404.803s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=406.304s">Member</a>  Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=407.384s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=407.764s">I'm</a>  actually reading the law right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=409.645s">Um,</a>  and actually member can not do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=411.225s">It</a>  must be the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=413.266s">And,</a>  um, I'm quite surprised by this language because how the full committee can have a publicly posted meeting with the student advisory council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=422.762s">which</a>  meets during the school day when we cannot meet as a body because we have jobs and other things that would prevent us from doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=431.251s">It's</a>  a very strange way that it's written that this whole body must meet with the student advisory council every other month. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=439.68s">So</a>  I don't know how we can get the student advisory council <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=443.837s">whether</a>  we do it as part of our regular meetings or as a meeting before our meetings, but it is not individual members, it is a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=455.627s">So</a>  I'll reach out to the association and ask how folks actually implement this, because while I certainly agree with the intent that's clear, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=465.991s">How</a>  does anybody get this done in practice, because we can't mandate the student advisor five members of the student advisory council come to our meetings, every other month. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=478.75s">We,</a>  by law, we cannot pay them to be here for their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=482.689s">which</a>  we talked about a couple of years ago when we were talking about student participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=487.756s">So,</a>  it's a very strange requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=493.122s">And</a>  I know that as far as the six years I've been here we've never done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=498.469s">And</a>  I'd like to thank member Hays for pointing it out, because never noticed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=505.254s">I'm</a>  quite curious how you came to know about this policy, or this law, which I mean the policy is literally just a copy of the law for the most part.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=516.182s">Yeah,</a>  I was just looking through some of the updated this wasn't an updated policy but in looking through. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=522.247s">the</a>  updated policies, trying to match the letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=525.409s">And</a>  I just, I happened to stumble upon this one, so I thought I'd bring it forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=530.611s">Well,</a>  I will certainly take it from the meeting to go to email MASC and look at other districts to see how or if, or how I just, you know, my head can't wrap around how we can do something this substantial every other month and drag a five student member body to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=552.236s">Does</a>  anybody else think that that seems like quite an exact a lot to require by law, that we will make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=560.364s">I</a>  mean, we can't compel. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=562.626s">We're</a>  not like the Congress that can like compel people to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=567.51s">But</a>  that's just very strange. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=570.033s">Thank</a>  you for bringing it up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=573.372s">Yeah,</a>  I appreciate members those willingness to check in with ma SC on this and see what other folks are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=579.614s">I</a>  would imagine, you know, wouldn't necessarily having to compel students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=583.855s">I</a>  would think that there's, you know, lots of students out there that want to talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=588.276s">I</a>  don't know that they want to do it in a public meeting per se, but obviously we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=592.377s">So</a>  I think we could make it potentially if it's not every other month, we could explore making it <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=597.093s">you</a>  know, something else after you get back from the MISC, but I envision it, you know, either an early, you know, before the regular meeting, you know, see, you know, Cal meeting or something like that, where we're having some pizza and some, you know, conversation with the students, which I think could really work out well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=613.839s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=614.179s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=617.44s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=619.581s">We</a>  have consent agenda bills and payrolls and minutes from the regular school committee meeting on April 10th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=626.187s">motion</a>  for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=626.948s">Motion</a>  to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=631.652s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=632.552s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=635.154s">Member</a>  Mustone is present. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=638.397s">You</a>  can mark her, Member Mustone, present, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=644.762s">Six</a>  in favor, one silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=646.844s">I</a>  know she's driving, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=650.046s">Reports</a>  of subcommittees, minutes from the Rules and Policy Subcommittee meeting on April 12, 2023 and <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=657.799s">rules</a>  and policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=659.06s">Members</a>  for self.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=662.343s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=662.903s">One</a>  moment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=672.651s">Um,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=673.832s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=674.593s">The</a>  rules and I'm just doing the minutes for the folks that we were just doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=678.896s">I'm</a>  sorry for the delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=680.257s">Um,</a>  so the rules and policy subcommittee met. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=684.389s">last</a>  week, was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=685.49s">I'm</a>  sorry, I forgot the dates.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=688.451s">25th.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=688.591s">25th,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=690.793s">And</a>  we had our attorney present and we went through all of his comments on the current version of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=698.377s">And</a>  I thought we had, we made good progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=702.879s">So</a>  as a result of the meeting, we've decided to pass the current draft version over to member Graham, vice chair Graham, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=715.185s">take</a>  a pass at making the document make sense, which I look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=723.69s">And</a>  we will schedule the next meeting, which will hopefully be the last meeting on this topic and subcommittee as soon as she's had a chance to go over the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=735.638s">I</a>  don't want to schedule it too soon, but my guess is by the end of May, this is May already, isn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=741.061s">By</a>  the end of May, we'll have the last <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=743.343s">another</a>  subcommittee meeting on that document, which we can hopefully approve and send to the full committee for consideration.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=753.251s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=754.892s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=756.913s">Yeah,</a>  as a member of the Rules, Policy and Equity subcommittee, I also wanted to just note that there were some items in the document that Attorney Greenspan was able to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=766.46s">And</a>  then there were some that were outside of his scope related to special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=772.242s">And</a>  we have a different law firm that represents the district regarding special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=779.243s">And</a>  so I had respectfully asked that the Director of Pupil Services reach out to the, to me, Cassian Lehane, and to just follow up on a couple of the items that needed legal consult as well, just because Attorney Greenspan, it was out of his scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=802.583s">So</a>  I just wanted to let members know that that will be part of the next conversation, I think, as well, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=809.428s">And</a>  Tumi Hassan-Lahin can get back to us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=812.111s">But</a>  just because there's so many nuances when it comes to legislation and other legal issues related to students with disabilities and other needs that I want to make sure that we're addressing, pressing our T's and dotting our I's in that capacity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=832.739s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=834.22s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=834.7s">So</a>  I think the motion is still in committee and the motion just to approve the minutes by member motion to approve the minutes McLaughlin seconded by second member Graham, all those in favor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=844.085s">I</a>  know you have to roll call because members don't as remote.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=853.03s">Oh,</a>  I did say I. Okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=855.871s">So</a>  we're gonna okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=859.713s">Roll</a>  call has been requested by member Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=861.596s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=862.457s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=864.318s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=865.539s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=867.22s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=868.981s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=870.883s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=871.983s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=872.464s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=874.125s">Yes,</a>  seven the affirmative zero the negatives, the minutes have passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=878.228s">We</a>  have minutes from evaluation subcommittee meeting on April 27 2023 pass that over to member Hays.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=886.069s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=886.67s">Yes,</a>  we met on April 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=889.632s">We</a>  went through. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=891.413s">Okay,</a>  so we had to, well, we just wanted to finish up both the form, the template that members will use to evaluate the superintendent and also to <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=910.777s">make</a>  sure that the instructions that we have that we will be sending along with the template were clear and included everything that was necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=920.166s">This</a>  has been passed out to the members before the meeting attached to the minutes that was passed out is the form itself or a copy of the form and a copy of the instructions and I think that it <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=937.482s">At</a>  this point, we needed members to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=941.265s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=942.726s">Approve</a>  the template. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=943.547s">We</a>  needed the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=950.011s">Was</a>  that the purpose at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=951.292s">I</a>  thought that was the end of our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=952.773s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=953.514s">Yeah,</a>  no, I guess, well, yeah, I guess I question this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=958.618s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=959.358s">You</a>  know, I, it was my impression that we were going to have this shared so people could <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=964.949s">look</a>  at it between now and the next meeting because it's a lot to look at in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=970.794s">And</a>  I wanted to also as a member of the committee with member Graham and member Hays, I wanted to thank the committee for their work on this and also member Hays' work on really sort of putting all of the documentation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=986.088s">And</a>  I think we have, if I'm not mistaken, one more meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=990.407s">between</a>  this and the next school committee meeting that we would, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=995.03s">We</a>  meet again on, well, we meet on the eighth for the superintendent's self-evaluation at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1000.794s">Originally,</a>  we had planned to present the template to members then, but so we're presenting it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1006.678s">So</a>  I suppose that would mean at the next meeting, members will have a chance to look at it and bring any questions or concerns they have so we can talk about it then.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1017.206s">motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1018.106s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1019.687s">For</a>  motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1020.527s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1021.847s">So,</a>  what we agreed to on Thursday was there needed to be a motion to approve this process and the templates today because next week is a committee of the whole and we cannot vote things in committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1036.751s">So,</a>  this needs to happen so that all the members can then fill out their <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1046.303s">on</a>  the, I believe it's like the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1047.904s">So</a>  we do, I thought it was on the agenda, but I don't see it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1052.586s">Yeah,</a>  there is a revised agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1054.748s">Just</a>  give me a moment to find the right version.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1060.451s">Yes,</a>  in the notes, it talked about approval of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1064.093s">So</a>  Member McLaughlin, did you make a motion to approve the minutes?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1068.495s">Motion</a>  to approve the minutes, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1072.017s">And</a>  also, yeah, we need a motion to approve the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1074.618s">So</a>  motion to approve the minutes, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1076.283s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1077.284s">Motion</a>  for approval of the minutes by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1081.647s">Roll</a>  call vote.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1110.915s">Differences</a>  from last year?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1113.557s">No,</a>  I know we all agreed on the sections that we'll be evaluating on, which are the last like four pages of this document, but is there anything that was discussed in your meeting specifically that we should be aware of? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1130.913s">before</a>  we take a motion tonight to approve the process?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1136.137s">On</a>  the form itself, there were no major changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1139.32s">I</a>  mean, we are using the DESE forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1141.281s">There</a>  really isn't room for huge changes to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1143.944s">We</a>  did fill in the superintendent's goals and we checked off and highlighted the specific focus indicators that we're using to evaluate the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1166.149s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1168.29s">In</a>  the packet attached to the minutes, there's a couple of things that I think will be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1172.032s">The</a>  timeline that we had previously agreed to did not change. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1175.635s">There</a>  is a step-by-step how to for members in the packet that talks about each step in the process that I think will be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1184.48s">The</a>  committee voted to use the DESI template. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1189.122s">So</a>  it will be delivered electronically, and everyone will be able to fill it out <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1194.648s">um</a>  according to the specific focus indicators that we had previously agreed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1198.611s">So,</a>  all that has happened is the the indicators we agreed on were laid into the template and highlighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1205.956s">Everyone</a>  will fill this individual PDF out and follow the process that is outlined step by step. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1213.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1213.662s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1214.763s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1216.424s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to reiterate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1218.045s">Yeah,</a>  what we're, I believe the motion is for tonight is to establish the process of <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1223.52s">sharing</a>  the template with you all and the instructions prior to the superintendent self-evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1229.882s">So</a>  that was really the process we're talking about.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1232.763s">Yes,</a>  it is on the amended agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1234.204s">Motion</a>  to approve superintendent evaluation template instructions and process for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1238.505s">So</a>  is there a motion on the floor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1240.386s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1241.266s">Motion</a>  to approve by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1247.408s">All</a>  those in favor, we will take another roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=1249.689s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2281.097s">So</a>  this is still just initial approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2283.059s">I</a>  haven't officially advertised waiting for the go ahead to be able to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2288.523s">So</a>  based on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2290.785s">We</a>  don't know yet, but we shall see hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2294.348s">So</a>  it is a little bit of a combination tour that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2300.613s">From</a>  North to South, kind of, but it's still unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2303.636s">We</a>  haven't done this exact route before. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2306.331s">You</a>  all have a copy of the itinerary? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2308.032s">Yes,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2310.454s">And</a>  the calendar did come out, so it does, these are the correct dates, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2315.717s">I</a>  just saw in the superintendent's email from last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2319.659s">Okay,</a>  so day one, depart, go to Venice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2322.601s">So</a>  it starts in Venice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2324.142s">We</a>  continue from Venice as we get on the coach, the ferry. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2329.392s">Nice</a>  bus, if you will, across the, where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2335.295s">Maybe</a>  to Verona, is Verona on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2337.496s">No,</a>  straight down to Bologna. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2339.137s">No,</a>  on the way from Venice, we're gonna stop in Bologna, an afternoon, see, but it's not gonna be an overnight peace in Bologna. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2347.101s">From</a>  there, we'll continue down to Florence. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2349.882s">Florence</a>  will be home base for two nights, at least, I believe, two nights, and then continuing on down to, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2372.89s">but</a>  in the past, we made a switch here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2376.212s">So</a>  in the past, we would stop in Rome and then continue further south, but we're going to go further south and then circle back up to Rome for the actual departure. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2386.007s">So</a>  this is where I was just messing up my stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2388.189s">From</a>  Florence, we're going to go straight past Rome down to near Naples, which is Sorrento. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2394.814s">Not</a>  actually in Napoli, but Sorrento, and stay there for two nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2399.418s">And</a>  then we'll go back up to Rome, which is where the main airports are, and we'll depart from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2406.624s">So</a>  that is <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2410.246s">a</a>  rough draft, I guess, of what I'm trying to articulate from this paper right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2416.729s">So</a>  the price itself varies depending on how many students actually do sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2423.052s">So</a>  you can see that there is a little chart here with the different price quotes based off of a group of, say, 40 to 45 students, people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2435.557s">The</a>  flight estimate included land suggestion or land <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2439.651s">estimate,</a>  the suggested supplement would be if anybody wanted to right, right away decide that they want to room individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2447.132s">So</a>  that would be an additional supplemental fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2450.033s">So</a>  depending on how many students we have, we're looking around what 3300 33 fish as a base price for the trip itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2465.135s">Gratuity</a>  as it's been in the past is an additional thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2467.676s">And</a>  that is <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2468.979s">usually</a>  collected in a cash form based off of, again, how many students are signed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2474.686s">So</a>  I don't know what that exact number would be at this moment, but it is probably $100 or something like that on top of this estimated price here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2488.715s">questions.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2491.498s">I</a>  just want assuming we're going to approve this mass that the, the, we have a form that has to be filled out before the trip actually happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2502.11s">I,</a>  it's been filled out many times in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2505.553s">I</a>  think you don't have the information at this point to fill it out, because it's usually like how many students, has the nurse signed off on everything, those forms, we do have to approve those before you take off, but certainly, I know that some forms were being redone over the past couple of months, perhaps, so I don't know, I haven't seen them yet, but from the last time that I did the paperwork myself,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2533.837s">I</a>  know that there were some different papers that Marine Island did use also recently for the trip to France.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2540.641s">Those</a>  are the ones, yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2541.561s">Those</a>  are the ones, all right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2542.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2543.062s">So</a>  I'd make a motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2544.503s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2545.884s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2548.885s">Roll</a>  call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2553.308s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2554.068s">Member</a>  Hays? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2554.848s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2557.39s">She</a>  stepped out for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2558.61s">She</a>  stepped out absent.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2560.251s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2561.292s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2561.832s">Member</a>  Mustone?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2563.053s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2564.246s">Remember</a>  so yes Maryland occur.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2566.928s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative one absent paper is approved.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2571.172s">Enjoy.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2571.832s">Yes,</a>  thank you enjoy the planning and say share but stay tuned. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2574.935s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2575.856s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2576.637s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2578.258s">We</a>  have report on high school and medford vocational technical high school safety security and school climate review, Mr. Michael Welch is here with us this evening administrative consultant to medical public schools, welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2596.038s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor, and thank you all for allowing me to come present my report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2600.4s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we have the technical aspects set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2605.062s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, if you want to be able to do it from there, I wasn't able to get in just now on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2609.443s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2611.564s">While</a>  we're sort of getting things ready from a standpoint of technology, I just want to thank the committee and all the members of the Medford public schools for allowing me the opportunity to come and create a, an opportunity to really comprehensively review Medford High School and vocational technical high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2633.672s">I</a>  assume all of you have seen the report that I presented, I created a very brief presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2639.397s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing, to be able to sort of summarize the different pieces the report is rather lengthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2645.942s">I</a>  wanted to make sure that all of you had an opportunity to see that in advance and <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2651.366s">I</a>  did get the opportunity to meet with a tremendous number of people and do a lot of work looking at trying to make sure I understood everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2659.409s">And</a>  if it's pleasing to the committee, I'll spend maybe 10 minutes reviewing different pieces and then we'll go right to questions because I know that the general public does not have a copy of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2670.112s">The</a>  only people who have seen it at this point are the superintendent and Mr. DeLayva, the high school principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2675.714s">I</a>  wanted to make sure that they could provide me with any corrections if I had any factual errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2681.136s">they</a>  did not make any changes to any content. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2683.577s">So</a>  I wanted to make sure that you all were able to see it as soon as that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2688.379s">So</a>  if we could, Dr. Cushing, to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2691.06s">Just</a>  a brief project overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2694.002s">Administratively,</a>  I was at the school from January 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2697.923s">In</a>  fact, prior to January 3rd, during the Christmas break, I was there for a couple of days just getting to know folks at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2704.646s">And</a>  concluded around March 17 there were a couple of additional meetings after that that I returned to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2711.313s">What</a>  happened was there were a number of people who specifically individually reached out to me over the course of doing the interviews and asked to either revisit a conversation or initiate one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2724.265s">There</a>  were 40 individual one hour interviews as all of you know, I met with each of you on the school committee as well as everyone in the district administration, the high school administration and all the K to 12 district directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2738.432s">In</a>  addition, I conducted faculty staff focus group interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2743.054s">Using</a>  educators from all the academic and career and technical and special education departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2748.415s">What</a>  I tried to do was make sure that everyone had an opportunity to provide input. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2752.816s">So</a>  those interviews were rather extensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2755.177s">In</a>  addition, I met with counselors building security secretaries and administrative assistants buildings and grounds athletics, a number of other groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2763.499s">in</a>  focus groups, so that they had the psychological safety to be able to speak honestly and openly with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2771.025s">And</a>  I think it's really critical that I was able to establish that confidence, so that people would speak openly and I believe that they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2779.571s">In</a>  addition, I did student focus groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2782.353s">The</a>  way I did this, as you may have read in the report, I asked Mr. Duleva to basically make me a substitute teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2789.678s">So</a>  when teachers were out, I essentially was doing what a substitute teacher would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2794.061s">I</a>  was assigned to, in some instances, five classes in an individual day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2799.164s">And</a>  I would go in and essentially be the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2802.506s">And</a>  the administration would additionally assign a teacher, as they typically would, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2808.188s">And</a>  I would take a portion of the class in some instances I took the whole class and let them know what I was doing had a conversation with them about what their experience was like and really had an opportunity to get to know all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2820.294s">The</a>  reason I did it that way is because it was a completely random sample students from ninth 10th 11th and 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2827.717s">from</a>  electives from lowest level classes to very high level classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2833.484s">It</a>  was really a fascinating experience and the kids were very open. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2836.687s">And</a>  in addition to that, I did individual interviews with English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2845.39s">Mr.</a>  Texera was able to nominate a bunch of kids to come and meet with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2850.533s">And</a>  those interviews were conducted with the assistance of an interpreter to make sure that we could get honest opinions from students in those instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2859.218s">And</a>  I believe we were able to successfully do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2863.18s">I</a>  could tell because the kids didn't wanna leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2865.381s">They</a>  asked if they could stay and continue to talk about their experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2870.151s">And</a>  again, I did some individual interviews via direct request, some folks that weren't necessarily directly associated with the high school but we're more of district wide positions I met with some of those folks to not wanting to have anyone feeling unheard. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2883.359s">And</a>  finally, I spent a tremendous amount of time in classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2888.582s">in</a>  the hallways, the cafeteria, the drop off and pick up line to make sure that I understood essentially everything that was going on in and around the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2896.468s">So</a>  it was in excess of, I want to say more than 33 school days that I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2903.373s">And</a>  then a lot of time spent revisiting some questions that I had as I was starting to do the write up portion of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2911.983s">So</a>  what I tried to do was use an analysis model framework that I hope you were able to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2919.145s">It's</a>  called the lipid Nostra model for managing complex change and I just being that it's on the screen right now I wanted to take a moment to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2927.848s">This</a>  is something that is used in educational circles quite a bit when looking at models for school wide improvement strategic planning, various aspects of change, and essentially consists of six different components that all need to be satisfactorily established. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2945.729s">In</a>  order for change to succeed, and this would be a good time for me to have my glasses on because the print is a little bit small for my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2954.781s">Some</a>  of you will correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2956.523s">So</a>  you can see across the top, there is vision consensus skills, a word I can't read. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2966.756s">You</a>  can see the words across the top, and in the absence of each of those categories, if one of those is absent you see the resulting deficit that could result. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2976.67s">If</a>  all six of these issues are addressed you typically would see some form of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2981.636s">If</a>  you are missing a vision, the resulting deficit would be confusion amongst faculty and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=2988.361s">If</a>  you are missing consensus, the result could be sabotage where people who don't feel that they're a part of the vision, simply trying either not to do it through benign neglect or actively try to sabotage the effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3002.911s">In</a>  addition, if you don't have the skills, you would end up with <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3008.286s">anxiety</a>  and fear about what potentially could happen if you are asked to do something you don't have the skills to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3018.088s">If</a>  you don't have the third category that I can't see, because the text is too small, you would end up with resistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3026.19s">And</a>  again, you can see each of the six categories, and I try to analyze all of the different pieces in my review, in essence, using that model framework as an analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3038.513s">If</a>  you could, Mr. Cushing, Dr. Cushing, to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3042.355s">So</a>  the different focus areas that I chose to look at after spending a little bit of time in the school were the categories that you see listed on this slide, the district and school organizational structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3053.377s">I</a>  wanted to make sure I fully understood both the staffing and the philosophy around the way that the school was structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3059.899s">In</a>  addition, I wanted to look at the leadership structure and all of the transitions that have occurred over the course of the last five to 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3068.481s">And</a>  you'll see that in a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3070.669s">In</a>  addition, I looked at specifically all of the DSEE data around enrollments and student achievement, as well as student-faculty demographics and trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3080.457s">I</a>  think that's a critical piece that is not unlike a lot of places in Massachusetts, particularly around the differences between the student demographics and the educator demographics, but I wanted to provide you with that analysis also. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3093.388s">I</a>  then looked at specifically the behavior and discipline referrals, specifically for the time I was in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3100.051s">So</a>  I believe it was about 33 days and I aggressively dug into the discipline statistics and provided you with that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3108.135s">I</a>  then looked carefully at the buildings and grounds, structure, security, and access to the building, as well as district and school policies, procedures, and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3120.021s">schedules,</a>  logistics, the collective bargaining negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3124.164s">I</a>  know that's been a difficult issue here in Medford, as it has been in a number of other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3130.208s">So</a>  looking at those contractual agreements and the potential constraints or advantages that those present, as well as some school committee policies, and then I provided overall recommendations at the conclusion of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3143.973s">Moving</a>  on to a couple of pieces that I would like to highlight without going through the 59 pages of the report as a whole here tonight publicly, I think a key piece that really is important to acknowledge are the leadership transitions that have happened over the course of the past seven or eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3161.606s">And</a>  I provided you with the slide that's on the screen right now, a grid that shows the different district level positions, as well as the high school specific positions <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3172.273s">And</a>  the transitions that have occurred in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3174.594s">And</a>  I think anyone can see that there have been a tremendous number of changes in the personnel, not to mention the coven pandemic that we can all talk about exacerbating some of this, but I think it's important to note that is there is only one single person who has remained consistent over the course of the eight years that are in that study. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3195.485s">that</a>  creates a tremendous amount of need for there to be a lot of conversation and teamwork so everyone's on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3203.616s">And</a>  that is almost impossible during a COVID pandemic when students are fully remote and then in hybrid format. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3211.607s">Next,</a>  I provided a brief snapshot of an original proposal for the consolidating emerging of Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3223.213s">I</a>  received this from Stacey Shulman. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3225.734s">She</a>  had found it when she was in the position that she is currently in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3230.796s">And</a>  I asked her if she had a copy of it electronically, she did not, but I found it to be very informative in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3238.36s">what</a>  the goals were when this process started way back in the 2013, around that time period, and what the ideal sequence would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3249.804s">So</a>  I only had a paper copy of this, and I went back to Stacy to see if we could dig up the actual electronic copy, we could not, but I thought it important <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3259.307s">that</a>  the committee see this and that we use it as a basis for what the vision was essentially back when Heidi Rick Riccio and john Perella were both the principal and director of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3272.32s">I</a>  then went into a lot about student demographics and. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3276.815s">if</a>  you can see, this is a sea of numbers, but you hopefully are able to see it a little bit better in the actual report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3284.26s">And</a>  essentially what I did was go back to 30 years ago when the Department of Education started requiring public schools to submit data around their student enrollments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3296.528s">And</a>  what I did was look at that not only as an enrollment history from in that 30 year period, but also the number of students in each of the grades as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3306.354s">the</a>  Curtis Tufts School and the vocational technical versus Medford High School breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3314.22s">So</a>  I thought that an interesting piece to provide historical perspective for all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3319.745s">The</a>  yellow diagonals represent the cohorts classes as they transition through the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3327.251s">And</a>  it's often convenient to look at the number of students who started out <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3331.154s">in</a>  kindergarten and first grade, and ultimately how many students ended up graduating as seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3337.635s">Next,</a>  I wanted to highlight for everyone some student demographic trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3342.256s">And</a>  I think this would not surprise any of you that are here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3346.357s">But</a>  again, there's been a significant amount of change in the demographics of the student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3353.719s">So</a>  what this chart shows is the percentage of students in each of these categories <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3359.66s">that</a>  are traditionally measured by the Department of Education, and I think it's important to point out a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3367.084s">First,</a>  the Department of Education has changed the way that they <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3372.128s">that</a>  they code individual students when they come in, what the options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3376.23s">So</a>  you can see that the population in Medford has diversified quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3381.333s">These</a>  are in about five year increments when you read from left to right going backward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3387.136s">And</a>  I wanted everybody to see exactly what the demographics of the student population look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3392.479s">You'll</a>  see some confusing information around <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3395.72s">ways</a>  to categorize students by income level. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3398.883s">And</a>  I think it's important to note that these were changes that occurred at the Department of Education, based on the way that kids families income could be classified for a while, the free and reduced lunch, where the numbers that were used. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3412.151s">Eventually,</a>  the department went to a category called <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3415.093s">economically</a>  disadvantaged, and you'll see that as one of the categories in 2017-18. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3420.995s">And</a>  finally, the Department of Education has reverted back to a low-income status. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3426.797s">So</a>  you'll see some changes in there, and I wanted to point out why that occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3430.918s">The</a>  thing that I really would like you to notice is the percentage of high-need students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3435.4s">High-need</a>  students are classified by the Department of Education in one of three categories, either students with disabilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3442.392s">students</a>  that are English learners or former English learners, and students who are low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3448.454s">So</a>  a student can be classified as high needs if they have any one of those characteristics. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3454.436s">If</a>  they have all three of them, they're still only counted as one high need student. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3458.337s">So</a>  I think it's important for folks on the committee to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3461.699s">It's</a>  really good to look at historically where the district has gone, because that can give you a sense of where the district is headed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3469.324s">Next,</a>  I want to contrast that with the demographics of the teacher force. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3474.748s">And</a>  again, I want to make sure that the committee knows this is not unique to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3480.492s">Having</a>  worked in a number of different districts, there are very few districts in Massachusetts whose demographics reflect even remotely close to the demographics of their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3490.078s">So</a>  I don't want you to beat yourselves up and think that we haven't done our work here, because there are virtually no districts that are successful at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3498.103s">As</a>  many of you are aware, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3499.624s">the</a>  Boston Public Schools has a mandate for the percentage of teachers of color, they have struggled to meet that mandate over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3508.994s">So</a>  I think it is important to point out the stark difference between the demographics of our teaching force and our student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3516.322s">I</a>  wish I could say that there were a solution here that could make this turnaround very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3522.088s">I</a>  know many districts are working in this area, but I think when you look at the numbers, there is a tremendous difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3529.575s">And</a>  I provided simply the data from 2007-8 and current most recent data that we have from 2021-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3539.104s">I</a>  didn't provide all of the other areas in between, because essentially there has been very little change in the demographics of the teaching force. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3547.461s">Next,</a>  I think it's important to recognize that the vision of having a more combined Medford high school and Medford vocational technical high school over the course of the past 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3559.127s">has</a>  created increasing student enrollment in the vocational technical edge of the house, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3566.392s">This</a>  graph was presented at a faculty meeting late last year, and it shows the increasing percentage of students only in grades 10 through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3575.357s">Now,</a>  this does not include ninth grade students, but the overall number of students that are progressing toward a career in technical education, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3585.223s">education.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3586.264s">So</a>  I wanted you to see that those numbers are increasing, and I believe students are recognizing the value in that form of additional training, yet that creates some challenges for the school because of the scheduling conflicts that come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3600.029s">And</a>  I won't go deeply into that tonight because I think the report does that a little better, but I think that's a critical area that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3609.778s">Next,</a>  I delved into discipline data, and I think it's important to recognize that what I did was look at every single discipline referral that came in from January 3rd to February 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3623.046s">And</a>  those numbers I broke down by the house that the student was in, because as you know, the high school is structured in houses M, H, and S. Each house has four grades, and about one third of the students <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3638.454s">And</a>  I think it's important to look at the total referrals that came in and the number of students that were involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3644.778s">So</a>  about 80% of kids had no referrals whatsoever, which is typical. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3650.622s">It's</a>  very frequent that the vast majority of kids are doing the right thing and really not causing any sorts of need to be addressed in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3660.769s">About</a>  20% of kids had one form of referral or another, and a very small percentage of kids had quite a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3668.635s">So</a>  that is not unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3670.477s">In</a>  addition, I provided a little snapshot your report has much more in depth analysis of what the referrals were for Dr cushion if you just click one more, it provides this is just the top 15 reasons why students were referred. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3686.357s">And</a>  I think it's very easy to see that the vast number of referrals for disciplinary action were for kids who simply were avoiding going to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3697.787s">And</a>  that is not a surprise, and again, not something that is unique to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3703.433s">In</a>  my conversations with other schools in the metropolitan Boston area, this has become a significant challenge across the state and the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3713.281s">So</a>  I don't want everyone to believe that this is completely unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3717.002s">However,</a>  it's very clear what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3719.923s">I</a>  believe this is a result of the pandemic and kids having the opportunity to not be told what to do for a significant chunk of time during a developmentally difficult period. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3729.785s">And</a>  now it's created a situation where kids who don't wanna go to a class they don't wanna go to, don't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3735.806s">And</a>  they figure out a way to try to avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3738.147s">And</a>  that's a challenge administratively to try to address those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3742.848s">Next,</a>  I'll just jump into recommendations and call it quits and answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3747.111s">Again,</a>  there are, I believe, 11 different recommendations that are in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3751.454s">Embedded</a>  within these are some multifaceted pieces along the way, but one of the most critical issues I believe the district and the high school specifically have to address is the collective bargaining agreements and the move toward a unified schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3765.905s">This</a>  was something that was mentioned in the initial vision for having some kind of collaboration between the two schools and it continues to be a challenge and it will continue to grow as a challenge as more students choose the vocational technical track. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3783.09s">The</a>  schedule, I'm sorry, the contract that was settled in December this year has within it some language that acknowledges the need to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3792.873s">So</a>  I think the time is right to aggressively pursue a schedule that is unified and it can be done that works for everyone in those two schools, but that's going to take some significant discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3806.546s">Next,</a>  I think it's critical that a clear district safety and security leadership team <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3811.491s">is</a>  established. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3812.652s">I</a>  know the superintendent and I have talked about this a good bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3815.134s">There</a>  have been groups that meet on a regular basis, but I think that needs to be expanded and codified in a way that is much more deliberate about the way the school and district prepare in any sort of safety or security event. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3831.277s">Number</a>  three is providing additional support for assistant principals in each house. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3836.023s">I</a>  think most members of the committee are aware there had been a staffing reduction in the not too recent past. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3841.73s">And</a>  with two of the three assistant principals new within the past three years, that has created just an overwhelming amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3850.28s">for</a>  them to be able to address, and it is simply unsustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3854.502s">So</a>  I believe there needs to be additional support in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3858.104s">Next,</a>  creating collaborative norms for student behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3861.285s">There</a>  was an overwhelming amount of feeling amongst educators and folks I met with that people aren't being listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3869.029s">Now,</a>  I believe a good bit of that is a result of the acrimonious contract negotiations that the district is just coming off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3875.652s">That</a>  is not unusual to see people feeling unheard <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3879.113s">particularly</a>  in the context of a contract negotiation year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3883.437s">However,</a>  I believe it's really important to come together and create those collaborative norms in a collaborative way so that everyone has consensus and everyone feels an ownership in acting those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3898.706s">Next,</a>  the fifth recommendation I made is creating a building wide associate principal role. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3905.369s">I</a>  know this is asking for additional staffing, but I believe that currently, Principal DeLava and a number of other folks are doing work that is not at the level of a leader's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3918.716s">For</a>  instance, the scheduling process is primarily scheduled by Mr. DeLeva himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3925.078s">Assignment</a>  of substitute teachers on a daily basis, that has been really problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3929.819s">There</a>  are a number of roles that have evaporated over time that I believe should be consolidated in one role. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3937.541s">Next,</a>  establishing a faculty homeroom advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3940.664s">Homeroom</a>  advisory is a great program that is recommended by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges as a part of an accreditation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3950.314s">However,</a>  right now it is a missed opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3953.517s">There's</a>  an opportunity to provide better training and better service for kids through the use of a collaborative committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3960.512s">Next,</a>  providing individual and collective mentoring for assistant principals and deans. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3965.754s">The</a>  dean position is a proposal I made that I believe could be very, very impactful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3971.296s">And</a>  some mentoring for those folks in those roles who in many instances have not been in that role for more than a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3979.839s">And</a>  during COVID, there was precious little opportunity to get on the same page about what those roles should do and communicate that well across the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3988.797s">Next,</a>  number eight, recruit, train, and hire four building-based permanent substitute teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=3993.96s">Over</a>  and over, teachers lamented that they are being pulled from their preparation time to cover classes for teachers who are absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4001.744s">While</a>  they were willing to do it, it is not their first choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4005.006s">And</a>  as we all know, the labor market is extremely tight, and it's very hard to find people to fill substitute teaching roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4012.991s">I</a>  believe the amount that the district is spending to cover those, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4017.393s">classes</a>  using current teachers and paying them for their prep would be more than enough to cover four positions of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4025.958s">I</a>  don't have those numbers for you in terms of what it's costing, but I think a review of that would validate my belief. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4034.244s">Finally,</a>  the last slide, leadership committee focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4039.445s">There</a>  are a number of folks within the school who are working valiantly trying to make sure that we are using culturally relevant teaching practices and supporting our students throughout the high school experience in a way that is more inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4057.188s">I</a>  believe that a formal committee around that work would be an important next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4062.918s">Number</a>  10 should come as a surprise to no one, aggressively pursuing an MSBA, Master School Building Authority core program grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4071.502s">The</a>  high school is not getting any younger and is a very, very large cabiners facility that is showing its age. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4081.007s">And</a>  there are a number of aspects that need one replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4084.009s">And</a>  I know the committee is aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4085.99s">I</a>  think continuing to aggressively pursue that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4088.951s">And</a>  finally, leveraging the existing administrative vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4092.552s">Over</a>  the course of my time in the school, it became clear to me, I became aware that there are a number of administrative vacancies that now are about to be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4102.635s">I</a>  think it's really important to get that next leadership team together and provide them the support that they need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4109.897s">And</a>  I provided one last slide with those administrative vacancies listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4113.858s">for</a>  the 2023-2024 school year as of, this is as of a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4119.223s">Prior</a>  to April break, I was traveling and during the break was not around. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4123.527s">So</a>  I think that explains a little bit of why this proposal is coming, this report is coming to at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4129.973s">And</a>  really, I'm not gonna speak anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4131.574s">That's</a>  probably more than 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4133.675s">And</a>  I'll go to the next slide, which is questions and next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4136.957s">And</a>  I'd be happy to answer any questions the committee has developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4140.66s">Again,</a>  I wanna thank the Medford Public Schools for being proactive and allowing me the opportunity to come and aggressively analyze its systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4153.127s">And</a>  I hope that this has been helpful to the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4156.029s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4156.93s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Welch. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4158.53s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4160.154s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4161.134s">It</a>  was a lot to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4163.015s">And</a>  I have an awful lot of sticky notes probably more than we have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4166.496s">I</a>  do have two corrections on page 51. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4168.356s">It</a>  says that we approved the resolution on October 14 2021 we actually approved it on October 14 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4177.219s">I</a>  have the minutes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4181.0s">And</a>  on page 52 it says October 2022 and it's actually October 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4188.2s">It's</a>  quite relevant that this committee, when we made changes to the discipline policy, put a very long runway to implementation, because we were not ignorant of the fact that we were making substantial changes and the district needed time to prepare. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4204.391s">So</a>  I think that having those dates be correct is really quite important. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4209.294s">But</a>  those are the two easiest things I'll have to say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4213.324s">If</a>  I may, Mr. Russo, thank you for that because part of my task was going in and looking at school committee policies that were relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4222.208s">And</a>  I may have simply misnumbered or misread some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4227.17s">And</a>  there were a couple pieces in there that I think were recommendations that the school committee is within your purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4233.594s">And</a>  I don't want to imply that there was not sufficient conversation in my conversations with Principal DeLeva. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4240.019s">He</a>  mentioned a number of opportunities for there to be input around those policies.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4244.383s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4245.103s">I</a>  think I did find the Google Doc that has the policy that a copy of which was probably given to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4252.229s">And</a>  it does say October 14, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4253.57s">It's</a>  just wrong.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4257.556s">Okay,</a>  so you didn't make that up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4259.699s">Okay,</a>  but I found the minutes and we did in fact approve it in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4262.561s">I</a>  was just confused because in the resolution it said, and in May of 2021 you'll bring your recommendations for any additional funding or anything that you need, which makes no sense that we would say to do that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4276.555s">So</a>  that's what confused me but anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4279.999s">So</a>  as for. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4282.523s">What</a>  to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4283.524s">I</a>  will tell you that this is my sixth year on the school committee, and I learned a lot about the high school from your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4291.349s">And</a>  I want to really thank you for that because my kids were not in high school when I first got on the school committee, and I didn't go to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4303.117s">So</a>  this is weird lens of a parent, a parent whose kid goes during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4308.621s">And</a>  while I can see an org chart, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4312.068s">really</a>  understanding how everything fits together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4315.07s">Your</a>  report does a fabulous job of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4318.972s">It's</a>  a little embarrassing that after six years, I'm learning this much about the high school, but I greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4324.474s">I</a>  did have, it's like how to approach this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4332.178s">I</a>  have too many sticky notes and there's a lot of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4334.62s">I</a>  do have two motions that I'll make because in your recommendations around policies, I thought both of those things <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4341.613s">really</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4343.994s">I</a>  was a little disappointed that there was a lot of confusion about the discipline policy as well as the dress code policy, considering every single school leader across the district was present for every single subcommittee meeting or committee of the whole we had on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4359.941s">And</a>  so when they literally are present and paying attention, we're on zoom, we all knew we were paying attention to have that message <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4370.683s">somehow</a>  missed really, it really bothers me a lot actually, that the people who sat in the meetings spoke on the topics themselves, somehow walked away and were unable to communicate to our teachers and the rest of the staff what the policy was, or communicated something different than what they in fact had heard and even spoken about. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4394.938s">So</a>  that part really, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4397.455s">disappoints</a>  me, I know that's a reality, and this is not the first time I'm hearing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4402.616s">And</a>  I don't think it's, I think it's really a disservice that the teaching staff and the rest of the staff didn't have that message coming down strong and firm as to what the policy was. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4415.42s">The</a>  issue of hats and hoods, the reason we actually brought the policy up was about hats and hoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4421.321s">We</a>  talked about hats and hoods to the point where I wanna just <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4425.416s">smacked</a>  my head into a wall about hats and hoods, and that anybody who works for Bedford Public Schools is confused about whether hats and hoods are allowed, is really very, very concerning about our ability to communicate to our staff what the policies are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4442.108s">We,</a>  as the school committee, are barred from communicating with the staff about what our policies are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4447.832s">That's</a>  against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4449.113s">I</a>  can't send an email to the teaching staff and say, here's the policy that we passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4454.076s">That's</a>  not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4456.138s">We</a>  passed the policy and the superintendent and her staff get that message out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4460.719s">And</a>  the message did not get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4462.659s">And</a>  I think it's really unfortunate that the teaching staff is sort of left to just wonder this description of piles of backpacks stacked outside of some teachers' classrooms and not others, that could be solved in an email in five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4484.617s">And</a>  here we are a year and a half after that policy went into effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4489.479s">So</a>  there was a lot in your email that was upsetting and that it was often very easy to solve, but still hasn't been solved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4499.383s">I'll</a>  let my colleagues have a chance cause I could go on all night, but thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4503.624s">Oh,</a>  the motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4505.465s">I'll</a>  make my motions cause I think they're totally non-controversial and I won't want to forget them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4511.709s">The</a>  first motion is that the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will provide recommendations for changes to the dress code policy that clarify the carrying of backpacks at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4520.637s">This</a>  recommendation will be returned to this body by June 30th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4526.682s">Yes,</a>  the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will provide recommendations for changes to the dress code policy that clarify the carrying of backpacks at Medford High School. <a

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4622.504s">Thank</a>  you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4628.371s">I</a>  also have a lot of questions and I'm trying to think about where to begin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4633.496s">I</a>  think one of the things that came out in your report was this idea that the assistant principals are overburdened in their caseload, and you go on to recommend some strategies to provide additional staff to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4655.642s">You</a>  also recommend an associate principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4658.384s">And</a>  I think within your report, you say that there's approximately three to 500 students for an administrator and that our assistant principals have 400 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4670.891s">And</a>  so I'm just, I'm trying to piece it all together because when I got to page 54, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4683.631s">M55,</a>  where you talked about some of the duties of a potential position for an associate principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4689.995s">I</a>  just was left wondering, what does the principal even do if all these other people are doing all these other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4696.239s">And</a>  we have a pile of department directors who I think really, at least in my mind, are responsible for some amount of instructional leadership within their own departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4707.846s">Like</a>  what does the org chart look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4712.276s">in</a>  its totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4714.177s">And</a>  I don't disagree per se with any independent thing that you suggested we explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4721.719s">But</a>  I think what I'm really looking for is a cohesive picture of what a successful Medford high school slash Medford public schools might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4731.281s">And</a>  that has to include all of the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4734.122s">It</a>  has to include all of the assistant principals and what their responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4738.323s">And</a>  we'll talk about job descriptions later and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4742.578s">it's</a>  not my sense there aren't enough adults in the building to do the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4747.519s">And</a>  maybe I'm completely wrong about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4750.34s">And</a>  it just didn't jump off the page at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4752.46s">Like</a>  what is the reconciliation of what all the things that you're recommending and how the total delivery of duties would parse out? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4762.382s">Or</a>  is there something else that is contributing to their workload that doesn't come across in those like caseload numbers?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4770.464s">I</a>  think I would respond by saying there are directors that are K through 12 in their responsibility that are primarily in the academic departments, and they have a district wide level of responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4784.713s">They</a>  are not involved in the student discipline and behavior end of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4789.856s">And</a>  that has, I think, many aspects of why the culture and climate is where it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4796.62s">responsibility</a>  falls on to those three individuals, primarily, I think the district has invested in additional social emotional support for students in the form of counselors and psychologists and social workers, and that has is laudable, but the first line of defense is always those assistant principals I think your question is a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4817.277s">How</a>  do we prioritize our resources and look to make that a comprehensive review, because right now the K through 12 directors primarily are not responsible for student discipline and student behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4831.611s">A</a>  couple of times I asked teachers, who do you go to when you need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4836.836s">If</a>  you're having trouble with classroom management, who do you go to, and teachers did not immediately say I go to my department head or my K through 12 director that was not typically the response I received it was, we go to the vice principal or the assistant principal I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4853.486s">And</a>  so I think there's some delegation of duties in there that could happen in the way that if I'm a new teacher, how do I deal with classroom management issues in my class? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4866.39s">And</a>  some of that must fall onto the teacher training, the mentoring program, and the responsibility of those K-12 directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4873.593s">But</a>  the teachers themselves, the ones that I spoke with, did not see that person as the one to go to in that instance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4880.615s">Yeah,</a>  and I can totally understand that because it's, I guess my thought is if you look at the role of the department heads, they're instructional leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4890.322s">And</a>  so by extension, the role of the assistant principal is much more narrow as an instructional leader so that they have time to adequately be the disciplinarians in the building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4903.17s">So</a>  I don't, I wouldn't expect anybody to go to their department head when they have a classroom management issue or a student issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4911.173s">But</a>  like the folks that are responsible for those things, I think, should have increased capacity if they're not carrying an instructional leadership role at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4921.797s">And</a>  that's like the bigger picture that I think we need to be clear about in what the responsibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4929.68s">And</a>  like I said, I was left reading after I read, I was like, well, what is the principal even do at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4934.301s">And</a>  I'm not to suggest we don't need a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4936.182s">We</a>  absolutely need a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4937.723s">But</a>  if we need a principal and we need an associate principal and we need an executive director at the Vogue and we need assistant principal at the Vogue and we need three assistant principals at the high school and we need deans of students in a part-time capacity to support them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4953.614s">Like,</a>  is that a typical amount of people administering essentially <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4962.028s">like</a>  discipline and overall school management for building of our size, it seemed like that's the question that's unanswered.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4969.996s">And</a>  I think I would, I would argue, in addition, your initial comment about why a teacher would not go to their department chair if they're having classroom management issues, I think that is a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4983.172s">of</a>  the department head director as overall instruction in a classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4988.474s">That's</a>  a critical piece that right now teachers, I don't believe see that person in that capacity, but they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4994.657s">That's</a>  an example of one way that this can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=4997.438s">For</a>  instance, I'm struggling with my, you know, period two geometry class there, they're misbehaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5004.221s">department</a>  chair, why don't you come in and look with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5007.022s">In</a>  addition, assistant principals are also evaluators for a huge number of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5013.683s">So</a>  the evaluation responsibility also falls onto the assistant principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5018.345s">And</a>  they're usually collaborating with the K through 12 directors in that capacity, but it is still an additional obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5025.266s">I</a>  would say yes, that the addition of deans <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5028.747s">is</a>  an additional resource that I think is critical given the current state of the number of discipline referrals that are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5037.615s">So</a>  I would say, yes, that is a generous staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5040.478s">I'm</a>  not disagreeing with you in that capacity, but I think given the current state of where the school is, I think it's appropriate to not have an under-resourced situation to make sure that stabilizes because some of this is a result of turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5055.191s">There</a>  has been significant turnover in those positions, and I think we've lost our sense of what is referral based when should I write a referral, what should I do in this instance, and there are some instances where teachers are filling out a tremendous number of referrals, more than one a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5071.993s">and</a>  the assistant principals are just completely overwhelmed with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5075.874s">And</a>  that frustration I think needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5078.195s">So</a>  I guess I'm saying, yes, I agree with you to an extent, but I think resourcing that part of the school right now is critical moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5086.198s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5086.638s">If</a>  I may piggyback on that member Graham, because I think you answered the question for the most part, but is that the staffing levels for other high schools or</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5100.379s">Is</a>  it an issue with the fact that we need to mentor we need to train we need to hold people accountable, we need to professionalize the organization, which one is it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5112.082s">I</a>  think it's both in the sense that all of those pieces that you just mentioned, clarifying roles, making sure there's good leadership around explaining what the role is of the assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5123.43s">When</a>  do you have a referral? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5124.491s">When</a>  do you not? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5125.091s">When</a>  do you deal with that on your own? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5126.932s">That</a>  aspect of things does need to be clarified and it needs to be a smooth, consistent message across the organization.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5136.099s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5138.08s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5139.631s">On</a>  the topic of referrals, I think the other thing that struck me was frankly how unmanageable this list of potential referral reasons is like there's like 17 different ways to call somebody cut in class and 17 is an exaggeration, but there were many and. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5157.981s">It</a>  just, it's way too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5160.844s">So</a>  I think that makes everybody's job harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5164.907s">But</a>  I was really struck by the fact that in, you know, in your 32 day period, 27% of teachers submitted no referrals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5177.556s">27%</a>  of teachers submitted one to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5180.839s">Over</a>  the like zero to nine referrals submitted in 30 days, that's 80% of our teaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5186.761s">So,</a>  and I guess my question in that group is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5191.028s">are</a>  they not submitting it because they gave up, or are they not submitting and they're just not doing it, which I have heard repeatedly, and it is so frustrating and something that needs to be addressed, or are they not doing it because they don't have these issues in their classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5208.621s">Like</a>  I can't parse that from this information, and I suspect you'd have to go back and talk to people, but I don't know if you had an overall like sense of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5219.917s">Where</a>  does that like fall line sort of draw?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5223.141s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5223.662s">I</a>  think all of those pieces that you mentioned are a part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5227.025s">There</a>  are some teachers who said, I don't bother filling out referrals anymore because I never know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5231.35s">And</a>  I don't, there's no consistency around the reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5234.694s">Other</a>  teachers do all of this work themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5237.637s">They</a>  make calls they stay they keep kids after school they talk to kids after class they speak with parents, they do a lot of that work on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5245.923s">And</a>  some decide that that's a more effective way to do it, depending upon the type of class and the age of the student, there are some classes that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5253.829s">teachers</a>  workloads are simply not in a situation where they're struggling, that the kids are, by and large, able to much more aptly go through their day without creating issues there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5265.704s">The</a>  kids were very honest with me, they said when they don't like going to class they don't necessarily like the teachers they don't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5272.532s">And</a>  I said, I did say to groups of students, suppose all of you next period, after we finish our, I'm your substitute teacher and I'm having this conversation with you, suppose all of you didn't go to class the rest of the day, what would happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5286.098s">and</a>  they had all different answers as to what could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5290.562s">And</a>  some of them admitted, yeah, there are classes I don't go to, because I don't like the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5294.425s">Where</a>  do you go? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5295.266s">Well,</a>  I go wherever I can, where there's not an adult, and I can find a place to hide. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5300.15s">And</a>  the response to that in some instances, yeah, the assistant principal got on top of it, called me down, called my parents, had a meeting, and that's the way it should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5309.298s">The</a>  volume is such that it's just not possible.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5313.906s">Yeah,</a>  and I have heard that, you know, from a whole variety of sources, and I hope that we can move to a place where not liking a class or a teacher is not a thing our kids have to experience in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5332.452s">But,</a>  you know, I guess the other thing that I'll say as I read this and really your entire report is that the failures that we're experiencing are all <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5343.755s">implementation</a>  failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5345.196s">They're</a>  all failures of implementation, the dress code, the house model, student discipline, the referral model being wildly complex, returning to school post COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5354.9s">I</a>  can't tell you how many times I've heard people say the school committee wouldn't let us discipline students on the return to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5362.823s">And</a>  we've had a lot of hours of meetings and I don't ever, I really, truly don't ever remember that being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5371.184s">And</a>  certainly there is nothing in writing to substantiate that, that I was able to find because I did a little bit of digging, but even, you know, emergency preparedness, all these things, something is missing in terms of how directives get implemented or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5391.43s">And</a>  it is the central thing that has to change at the high school in order to move the high school past where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5399.792s">The</a>  dress code, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5401.004s">was</a>  not unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5402.605s">The</a>  dress code was quite clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5405.046s">Everybody</a>  was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5408.988s">Many,</a>  many meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5410.328s">We</a>  talked extensively about hats and hoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5413.59s">That</a>  there's any confusion is absolutely mind blowing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5418.572s">And</a>  so the only answer there is that the implementation failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5424.014s">That</a>  there's this confusion that the handbook says something that is in conflict with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5427.956s">Like,</a>  these are the kinds of things that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5430.543s">You</a>  know they, I think they seem small at the time but they're really, really important when you want to sort of move six or eight or 12 months down the road from a change and say did it work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5444.671s">The</a>  answer will always be no if you don't take the time to implement without exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5452.217s">And</a>  the last thing I'll say is I actually enjoyed the picture of your model and the consequence of lacking various components. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5461.444s">And</a>  I think if you use that model and you look at any of the challenges we have, you can really clearly point out what was missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5473.573s">It</a>  is not a surprise that we're struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5475.595s">So</a>  I do thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5478.877s">And</a>  I am, I just finished serving on the principal selection committee and I'm really hopeful about our candidates for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5487.745s">And</a>  I'm entirely on board with making sure that that incoming principal has the resources that they need to really make a difference here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5498.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5500.876s">Member</a>  Hays and member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5503.442s">And</a>  then member grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5504.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5505.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5507.104s">One</a>  of the things I really appreciated about your report and member so kind of already spoke to some of this was the history you gave because I certainly did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5516.65s">I</a>  have new bits and pieces of the history and, but having it all put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5522.433s">really</a>  helped a lot to provide some context to some of the issues that we're having, because they're not just based on what's happening right now or even in the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5532.798s">There's</a>  a lot of history behind all of that that leads us to where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5538.521s">And</a>  one of the things that struck me a lot was the turnover, the amazing turnover in the various administrative positions, because it's very hard to implement or to get <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5551.01s">anything</a>  to stick if you don't have some consistency in those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5556.451s">And</a>  so I'm wondering, did you have a sense, well, two questions I'm wondering, and one of them may not be exactly for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5563.393s">One,</a>  do we do exit interviews when people leave so we can have a sense of, is there some pattern, something we can understand to why we seem to have so much turnover? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5574.895s">Did</a>  you get a sense from any of the people you talked to who maybe knew some of these people <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5579.631s">was</a>  there any sense of why we seem to have so much turnover? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5582.653s">And</a>  I guess in your experience, is that amount of turnover typical? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5586.476s">I</a>  know there's a lot of administrative turnover at all levels of K to 12 education, but that just feels like so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5594.782s">And</a>  when you think of the things that we haven't been able to get done, so much of that, when you've got people who are new to the system, and then also some, I think you mentioned some of these people maybe were just even new to that particular position. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5609.941s">anywhere.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5610.842s">So</a>  it's hard to get much traction for things if people are new and just trying to get their bearings and then a couple years later they're gone and somebody new is trying to get their bearings and did you have any sense of what that why that turnover was happening if there was any pattern to that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5627.563s">So</a>  typically, just to briefly answer that, I think you're looking at instances where folks are making lateral moves, where they're staying in the same position and simply moving to another district. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5637.829s">I</a>  didn't see that occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5640.21s">In</a>  many instances, I think going back to the previous superintendent's administration, Mr. Belson, there had been such a long period of stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5650.971s">When</a>  that happens, everyone gets used to that because there's familiarity with the individual or individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5657.233s">And</a>  I think there had been a long stretch of tremendous stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5661.814s">And</a>  when you start a little bit of turnover, the whole thing shifts, all of the pieces shift and reconnect and realign. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5671.136s">And</a>  I think there has been a succession of those instances that I think it's more than typical <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5678.298s">for</a>  a district like Medford and Medford size, but there is this is an era right now have a lot of instability and a lot of districts, there's a lot of people who are choosing to exit the profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5690.425s">I</a>  teach in a program that recruits teachers to become administrators and people don't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5697.614s">It's</a>  a hard time to be moving in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5700.698s">So</a>  I would say Medford has had more than its share of transitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5705.324s">I</a>  have not seen people fleeing because they were unhappy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5708.408s">That</a>  was not a part of what I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5710.531s">And</a>  I think there are so many people who are so committed to staying in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5715.677s">I</a>  saw that repeatedly amongst the educators, as well as the support staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5720.098s">They</a>  love working here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5721.919s">Some</a>  of them have had a difficult stretch, like everyone has in education over the course of the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5727.06s">It's</a>  been hard, but there has been, Medford has had more of its share of turnover in strategic positions where there had been a long period of stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5738.163s">And</a>  I think because of that, it's a bit more of a shock for this district than in typical situations.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5749.88s">So</a>  I've already requested this information from administration, but I'm curious whether you looked at it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5756.884s">The</a>  discipline data or the referral, the chart that you have from the period that you were here from January 3rd to February 17th, I think was the stretch of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5768.09s">That,</a>  of course, period of time is right after the new procedures were put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5773.433s">I'm</a>  curious, did you look at all <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5776.536s">back</a>  before those procedures were put in place to see how the data, was it comparable, did anything shift with the new procedures that you noticed? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5787.144s">I</a>  don't know if you did that or not.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5789.354s">Yes,</a>  and the kids told me it is so much tighter during that stretch than it was prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5796.919s">And</a>  the data bears that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5799.201s">And</a>  I think the resources that were devoted to this in terms of mere supervision of the common areas of the building, there was significantly more resources put in place during that stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5810.789s">And</a>  that really pushed kids back into classrooms in a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5816.072s">they</a>  had previously been able to get away with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5819.334s">And</a>  they admitted that to me, they had seen so much more tightness that had occurred in a good way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5825.638s">And</a>  again, I don't think that, I don't have a good sense of exactly the referral frequency prior to this stretch, because I really didn't study that, but a quick glance at it would say to me that anecdotally, it is far less than it had been.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5846.462s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and Member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5850.784s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5851.144s">I</a>  thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5853.725s">I</a>  also appreciate coming from the education world, the framework and framing systemic change. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5860.709s">And</a>  I think that we all know that systems level change is painful and difficult and arduous and time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5868.412s">And</a>  I think that, you know, putting in perspective as well, as you said, the long term of <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5874.679s">stability</a>  with the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5877.16s">So</a>  the fact that we have, you know, new administration turnover central administration turnover as a whole, really, and also a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5886.845s">In</a>  the past couple of years, I think that it says a lot as well as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5892.368s">I</a>  think that it's important to also put things in context in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5896.71s">Because</a>  I think that we all know there's a lot of work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5899.392s">But</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5900.222s">we</a>  also need to sort of look at it in terms of perspective as to in terms of what else has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5905.546s">And,</a>  and, and thinking about how change actually happens, and how it needs to happen over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5911.311s">And</a>  I think we also know, both with the frameworks that are used, that if you do change too quickly, you know what can happen, right, and that things can really sort of blow up as well, which is part of what I think we're seeing around having <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5927.243s">such</a>  turnover and you know all of this churning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5930.665s">But</a>  a couple of questions so I appreciate the frameworks and I and I say that just because there are other frameworks that talk about change and you know the systems change and how, what, what can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5941.111s">As</a>  you know, so I wanted to ask about just a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5945.813s">One</a>  was, did you also happen to interview or include <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5951.229s">the</a>  annex to the high school, the Curtis Tufts, which has, you know, a long history of, you know, maybe some students who have been marginalized or for various reasons and staff that could really share some of their experience.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5965.558s">I</a>  did not personally interview the folks at the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5969.1s">However,</a>  I did speak at length with the previous director of the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5977.366s">I'm</a>  trying to remember of the hundreds of people, I wanna say Doug Bowen Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5981.787s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5985.569s">Craig,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=5987.129s">I</a>  spoke at length with him specifically about that issue and how that school has changed over time and the target population and the experiences he had, but I did not visit the school and talk with the staff there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6000.955s">However,</a>  we did have an extensive conversation about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6004.837s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6005.997s">And</a>  I just think it's, you know, I think some of those students and families there probably have experienced <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6010.788s">very</a>  directly some of the policies and procedures that have been in place and I think it could be interesting and I appreciate Mr. Jarski sharing his perspective with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6018.792s">I'm</a>  sure it was valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6021.354s">And</a>  to that end, I'm wondering about, I did want to say I appreciate you mentoring the mentor program. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6028.798s">I</a>  think that, you know, across the board, mentor programs are so essential and <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6034.85s">Having</a>  worked with the committee on education at the state level and really reviewing mentor programs and schools, knowing that you know if folks feel like they really have people to rely on in terms of the mentor program, then that is one of the ways that they're able to, especially new teachers feel like their belonging so I appreciate you mentioning that and I think it's an important piece to consider and I also really appreciate your mention of the need for building based subs I think that I've heard that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6059.528s">more</a>  from families than anything in terms of, particularly from families whose children may fit the high needs categories and who are not having necessarily staffing there that might've been appropriate in terms of, you know, building base subs who can actually get to know students and also the cost analysis compared to what you were saying, I think is really critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6083.706s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6085.106s">And</a>  then I wanted to ask you about the leadership committee on DEI, and if you had talked to any of the folks about sort of what had existed and sort of didn't exist after a little while, basically last year, as far as a DEI committee.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6104.767s">It</a>  was not something that came up in my conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6108.108s">So</a>  the fact that it wasn't mentioned by folks in a comprehensive way to me said that it wasn't a priority that was being recognized across the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6118.811s">Now</a>  I say that knowing that there are individuals who are very committed to this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6124.873s">and</a>  a number of teachers individually talked about their efforts along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6129.155s">I</a>  didn't see in any conversations that I had or in any references, people seeing that as a huge priority or any sort of formal training that was being conducted for teachers, or the sort of efforts that I think are all districts are now in the need for this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6146.866s">Some</a>  districts have hired an individual to champion this work, and that has not always met with success. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6152.771s">In</a>  other instances, it is seen as an add-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6155.913s">Now,</a>  quote, they want us to do this too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6158.595s">It</a>  can't be presented that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6159.916s">It</a>  needs to be embedded in everything that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6163.019s">So</a>  there's a tremendous amount of training that needs to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6167.182s">and</a>  someone needs to coordinate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6169.284s">So</a>  how that ends up moving forward is not exactly clear to many districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6176.028s">There</a>  are different ways that people are approaching this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6178.53s">And</a>  I don't see any sort of gold standard of way to set it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6183.573s">I've</a>  seen instances where it has made some inroads, looking at recruiting a more diverse staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6190.718s">Every</a>  district in Massachusetts is trying to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6193.32s">And</a>  it is not easy to do because the teaching pool right now is simply not <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6197.382s">deep,</a>  and it is not diverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6199.923s">Secondarily,</a>  simply providing training to those who we currently have and are going to continue to be in the district for many years, coordinating that, doing it in a way that enlists an outside provider, perhaps it might be the way to go, because I've seen different districts try to do it with an individual appointed in that role, and that tends to not be as successful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6220.919s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6221.519s">I</a>  was asking the question because we did have a committee that was appointed that was community members, school-based members and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6228.344s">And</a>  it's sort of, it's unclear to me what happened to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6233.127s">And</a>  it, you know, I know that it sort of fell apart, I think a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6236.73s">And</a>  I think those people would have valuable input as to why that fell apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6242.153s">I</a>  think it was well-intentioned and I'm sure there are a lot of people in the district that really do wanna do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6247.197s">But</a>  I think that there's a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6249.562s">after</a>  review that could be done with that committee or that no longer committee, however you want to look at it, that could really inform that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6258.391s">So</a>  I think it's interesting that you didn't know that there was one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6261.053s">So</a>  that speaks volumes to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6264.697s">And</a>  then I also would want to know about how in the report family engagement was considered.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6273.089s">Originally,</a>  the original charge was to have parent engagement too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6277.251s">And</a>  at the time, as I started moving down that path and speaking with Megan Fidler-Carey, I believe there was a goal of having a survey that would go to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6287.495s">So</a>  I backed off from individually looking at individual parent interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6292.797s">So</a>  that was the reason I moved away from that, knowing that at the time that I know the district was looking to try to engage in a survey tool to be providing to parents.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6306.616s">Thank</a>  you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6307.796s">Member</a>  Kratz?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6309.977s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6310.438s">Thank</a>  you very much for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6312.598s">And</a>  I thought it was great that you were substituting in the classrooms when you just mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6316.64s">That's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6318.481s">Yeah,</a>  so I thought it was interesting because going over the history of the high school and the vocational school, I've been on the robotics engineering advisory committee, and I've heard, and my son has told me, for many, many years, there's been discussions about <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6336.038s">the</a>  two schedules, how the five day and the six day, and it's such a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6342.082s">And</a>  I've heard from students that were in my advisory committee that it's so frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6348.968s">Some</a>  students couldn't take a foreign language. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6351.069s">I</a>  know my son didn't take a foreign language because the schedules were too restricted. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6355.913s">There</a>  wasn't enough room in their schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6358.414s">So</a>  it's interesting that you discovered this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6361.906s">You</a>  know, it is something that is contractual that, you know, we're working on or that's going to be worked on, you know, as another task coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6370.512s">I</a>  mean, it's going to be, you know, I think challenging, but I think at the end result, it will, you know, open up the schedule so that there'll be more opportunities for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6381.459s">And</a>  I was just wondering if you had the opportunity to talk to any of the students, you know, did they share any of their experiences or, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6389.85s">anything</a>  with you, if you could share some of that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6391.871s">Oh</a>  yeah, very much so. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6393.372s">And</a>  I would also piggyback on the statements that you made about the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6398.295s">I</a>  heard a lot from special educators about the difficulty with trying to make sure that all students were able to get their needed services, particularly if they were following the week on week off schedule in the vocational realm. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6414.271s">So</a>  they express frustration trying to make that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6417.373s">And</a>  the world language piece is well documented that that's been challenging to be able to allow kids to have all those options. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6423.676s">And</a>  I also heard from the career and technical education teachers that they wanted more time with their students, if you will, particularly around advisories and around the 900 hour requirement in their core areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6440.086s">So</a>  that was challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6441.627s">And</a>  by and large, kids are proud of the school, they have seen many instances that they enjoy about the school, and they also feel that there isn't the tightness around behaviors that <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6456.164s">They</a>  are able to figure out a way around things and I think there are so many different reasons why that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6462.406s">it's</a>  just an enormous building there isn't I talked about how teachers are not obligated to have duties and that's a that's a very traditionally in other schools in medford their obligations around duties, with the exception of homeroom advisory. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6476.15s">There</a>  aren't any for teachers unless there's pay associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6479.353s">So</a>  that's a huge bargaining chip around the collective bargaining agreement that I believe has to be adapted in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6486.699s">And</a>  I believe the time to do that is when you look at melding the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6491.133s">Because</a>  I think there's a way, and I think there's a willingness, teachers know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6494.275s">Teachers</a>  know they need to be doing this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6496.777s">But</a>  they're also aware that when this was negotiated out of the contract, it was a form of compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6502.6s">And</a>  I think they're not willing to volunteer to do that type of work, because those are hard won negotiations that resulted with the contract they have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6512.787s">So</a>  I think the time is right to be able to look at the two schedules, meld them, and institute some form <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6519.731s">even</a>  in a small way of non-instructional duty for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6524.435s">I</a>  just think that has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6526.056s">And</a>  the kids know how to get around it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6529.719s">Great,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6530.519s">And</a>  it's nice to see the enrollment numbers increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6535.663s">I</a>  can just remember doing promoting and commercials for the vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6541.527s">And</a>  we have the excellent open houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6544.57s">And</a>  it's really great when <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6548.382s">We</a>  do have the open houses and everybody can come out and see in going to the various shops and explore and it's a really nice event that we put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6558.59s">that's</a>  that's all graded here too and and then I I know, Miss Graham had talked about the associate principal position and. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6567.73s">I</a>  did receive some emails from parents, just mentioning that they felt as though we needed to have, there wasn't a particular name, but another assistant principal, because they felt as though there wasn't enough supports at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6589.283s">And</a>  that was just something that was brought up recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6593.205s">I</a>  had put it in, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6594.793s">the</a>  budget survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6596.234s">So</a>  I thought that was interesting that there was a position that was a recommendation for the associate principal in it would that be one position or would that be because it does say this, the associate principal role would be a full-time role. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6614.742s">So</a>  it would be one new position.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6616.903s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6617.223s">And</a>  again, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6620.498s">with</a>  the other four assistant principals?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6623.702s">No,</a>  so I see these as distinct and different, that the assistant principals are dealing with student behavior, discipline, and overall looking at the emotional and academic progress of all their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6636.196s">That</a>  piece is very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6637.938s">The</a>  associate principal would not be dealing in behavior and discipline in any of those aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6643.5s">There's</a>  the management and operations of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6646.241s">For</a>  instance, advanced placement testing, MCAS testing, all of the issues that are listed in that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6652.663s">That's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6653.723s">And</a>  that's a lot of stuff that normally would be sort of parceled out this assistant principal will do this piece this assistant principal will be that piece, and then you get a very dispersed sort of responsibility for all of those pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6666.612s">I</a>  believe that consolidating that under one individual is the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6670.715s">Again,</a>  it used to be that there were four assistant principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6673.818s">Now</a>  there were three. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6675.099s">And</a>  whether or not those duties were adequately distributed, especially to people who are coming in new, a new person coming in, trying to be able to do those is doomed to failure without the support of mentoring and an understanding of historically how these things are done.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6692.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6692.652s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6696.335s">Member</a>  Ruseaul.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6697.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6700.043s">There's</a>  a lot in here around security and cameras and the building and our 55 exterior doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6706.869s">Thank</a>  you for the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6708.971s">I</a>  just think about what it costs to make an exterior door a high tech modern exterior door with access control and alerting when it's not closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6720.475s">take</a>  that number in my head, which I don't have a real number, and I multiply that by 55, and I know that number is just too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6727.978s">So</a>  that is a bit startling to imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6732.799s">And</a>  I mean, you do point out, and one of the teachers are quoted as like, the place is just too big, and we cannot hire enough staff to make all the hiding places not hiding places. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6744.583s">That's</a>  just not one of our options. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6747.304s">So</a>  it's sort of a problem of enrollment and the school size kind of coming together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6754.587s">There</a>  was someplace in the report, I couldn't find it quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6758.488s">You</a>  said something really important about how when the teachers and the students came back after being remote, that the behaviors were, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6773.561s">Well,</a>  we planned a lot for coming back into in-person, but I don't know that we planned for the student body to largely be unrecognizable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6786.505s">And</a>  for teachers that have been teaching for many, many years to have like, it's like they showed up and it's a different planet or something, like all of the things going on that they had not experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6799.901s">And</a>  maybe did not have training and supports and you know we didn't suddenly multiply the number of people in the assistant principal's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6808.703s">That</a>  like we did try our best to support them in coming back, but I feel like this would probably be like you know, in the history books will be one of the areas where we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6819.286s">So</a>  it's not that we didn't provide like. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6822.287s">adjustment</a>  counselors and all those other people, but that's sort of for the students, but finding ways to support the teachers who just came into this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6833.111s">A</a>  friend of mine is a, I think she's a second grade or third grade teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6838.633s">And</a>  during the pandemic, we talked about like how there were not being, there were not a lot of special ed referrals coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6844.735s">And</a>  she was, I was, I mean, I mentioned this on the floor, like I'm terrified that the referrals are down because there's no, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6852.591s">Well</a>  there's eyes on the students but eyes on a webcam is not the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6857.915s">And</a>  sure enough September arrived, and it was a madhouse of all these students who are completely undiagnosed or on untested for what they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6872.5s">And</a>  how much of that could have ever really been supported is will be interesting thing some people I'm sure will study but, you know, we couldn't just magically create a second teacher to sit in every classroom or whatever that those people don't exist so I just think it's really important to recognize that the teaching staff wasn't prepared because they couldn't be prepared because we didn't know, none of us have been through this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6899.651s">Even</a>  if we had pandemics every 25 years, we never would have had a pandemic on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6904.874s">So</a>  it's like, no matter how more common pandemics become, this will be the first one where kids actually kept going sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6913.799s">And</a>  I hope we can take a lot of these things away because the global authorities indicate we can expect more pandemics. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6923.344s">So</a>  maybe we can do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6925.445s">I'll</a>  stop talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6926.786s">I</a>  do just want to point out on page, <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6929.096s">41,</a>  there's a paragraph, I'm gonna read it, it's one paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6934.0s">I'm</a>  just really tired of this conversation and you probably don't know, because you haven't been to all of our meetings, but we have been having this conversation over and over again since returning from the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6945.829s">Bathroom</a>  access and availability, and yes, I rolled my eyes, sorry, has been a significant issue in the overall supervision of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6953.475s">Bathrooms</a>  are scattered throughout the building and periodically are not functioning due to maintenance needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6960.481s">Some</a>  bathrooms are routinely closed deliberately to limit supervisory requirements for staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6965.084s">This</a>  is a relatively common practice in large comprehensive high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6968.749s">but</a>  the number and location of open bathrooms at Medford High School changes on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, creating frustration and confusion for all involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6978.392s">These</a>  changes are usually a result of lack of monitoring coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6981.433s">When</a>  monitors are not available, bathrooms are locked and students are sent to other bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6986.175s">A</a>  couple of questions in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6988.516s">Students</a>  are sent to other bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6990.776s">If</a>  there's nobody to cover it, they're not sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6992.817s">They're</a>  left to wander to find another bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6994.838s">Am</a>  I correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=6995.942s">I</a>  believe in most instances, there's a sign placed on the door, indicating where kids should go and they, those are the attempt is to try to this is, I don't want to imply that this doesn't happen in other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7008.076s">There</a>  are bathrooms in other remote areas of schools that typically are not open to the public, and to students, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7017.506s">So</a>  I think the challenges have been trying to bring a system up to speed immediately after this incident that occurred in December that would provide coverage across the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7027.833s">That</a>  was a lot to try to maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7030.514s">And</a>  sometimes somebody had signed up for coverage and they happened to be out that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7034.757s">And</a>  then that would result in a scramble to try to find somebody to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7039.039s">And</a>  if they couldn't, that bathroom was closed and the kid's sign was on the door and they'd be directed somewhere else.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7044.883s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7047.15s">Reasons</a>  make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7050.011s">We</a>  have all had to go to the bathroom and not been able to find a bathroom though. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7054.572s">And,</a>  you know, the changes happening sometimes on a daily or hourly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7060.134s">I</a>  mean, are we really getting signs up there on the fly in the moment that are always accurate to tell a student where to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7067.256s">Because,</a>  you know, my daughter doesn't go to her locker anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7071.218s">She</a>  just violates the <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7072.813s">policy,</a>  whatever it is, or at least in the handbook and carries all of her books with her in a backpack all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7078.235s">And,</a>  you know, that's partially related to scheduling and our lovely asbestos challenge we had in one of the halls that took out her locker area. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7088.14s">But</a>  when I think about three minutes, I mean, my high school was a similar number of students, dramatically smaller footprint, and we had four minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7099.574s">I</a>  still remember thinking four minutes was nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7101.555s">Like,</a>  how can you get anywhere in four minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7103.856s">And</a>  if you're like ninth grade is in this wing, maybe that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7108.478s">10th</a>  grade's in this wing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7110.379s">But</a>  we have students traversing like the entire building in their three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7116.521s">So,</a>  you know, when I think about that, and then I think about they go, the bathroom is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7124.785s">Is</a>  there, I don't think 100% is an unreasonable expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7129.346s">that</a>  every bathroom has a sign 100% of the time that correctly says where is an open bathroom, not 95% of the time, 100% of the time the sign is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7140.992s">Like</a>  we have an awful lot of people working in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7144.414s">And</a>  it's one thing that matters a lot to somebody who's looking for a bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7149.277s">And</a>  when we talk about student behaviors, well, one thing that's important is that we might wanna consider respecting our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7155.9s">And</a>  while I agree we can't have all the bathrooms open <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7159.301s">plenty</a>  of very good reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7162.964s">If</a>  the bathroom is closed and the sign says to go here and you go over there and that one's closed and there's no sign telling you where else to go, I would feel very disrespected as a student who is supposed to be in class learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7176.734s">I</a>  mean, we can ignore the fact that that means they're not getting an education while they're on the hunt for a bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7184.335s">It's</a>  obnoxious that I'm talking about bathrooms, but we have talked about it so many meetings that you have been lucky enough not to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7191.658s">And</a>  I'm just I'm really exhausted and I'm not running around looking for a bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7197.78s">So</a>  thank you for answering that one question about like the why is there there's coverage all set up everything is lined up and then somebody's out sick or somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7206.94s">You</a>  know, there's lots of other reasons why a staff member couldn't make a coverage, but I just want to make sure that the signage issue is, you know, NASA level accurate, because it's a big building to be running all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7223.646s">And</a>  by the way, having to go pee isn't the only thing our students need to use bathrooms for, which, you know, we still don't have menstrual products in all of our bathrooms, but that's a different conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7233.329s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7450.421s">Hello,</a>  Spagnola. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7453.162s">I'm</a>  at 86 Gore Road in Revere, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7457.604s">I'd</a>  like to say just, because even though if we're not going to talk about bathrooms, it still needs to be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7463.126s">The</a>  problem was, it's a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7465.967s">When</a>  you have kids that are leaving class, and then kids are walking around the school, and then if bathrooms are not monitored, that's where they're going to go hide. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7475.231s">And</a>  so I am somebody that I was walking in the bathrooms whenever I walk around the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7481.813s">And</a>  the record, I threw out 14 kids from a bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7486.535s">Three</a>  of them were eating lunch, sitting on the floor, and one of them was trying to go to the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7491.357s">Actually,</a>  two were trying to go to the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7493.657s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7496.238s">You</a>  can blame or we can try and circle the wagons, whatever we're going to do, but <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7502.496s">there's</a>  really no one person to blame. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7505.117s">It's</a>  let's take a look at the situation and let's react to the situation as opposed to, you know, well, let's put signs on bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7514.398s">I'm</a>  the graphics teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7515.799s">I</a>  did follow the direction of superintendent and the principal who asked me to print signs that said a maximum of two allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7524.44s">And</a>  then we went around me and my students, we'd put them all up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7528.741s">It's,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7529.707s">helpful</a>  if we know what bathrooms are open, but the problem is we don't have enough people to monitor them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7535.028s">And</a>  then if we don't monitor them, I've kicked six kids out a couple of weeks ago because they managed to get into a bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7542.749s">So</a>  I don't know what else we can do outside of a complete reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7549.271s">But</a>  I figured as long as we're talking about bathrooms, I just wanted to say that everybody that's trying to do their best <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7557.205s">sees</a>  that the bathroom is a huge problem and outside of monitoring them, we're gonna have to lock them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7564.549s">So</a>  I just wanted to add that, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7566.971s">I</a>  just wanted to give some clarity as somebody that does walk around the school anytime I can and try and help out and try and get these kids to get to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7575.436s">So</a>  that's it, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7632.217s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7634.761s">If</a>  there are additional concerns or issues, I've more than exceeded the allocation that was originally made by the school committee, but I felt very committed to making sure I saw the process through. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7644.168s">And</a>  if there are additional concerns or questions that come up, I'd be happy to return and help out in whatever way I can.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7649.992s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7653.354s">We</a>  do not have any presentations of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7655.656s">We</a>  have continued business 2023-01 offered by member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7660.902s">On</a>  April 26, 2021, the school committee voted unanimously to amend policy GAD, permanent staff positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7667.668s">The</a>  amended policy included this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7670.85s">All</a>  job descriptions were reviewed every three years and presented to the school committee for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7675.334s">Job</a>  descriptions will contain a last reviewed date. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7678.656s">Superintendent</a>  will establish a review cycle for all positions descriptions within 60 days of the adoption of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7684.881s">The</a>  initial review cycle lasts no longer than three years and conclude on September 1st, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7691.513s">Back</a>  to October 21 2021, the comprehensive list of current job descriptions professional staff positions are available for view by the public on the Medford public school website. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7702.179s">Each</a>  time a new position is established by the committee, the superintendent will present the committee's approval job description for the position which specifies the job holders qualifications and the jobs performance responsibilities, although such positions may remain <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7716.673s">temporarily</a>  unfilled, only the committee may abolish position it has created. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7721.254s">All</a>  positions unfilled for the entire prior school year will be reported to the committee annually no later than June 1st with an explanation for the vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7729.475s">All</a>  positions that remain unfilled for more than two consecutive school years will be presented to the committee to be abolished no later than June 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7737.036s">In</a>  the event the superintendent wishes to maintain any positions that have been unfilled for more than two consecutive school years, the superintendent must explain the rationale and plan to fill the position <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7746.28s">and</a>  get approved from the committee to continue the unfilled position for an additional year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7750.645s">Be</a>  resolved that the superintendent provide an update and timeline to comply with the September, 2024 completion of the initial view cycle here in member Graham.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7760.816s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7762.62s">As</a>  I was referencing earlier, this has come up multiple times in the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7767.902s">Certainly,</a>  as we were talking about the roles and responsibilities of the high school principal for which we are interviewing, it came up, we were asked questions by candidates and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7780.486s">But</a>  we did, several years ago, try to establish a process that would make sure that we are thoughtfully looking at these positions on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7792.167s">So</a>  my request really is not that there's an answer tonight, but that before the year is out, we do have a plan for actually reviewing these job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7801.975s">I</a>  think it's incredibly hard to figure out and not clear to me, you know, who does the, does the director of such and such a topic have responsibilities for supervision? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7816.001s">Do</a>  they have responsibilities for duties? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7819.524s">All</a>  of that is very muddy and it's not easy to even know where to go to look for those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7823.387s">So</a>  my request is just that at some point we get back to this thing we originally unanimously supported and make sure that we're on a better path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7837.237s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7845.879s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7849.162s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7849.942s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7901.471s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7903.232s">I</a>  know there has been a lot of work going on behind the scenes in our food service area as a result of an audit and other changes that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7912.416s">So</a>  I thought it would be a good time to remind everybody that we were interested in pursuing <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7919.933s">some</a>  more information about composting based on the report that the Global Scholars presented last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7926.058s">I've</a>  been asked about it by my daughter, who was one of the presenters several times, and I keep telling her, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7931.101s">So</a>  I wanted to put that back on everybody's radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7934.824s">And</a>  again, just, you know, if there are things happening in the district that we're unaware of, I think people would be happy to hear about those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7942.73s">But</a>  I think also, you know, what is our plan for next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7945.712s">And</a>  is composting part of the food service plan, I think is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7949.318s">So</a>  it doesn't have to be today, but as we talk about food service.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7953.08s">And</a>  if I may, through the chair, I met with the chair of the Energy and Environment Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7957.243s">I</a>  believe it was maybe Thursday or Friday, and they have five goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7962.926s">And</a>  one is to learn more from students and get more active in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7970.251s">So</a>  maybe your daughter can go to the committee, one of their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7974.093s">I</a>  think they're on Monday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7976.366s">But</a>  they are looking to interact more with students and try to get more involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7979.607s">And</a>  they could be a huge asset to trying to get composting in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7983.848s">And</a>  I will also talk to Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=7986.548s">And</a>  on the city side, we're working on, we have a task force in place, because we're doing a new RFP for recycling, composting, and trash pickup in the city, as we want to encourage more composting and recycling versus trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8001.171s">So</a>  we'll see if they have anything in mind for the schools as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8005.589s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8005.989s">So</a>  just looking for an update at some point.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8008.611s">Update</a>  from the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8010.391s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8011.072s">And</a>  motion for approval by Member Graham seconded by Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8015.594s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8027.14s">Yes,</a>  70 in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8031.629s">New</a>  business, we have member Graham and member McLaughlin, 2023-08, whereas the Medford School Committee seeks to increase transparency and community engagement, and whereas Medford Public Schools has recently relaunched its website on a modernized platform that enables regular maintenance, be resolved if the Communications and Family Engagement Subcommittee meet to discuss updates to the website that would promote family engagement <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8057.56s">improve</a>  accessibility and ensure transparency for all medical public school families and residents of Medford, be it further resolved that the communications and family engagement subcommittee will invite miss Lisa Miller and her students who work to launch the site, and are currently working on plans for phase two, two of development.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8075.394s">I</a>  think we talked about this when we had a presentation for the website that there's potentially some connections to some of the school committee's goals around accessibility and translation that probably just warrant a little bit of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8092.3s">I</a>  think on our part about what the website's capabilities are and really talk about what those next phases might look like for phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8101.004s">So</a>  just officially asking the committee to push this to committee so that we can work on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8106.126s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/_OvxNEIZPH8&t=8108.887s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>
