1
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:12,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

[SPEAKER_16]: Member Hays?

9
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:57,248
Here.

[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz?

11
00:00:59,129 --> 00:00:59,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Here.

12
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin?

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:01,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

[SPEAKER_16]: Member Mustone is not here yet.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau, present.

16
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Longo, present.

17
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Six present, one absent.

18
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,463
[SPEAKER_10]: For now, please all rise to salute the flag.

19
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:26,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:33,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe we have any student representatives on tonight yet.

21
00:01:36,518 --> 00:01:39,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Mr. Bruno will be here shortly.

22
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:39,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,441
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number three good of the order.

24
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:44,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody have any comments?

25
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:47,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays.

26
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:49,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

27
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a I guess a question for longer term members about a policy I came across as I was looking at some of the

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,811
[SPEAKER_04]: the updated policies on mask.

29
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:14,777
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a policy, JIB, Student Involvement and Decision Making, about having us meet with a student advisory council once every other month or some such thing.

30
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:20,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know if that ever existed or whether it's something we need to look into how we create this process.

31
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:22,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping someone might know.

32
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:24,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Repeat what it is one more time, student.

33
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:35,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Student Involvement in Decision Making, and it says, as required by state law, the committee will meet at least once every other month while school is in session with its student advisory committee.

34
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,299
[SPEAKER_06]: J-I-B.

35
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, member McLaughlin?

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not heard of that previously, and I think it's a great idea, and I thank you for noticing.

37
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would

38
00:02:52,277 --> 00:03:01,201
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously be, I don't think we need to make a motion if it's already in policy, but I would be wanting to ensure that we're doing that starting in September.

39
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:04,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Cushing.

40
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,388
[SPEAKER_15]: The district has been meeting with students on a student advisory council.

41
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I just shared the

42
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:23,817
[SPEAKER_15]: definition roster with you first member Hays, and I'll share it with everybody else when I go back to my seat.

43
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:28,819
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have about 25 to 30 members at the middle school level, which is not required by law.

44
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,081
[SPEAKER_15]: We have about 25 or so at the high school level.

45
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:40,285
[SPEAKER_15]: From that, we pull the rotating members, four or five, for the students who come here.

46
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:46,166
[SPEAKER_15]: So most school committees have delegated to district leadership.

47
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:56,169
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we do meet and have conversations focused on student needs and helping them to be part of the decisions in the district.

48
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:00,450
[SPEAKER_15]: So I did just share the description with you and I'll share it with everybody else.

49
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:01,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

50
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

51
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, if Member Hays is done.

52
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:12,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm not clear on whether that well satisfies.

53
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:16,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm not sure when it says that it's required by law that the committee meets with them.

54
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I don't know historically, is that something that the committee decided sometime in the past that it would be the responsibility of the school administration to do that?

55
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, that's fine.

56
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:29,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I didn't know anything about this.

57
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:32,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was just curious if anyone had the history on it.

58
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm point point information because member mobile phone is next.

59
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:46,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless Dr. Edward was going to answer so I don't know.

60
00:04:47,866 --> 00:05:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: My answer was going to be that this to my knowledge, at least since I've been here the students did not meet with the school committee members I know that Dr. Cushing has been, but since there is a standing schedule in place, I don't see why it happens during the school day.

61
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:08,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So, depending on availability or flexibility I don't see why we can't extend it.

62
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: to school committee members, I'd have to go back and look at the policy, and I don't know if it's one member or if it should be a rotating member, but we definitely could add that.

63
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

64
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:25,264
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually what I was going to suggest.

65
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:38,253
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Dr. Avey, that if we could have either rotating membership, or I don't think the students necessarily want seven school committee members coming into their meeting on an every other month basis, but I think

66
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:43,270
[SPEAKER_05]: know, a rotating visit would be really nice so that we can hear directly from them.

67
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that you this was really sort of implemented last year, a year before last, right?

68
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:52,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I last year, last year, I think member Ruseau made a motion about two years ago.

69
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:55,935
[SPEAKER_15]: And I could be off on my timing.

70
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:57,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

71
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:00,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham, the member Ruseau.

72
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:03,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to suggest that

73
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:10,265
[SPEAKER_07]: As a committee, we should probably just revisit the policy and make sure that we still agree that it's the right policy for us.

74
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:16,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Any delegation of that to the administration predates more than likely every person here.

75
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:32,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we can assume we know what their intentions were or what the dynamics were, but I do think our students always have really valuable things to say, and I don't wanna like interrupt what is happening

76
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,321
[SPEAKER_07]: already, but I don't think that necessarily is the same as a collaboration with us.

77
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:44,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, at some point we should put a resolution on to have the rules committee, take a look at that policy and figure out like, what do we recommend going forward?

78
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

79
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:46,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

80
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:47,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

81
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,205
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually reading the law right now.

82
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and actually member can not do it.

83
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,506
[SPEAKER_16]: It must be the full committee.

84
00:06:53,266 --> 00:07:02,349
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, I'm quite surprised by this language because how the full committee can have a publicly posted meeting with the student advisory council.

85
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:11,211
[SPEAKER_16]: which meets during the school day when we cannot meet as a body because we have jobs and other things that would prevent us from doing that.

86
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:19,520
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very strange way that it's written that this whole body must meet with the student advisory council every other month.

87
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,804
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know how we can get the student advisory council

88
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:34,746
[SPEAKER_16]: whether we do it as part of our regular meetings or as a meeting before our meetings, but it is not individual members, it is a regular meeting.

89
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:44,675
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll reach out to the association and ask how folks actually implement this, because while I certainly agree with the intent that's clear,

90
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:58,209
[SPEAKER_16]: How does anybody get this done in practice, because we can't mandate the student advisor five members of the student advisory council come to our meetings, every other month.

91
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,734
[SPEAKER_16]: We, by law, we cannot pay them to be here for their time.

92
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,374
[SPEAKER_16]: which we talked about a couple of years ago when we were talking about student participation.

93
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:11,741
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it's a very strange requirement.

94
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:17,428
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that as far as the six years I've been here we've never done it.

95
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:24,493
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to thank member Hays for pointing it out, because never noticed it.

96
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:34,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm quite curious how you came to know about this policy, or this law, which I mean the policy is literally just a copy of the law for the most part.

97
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:41,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just looking through some of the updated this wasn't an updated policy but in looking through.

98
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:45,369
[SPEAKER_04]: the updated policies, trying to match the letters.

99
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:50,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, I happened to stumble upon this one, so I thought I'd bring it forward.

100
00:08:50,611 --> 00:09:10,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I will certainly take it from the meeting to go to email MASC and look at other districts to see how or if, or how I just, you know, my head can't wrap around how we can do something this substantial every other month and drag a five student member body to a meeting.

101
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:20,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anybody else think that that seems like quite an exact a lot to require by law, that we will make this happen.

102
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:21,885
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we can't compel.

103
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:26,369
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not like the Congress that can like compel people to be here.

104
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,973
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's just very strange.

105
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:30,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for bringing it up.

106
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I appreciate members those willingness to check in with ma SC on this and see what other folks are doing.

107
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:43,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine, you know, wouldn't necessarily having to compel students.

108
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:48,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that there's, you know, lots of students out there that want to talk to us.

109
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:51,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that they want to do it in a public meeting per se, but obviously we need to.

110
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:56,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we could make it potentially if it's not every other month, we could explore making it

111
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:12,458
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, something else after you get back from the MISC, but I envision it, you know, either an early, you know, before the regular meeting, you know, see, you know, Cal meeting or something like that, where we're having some pizza and some, you know, conversation with the students, which I think could really work out well.

112
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

113
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

114
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

115
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:24,443
[SPEAKER_10]: We have consent agenda bills and payrolls and minutes from the regular school committee meeting on April 10th, 2023.

116
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:26,908
[SPEAKER_10]: motion for approval.

117
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:31,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

118
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:32,532
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

119
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:33,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

120
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:38,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Mustone is present.

121
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:40,899
[SPEAKER_10]: You can mark her, Member Mustone, present, please.

122
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:46,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in favor, one silent.

123
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:47,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I know she's driving, so.

124
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:54,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Reports of subcommittees, minutes from the Rules and Policy Subcommittee meeting on April 12, 2023 and

125
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,420
[SPEAKER_10]: rules and policy.

126
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Members for self.

127
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:02,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

128
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:03,344
[SPEAKER_11]: One moment.

129
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, yes.

130
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:14,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

131
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:18,216
[SPEAKER_16]: The rules and I'm just doing the minutes for the folks that we were just doing.

132
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:19,857
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry for the delay.

133
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:23,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so the rules and policy subcommittee met.

134
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,129
[SPEAKER_16]: last week, was it?

135
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, I forgot the dates.

136
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:28,491
[SPEAKER_11]: 25th.

137
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,412
[SPEAKER_16]: 25th, thank you.

138
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:37,376
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had our attorney present and we went through all of his comments on the current version of the policy.

139
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:42,339
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thought we had, we made good progress.

140
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:52,784
[SPEAKER_16]: So as a result of the meeting, we've decided to pass the current draft version over to member Graham, vice chair Graham,

141
00:11:55,185 --> 00:12:01,649
[SPEAKER_16]: take a pass at making the document make sense, which I look forward to that.

142
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:15,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And we will schedule the next meeting, which will hopefully be the last meeting on this topic and subcommittee as soon as she's had a chance to go over the document.

143
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:20,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to schedule it too soon, but my guess is by the end of May, this is May already, isn't it?

144
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,382
[SPEAKER_16]: By the end of May, we'll have the last

145
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:30,448
[SPEAKER_16]: another subcommittee meeting on that document, which we can hopefully approve and send to the full committee for consideration.

146
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:33,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

147
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:35,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

148
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, as a member of the Rules, Policy and Equity subcommittee, I also wanted to just note that there were some items in the document that Attorney Greenspan was able to address.

149
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were some that were outside of his scope related to special education.

150
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:59,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a different law firm that represents the district regarding special education.

151
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:21,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I had respectfully asked that the Director of Pupil Services reach out to the, to me, Cassian Lehane, and to just follow up on a couple of the items that needed legal consult as well, just because Attorney Greenspan, it was out of his scope.

152
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:28,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to let members know that that will be part of the next conversation, I think, as well, hopefully.

153
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:32,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tumi Hassan-Lahin can get back to us on that.

154
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:51,646
[SPEAKER_05]: But just because there's so many nuances when it comes to legislation and other legal issues related to students with disabilities and other needs that I want to make sure that we're addressing, pressing our T's and dotting our I's in that capacity as well.

155
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:53,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

156
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

157
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:03,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the motion is still in committee and the motion just to approve the minutes by member motion to approve the minutes McLaughlin seconded by second member Graham, all those in favor.

158
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:12,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you have to roll call because members don't as remote.

159
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I did say I. Okay, great.

160
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:19,093
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're gonna okay.

161
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:21,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call has been requested by member Graham.

162
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:21,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

163
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:23,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

164
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

165
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:26,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

166
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

167
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:29,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

168
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:31,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

169
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:32,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

170
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:32,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

171
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven the affirmative zero the negatives, the minutes have passed.

172
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:41,950
[SPEAKER_10]: We have minutes from evaluation subcommittee meeting on April 27 2023 pass that over to member Hays.

173
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

174
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we met on April 27th.

175
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,393
[SPEAKER_04]: We went through.

176
00:14:51,413 --> 00:15:09,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we had to, well, we just wanted to finish up both the form, the template that members will use to evaluate the superintendent and also to

177
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:18,585
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that the instructions that we have that we will be sending along with the template were clear and included everything that was necessary.

178
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:35,821
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been passed out to the members before the meeting attached to the minutes that was passed out is the form itself or a copy of the form and a copy of the instructions and I think that it

179
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,565
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, we needed members to approve.

180
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:42,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

181
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:43,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Approve the template.

182
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,728
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed the full committee.

183
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:51,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the purpose at this point?

184
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was the end of our meeting.

185
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

186
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:58,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I guess, well, yeah, I guess I question this.

187
00:15:58,618 --> 00:15:58,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

188
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:04,402
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, it was my impression that we were going to have this shared so people could

189
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:10,774
[SPEAKER_05]: look at it between now and the next meeting because it's a lot to look at in this meeting.

190
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:25,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to also as a member of the committee with member Graham and member Hays, I wanted to thank the committee for their work on this and also member Hays' work on really sort of putting all of the documentation together.

191
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have, if I'm not mistaken, one more meeting.

192
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,870
[SPEAKER_05]: between this and the next school committee meeting that we would, right?

193
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,594
[SPEAKER_04]: We meet again on, well, we meet on the eighth for the superintendent's self-evaluation at that point.

194
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:46,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, we had planned to present the template to members then, but so we're presenting it now.

195
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:54,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose that would mean at the next meeting, members will have a chance to look at it and bring any questions or concerns they have so we can talk about it then.

196
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:57,886
[SPEAKER_07]: motion to approve.

197
00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

198
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,507
[SPEAKER_10]: For motion for approval.

199
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:01,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

200
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:16,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what we agreed to on Thursday was there needed to be a motion to approve this process and the templates today because next week is a committee of the whole and we cannot vote things in committee of the whole.

201
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this needs to happen so that all the members can then fill out their

202
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:27,724
[SPEAKER_07]: on the, I believe it's like the 21st.

203
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:32,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do, I thought it was on the agenda, but I don't see it.

204
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is a revised agenda.

205
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a moment to find the right version.

206
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:43,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, in the notes, it talked about approval of the process.

207
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So Member McLaughlin, did you make a motion to approve the minutes?

208
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve the minutes, yes.

209
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, yeah, we need a motion to approve the process.

210
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion to approve the minutes, please.

211
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:56,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

212
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval of the minutes by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

213
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote.

214
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:04,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

215
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:04,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

216
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Hays.

217
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:06,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

218
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:06,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz.

219
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:07,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

220
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:08,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

221
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:08,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

222
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:09,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Mestona.

223
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:11,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

224
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:12,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Rossell.

225
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:12,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

226
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:13,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Long-Gokern.

227
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:14,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

228
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

229
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:21,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Before you move a motion to approve the process, I know we all talked about it in the last

230
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:25,271
[SPEAKER_10]: committee of the whole meeting, but can somebody explain just the difference?

231
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:29,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any major differences on what we'll be doing on the 8th?

232
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Differences from last year?

233
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:50,150
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know we all agreed on the sections that we'll be evaluating on, which are the last like four pages of this document, but is there anything that was discussed in your meeting specifically that we should be aware of?

234
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,755
[SPEAKER_10]: before we take a motion tonight to approve the process?

235
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: On the form itself, there were no major changes.

236
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we are using the DESE forms.

237
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:03,523
[SPEAKER_04]: There really isn't room for huge changes to it.

238
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:16,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We did fill in the superintendent's goals and we checked off and highlighted the specific focus indicators that we're using to evaluate the superintendent.

239
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:27,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

240
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,012
[SPEAKER_07]: In the packet attached to the minutes, there's a couple of things that I think will be helpful.

241
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:34,494
[SPEAKER_07]: The timeline that we had previously agreed to did not change.

242
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:43,519
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a step-by-step how to for members in the packet that talks about each step in the process that I think will be really helpful.

243
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,761
[SPEAKER_07]: The committee voted to use the DESI template.

244
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:53,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So it will be delivered electronically, and everyone will be able to fill it out

245
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:58,551
[SPEAKER_07]: um according to the specific focus indicators that we had previously agreed on.

246
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:05,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all that has happened is the the indicators we agreed on were laid into the template and highlighted.

247
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:13,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone will fill this individual PDF out and follow the process that is outlined step by step.

248
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:13,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

249
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:14,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

250
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:15,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

251
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate that.

252
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:22,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what we're, I believe the motion is for tonight is to establish the process of

253
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,862
[SPEAKER_05]: sharing the template with you all and the instructions prior to the superintendent self-evaluation.

254
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really the process we're talking about.

255
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is on the amended agenda.

256
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:38,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve superintendent evaluation template instructions and process for consideration.

257
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,906
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there a motion on the floor?

258
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

259
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:47,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

260
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,489
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor, we will take another roll call.

261
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:49,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

262
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:52,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

263
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:52,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

264
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:53,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Hays.

265
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:54,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

266
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz.

267
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:55,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

268
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:56,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

269
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:56,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

270
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:58,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Mustone.

271
00:20:58,935 --> 00:20:59,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

272
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:00,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

273
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:00,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

274
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:01,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

275
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:02,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

276
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:05,578
[SPEAKER_10]: On the affirmative, zero on the negative, the process has been approved.

277
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, we have reports of superintendent.

278
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,261
[SPEAKER_10]: First up is updates and comments by Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent, our superintendent.

279
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:18,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

280
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we meet tonight, first day of May.

281
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We do so on School Principals Day.

282
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:39,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I must wish all of our principals and assistant principals our sincere thanks for all they do for our students.

283
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:48,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, this week will be both Teachers Appreciation Day and the beginning of School Nurses Week Appreciation.

284
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:53,019
[SPEAKER_02]: The nurses actually get a full week from May 6th through the 12th.

285
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,644
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our staff's dedication and attention to detail make them an integral part of our Mustang community.

286
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,747
[SPEAKER_02]: They're our top priority.

287
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:10,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And since education, their top priority is always the education and health and safety of all of our students.

288
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,648
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to commend and thank them for always going above and beyond the call of duty.

[SPEAKER_10]: Recommendation to approve travel to Italy, Dr. Vilma Bobo, Coordinator of World Language, and Ms.

425
00:36:58,787 --> 00:37:03,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicole Shalafo, Metro Public School teacher.

426
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:07,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you both for being here.

427
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:07,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

428
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:14,021
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on.

429
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:15,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

430
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:17,289
[SPEAKER_12]: How's everybody doing tonight?

431
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:17,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

432
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having us.

433
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:25,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, we're here to propose the travel trip to Italy next spring 2024.

434
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just here to support Ms.

435
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:30,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Chalafour.

436
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:30,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

437
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:31,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Chalafour is actually

438
00:37:32,596 --> 00:37:36,038
[SPEAKER_12]: done this trip many times before, about three times.

439
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:42,800
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the same company that we have used recently to go to France, the trip to France.

440
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:49,143
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a company that we have used here in Medford for Italy since 2015.

441
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:50,504
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'll have Ms.

442
00:37:50,524 --> 00:37:55,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Chalifour talk a little bit more about this trip, as she's going to be the leader of the trip.

443
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:59,556
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how many students are going.

444
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,496
[SPEAKER_10]: How many students are going?

445
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:02,979
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is still just initial approval.

446
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:07,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't officially advertised waiting for the go ahead to be able to do so.

447
00:38:08,523 --> 00:38:09,724
[SPEAKER_18]: So based on.

448
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:14,128
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know yet, but we shall see hopefully.

449
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:18,672
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is a little bit of a combination tour that we've done.

450
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:23,576
[SPEAKER_18]: From North to South, kind of, but it's still unique.

451
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,277
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't done this exact route before.

452
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:27,872
[SPEAKER_18]: You all have a copy of the itinerary?

453
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:28,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, okay.

454
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:35,036
[SPEAKER_18]: And the calendar did come out, so it does, these are the correct dates, right?

455
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:39,079
[SPEAKER_18]: I just saw in the superintendent's email from last week.

456
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:42,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so day one, depart, go to Venice.

457
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:43,562
[SPEAKER_18]: So it starts in Venice.

458
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:48,505
[SPEAKER_18]: We continue from Venice as we get on the coach, the ferry.

459
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:54,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice bus, if you will, across the, where is it?

460
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:57,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe to Verona, is Verona on here?

461
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:58,937
[SPEAKER_18]: No, straight down to Bologna.

462
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:06,740
[SPEAKER_18]: No, on the way from Venice, we're gonna stop in Bologna, an afternoon, see, but it's not gonna be an overnight peace in Bologna.

463
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,442
[SPEAKER_18]: From there, we'll continue down to Florence.

464
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:17,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Florence will be home base for two nights, at least, I believe, two nights, and then continuing on down to,

465
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,152
[SPEAKER_18]: but in the past, we made a switch here.

466
00:39:36,212 --> 00:39:45,418
[SPEAKER_18]: So in the past, we would stop in Rome and then continue further south, but we're going to go further south and then circle back up to Rome for the actual departure.

467
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:48,149
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is where I was just messing up my stuff.

468
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:54,774
[SPEAKER_18]: From Florence, we're going to go straight past Rome down to near Naples, which is Sorrento.

469
00:39:54,814 --> 00:39:59,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Not actually in Napoli, but Sorrento, and stay there for two nights.

470
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:03,821
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll go back up to Rome, which is where the main airports are, and we'll depart from there.

471
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:07,324
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is

472
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:16,509
[SPEAKER_18]: a rough draft, I guess, of what I'm trying to articulate from this paper right now.

473
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:22,071
[SPEAKER_18]: So the price itself varies depending on how many students actually do sign up.

474
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:32,236
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can see that there is a little chart here with the different price quotes based off of a group of, say, 40 to 45 students, people.

475
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:38,919
[SPEAKER_18]: The flight estimate included land suggestion or land

476
00:40:39,651 --> 00:40:46,532
[SPEAKER_18]: estimate, the suggested supplement would be if anybody wanted to right, right away decide that they want to room individually.

477
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:48,933
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would be an additional supplemental fee.

478
00:40:50,033 --> 00:41:04,195
[SPEAKER_18]: So depending on how many students we have, we're looking around what 3300 33 fish as a base price for the trip itself.

479
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:07,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Gratuity as it's been in the past is an additional thing.

480
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,276
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is

481
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:13,865
[SPEAKER_18]: usually collected in a cash form based off of, again, how many students are signed up.

482
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:26,520
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know what that exact number would be at this moment, but it is probably $100 or something like that on top of this estimated price here.

483
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:31,278
[SPEAKER_09]: questions.

484
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:40,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want assuming we're going to approve this mass that the, the, we have a form that has to be filled out before the trip actually happens.

485
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I, it's been filled out many times in the past.

486
00:41:45,553 --> 00:42:13,185
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you don't have the information at this point to fill it out, because it's usually like how many students, has the nurse signed off on everything, those forms, we do have to approve those before you take off, but certainly, I know that some forms were being redone over the past couple of months, perhaps, so I don't know, I haven't seen them yet, but from the last time that I did the paperwork myself,

487
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:19,220
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that there were some different papers that Marine Island did use also recently for the trip to France.

488
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the ones, yes.

489
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:22,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the ones, all right.

490
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

491
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,483
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd make a motion to approve.

492
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:25,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

493
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:28,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

494
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:29,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote, please.

495
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:32,987

[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays?

498
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:35,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

499
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:35,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz?

500
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,510
[SPEAKER_09]: She stepped out for a moment.

501
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,971
[SPEAKER_09]: She stepped out absent.

502
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:40,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin?

503
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:41,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

504
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:42,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Mustone?

505
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:43,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

506
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember so yes Maryland occur.

507
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:49,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, six in the affirmative one absent paper is approved.

508
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:51,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

509
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:54,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you enjoy the planning and say share but stay tuned.

510
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:55,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

511
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:56,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here.

512
00:42:56,637 --> 00:42:57,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

513
00:42:58,258 --> 00:43:10,088
[SPEAKER_10]: We have report on high school and medford vocational technical high school safety security and school climate review, Mr. Michael Welch is here with us this evening administrative consultant to medical public schools, welcome.

514
00:43:16,038 --> 00:43:20,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, and thank you all for allowing me to come present my report.

515
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,641
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that we have the technical aspects set up.

516
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:28,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, if you want to be able to do it from there, I wasn't able to get in just now on Zoom.

517
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:29,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

518
00:43:31,564 --> 00:43:51,945
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're sort of getting things ready from a standpoint of technology, I just want to thank the committee and all the members of the Medford public schools for allowing me the opportunity to come and create a, an opportunity to really comprehensively review Medford High School and vocational technical high school.

519
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:59,337
[SPEAKER_13]: I assume all of you have seen the report that I presented, I created a very brief presentation.

520
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:05,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing, to be able to sort of summarize the different pieces the report is rather lengthy.

521
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:09,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to make sure that all of you had an opportunity to see that in advance and

522
00:44:11,366 --> 00:44:19,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I did get the opportunity to meet with a tremendous number of people and do a lot of work looking at trying to make sure I understood everything.

523
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:29,732
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it's pleasing to the committee, I'll spend maybe 10 minutes reviewing different pieces and then we'll go right to questions because I know that the general public does not have a copy of the report.

524
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:35,674
[SPEAKER_13]: The only people who have seen it at this point are the superintendent and Mr. DeLayva, the high school principal.

525
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:40,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to make sure that they could provide me with any corrections if I had any factual errors.

526
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,397
[SPEAKER_13]: they did not make any changes to any content.

527
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:48,259
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to make sure that you all were able to see it as soon as that was done.

528
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:50,440
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could, Dr. Cushing, to the next slide.

529
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a brief project overview.

530
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:57,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Administratively, I was at the school from January 3rd.

531
00:44:57,923 --> 00:45:04,006
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, prior to January 3rd, during the Christmas break, I was there for a couple of days just getting to know folks at the school.

532
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:10,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And concluded around March 17 there were a couple of additional meetings after that that I returned to the school.

533
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:22,726
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened was there were a number of people who specifically individually reached out to me over the course of doing the interviews and asked to either revisit a conversation or initiate one.

534
00:45:24,265 --> 00:45:37,512
[SPEAKER_13]: There were 40 individual one hour interviews as all of you know, I met with each of you on the school committee as well as everyone in the district administration, the high school administration and all the K to 12 district directors.

535
00:45:38,432 --> 00:45:42,034
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I conducted faculty staff focus group interviews.

536
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:48,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Using educators from all the academic and career and technical and special education departments.

537
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,256
[SPEAKER_13]: What I tried to do was make sure that everyone had an opportunity to provide input.

538
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,997
[SPEAKER_13]: So those interviews were rather extensive.

539
00:45:55,177 --> 00:46:02,879
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I met with Councilors building security secretaries and administrative assistants buildings and grounds athletics, a number of other groups.

540
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:10,584
[SPEAKER_13]: in focus groups, so that they had the psychological safety to be able to speak honestly and openly with me.

541
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:18,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's really critical that I was able to establish that confidence, so that people would speak openly and I believe that they did.

542
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:21,572
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I did student focus groups.

543
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:29,097
[SPEAKER_13]: The way I did this, as you may have read in the report, I asked Mr. Duleva to basically make me a substitute teacher.

544
00:46:29,678 --> 00:46:33,961
[SPEAKER_13]: So when teachers were out, I essentially was doing what a substitute teacher would do.

545
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:38,764
[SPEAKER_13]: I was assigned to, in some instances, five classes in an individual day.

546
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:41,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would go in and essentially be the teacher.

547
00:46:42,506 --> 00:46:47,870
[SPEAKER_13]: And the administration would additionally assign a teacher, as they typically would,

548
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:59,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would take a portion of the class in some instances I took the whole class and let them know what I was doing had a conversation with them about what their experience was like and really had an opportunity to get to know all of them.

549
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:05,716
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason I did it that way is because it was a completely random sample students from ninth 10th 11th and 12th.

550
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:12,923
[SPEAKER_13]: from electives from lowest level classes to very high level classes.

551
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:16,447
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really a fascinating experience and the kids were very open.

552
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:23,194
[SPEAKER_13]: And in addition to that, I did individual interviews with English learner students.

553
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:30,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Texera was able to nominate a bunch of kids to come and meet with me.

554
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:39,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And those interviews were conducted with the assistance of an interpreter to make sure that we could get honest opinions from students in those instances.

555
00:47:39,218 --> 00:47:42,139
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe we were able to successfully do that.

556
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I could tell because the kids didn't wanna leave.

557
00:47:45,381 --> 00:47:48,483
[SPEAKER_13]: They asked if they could stay and continue to talk about their experiences.

558
00:47:50,151 --> 00:48:02,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I did some individual interviews via direct request, some folks that weren't necessarily directly associated with the high school but we're more of district wide positions I met with some of those folks to not wanting to have anyone feeling unheard.

559
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, I spent a tremendous amount of time in classrooms.

560
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:16,388
[SPEAKER_13]: in the hallways, the cafeteria, the drop off and pick up line to make sure that I understood essentially everything that was going on in and around the school.

561
00:48:16,468 --> 00:48:22,332
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was in excess of, I want to say more than 33 school days that I was there.

562
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:30,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And then a lot of time spent revisiting some questions that I had as I was starting to do the write up portion of the report.

563
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:38,565
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I tried to do was use an analysis model framework that I hope you were able to review.

564
00:48:39,145 --> 00:48:47,248
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the lipid Nostra model for managing complex change and I just being that it's on the screen right now I wanted to take a moment to talk about this.

565
00:48:47,848 --> 00:49:04,888
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that is used in educational circles quite a bit when looking at models for school wide improvement strategic planning, various aspects of change, and essentially consists of six different components that all need to be satisfactorily established.

566
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:14,020
[SPEAKER_13]: In order for change to succeed, and this would be a good time for me to have my glasses on because the print is a little bit small for my eyes.

567
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of you will correct me if I'm wrong.

568
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:24,393
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can see across the top, there is vision consensus skills, a word I can't read.

569
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:36,209
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see the words across the top, and in the absence of each of those categories, if one of those is absent you see the resulting deficit that could result.

570
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,915
[SPEAKER_13]: If all six of these issues are addressed you typically would see some form of success.

571
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:47,821
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are missing a vision, the resulting deficit would be confusion amongst faculty and staff.

572
00:49:48,361 --> 00:50:02,151
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are missing consensus, the result could be sabotage where people who don't feel that they're a part of the vision, simply trying either not to do it through benign neglect or actively try to sabotage the effort.

573
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:06,434
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, if you don't have the skills, you would end up with

574
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:15,368
[SPEAKER_13]: anxiety and fear about what potentially could happen if you are asked to do something you don't have the skills to complete.

575
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:25,210
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't have the third category that I can't see, because the text is too small, you would end up with resistance.

576
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:37,473
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, you can see each of the six categories, and I try to analyze all of the different pieces in my review, in essence, using that model framework as an analysis.

577
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:41,179
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could, Mr. Cushing, Dr. Cushing, to the next slide.

578
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:52,977
[SPEAKER_13]: So the different focus areas that I chose to look at after spending a little bit of time in the school were the categories that you see listed on this slide, the district and school organizational structure.

579
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:59,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to make sure I fully understood both the staffing and the philosophy around the way that the school was structured.

580
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:08,020
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I wanted to look at the leadership structure and all of the transitions that have occurred over the course of the last five to 10 years.

581
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,741
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'll see that in a moment.

582
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:20,157
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I looked at specifically all of the DSEE data around enrollments and student achievement, as well as student-faculty demographics and trends.

583
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:32,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a critical piece that is not unlike a lot of places in Massachusetts, particularly around the differences between the student demographics and the educator demographics, but I wanted to provide you with that analysis also.

584
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:39,551
[SPEAKER_13]: I then looked at specifically the behavior and discipline referrals, specifically for the time I was in the school.

585
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:47,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe it was about 33 days and I aggressively dug into the discipline statistics and provided you with that information.

586
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:59,121
[SPEAKER_13]: I then looked carefully at the buildings and grounds, structure, security, and access to the building, as well as district and school policies, procedures, and processes.

587
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:03,984
[SPEAKER_13]: schedules, logistics, the collective bargaining negotiations.

588
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:09,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that's been a difficult issue here in Medford, as it has been in a number of other communities.

589
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:22,397
[SPEAKER_13]: So looking at those contractual agreements and the potential constraints or advantages that those present, as well as some school committee policies, and then I provided overall recommendations at the conclusion of the report.

590
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:41,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on to a couple of pieces that I would like to highlight without going through the 59 pages of the report as a whole here tonight publicly, I think a key piece that really is important to acknowledge are the leadership transitions that have happened over the course of the past seven or eight years.

591
00:52:41,606 --> 00:52:51,913
[SPEAKER_13]: And I provided you with the slide that's on the screen right now, a grid that shows the different district level positions, as well as the high school specific positions

592
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:54,194
[SPEAKER_13]: And the transitions that have occurred in those areas.

593
00:52:54,594 --> 00:53:13,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think anyone can see that there have been a tremendous number of changes in the personnel, not to mention the coven pandemic that we can all talk about exacerbating some of this, but I think it's important to note that is there is only one single person who has remained consistent over the course of the eight years that are in that study.

594
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:23,295
[SPEAKER_13]: that creates a tremendous amount of need for there to be a lot of conversation and teamwork so everyone's on the same page.

595
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:30,465
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is almost impossible during a COVID pandemic when students are fully remote and then in hybrid format.

596
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:42,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I provided a brief snapshot of an original proposal for the consolidating emerging of Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

597
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:44,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I received this from Stacey Shulman.

598
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:50,036
[SPEAKER_13]: She had found it when she was in the position that she is currently in.

599
00:53:50,796 --> 00:53:57,940
[SPEAKER_13]: And I asked her if she had a copy of it electronically, she did not, but I found it to be very informative in terms of

600
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:09,264
[SPEAKER_13]: what the goals were when this process started way back in the 2013, around that time period, and what the ideal sequence would be.

601
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:18,927
[SPEAKER_13]: So I only had a paper copy of this, and I went back to Stacy to see if we could dig up the actual electronic copy, we could not, but I thought it important

602
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:31,139
[SPEAKER_13]: that the committee see this and that we use it as a basis for what the vision was essentially back when Heidi Rick Riccio and john Perella were both the principal and director of the schools.

603
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I then went into a lot about student demographics and.

604
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:43,760
[SPEAKER_13]: if you can see, this is a sea of numbers, but you hopefully are able to see it a little bit better in the actual report.

605
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:55,947
[SPEAKER_13]: And essentially what I did was go back to 30 years ago when the Department of Education started requiring public schools to submit data around their student enrollments.

606
00:54:56,528 --> 00:55:05,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I did was look at that not only as an enrollment history from in that 30 year period, but also the number of students in each of the grades as well as

607
00:55:06,354 --> 00:55:13,500
[SPEAKER_13]: the Curtis Tufts School and the vocational technical versus Medford High School breakdown.

608
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,245
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought that an interesting piece to provide historical perspective for all of you.

609
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:26,791
[SPEAKER_13]: The yellow diagonals represent the cohorts classes as they transition through the district.

610
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:30,714
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's often convenient to look at the number of students who started out

611
00:55:31,154 --> 00:55:36,515
[SPEAKER_13]: in kindergarten and first grade, and ultimately how many students ended up graduating as seniors.

612
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:41,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I wanted to highlight for everyone some student demographic trends.

613
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this would not surprise any of you that are here tonight.

614
00:55:46,357 --> 00:55:53,139
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, there's been a significant amount of change in the demographics of the student population.

615
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:59,180
[SPEAKER_13]: So what this chart shows is the percentage of students in each of these categories

616
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:06,964
[SPEAKER_13]: that are traditionally measured by the Department of Education, and I think it's important to point out a couple of things.

617
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:10,705
[SPEAKER_13]: First, the Department of Education has changed the way that they

618
00:56:12,128 --> 00:56:16,170
[SPEAKER_13]: that they code individual students when they come in, what the options are.

619
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:20,492
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can see that the population in Medford has diversified quite a bit.

620
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:26,776
[SPEAKER_13]: These are in about five year increments when you read from left to right going backward.

621
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:32,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanted everybody to see exactly what the demographics of the student population look like.

622
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:34,780
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see some confusing information around

623
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,442
[SPEAKER_13]: ways to categorize students by income level.

624
00:56:38,883 --> 00:56:51,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important to note that these were changes that occurred at the Department of Education, based on the way that kids families income could be classified for a while, the free and reduced lunch, where the numbers that were used.

625
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:54,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Eventually, the department went to a category called

626
00:56:55,093 --> 00:57:00,575
[SPEAKER_13]: economically disadvantaged, and you'll see that as one of the categories in 2017-18.

627
00:57:00,995 --> 00:57:06,577
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, the Department of Education has reverted back to a low-income status.

628
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:10,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll see some changes in there, and I wanted to point out why that occurred.

629
00:57:10,918 --> 00:57:14,860
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing that I really would like you to notice is the percentage of high-need students.

630
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,922
[SPEAKER_13]: High-need students are classified by the Department of Education in one of three categories, either students with disabilities,

631
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:27,914
[SPEAKER_13]: students that are English learners or former English learners, and students who are low income.

632
00:57:28,454 --> 00:57:33,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So a student can be classified as high needs if they have any one of those characteristics.

633
00:57:34,436 --> 00:57:38,317
[SPEAKER_13]: If they have all three of them, they're still only counted as one high need student.

634
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:41,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's important for folks on the committee to understand that.

635
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:48,241
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really good to look at historically where the district has gone, because that can give you a sense of where the district is headed.

636
00:57:49,324 --> 00:57:54,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I want to contrast that with the demographics of the teacher force.

637
00:57:54,748 --> 00:57:59,691
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I want to make sure that the committee knows this is not unique to Medford.

638
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:09,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Having worked in a number of different districts, there are very few districts in Massachusetts whose demographics reflect even remotely close to the demographics of their students.

639
00:58:10,078 --> 00:58:17,903
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't want you to beat yourselves up and think that we haven't done our work here, because there are virtually no districts that are successful at this.

640
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:19,124
[SPEAKER_13]: As many of you are aware,

641
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:28,554
[SPEAKER_13]: the Boston Public Schools has a mandate for the percentage of teachers of color, they have struggled to meet that mandate over time.

642
00:58:28,994 --> 00:58:35,901
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it is important to point out the stark difference between the demographics of our teaching force and our student population.

643
00:58:36,322 --> 00:58:41,387
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I could say that there were a solution here that could make this turnaround very quickly.

644
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:48,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I know many districts are working in this area, but I think when you look at the numbers, there is a tremendous difference.

645
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:58,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And I provided simply the data from 2007-8 and current most recent data that we have from 2021-22.

646
00:58:59,104 --> 00:59:05,551
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't provide all of the other areas in between, because essentially there has been very little change in the demographics of the teaching force.

647
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:18,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I think it's important to recognize that the vision of having a more combined Medford high school and Medford vocational technical high school over the course of the past 10 years.

648
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:25,911
[SPEAKER_13]: has created increasing student enrollment in the vocational technical edge of the house, if you will.

649
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:34,797
[SPEAKER_13]: This graph was presented at a faculty meeting late last year, and it shows the increasing percentage of students only in grades 10 through 12.

650
00:59:35,357 --> 00:59:43,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, this does not include ninth grade students, but the overall number of students that are progressing toward a career in technical education,

651
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:45,803
[SPEAKER_13]: education.

652
00:59:46,264 --> 01:00:00,009
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted you to see that those numbers are increasing, and I believe students are recognizing the value in that form of additional training, yet that creates some challenges for the school because of the scheduling conflicts that come into play.

653
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:06,872
[SPEAKER_13]: And I won't go deeply into that tonight because I think the report does that a little better, but I think that's a critical area that needs to be addressed.

654
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:22,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I delved into discipline data, and I think it's important to recognize that what I did was look at every single discipline referral that came in from January 3rd to February 17th.

655
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:37,894
[SPEAKER_13]: And those numbers I broke down by the house that the student was in, because as you know, the high school is structured in houses M, H, and S. Each house has four grades, and about one third of the students

656
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:44,718
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important to look at the total referrals that came in and the number of students that were involved.

657
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:49,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So about 80% of kids had no referrals whatsoever, which is typical.

658
01:00:50,622 --> 01:01:00,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very frequent that the vast majority of kids are doing the right thing and really not causing any sorts of need to be addressed in any way.

659
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:07,734
[SPEAKER_13]: About 20% of kids had one form of referral or another, and a very small percentage of kids had quite a few.

660
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:09,756
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is not unique.

661
01:01:10,477 --> 01:01:25,857
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, I provided a little snapshot your report has much more in depth analysis of what the referrals were for Dr cushion if you just click one more, it provides this is just the top 15 reasons why students were referred.

662
01:01:26,357 --> 01:01:36,967
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's very easy to see that the vast number of referrals for disciplinary action were for kids who simply were avoiding going to class.

663
01:01:37,787 --> 01:01:43,012
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is not a surprise, and again, not something that is unique to Medford High School.

664
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:52,501
[SPEAKER_13]: In my conversations with other schools in the metropolitan Boston area, this has become a significant challenge across the state and the region.

665
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:56,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't want everyone to believe that this is completely unique.

666
01:01:57,002 --> 01:01:59,383
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it's very clear what's going on.

667
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:09,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe this is a result of the pandemic and kids having the opportunity to not be told what to do for a significant chunk of time during a developmentally difficult period.

668
01:02:09,785 --> 01:02:15,346
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it's created a situation where kids who don't wanna go to a class they don't wanna go to, don't go.

669
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And they figure out a way to try to avoid that.

670
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:22,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a challenge administratively to try to address those issues.

671
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:26,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I'll just jump into recommendations and call it quits and answer questions.

672
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:31,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, there are, I believe, 11 different recommendations that are in here.

673
01:02:31,454 --> 01:02:45,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Embedded within these are some multifaceted pieces along the way, but one of the most critical issues I believe the district and the high school specifically have to address is the collective bargaining agreements and the move toward a unified schedule.

674
01:02:45,905 --> 01:03:02,410
[SPEAKER_13]: This was something that was mentioned in the initial vision for having some kind of collaboration between the two schools and it continues to be a challenge and it will continue to grow as a challenge as more students choose the vocational technical track.

675
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:12,153
[SPEAKER_13]: The schedule, I'm sorry, the contract that was settled in December this year has within it some language that acknowledges the need to do this.

676
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:25,806
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the time is right to aggressively pursue a schedule that is unified and it can be done that works for everyone in those two schools, but that's going to take some significant discussion.

677
01:03:26,546 --> 01:03:31,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, I think it's critical that a clear district safety and security leadership team

678
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:32,212
[SPEAKER_13]: is established.

679
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:35,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the superintendent and I have talked about this a good bit.

680
01:03:35,134 --> 01:03:50,107
[SPEAKER_13]: There have been groups that meet on a regular basis, but I think that needs to be expanded and codified in a way that is much more deliberate about the way the school and district prepare in any sort of safety or security event.

681
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:55,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three is providing additional support for assistant principals in each house.

682
01:03:56,023 --> 01:04:01,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I think most members of the committee are aware there had been a staffing reduction in the not too recent past.

683
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:09,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And with two of the three assistant principals new within the past three years, that has created just an overwhelming amount of work.

684
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,122
[SPEAKER_13]: for them to be able to address, and it is simply unsustainable.

685
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:17,363
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe there needs to be additional support in that position.

686
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, creating collaborative norms for student behavior.

687
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:28,328
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an overwhelming amount of feeling amongst educators and folks I met with that people aren't being listened to.

688
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:35,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I believe a good bit of that is a result of the acrimonious contract negotiations that the district is just coming off of.

689
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:38,833
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not unusual to see people feeling unheard

690
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:42,916
[SPEAKER_13]: particularly in the context of a contract negotiation year.

691
01:04:43,437 --> 01:04:57,789
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I believe it's really important to come together and create those collaborative norms in a collaborative way so that everyone has consensus and everyone feels an ownership in acting those out.

692
01:04:58,706 --> 01:05:04,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, the fifth recommendation I made is creating a building wide associate principal role.

693
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:18,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this is asking for additional staffing, but I believe that currently, Principal DeLava and a number of other folks are doing work that is not at the level of a leader's responsibility.

694
01:05:18,716 --> 01:05:24,318
[SPEAKER_13]: For instance, the scheduling process is primarily scheduled by Mr. DeLeva himself.

695
01:05:25,078 --> 01:05:29,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Assignment of substitute teachers on a daily basis, that has been really problematic.

696
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:36,721
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a number of roles that have evaporated over time that I believe should be consolidated in one role.

697
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:40,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, establishing a faculty homeroom advisory committee.

698
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:49,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Homeroom advisory is a great program that is recommended by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges as a part of an accreditation process.

699
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:53,076
[SPEAKER_13]: However, right now it is a missed opportunity.

700
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:59,623
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an opportunity to provide better training and better service for kids through the use of a collaborative committee.

701
01:06:00,512 --> 01:06:05,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, providing individual and collective mentoring for assistant principals and deans.

702
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:10,756
[SPEAKER_13]: The dean position is a proposal I made that I believe could be very, very impactful.

703
01:06:11,296 --> 01:06:19,379
[SPEAKER_13]: And some mentoring for those folks in those roles who in many instances have not been in that role for more than a couple of years.

704
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:28,042
[SPEAKER_13]: And during COVID, there was precious little opportunity to get on the same page about what those roles should do and communicate that well across the school.

705
01:06:28,797 --> 01:06:33,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, number eight, recruit, train, and hire four building-based permanent substitute teachers.

706
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:41,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Over and over, teachers lamented that they are being pulled from their preparation time to cover classes for teachers who are absent.

707
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:44,426
[SPEAKER_13]: While they were willing to do it, it is not their first choice.

708
01:06:45,006 --> 01:06:52,590
[SPEAKER_13]: And as we all know, the labor market is extremely tight, and it's very hard to find people to fill substitute teaching roles.

709
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:56,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the amount that the district is spending to cover those,

710
01:06:57,393 --> 01:07:05,318
[SPEAKER_13]: classes using current teachers and paying them for their prep would be more than enough to cover four positions of that nature.

711
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:12,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have those numbers for you in terms of what it's costing, but I think a review of that would validate my belief.

712
01:07:14,244 --> 01:07:19,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, the last slide, leadership committee focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

713
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:36,768
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a number of folks within the school who are working valiantly trying to make sure that we are using culturally relevant teaching practices and supporting our students throughout the high school experience in a way that is more inclusive.

714
01:07:37,188 --> 01:07:41,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that a formal committee around that work would be an important next step.

715
01:07:42,918 --> 01:07:50,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Number 10 should come as a surprise to no one, aggressively pursuing an MSBA, Master School Building Authority core program grant.

716
01:07:51,502 --> 01:08:00,547
[SPEAKER_13]: The high school is not getting any younger and is a very, very large cabiners facility that is showing its age.

717
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:03,929
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are a number of aspects that need one replacement.

718
01:08:04,009 --> 01:08:05,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know the committee is aware of that.

719
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:08,411
[SPEAKER_13]: I think continuing to aggressively pursue that is important.

720
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,392
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, leveraging the existing administrative vacancies.

721
01:08:12,552 --> 01:08:22,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the course of my time in the school, it became clear to me, I became aware that there are a number of administrative vacancies that now are about to be filled.

722
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:29,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's really important to get that next leadership team together and provide them the support that they need to move forward.

723
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,438
[SPEAKER_13]: And I provided one last slide with those administrative vacancies listed.

724
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:38,342
[SPEAKER_13]: for the 2023-2024 school year as of, this is as of a few weeks ago.

725
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:43,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Prior to April break, I was traveling and during the break was not around.

726
01:08:43,527 --> 01:08:49,092
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that explains a little bit of why this proposal is coming, this report is coming to at this time.

727
01:08:49,973 --> 01:08:51,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And really, I'm not gonna speak anymore.

728
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:53,175
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably more than 10 minutes.

729
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll go to the next slide, which is questions and next steps.

730
01:08:56,957 --> 01:09:00,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions the committee has developed.

731
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:12,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I wanna thank the Medford Public Schools for being proactive and allowing me the opportunity to come and aggressively analyze its systems.

732
01:09:13,127 --> 01:09:15,389
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope that this has been helpful to the group.

733
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:16,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

734
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:17,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Welch.

735
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

736
01:09:20,154 --> 01:09:20,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

737
01:09:21,134 --> 01:09:22,195
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a lot to digest.

738
01:09:23,015 --> 01:09:25,976
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have an awful lot of sticky notes probably more than we have time.

739
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,196
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have two corrections on page 51.

740
01:09:28,356 --> 01:09:36,199
[SPEAKER_16]: It says that we approved the resolution on October 14 2021 we actually approved it on October 14 2020.

741
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:40,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the minutes here.

742
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,481
[SPEAKER_16]: And on page 52 it says October 2022 and it's actually October 2020.

743
01:09:48,200 --> 01:10:03,370
[SPEAKER_16]: It's quite relevant that this committee, when we made changes to the discipline policy, put a very long runway to implementation, because we were not ignorant of the fact that we were making substantial changes and the district needed time to prepare.

744
01:10:04,391 --> 01:10:08,073
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that having those dates be correct is really quite important.

745
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:11,696
[SPEAKER_16]: But those are the two easiest things I'll have to say.

746
01:10:13,324 --> 01:10:21,788
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, Mr. Russo, thank you for that because part of my task was going in and looking at school committee policies that were relevant.

747
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:26,650
[SPEAKER_13]: And I may have simply misnumbered or misread some of that.

748
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:32,493
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were a couple pieces in there that I think were recommendations that the school committee is within your purview.

749
01:10:33,594 --> 01:10:39,699
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't want to imply that there was not sufficient conversation in my conversations with Principal DeLeva.

750
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:44,123
[SPEAKER_13]: He mentioned a number of opportunities for there to be input around those policies.

751
01:10:44,383 --> 01:10:45,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

752
01:10:45,103 --> 01:10:51,889
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I did find the Google Doc that has the policy that a copy of which was probably given to you.

753
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:53,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And it does say October 14, 2021.

754
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:54,191
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just wrong.

755
01:10:57,556 --> 01:10:59,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so you didn't make that up.

756
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:02,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, but I found the minutes and we did in fact approve it in 2020.

757
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:15,795
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just confused because in the resolution it said, and in May of 2021 you'll bring your recommendations for any additional funding or anything that you need, which makes no sense that we would say to do that in the past.

758
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:18,898
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what confused me but anyways.

759
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:20,679
[SPEAKER_16]: So as for.

760
01:11:22,523 --> 01:11:23,504
[SPEAKER_16]: What to say?

761
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:31,309
[SPEAKER_16]: I will tell you that this is my sixth year on the school committee, and I learned a lot about the high school from your report.

762
01:11:31,349 --> 01:11:42,717
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to really thank you for that because my kids were not in high school when I first got on the school committee, and I didn't go to the high school.

763
01:11:43,117 --> 01:11:48,041
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is weird lens of a parent, a parent whose kid goes during the pandemic.

764
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:51,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And while I can see an org chart,

765
01:11:52,068 --> 01:11:54,789
[SPEAKER_16]: really understanding how everything fits together.

766
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Your report does a fabulous job of that.

767
01:11:58,972 --> 01:12:04,454
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little embarrassing that after six years, I'm learning this much about the high school, but I greatly appreciate it.

768
01:12:04,474 --> 01:12:12,138
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have, it's like how to approach this.

769
01:12:12,178 --> 01:12:14,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I have too many sticky notes and there's a lot of us.

770
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:20,903
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have two motions that I'll make because in your recommendations around policies, I thought both of those things

771
01:12:21,613 --> 01:12:22,413
[SPEAKER_16]: really excellent.

772
01:12:23,994 --> 01:12:38,541
[SPEAKER_16]: I was a little disappointed that there was a lot of confusion about the discipline policy as well as the dress code policy, considering every single school leader across the district was present for every single subcommittee meeting or committee of the whole we had on it.

773
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:49,626
[SPEAKER_16]: And so when they literally are present and paying attention, we're on zoom, we all knew we were paying attention to have that message

774
01:12:50,683 --> 01:13:14,838
[SPEAKER_16]: somehow missed really, it really bothers me a lot actually, that the people who sat in the meetings spoke on the topics themselves, somehow walked away and were unable to communicate to our teachers and the rest of the staff what the policy was, or communicated something different than what they in fact had heard and even spoken about.

775
01:13:14,938 --> 01:13:16,899
[SPEAKER_16]: So that part really,

776
01:13:17,455 --> 01:13:21,616
[SPEAKER_16]: disappoints me, I know that's a reality, and this is not the first time I'm hearing about it.

777
01:13:22,616 --> 01:13:35,380
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think it's, I think it's really a disservice that the teaching staff and the rest of the staff didn't have that message coming down strong and firm as to what the policy was.

778
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:41,241
[SPEAKER_16]: The issue of hats and hoods, the reason we actually brought the policy up was about hats and hoods.

779
01:13:41,321 --> 01:13:44,362
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked about hats and hoods to the point where I wanna just

780
01:13:45,416 --> 01:14:01,427
[SPEAKER_16]: smacked my head into a wall about hats and hoods, and that anybody who works for Bedford Public Schools is confused about whether hats and hoods are allowed, is really very, very concerning about our ability to communicate to our staff what the policies are.

781
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:07,111
[SPEAKER_16]: We, as the school committee, are barred from communicating with the staff about what our policies are.

782
01:14:07,832 --> 01:14:08,973
[SPEAKER_16]: That's against the law.

783
01:14:09,113 --> 01:14:13,696
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't send an email to the teaching staff and say, here's the policy that we passed.

784
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:14,837
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not allowed.

785
01:14:16,138 --> 01:14:20,579
[SPEAKER_16]: We passed the policy and the superintendent and her staff get that message out.

786
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,039
[SPEAKER_16]: And the message did not get out.

787
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:42,803
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's really unfortunate that the teaching staff is sort of left to just wonder this description of piles of backpacks stacked outside of some teachers' classrooms and not others, that could be solved in an email in five minutes.

788
01:14:44,617 --> 01:14:48,539
[SPEAKER_16]: And here we are a year and a half after that policy went into effect.

789
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:57,042
[SPEAKER_16]: So there was a lot in your email that was upsetting and that it was often very easy to solve, but still hasn't been solved.

790
01:14:59,383 --> 01:15:03,524
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll let my colleagues have a chance cause I could go on all night, but thank you for that.

791
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:04,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the motions.

792
01:15:05,465 --> 01:15:09,407
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll make my motions cause I think they're totally non-controversial and I won't want to forget them.

793
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:20,236
[SPEAKER_16]: The first motion is that the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will provide recommendations for changes to the dress code policy that clarify the carrying of backpacks at Medford High School.

794
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:24,640
[SPEAKER_16]: This recommendation will be returned to this body by June 30th, 2023.

795
01:15:26,682 --> 01:15:35,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will provide recommendations for changes to the dress code policy that clarify the carrying of backpacks at Medford High School.

796
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:38,592
[SPEAKER_16]: This recommendation will be returned to this body by June 30th, 2023.

797

[SPEAKER_16]: Members, so yes, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

809

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative.

810
01:16:17,862 --> 01:16:18,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

811
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:28,649
[SPEAKER_16]: And the second policy, second motion is that the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will provide recommendations for changes to the dress code policy to clarify the wearing of hats and hoods.

812
01:16:28,929 --> 01:16:31,511
[SPEAKER_16]: This recommendation will be returned to this body by June 30th, 2023.

813
01:16:35,782 --> 01:16:38,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

01:16:41,186 --> 01:16:41,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:52,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

827
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:53,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

828
01:16:53,557 --> 01:16:54,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Langaudere.

829
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:54,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

830
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:56,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

831
01:16:56,799 --> 01:16:57,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

832
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

833
01:16:59,842 --> 01:17:00,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions.

834
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:00,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

835
01:17:02,504 --> 01:17:03,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your report.

836
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:10,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have a lot of questions and I'm trying to think about where to begin.

837
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:34,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the things that came out in your report was this idea that the assistant principals are overburdened in their caseload, and you go on to recommend some strategies to provide additional staff to support them.

838
01:17:35,642 --> 01:17:38,364
[SPEAKER_07]: You also recommend an associate principal.

839
01:17:38,384 --> 01:17:50,691
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think within your report, you say that there's approximately three to 500 students for an administrator and that our assistant principals have 400 students.

840
01:17:50,891 --> 01:17:55,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm just, I'm trying to piece it all together because when I got to page 54,

841
01:18:03,631 --> 01:18:09,795
[SPEAKER_07]: M55, where you talked about some of the duties of a potential position for an associate principal.

842
01:18:09,995 --> 01:18:15,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I just was left wondering, what does the principal even do if all these other people are doing all these other things?

843
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:27,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a pile of department directors who I think really, at least in my mind, are responsible for some amount of instructional leadership within their own departments.

844
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:29,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what does the org chart look like?

845
01:18:32,276 --> 01:18:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: in its totality.

846
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:41,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't disagree per se with any independent thing that you suggested we explore.

847
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:51,021
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what I'm really looking for is a cohesive picture of what a successful Medford high school slash Medford public schools might look like.

848
01:18:51,281 --> 01:18:54,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has to include all of the department heads.

849
01:18:54,122 --> 01:18:58,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to include all of the assistant principals and what their responsibilities are.

850
01:18:58,323 --> 01:19:00,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll talk about job descriptions later and all that good stuff.

851
01:19:02,578 --> 01:19:06,399
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not my sense there aren't enough adults in the building to do the things.

852
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe I'm completely wrong about that.

853
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just didn't jump off the page at me.

854
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:22,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what is the reconciliation of what all the things that you're recommending and how the total delivery of duties would parse out?

855
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:29,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is there something else that is contributing to their workload that doesn't come across in those like caseload numbers?

856
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:43,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I would respond by saying there are directors that are K through 12 in their responsibility that are primarily in the academic departments, and they have a district wide level of responsibility.

857
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:49,296
[SPEAKER_13]: They are not involved in the student discipline and behavior end of the house.

858
01:19:49,856 --> 01:19:55,479
[SPEAKER_13]: And that has, I think, many aspects of why the culture and climate is where it is right now.

859
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:16,497
[SPEAKER_13]: responsibility falls on to those three individuals, primarily, I think the district has invested in additional social emotional support for students in the form of Councilors and psychologists and social workers, and that has is laudable, but the first line of defense is always those assistant principals I think your question is a good one.

860
01:20:17,277 --> 01:20:31,271
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we prioritize our resources and look to make that a comprehensive review, because right now the K through 12 directors primarily are not responsible for student discipline and student behavior.

861
01:20:31,611 --> 01:20:35,895
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of times I asked teachers, who do you go to when you need help.

862
01:20:36,836 --> 01:20:52,946
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're having trouble with classroom management, who do you go to, and teachers did not immediately say I go to my department head or my K through 12 director that was not typically the response I received it was, we go to the vice principal or the assistant principal I'm sorry.

863
01:20:53,486 --> 01:21:05,910
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think there's some delegation of duties in there that could happen in the way that if I'm a new teacher, how do I deal with classroom management issues in my class?

864
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:13,313
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of that must fall onto the teacher training, the mentoring program, and the responsibility of those K-12 directors.

865
01:21:13,593 --> 01:21:20,375
[SPEAKER_13]: But the teachers themselves, the ones that I spoke with, did not see that person as the one to go to in that instance.

866
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:29,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I can totally understand that because it's, I guess my thought is if you look at the role of the department heads, they're instructional leaders.

867
01:21:30,322 --> 01:21:43,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And so by extension, the role of the assistant principal is much more narrow as an instructional leader so that they have time to adequately be the disciplinarians in the building, right?

868
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:50,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't, I wouldn't expect anybody to go to their department head when they have a classroom management issue or a student issue.

869
01:21:51,173 --> 01:22:01,357
[SPEAKER_07]: But like the folks that are responsible for those things, I think, should have increased capacity if they're not carrying an instructional leadership role at the same time.

870
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:09,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like the bigger picture that I think we need to be clear about in what the responsibilities are.

871
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, I was left reading after I read, I was like, well, what is the principal even do at this point?

872
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:16,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not to suggest we don't need a principal.

873
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:17,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We absolutely need a principal.

874
01:22:17,723 --> 01:22:33,254
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we need a principal and we need an associate principal and we need an executive director at the Vogue and we need assistant principal at the Vogue and we need three assistant principals at the high school and we need deans of students in a part-time capacity to support them all.

875
01:22:33,614 --> 01:22:41,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is that a typical amount of people administering essentially

876
01:22:42,028 --> 01:22:49,115
[SPEAKER_07]: like discipline and overall school management for building of our size, it seemed like that's the question that's unanswered.

877
01:22:49,996 --> 01:23:02,588
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think I would, I would argue, in addition, your initial comment about why a teacher would not go to their department chair if they're having classroom management issues, I think that is a responsibility.

878
01:23:03,172 --> 01:23:08,074
[SPEAKER_13]: of the department head director as overall instruction in a classroom.

879
01:23:08,474 --> 01:23:14,057
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a critical piece that right now teachers, I don't believe see that person in that capacity, but they should.

880
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,378
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an example of one way that this can happen.

881
01:23:17,438 --> 01:23:23,501
[SPEAKER_13]: For instance, I'm struggling with my, you know, period two geometry class there, they're misbehaving.

882
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:26,202
[SPEAKER_13]: department chair, why don't you come in and look with me?

883
01:23:27,022 --> 01:23:33,003
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, assistant principals are also evaluators for a huge number of staff.

884
01:23:33,683 --> 01:23:37,664
[SPEAKER_13]: So the evaluation responsibility also falls onto the assistant principals.

885
01:23:38,345 --> 01:23:44,626
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're usually collaborating with the K through 12 directors in that capacity, but it is still an additional obligation.

886
01:23:45,266 --> 01:23:48,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say yes, that the addition of deans

887
01:23:48,747 --> 01:23:56,554
[SPEAKER_13]: is an additional resource that I think is critical given the current state of the number of discipline referrals that are coming in.

888
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:00,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say, yes, that is a generous staffing.

889
01:24:00,478 --> 01:24:14,571
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not disagreeing with you in that capacity, but I think given the current state of where the school is, I think it's appropriate to not have an under-resourced situation to make sure that stabilizes because some of this is a result of turnover.

890
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:31,112
[SPEAKER_13]: There has been significant turnover in those positions, and I think we've lost our sense of what is referral based when should I write a referral, what should I do in this instance, and there are some instances where teachers are filling out a tremendous number of referrals, more than one a day.

891
01:24:31,993 --> 01:24:35,814
[SPEAKER_13]: and the assistant principals are just completely overwhelmed with that.

892
01:24:35,874 --> 01:24:38,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And that frustration I think needs to be addressed.

893
01:24:38,195 --> 01:24:46,158
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess I'm saying, yes, I agree with you to an extent, but I think resourcing that part of the school right now is critical moving forward.

894
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:46,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

895
01:24:46,638 --> 01:24:59,262
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may piggyback on that member Graham, because I think you answered the question for the most part, but is that the staffing levels for other high schools or

896
01:25:00,379 --> 01:25:10,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an issue with the fact that we need to mentor we need to train we need to hold people accountable, we need to professionalize the organization, which one is it.

897
01:25:12,082 --> 01:25:23,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's both in the sense that all of those pieces that you just mentioned, clarifying roles, making sure there's good leadership around explaining what the role is of the assistant principal.

898
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:24,451
[SPEAKER_13]: When do you have a referral?

899
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:25,051
[SPEAKER_13]: When do you not?

900
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:26,412
[SPEAKER_13]: When do you deal with that on your own?

901
01:25:26,932 --> 01:25:35,258
[SPEAKER_13]: That aspect of things does need to be clarified and it needs to be a smooth, consistent message across the organization.

902
01:25:36,099 --> 01:25:37,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

903
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:38,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

904
01:25:39,631 --> 01:25:55,512
[SPEAKER_07]: On the topic of referrals, I think the other thing that struck me was frankly how unmanageable this list of potential referral reasons is like there's like 17 different ways to call somebody cut in class and 17 is an exaggeration, but there were many and.

905
01:25:57,981 --> 01:26:00,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It just, it's way too complicated.

906
01:26:00,844 --> 01:26:03,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that makes everybody's job harder.

907
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:17,256
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was really struck by the fact that in, you know, in your 32 day period, 27% of teachers submitted no referrals.

908
01:26:17,556 --> 01:26:19,458
[SPEAKER_07]: 27% of teachers submitted one to three.

909
01:26:20,839 --> 01:26:26,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the like zero to nine referrals submitted in 30 days, that's 80% of our teaching staff.

910
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:29,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and I guess my question in that group is.

911
01:26:31,028 --> 01:26:48,601
[SPEAKER_07]: are they not submitting it because they gave up, or are they not submitting and they're just not doing it, which I have heard repeatedly, and it is so frustrating and something that needs to be addressed, or are they not doing it because they don't have these issues in their classroom?

912
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:58,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I can't parse that from this information, and I suspect you'd have to go back and talk to people, but I don't know if you had an overall like sense of like,

913
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:02,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Where does that like fall line sort of draw?

914
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:03,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

915
01:27:03,662 --> 01:27:06,725
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all of those pieces that you mentioned are a part of this.

916
01:27:07,025 --> 01:27:11,270
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some teachers who said, I don't bother filling out referrals anymore because I never know what's going to happen.

917
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:14,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't, there's no consistency around the reaction.

918
01:27:14,694 --> 01:27:16,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Other teachers do all of this work themselves.

919
01:27:17,637 --> 01:27:25,103
[SPEAKER_13]: They make calls they stay they keep kids after school they talk to kids after class they speak with parents, they do a lot of that work on their own.

920
01:27:25,923 --> 01:27:33,329
[SPEAKER_13]: And some decide that that's a more effective way to do it, depending upon the type of class and the age of the student, there are some classes that

921
01:27:33,829 --> 01:27:45,063
[SPEAKER_13]: teachers workloads are simply not in a situation where they're struggling, that the kids are, by and large, able to much more aptly go through their day without creating issues there.

922
01:27:45,704 --> 01:27:51,591
[SPEAKER_13]: The kids were very honest with me, they said when they don't like going to class they don't necessarily like the teachers they don't go.

923
01:27:52,532 --> 01:28:05,224
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, I did say to groups of students, suppose all of you next period, after we finish our, I'm your substitute teacher and I'm having this conversation with you, suppose all of you didn't go to class the rest of the day, what would happen?

924
01:28:06,098 --> 01:28:09,921
[SPEAKER_13]: and they had all different answers as to what could happen.

925
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:13,865
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of them admitted, yeah, there are classes I don't go to, because I don't like the class.

926
01:28:14,425 --> 01:28:15,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Where do you go?

927
01:28:15,266 --> 01:28:19,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I go wherever I can, where there's not an adult, and I can find a place to hide.

928
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:29,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And the response to that in some instances, yeah, the assistant principal got on top of it, called me down, called my parents, had a meeting, and that's the way it should work.

929
01:28:29,298 --> 01:28:32,201
[SPEAKER_13]: The volume is such that it's just not possible.

930
01:28:33,906 --> 01:28:50,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I have heard that, you know, from a whole variety of sources, and I hope that we can move to a place where not liking a class or a teacher is not a thing our kids have to experience in Medford Public Schools.

931
01:28:52,452 --> 01:29:02,755
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I guess the other thing that I'll say as I read this and really your entire report is that the failures that we're experiencing are all

932
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:04,735
[SPEAKER_07]: implementation failures.

933
01:29:05,196 --> 01:29:14,880
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all failures of implementation, the dress code, the house model, student discipline, the referral model being wildly complex, returning to school post COVID.

934
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:22,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say the school committee wouldn't let us discipline students on the return to school.

935
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:29,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've had a lot of hours of meetings and I don't ever, I really, truly don't ever remember that being said.

936
01:29:31,184 --> 01:29:50,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And certainly there is nothing in writing to substantiate that, that I was able to find because I did a little bit of digging, but even, you know, emergency preparedness, all these things, something is missing in terms of how directives get implemented or not.

937
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:58,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is the central thing that has to change at the high school in order to move the high school past where it is.

938
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:00,472
[SPEAKER_07]: The dress code,

939
01:30:01,004 --> 01:30:01,964
[SPEAKER_07]: was not unclear.

940
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:04,506
[SPEAKER_07]: The dress code was quite clear.

941
01:30:05,046 --> 01:30:06,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody was involved.

942
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:09,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Many, many meetings.

943
01:30:10,328 --> 01:30:13,189
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked extensively about hats and hoods.

944
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:17,191
[SPEAKER_07]: That there's any confusion is absolutely mind blowing to me.

945
01:30:18,572 --> 01:30:22,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the only answer there is that the implementation failed.

946
01:30:24,014 --> 01:30:27,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That there's this confusion that the handbook says something that is in conflict with the policy.

947
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:29,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, these are the kinds of things that

948
01:30:30,543 --> 01:30:42,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You know they, I think they seem small at the time but they're really, really important when you want to sort of move six or eight or 12 months down the road from a change and say did it work.

949
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:50,556
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer will always be no if you don't take the time to implement without exception.

950
01:30:52,217 --> 01:31:00,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last thing I'll say is I actually enjoyed the picture of your model and the consequence of lacking various components.

951
01:31:01,444 --> 01:31:08,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if you use that model and you look at any of the challenges we have, you can really clearly point out what was missing.

952
01:31:13,573 --> 01:31:15,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not a surprise that we're struggling.

953
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:18,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do thank you for this report.

954
01:31:18,877 --> 01:31:27,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am, I just finished serving on the principal selection committee and I'm really hopeful about our candidates for next year.

955
01:31:27,745 --> 01:31:36,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm entirely on board with making sure that that incoming principal has the resources that they need to really make a difference here.

956
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:38,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

957
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:42,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays and member McLaughlin.

958
01:31:43,442 --> 01:31:44,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And then member grants.

959
01:31:44,743 --> 01:31:45,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

960
01:31:45,823 --> 01:31:46,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

961
01:31:47,104 --> 01:31:55,809
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I really appreciated about your report and member so kind of already spoke to some of this was the history you gave because I certainly did not.

962
01:31:56,650 --> 01:32:01,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I have new bits and pieces of the history and, but having it all put together.

963
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:12,358
[SPEAKER_04]: really helped a lot to provide some context to some of the issues that we're having, because they're not just based on what's happening right now or even in the past two years.

964
01:32:12,798 --> 01:32:18,100
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of history behind all of that that leads us to where we are today.

965
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:30,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that struck me a lot was the turnover, the amazing turnover in the various administrative positions, because it's very hard to implement or to get

966
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:36,051
[SPEAKER_04]: anything to stick if you don't have some consistency in those positions.

967
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm wondering, did you have a sense, well, two questions I'm wondering, and one of them may not be exactly for you.

968
01:32:43,393 --> 01:32:53,135
[SPEAKER_04]: One, do we do exit interviews when people leave so we can have a sense of, is there some pattern, something we can understand to why we seem to have so much turnover?

969
01:32:54,895 --> 01:32:58,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get a sense from any of the people you talked to who maybe knew some of these people

970
01:32:59,631 --> 01:33:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: was there any sense of why we seem to have so much turnover?

971
01:33:02,653 --> 01:33:06,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess in your experience, is that amount of turnover typical?

972
01:33:06,476 --> 01:33:14,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a lot of administrative turnover at all levels of K to 12 education, but that just feels like so much.

973
01:33:14,782 --> 01:33:28,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you think of the things that we haven't been able to get done, so much of that, when you've got people who are new to the system, and then also some, I think you mentioned some of these people maybe were just even new to that particular position.

974
01:33:29,941 --> 01:33:30,322
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere.

975
01:33:30,842 --> 01:33:47,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to get much traction for things if people are new and just trying to get their bearings and then a couple years later they're gone and somebody new is trying to get their bearings and did you have any sense of what that why that turnover was happening if there was any pattern to that.

976
01:33:47,563 --> 01:33:57,729
[SPEAKER_13]: So typically, just to briefly answer that, I think you're looking at instances where folks are making lateral moves, where they're staying in the same position and simply moving to another district.

977
01:33:57,829 --> 01:33:59,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see that occurring.

978
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:10,136
[SPEAKER_13]: In many instances, I think going back to the previous superintendent's administration, Mr. Belson, there had been such a long period of stability.

979
01:34:10,971 --> 01:34:16,913
[SPEAKER_13]: When that happens, everyone gets used to that because there's familiarity with the individual or individuals.

980
01:34:17,233 --> 01:34:21,234
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there had been a long stretch of tremendous stability.

981
01:34:21,814 --> 01:34:30,696
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you start a little bit of turnover, the whole thing shifts, all of the pieces shift and reconnect and realign.

982
01:34:31,136 --> 01:34:37,718
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there has been a succession of those instances that I think it's more than typical

983
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:50,405
[SPEAKER_13]: for a district like Medford and Medford size, but there is this is an era right now have a lot of instability and a lot of districts, there's a lot of people who are choosing to exit the profession.

984
01:34:50,425 --> 01:34:56,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I teach in a program that recruits teachers to become administrators and people don't want to do it.

985
01:34:57,614 --> 01:35:00,197
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a hard time to be moving in that direction.

986
01:35:00,698 --> 01:35:04,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say Medford has had more than its share of transitions.

987
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:08,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not seen people fleeing because they were unhappy.

988
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:10,131
[SPEAKER_13]: That was not a part of what I saw.

989
01:35:10,531 --> 01:35:14,737
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there are so many people who are so committed to staying in Medford.

990
01:35:15,677 --> 01:35:19,798
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that repeatedly amongst the educators, as well as the support staff.

991
01:35:20,098 --> 01:35:21,138
[SPEAKER_13]: They love working here.

992
01:35:21,919 --> 01:35:26,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them have had a difficult stretch, like everyone has in education over the course of the past three years.

993
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:38,083
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been hard, but there has been, Medford has had more of its share of turnover in strategic positions where there had been a long period of stability.

994
01:35:38,163 --> 01:35:44,044
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think because of that, it's a bit more of a shock for this district than in typical situations.

995
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:56,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've already requested this information from administration, but I'm curious whether you looked at it too.

996
01:35:56,884 --> 01:36:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: The discipline data or the referral, the chart that you have from the period that you were here from January 3rd to February 17th, I think was the stretch of time.

997
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:12,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That, of course, period of time is right after the new procedures were put in place.

998
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious, did you look at all

999
01:36:16,536 --> 01:36:27,004
[SPEAKER_04]: back before those procedures were put in place to see how the data, was it comparable, did anything shift with the new procedures that you noticed?

1000
01:36:27,144 --> 01:36:28,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you did that or not.

1001
01:36:29,354 --> 01:36:36,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and the kids told me it is so much tighter during that stretch than it was prior to that.

1002
01:36:36,919 --> 01:36:38,300
[SPEAKER_13]: And the data bears that out.

1003
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:50,509
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the resources that were devoted to this in terms of mere supervision of the common areas of the building, there was significantly more resources put in place during that stretch.

1004
01:36:50,789 --> 01:36:55,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And that really pushed kids back into classrooms in a way that

1005
01:36:56,072 --> 01:36:58,474
[SPEAKER_13]: they had previously been able to get away with it.

1006
01:36:59,334 --> 01:37:04,797
[SPEAKER_13]: And they admitted that to me, they had seen so much more tightness that had occurred in a good way.

1007
01:37:05,638 --> 01:37:23,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I don't think that, I don't have a good sense of exactly the referral frequency prior to this stretch, because I really didn't study that, but a quick glance at it would say to me that anecdotally, it is far less than it had been.

1008
01:37:26,462 --> 01:37:28,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin and Member Kreatz.

1009
01:37:30,784 --> 01:37:31,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1010
01:37:31,144 --> 01:37:33,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you for the report.

1011
01:37:33,725 --> 01:37:40,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I also appreciate coming from the education world, the framework and framing systemic change.

1012
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:47,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we all know that systems level change is painful and difficult and arduous and time consuming.

1013
01:37:48,412 --> 01:37:54,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, putting in perspective as well, as you said, the long term of

1014
01:37:54,679 --> 01:37:56,660
[SPEAKER_05]: stability with the previous administration.

1015
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:05,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that we have, you know, new administration turnover central administration turnover as a whole, really, and also a global pandemic.

1016
01:38:06,845 --> 01:38:12,328
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past couple of years, I think that it says a lot as well as to what's going on.

1017
01:38:12,368 --> 01:38:15,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's important to also put things in context in place.

1018
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that we all know there's a lot of work to be done.

1019
01:38:19,392 --> 01:38:19,772
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think

1020
01:38:20,222 --> 01:38:24,666
[SPEAKER_05]: we also need to sort of look at it in terms of perspective as to in terms of what else has been going on.

1021
01:38:25,546 --> 01:38:31,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and thinking about how change actually happens, and how it needs to happen over time.

1022
01:38:31,311 --> 01:38:46,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we also know, both with the frameworks that are used, that if you do change too quickly, you know what can happen, right, and that things can really sort of blow up as well, which is part of what I think we're seeing around having

1023
01:38:47,243 --> 01:38:49,685
[SPEAKER_05]: such turnover and you know all of this churning.

1024
01:38:50,665 --> 01:39:00,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But a couple of questions so I appreciate the frameworks and I and I say that just because there are other frameworks that talk about change and you know the systems change and how, what, what can happen.

1025
01:39:01,111 --> 01:39:05,613
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, so I wanted to ask about just a couple of questions.

1026
01:39:05,813 --> 01:39:10,636
[SPEAKER_05]: One was, did you also happen to interview or include

1027
01:39:11,229 --> 01:39:24,798
[SPEAKER_05]: the annex to the high school, the Curtis Tufts, which has, you know, a long history of, you know, maybe some students who have been marginalized or for various reasons and staff that could really share some of their experience.

1028
01:39:25,558 --> 01:39:28,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not personally interview the folks at the Curtis Tufts.

1029
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:35,785
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I did speak at length with the previous director of the Curtis Tufts.

1030
01:39:37,366 --> 01:39:40,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to remember of the hundreds of people, I wanna say Doug Bowen Smith.

1031
01:39:41,787 --> 01:39:41,987
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1032
01:39:45,569 --> 01:39:46,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Craig, right.

1033
01:39:47,129 --> 01:40:00,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I spoke at length with him specifically about that issue and how that school has changed over time and the target population and the experiences he had, but I did not visit the school and talk with the staff there.

1034
01:40:00,955 --> 01:40:03,956
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we did have an extensive conversation about that.

1035
01:40:04,837 --> 01:40:05,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1036
01:40:05,997 --> 01:40:10,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think it's, you know, I think some of those students and families there probably have experienced

1037
01:40:10,788 --> 01:40:18,772
[SPEAKER_05]: very directly some of the policies and procedures that have been in place and I think it could be interesting and I appreciate Mr. Jarski sharing his perspective with you.

1038
01:40:18,792 --> 01:40:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it was valuable.

1039
01:40:21,354 --> 01:40:28,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And to that end, I'm wondering about, I did want to say I appreciate you mentoring the mentor program.

1040
01:40:28,798 --> 01:40:34,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, you know, across the board, mentor programs are so essential and

1041
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:58,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Having worked with the committee on education at the state level and really reviewing mentor programs and schools, knowing that you know if folks feel like they really have people to rely on in terms of the mentor program, then that is one of the ways that they're able to, especially new teachers feel like their belonging so I appreciate you mentioning that and I think it's an important piece to consider and I also really appreciate your mention of the need for building based subs I think that I've heard that

1042
01:40:59,528 --> 01:41:22,605
[SPEAKER_05]: more from families than anything in terms of, particularly from families whose children may fit the high needs categories and who are not having necessarily staffing there that might've been appropriate in terms of, you know, building base subs who can actually get to know students and also the cost analysis compared to what you were saying, I think is really critical.

1043
01:41:23,706 --> 01:41:24,607
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that.

1044
01:41:25,106 --> 01:41:44,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I wanted to ask you about the leadership committee on DEI, and if you had talked to any of the folks about sort of what had existed and sort of didn't exist after a little while, basically last year, as far as a DEI committee.

1045
01:41:44,767 --> 01:41:47,428
[SPEAKER_13]: It was not something that came up in my conversation.

1046
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:58,311
[SPEAKER_13]: So the fact that it wasn't mentioned by folks in a comprehensive way to me said that it wasn't a priority that was being recognized across the school.

1047
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:04,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I say that knowing that there are individuals who are very committed to this work.

1048
01:42:04,873 --> 01:42:08,655
[SPEAKER_13]: and a number of teachers individually talked about their efforts along those lines.

1049
01:42:09,155 --> 01:42:25,784
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see in any conversations that I had or in any references, people seeing that as a huge priority or any sort of formal training that was being conducted for teachers, or the sort of efforts that I think are all districts are now in the need for this work.

1050
01:42:26,866 --> 01:42:32,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Some districts have hired an individual to champion this work, and that has not always met with success.

1051
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:35,673
[SPEAKER_13]: In other instances, it is seen as an add-on.

1052
01:42:35,913 --> 01:42:38,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, quote, they want us to do this too.

1053
01:42:38,595 --> 01:42:39,896
[SPEAKER_13]: It can't be presented that way.

1054
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:42,298
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs to be embedded in everything that we do.

1055
01:42:43,019 --> 01:42:46,842
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a tremendous amount of training that needs to go on.

1056
01:42:47,182 --> 01:42:48,923
[SPEAKER_13]: and someone needs to coordinate that.

1057
01:42:49,284 --> 01:42:55,668
[SPEAKER_13]: So how that ends up moving forward is not exactly clear to many districts.

1058
01:42:56,028 --> 01:42:58,189
[SPEAKER_13]: There are different ways that people are approaching this.

1059
01:42:58,530 --> 01:43:03,153
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't see any sort of gold standard of way to set it up.

1060
01:43:03,573 --> 01:43:10,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen instances where it has made some inroads, looking at recruiting a more diverse staff.

1061
01:43:10,718 --> 01:43:12,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Every district in Massachusetts is trying to do that.

1062
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,942
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is not easy to do because the teaching pool right now is simply not

1063
01:43:17,382 --> 01:43:18,983
[SPEAKER_13]: deep, and it is not diverse.

1064
01:43:19,923 --> 01:43:40,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondarily, simply providing training to those who we currently have and are going to continue to be in the district for many years, coordinating that, doing it in a way that enlists an outside provider, perhaps it might be the way to go, because I've seen different districts try to do it with an individual appointed in that role, and that tends to not be as successful.

1065
01:43:40,919 --> 01:43:41,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

1066
01:43:41,519 --> 01:43:48,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asking the question because we did have a committee that was appointed that was community members, school-based members and others.

1067
01:43:48,344 --> 01:43:52,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sort of, it's unclear to me what happened to that.

1068
01:43:53,127 --> 01:43:56,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, you know, I know that it sort of fell apart, I think a little bit.

1069
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:01,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think those people would have valuable input as to why that fell apart.

1070
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:06,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was well-intentioned and I'm sure there are a lot of people in the district that really do wanna do the work.

1071
01:44:07,197 --> 01:44:08,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that there's a lot of,

1072
01:44:09,562 --> 01:44:18,351
[SPEAKER_05]: after review that could be done with that committee or that no longer committee, however you want to look at it, that could really inform that information.

1073
01:44:18,391 --> 01:44:20,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's interesting that you didn't know that there was one.

1074
01:44:21,053 --> 01:44:23,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So that speaks volumes to me.

1075
01:44:24,697 --> 01:44:32,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also would want to know about how in the report family engagement was considered.

1076
01:44:33,089 --> 01:44:36,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Originally, the original charge was to have parent engagement too.

1077
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:47,475
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the time, as I started moving down that path and speaking with Megan Fidler-Carey, I believe there was a goal of having a survey that would go to parents.

1078
01:44:47,495 --> 01:44:52,017
[SPEAKER_13]: So I backed off from individually looking at individual parent interviews.

1079
01:44:52,797 --> 01:45:02,761
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was the reason I moved away from that, knowing that at the time that I know the district was looking to try to engage in a survey tool to be providing to parents.

1080
01:45:06,616 --> 01:45:07,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1081
01:45:07,796 --> 01:45:08,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Kreatz?

1082
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:10,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1083
01:45:10,438 --> 01:45:11,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for the report.

1084
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:16,600
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought it was great that you were substituting in the classrooms when you just mentioned that.

1085
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:17,300
[SPEAKER_17]: That's wonderful.

1086
01:45:18,481 --> 01:45:35,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so I thought it was interesting because going over the history of the high school and the vocational school, I've been on the robotics engineering advisory committee, and I've heard, and my son has told me, for many, many years, there's been discussions about

1087
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:41,462
[SPEAKER_17]: the two schedules, how the five day and the six day, and it's such a challenge.

1088
01:45:42,082 --> 01:45:48,467
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've heard from students that were in my advisory committee that it's so frustrating.

1089
01:45:48,968 --> 01:45:50,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Some students couldn't take a foreign language.

1090
01:45:51,069 --> 01:45:55,773
[SPEAKER_17]: I know my son didn't take a foreign language because the schedules were too restricted.

1091
01:45:55,913 --> 01:45:57,534
[SPEAKER_17]: There wasn't enough room in their schedules.

1092
01:45:58,414 --> 01:46:00,996
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's interesting that you discovered this.

1093
01:46:01,906 --> 01:46:10,332
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it is something that is contractual that, you know, we're working on or that's going to be worked on, you know, as another task coming up.

1094
01:46:10,512 --> 01:46:20,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's going to be, you know, I think challenging, but I think at the end result, it will, you know, open up the schedule so that there'll be more opportunities for students.

1095
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:28,925
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was just wondering if you had the opportunity to talk to any of the students, you know, did they share any of their experiences or,

1096
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,731
[SPEAKER_17]: anything with you, if you could share some of that.

1097
01:46:31,871 --> 01:46:33,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, very much so.

1098
01:46:33,372 --> 01:46:37,914
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would also piggyback on the statements that you made about the schedule.

1099
01:46:38,295 --> 01:46:53,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard a lot from special educators about the difficulty with trying to make sure that all students were able to get their needed services, particularly if they were following the week on week off schedule in the vocational realm.

1100
01:46:54,271 --> 01:46:56,692
[SPEAKER_13]: So they express frustration trying to make that work.

1101
01:46:57,373 --> 01:47:03,416
[SPEAKER_13]: And the world language piece is well documented that that's been challenging to be able to allow kids to have all those options.

1102
01:47:03,676 --> 01:47:19,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also heard from the career and technical education teachers that they wanted more time with their students, if you will, particularly around advisories and around the 900 hour requirement in their core areas.

1103
01:47:20,086 --> 01:47:21,267
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was challenging.

1104
01:47:21,627 --> 01:47:35,523
[SPEAKER_13]: And by and large, kids are proud of the school, they have seen many instances that they enjoy about the school, and they also feel that there isn't the tightness around behaviors that

1105
01:47:36,164 --> 01:47:41,686
[SPEAKER_13]: They are able to figure out a way around things and I think there are so many different reasons why that happens.

1106
01:47:42,406 --> 01:47:55,810
[SPEAKER_13]: it's just an enormous building there isn't I talked about how teachers are not obligated to have duties and that's a that's a very traditionally in other schools in medford their obligations around duties, with the exception of homeroom advisory.

1107
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:58,972
[SPEAKER_13]: There aren't any for teachers unless there's pay associated with it.

1108
01:47:59,353 --> 01:48:06,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a huge bargaining chip around the collective bargaining agreement that I believe has to be adapted in some way.

1109
01:48:06,699 --> 01:48:10,302
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe the time to do that is when you look at melding the schedule.

1110
01:48:11,133 --> 01:48:13,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think there's a way, and I think there's a willingness, teachers know this.

1111
01:48:14,275 --> 01:48:16,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Teachers know they need to be doing this work.

1112
01:48:16,777 --> 01:48:21,940
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're also aware that when this was negotiated out of the contract, it was a form of compensation.

1113
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:32,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think they're not willing to volunteer to do that type of work, because those are hard won negotiations that resulted with the contract they have now.

1114
01:48:32,787 --> 01:48:39,211
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the time is right to be able to look at the two schedules, meld them, and institute some form

1115
01:48:39,731 --> 01:48:44,275
[SPEAKER_13]: even in a small way of non-instructional duty for teachers.

1116
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:45,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that has to happen.

1117
01:48:46,056 --> 01:48:48,918
[SPEAKER_13]: And the kids know how to get around it.

1118
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:50,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thanks.

1119
01:48:50,519 --> 01:48:55,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's nice to see the enrollment numbers increase.

1120
01:48:55,663 --> 01:49:01,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I can just remember doing promoting and commercials for the vocational programs.

1121
01:49:01,527 --> 01:49:04,449
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have the excellent open houses.

1122
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:07,692
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really great when

1123
01:49:08,382 --> 01:49:16,889
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have the open houses and everybody can come out and see in going to the various shops and explore and it's a really nice event that we put on.

1124
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:26,677
[SPEAKER_17]: that's that's all graded here too and and then I I know, Miss Graham had talked about the associate principal position and.

1125
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:48,082
[SPEAKER_17]: I did receive some emails from parents, just mentioning that they felt as though we needed to have, there wasn't a particular name, but another assistant principal, because they felt as though there wasn't enough supports at the high school.

1126
01:49:49,283 --> 01:49:52,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was just something that was brought up recently.

1127
01:49:53,205 --> 01:49:53,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I had put it in,

1128
01:49:54,793 --> 01:49:55,873
[SPEAKER_17]: the budget survey.

1129
01:49:56,234 --> 01:50:14,282
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thought that was interesting that there was a position that was a recommendation for the associate principal in it would that be one position or would that be because it does say this, the associate principal role would be a full-time role.

1130
01:50:14,742 --> 01:50:16,583
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would be one new position.

1131
01:50:16,903 --> 01:50:17,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1132
01:50:17,223 --> 01:50:18,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I'm sorry.

1133
01:50:20,498 --> 01:50:23,301
[SPEAKER_17]: with the other four assistant principals?

1134
01:50:23,702 --> 01:50:35,716
[SPEAKER_13]: No, so I see these as distinct and different, that the assistant principals are dealing with student behavior, discipline, and overall looking at the emotional and academic progress of all their students.

1135
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:37,578
[SPEAKER_13]: That piece is very clear.

1136
01:50:37,938 --> 01:50:43,180
[SPEAKER_13]: The associate principal would not be dealing in behavior and discipline in any of those aspects.

1137
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,921
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the management and operations of the school.

1138
01:50:46,241 --> 01:50:52,323
[SPEAKER_13]: For instance, advanced placement testing, MCAS testing, all of the issues that are listed in that list.

1139
01:50:52,663 --> 01:50:53,323
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot.

1140
01:50:53,723 --> 01:51:06,052
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a lot of stuff that normally would be sort of parceled out this assistant principal will do this piece this assistant principal will be that piece, and then you get a very dispersed sort of responsibility for all of those pieces.

1141
01:51:06,612 --> 01:51:10,215
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that consolidating that under one individual is the way to go.

1142
01:51:10,715 --> 01:51:13,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it used to be that there were four assistant principals.

1143
01:51:13,818 --> 01:51:14,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Now there were three.

1144
01:51:15,099 --> 01:51:30,851
[SPEAKER_13]: And whether or not those duties were adequately distributed, especially to people who are coming in new, a new person coming in, trying to be able to do those is doomed to failure without the support of mentoring and an understanding of historically how these things are done.

1145
01:51:32,112 --> 01:51:32,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1146
01:51:32,652 --> 01:51:33,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1147
01:51:36,335 --> 01:51:36,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau.

1148
01:51:37,436 --> 01:51:37,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1149
01:51:40,043 --> 01:51:46,529
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot in here around security and cameras and the building and our 55 exterior doors.

1150
01:51:46,869 --> 01:51:47,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the number.

1151
01:51:48,971 --> 01:51:58,639
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think about what it costs to make an exterior door a high tech modern exterior door with access control and alerting when it's not closed.

1152
01:52:00,475 --> 01:52:07,017
[SPEAKER_16]: take that number in my head, which I don't have a real number, and I multiply that by 55, and I know that number is just too big.

1153
01:52:07,978 --> 01:52:11,619
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is a bit startling to imagine.

1154
01:52:12,799 --> 01:52:24,463
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, you do point out, and one of the teachers are quoted as like, the place is just too big, and we cannot hire enough staff to make all the hiding places not hiding places.

1155
01:52:24,583 --> 01:52:26,164
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just not one of our options.

1156
01:52:27,304 --> 01:52:34,567
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's sort of a problem of enrollment and the school size kind of coming together.

1157
01:52:34,587 --> 01:52:37,988
[SPEAKER_16]: There was someplace in the report, I couldn't find it quickly.

1158
01:52:38,488 --> 01:52:51,253
[SPEAKER_16]: You said something really important about how when the teachers and the students came back after being remote, that the behaviors were,

1159
01:52:53,561 --> 01:53:04,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we planned a lot for coming back into in-person, but I don't know that we planned for the student body to largely be unrecognizable.

1160
01:53:06,505 --> 01:53:19,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And for teachers that have been teaching for many, many years to have like, it's like they showed up and it's a different planet or something, like all of the things going on that they had not experienced.

1161
01:53:19,901 --> 01:53:27,343
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe did not have training and supports and you know we didn't suddenly multiply the number of people in the assistant principal's office.

1162
01:53:28,703 --> 01:53:37,345
[SPEAKER_16]: That like we did try our best to support them in coming back, but I feel like this would probably be like you know, in the history books will be one of the areas where we didn't.

1163
01:53:39,286 --> 01:53:41,066
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not that we didn't provide like.

1164
01:53:42,287 --> 01:53:53,011
[SPEAKER_16]: adjustment Councilors and all those other people, but that's sort of for the students, but finding ways to support the teachers who just came into this situation.

1165
01:53:53,111 --> 01:53:58,092
[SPEAKER_16]: A friend of mine is a, I think she's a second grade or third grade teacher.

1166
01:53:58,633 --> 01:54:04,274
[SPEAKER_16]: And during the pandemic, we talked about like how there were not being, there were not a lot of special ed referrals coming in.

1167
01:54:04,735 --> 01:54:11,557
[SPEAKER_16]: And she was, I was, I mean, I mentioned this on the floor, like I'm terrified that the referrals are down because there's no,

1168
01:54:12,591 --> 01:54:17,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Well there's eyes on the students but eyes on a webcam is not the same thing.

1169
01:54:17,915 --> 01:54:28,143
[SPEAKER_16]: And sure enough September arrived, and it was a madhouse of all these students who are completely undiagnosed or on untested for what they needed.

1170
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:58,086
[SPEAKER_16]: And how much of that could have ever really been supported is will be interesting thing some people I'm sure will study but, you know, we couldn't just magically create a second teacher to sit in every classroom or whatever that those people don't exist so I just think it's really important to recognize that the teaching staff wasn't prepared because they couldn't be prepared because we didn't know, none of us have been through this pandemic.

1171
01:54:59,651 --> 01:55:03,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Even if we had pandemics every 25 years, we never would have had a pandemic on Zoom.

1172
01:55:04,874 --> 01:55:13,259
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's like, no matter how more common pandemics become, this will be the first one where kids actually kept going sort of.

1173
01:55:13,799 --> 01:55:22,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope we can take a lot of these things away because the global authorities indicate we can expect more pandemics.

1174
01:55:23,344 --> 01:55:24,525
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe we can do a better job.

1175
01:55:25,445 --> 01:55:26,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll stop talking about that.

1176
01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:28,347
[SPEAKER_16]: I do just want to point out on page,

1177
01:55:29,096 --> 01:55:32,199
[SPEAKER_16]: 41, there's a paragraph, I'm gonna read it, it's one paragraph.

1178
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:45,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just really tired of this conversation and you probably don't know, because you haven't been to all of our meetings, but we have been having this conversation over and over again since returning from the pandemic.

1179
01:55:45,829 --> 01:55:53,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Bathroom access and availability, and yes, I rolled my eyes, sorry, has been a significant issue in the overall supervision of students.

1180
01:55:53,475 --> 01:55:58,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Bathrooms are scattered throughout the building and periodically are not functioning due to maintenance needs.

1181
01:56:00,481 --> 01:56:04,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Some bathrooms are routinely closed deliberately to limit supervisory requirements for staff.

1182
01:56:05,084 --> 01:56:08,246
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a relatively common practice in large comprehensive high schools.

1183
01:56:08,749 --> 01:56:17,732
[SPEAKER_16]: but the number and location of open bathrooms at Medford High School changes on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, creating frustration and confusion for all involved.

1184
01:56:18,392 --> 01:56:21,273
[SPEAKER_16]: These changes are usually a result of lack of monitoring coverage.

1185
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:25,675
[SPEAKER_16]: When monitors are not available, bathrooms are locked and students are sent to other bathrooms.

1186
01:56:26,175 --> 01:56:27,335
[SPEAKER_16]: A couple of questions in there.

1187
01:56:28,516 --> 01:56:29,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are sent to other bathrooms.

1188
01:56:30,776 --> 01:56:32,737
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's nobody to cover it, they're not sent.

1189
01:56:32,817 --> 01:56:34,798
[SPEAKER_16]: They're left to wander to find another bathroom.

1190
01:56:34,838 --> 01:56:35,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I correct?

1191
01:56:35,942 --> 01:56:47,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe in most instances, there's a sign placed on the door, indicating where kids should go and they, those are the attempt is to try to this is, I don't want to imply that this doesn't happen in other schools.

1192
01:56:48,076 --> 01:56:56,626
[SPEAKER_13]: There are bathrooms in other remote areas of schools that typically are not open to the public, and to students, I should say.

1193
01:56:57,506 --> 01:57:07,492
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the challenges have been trying to bring a system up to speed immediately after this incident that occurred in December that would provide coverage across the building.

1194
01:57:07,833 --> 01:57:10,094
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a lot to try to maintain.

1195
01:57:10,514 --> 01:57:14,056
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes somebody had signed up for coverage and they happened to be out that day.

1196
01:57:14,757 --> 01:57:19,019
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that would result in a scramble to try to find somebody to cover.

1197
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:23,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they couldn't, that bathroom was closed and the kid's sign was on the door and they'd be directed somewhere else.

1198
01:57:24,883 --> 01:57:25,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1199
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:28,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Reasons make sense to me.

1200
01:57:30,011 --> 01:57:33,112
[SPEAKER_16]: We have all had to go to the bathroom and not been able to find a bathroom though.

1201
01:57:34,572 --> 01:57:39,014
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, the changes happening sometimes on a daily or hourly basis.

1202
01:57:40,134 --> 01:57:47,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, are we really getting signs up there on the fly in the moment that are always accurate to tell a student where to go?

1203
01:57:47,256 --> 01:57:51,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, my daughter doesn't go to her locker anymore.

1204
01:57:51,218 --> 01:57:52,278
[SPEAKER_16]: She just violates the

1205
01:57:52,813 --> 01:57:57,455
[SPEAKER_16]: policy, whatever it is, or at least in the handbook and carries all of her books with her in a backpack all day.

1206
01:57:58,235 --> 01:58:08,040
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, that's partially related to scheduling and our lovely asbestos challenge we had in one of the halls that took out her locker area.

1207
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:18,144
[SPEAKER_16]: But when I think about three minutes, I mean, my high school was a similar number of students, dramatically smaller footprint, and we had four minutes

1208
01:58:19,574 --> 01:58:21,475
[SPEAKER_16]: I still remember thinking four minutes was nuts.

1209
01:58:21,555 --> 01:58:23,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, how can you get anywhere in four minutes?

1210
01:58:23,856 --> 01:58:28,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're like ninth grade is in this wing, maybe that makes sense.

1211
01:58:28,478 --> 01:58:29,618
[SPEAKER_16]: 10th grade's in this wing.

1212
01:58:30,379 --> 01:58:35,681
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have students traversing like the entire building in their three minutes.

1213
01:58:36,521 --> 01:58:42,804
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, when I think about that, and then I think about they go, the bathroom is closed.

1214
01:58:44,785 --> 01:58:49,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there, I don't think 100% is an unreasonable expectation.

1215
01:58:49,346 --> 01:59:00,512
[SPEAKER_16]: that every bathroom has a sign 100% of the time that correctly says where is an open bathroom, not 95% of the time, 100% of the time the sign is correct.

1216
01:59:00,992 --> 01:59:03,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Like we have an awful lot of people working in that building.

1217
01:59:04,414 --> 01:59:08,776
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's one thing that matters a lot to somebody who's looking for a bathroom.

1218
01:59:09,277 --> 01:59:15,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we talk about student behaviors, well, one thing that's important is that we might wanna consider respecting our students.

1219
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,762
[SPEAKER_16]: And while I agree we can't have all the bathrooms open

1220
01:59:19,301 --> 01:59:20,942
[SPEAKER_16]: plenty of very good reasons.

1221
01:59:22,964 --> 01:59:36,714
[SPEAKER_16]: If the bathroom is closed and the sign says to go here and you go over there and that one's closed and there's no sign telling you where else to go, I would feel very disrespected as a student who is supposed to be in class learning.

1222
01:59:36,734 --> 01:59:42,458
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we can ignore the fact that that means they're not getting an education while they're on the hunt for a bathroom.

1223
01:59:44,335 --> 01:59:50,958
[SPEAKER_16]: It's obnoxious that I'm talking about bathrooms, but we have talked about it so many meetings that you have been lucky enough not to participate in.

1224
01:59:51,658 --> 01:59:56,060
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm just I'm really exhausted and I'm not running around looking for a bathroom.

1225
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:06,424
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for answering that one question about like the why is there there's coverage all set up everything is lined up and then somebody's out sick or somebody

1226
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:23,265
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there's lots of other reasons why a staff member couldn't make a coverage, but I just want to make sure that the signage issue is, you know, NASA level accurate, because it's a big building to be running all over the place.

1227
02:00:23,646 --> 02:00:33,189
[SPEAKER_16]: And by the way, having to go pee isn't the only thing our students need to use bathrooms for, which, you know, we still don't have menstrual products in all of our bathrooms, but that's a different conversation.

1228
02:00:33,329 --> 02:00:33,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1229
02:00:37,759 --> 02:00:44,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a resident S Diaz, if you could state your name and address for the record.

1230
02:00:47,608 --> 02:00:48,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, can you hear me.

1231
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:50,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1232
02:00:51,091 --> 02:00:51,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello.

1233
02:00:52,192 --> 02:00:56,216
[SPEAKER_19]: So your idea, 143 Lake Street in Arlington.

1234
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:25,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I was one of the teachers meeting with Michael, and I wanted to thank him because he was, I don't know, and I'm speaking for myself, but a lot of people in the building agree with me, he's the first person that really was listening to us.

1235
02:01:26,351 --> 02:01:43,858
[SPEAKER_19]: uh a lot of the a lot of the I mean everything Michael said is uh is correct and uh he's just presenting to the committee what we teachers have been saying for months and I remembered in the last meeting

1236
02:01:44,992 --> 02:01:50,797
[SPEAKER_19]: In the meeting we had after the stabbing, one of the teachers said, please listen to us.

1237
02:01:51,477 --> 02:01:54,399
[SPEAKER_19]: And everything Michael said is correct.

1238
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:57,282
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have been saying that for so long.

1239
02:01:58,202 --> 02:02:05,728
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not saying that the school committee is not doing their job or anything.

1240
02:02:05,788 --> 02:02:05,948
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1241
02:02:06,429 --> 02:02:10,392
[SPEAKER_19]: What I want to reiterate is that we need

1242
02:02:11,929 --> 02:02:14,870
[SPEAKER_19]: We need everybody to be on the same boat.

1243
02:02:15,491 --> 02:02:21,813
[SPEAKER_19]: We teachers, and it's very funny what Michael said, well, some teachers do the referrals, others gave up.

1244
02:02:22,233 --> 02:02:29,516
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's because we don't have all the APs working together.

1245
02:02:29,536 --> 02:02:34,617
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes when we see, oh, who is the AP of this student?

1246
02:02:34,937 --> 02:02:36,258
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are like, oh, great.

1247
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:38,465
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to be supported.

1248
02:02:39,046 --> 02:02:41,990
[SPEAKER_19]: He's going to do something or she's going to do something.

1249
02:02:42,691 --> 02:02:44,774
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we take, oh, what is the AP?

1250
02:02:45,074 --> 02:02:45,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, no.

1251
02:02:46,156 --> 02:02:46,777
[SPEAKER_19]: And we give up.

1252
02:02:47,364 --> 02:02:49,206
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need consistency.

1253
02:02:49,286 --> 02:02:51,548
[SPEAKER_19]: We need everybody working together.

1254
02:02:52,149 --> 02:02:59,556
[SPEAKER_19]: And Mr. Rousseau, I know you don't want to hear about the bathroom, but the bathrooms are a big, big problem.

1255
02:02:59,696 --> 02:03:00,777
[SPEAKER_19]: There are no signs.

1256
02:03:01,378 --> 02:03:02,779
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no consistency.

1257
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:06,082
[SPEAKER_19]: And we need strong leaders.

1258
02:03:06,423 --> 02:03:10,607
[SPEAKER_19]: We need strong people in front of the bathroom.

1259
02:03:11,267 --> 02:03:17,148
[SPEAKER_19]: We cannot have someone that sits there and have eight to 10 kids.

1260
02:03:17,808 --> 02:03:21,449
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of them, I'm sorry, are kids.

1261
02:03:21,889 --> 02:03:24,730
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't feel comfortable being around them.

1262
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:30,191
[SPEAKER_19]: And he cannot have a group of kids just talking to him and hanging out there.

1263
02:03:30,491 --> 02:03:31,951
[SPEAKER_19]: We need strong people.

1264
02:03:32,671 --> 02:03:35,692
[SPEAKER_19]: And yes, we need another AP.

1265
02:03:36,812 --> 02:03:40,133
[SPEAKER_19]: I told Michael, I said, we need an AP per grade.

1266
02:03:41,093 --> 02:03:47,759
[SPEAKER_19]: and they focus on their grade, and then they don't need to be thinking, is this ninth grader or 10th grader?

1267
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:50,301
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it will work a lot better.

1268
02:03:51,181 --> 02:03:52,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much for listening.

1269
02:03:53,103 --> 02:03:58,007
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you heard this before, but I really needed to share.

1270
02:03:58,227 --> 02:03:59,408
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, thank you so much.

1271
02:04:02,471 --> 02:04:03,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

1272
02:04:03,512 --> 02:04:03,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Diaz.

1273
02:04:05,413 --> 02:04:08,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Lou, name and address for the record, please.

1274
02:04:09,236 --> 02:04:09,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Spagnolia.

1275
02:04:10,421 --> 02:04:11,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Spagnola.

1276
02:04:13,162 --> 02:04:15,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at 86 Gore Road in Revere, Massachusetts.

1277
02:04:17,604 --> 02:04:22,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say just, because even though if we're not going to talk about bathrooms, it still needs to be added.

1278
02:04:23,126 --> 02:04:25,627
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was, it's a big thing.

1279
02:04:25,967 --> 02:04:34,771
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have kids that are leaving class, and then kids are walking around the school, and then if bathrooms are not monitored, that's where they're going to go hide.

1280
02:04:35,231 --> 02:04:41,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I am somebody that I was walking in the bathrooms whenever I walk around the school.

1281
02:04:41,813 --> 02:04:45,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And the record, I threw out 14 kids from a bathroom.

1282
02:04:46,535 --> 02:04:50,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of them were eating lunch, sitting on the floor, and one of them was trying to go to the bathroom.

1283
02:04:51,357 --> 02:04:53,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, two were trying to go to the bathroom.

1284
02:04:53,657 --> 02:04:54,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.

1285
02:04:56,238 --> 02:05:00,520
[SPEAKER_01]: You can blame or we can try and circle the wagons, whatever we're going to do, but

1286
02:05:02,496 --> 02:05:04,656
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really no one person to blame.

1287
02:05:05,117 --> 02:05:14,078
[SPEAKER_01]: It's let's take a look at the situation and let's react to the situation as opposed to, you know, well, let's put signs on bathrooms.

1288
02:05:14,398 --> 02:05:15,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the graphics teacher.

1289
02:05:15,799 --> 02:05:23,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I did follow the direction of superintendent and the principal who asked me to print signs that said a maximum of two allowed.

1290
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:27,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went around me and my students, we'd put them all up.

1291
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:28,861
[SPEAKER_01]: It's,

1292
02:05:29,707 --> 02:05:34,628
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful if we know what bathrooms are open, but the problem is we don't have enough people to monitor them.

1293
02:05:35,028 --> 02:05:42,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we don't monitor them, I've kicked six kids out a couple of weeks ago because they managed to get into a bathroom.

1294
02:05:42,749 --> 02:05:48,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what else we can do outside of a complete reform.

1295
02:05:49,271 --> 02:05:56,092
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured as long as we're talking about bathrooms, I just wanted to say that everybody that's trying to do their best

1296
02:05:57,205 --> 02:06:03,829
[SPEAKER_01]: sees that the bathroom is a huge problem and outside of monitoring them, we're gonna have to lock them.

1297
02:06:04,549 --> 02:06:06,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to add that, that's all.

1298
02:06:06,971 --> 02:06:14,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give some clarity as somebody that does walk around the school anytime I can and try and help out and try and get these kids to get to class.

1299
02:06:15,436 --> 02:06:17,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it, thank you.

1300
02:06:18,197 --> 02:06:19,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Spagnuolo.

1301
02:06:21,559 --> 02:06:24,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Giglio, name and address for the record, please.

1302
02:06:26,164 --> 02:06:27,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Bill Guglielmo.

1303
02:06:28,205 --> 02:06:36,371
[SPEAKER_14]: At first, months ago, I had my reservations about Mr. Wells, but I have to say this presentation that he put together was very thorough, very good.

1304
02:06:36,391 --> 02:06:37,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very, very impressed.

1305
02:06:37,632 --> 02:06:38,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank him for that.

1306
02:06:38,973 --> 02:06:39,513
[SPEAKER_14]: That's very good.

1307
02:06:39,533 --> 02:06:46,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we should all need to listen to everything that he has to say because he's bringing up some very valid points on things that really need to be addressed.

1308
02:06:47,018 --> 02:06:48,999
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, Mr. Wells, I'd like to thank you very much.

1309
02:06:49,019 --> 02:06:50,340
[SPEAKER_14]: You did an excellent job.

1310
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:50,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1311
02:06:52,381 --> 02:06:53,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Guglielmo.

1312
02:06:57,236 --> 02:07:11,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions from the committee, I think we just received it so i'm sure some some of you read it sorry Sunday Monday, so I think we need a little more time to digest digested to so sure we can reserve some more questions if we have them, but thank you for the presentation.

1313
02:07:12,217 --> 02:07:14,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the opportunity and again.

1314
02:07:14,761 --> 02:07:23,747
[SPEAKER_13]: If there are additional concerns or issues, I've more than exceeded the allocation that was originally made by the school committee, but I felt very committed to making sure I saw the process through.

1315
02:07:24,168 --> 02:07:29,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there are additional concerns or questions that come up, I'd be happy to return and help out in whatever way I can.

1316
02:07:29,992 --> 02:07:30,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1317
02:07:30,512 --> 02:07:30,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1318
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:35,596
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have any presentations of the public.

1319
02:07:35,656 --> 02:07:37,597
[SPEAKER_10]: We have continued business 2023-01 offered by member Graham.

1320
02:07:40,902 --> 02:07:47,567
[SPEAKER_10]: On April 26, 2021, the school committee voted unanimously to amend policy GAD, permanent staff positions.

1321
02:07:47,668 --> 02:07:49,929
[SPEAKER_10]: The amended policy included this language.

1322
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:55,114
[SPEAKER_10]: All job descriptions were reviewed every three years and presented to the school committee for approval.

1323
02:07:55,334 --> 02:07:58,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Job descriptions will contain a last reviewed date.

1324
02:07:58,656 --> 02:08:04,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent will establish a review cycle for all positions descriptions within 60 days of the adoption of the policy.

1325
02:08:04,881 --> 02:08:09,565
[SPEAKER_10]: The initial review cycle lasts no longer than three years and conclude on September 1st, 2024.

1326
02:08:11,513 --> 02:08:21,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to October 21 2021, the comprehensive list of current job descriptions professional staff positions are available for view by the public on the Medford public school website.

1327
02:08:22,179 --> 02:08:36,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Each time a new position is established by the committee, the superintendent will present the committee's approval job description for the position which specifies the job holders qualifications and the jobs performance responsibilities, although such positions may remain

1328
02:08:36,673 --> 02:08:41,074
[SPEAKER_10]: temporarily unfilled, only the committee may abolish position it has created.

1329
02:08:41,254 --> 02:08:48,875
[SPEAKER_10]: All positions unfilled for the entire prior school year will be reported to the committee annually no later than June 1st with an explanation for the vacancy.

1330
02:08:49,475 --> 02:08:56,416
[SPEAKER_10]: All positions that remain unfilled for more than two consecutive school years will be presented to the committee to be abolished no later than June 1st.

1331
02:08:57,036 --> 02:09:05,878
[SPEAKER_10]: In the event the superintendent wishes to maintain any positions that have been unfilled for more than two consecutive school years, the superintendent must explain the rationale and plan to fill the position

1332
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:10,044
[SPEAKER_10]: and get approved from the committee to continue the unfilled position for an additional year.

1333
02:09:10,645 --> 02:09:19,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the superintendent provide an update and timeline to comply with the September, 2024 completion of the initial view cycle here in member Graham.

1334
02:09:20,816 --> 02:09:21,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1335
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:26,481
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was referencing earlier, this has come up multiple times in the last couple of weeks.

1336
02:09:27,902 --> 02:09:39,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly, as we were talking about the roles and responsibilities of the high school principal for which we are interviewing, it came up, we were asked questions by candidates and things like that.

1337
02:09:40,486 --> 02:09:51,029
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did, several years ago, try to establish a process that would make sure that we are thoughtfully looking at these positions on a regular basis.

1338
02:09:52,167 --> 02:10:01,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So my request really is not that there's an answer tonight, but that before the year is out, we do have a plan for actually reviewing these job descriptions.

1339
02:10:01,975 --> 02:10:15,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's incredibly hard to figure out and not clear to me, you know, who does the, does the director of such and such a topic have responsibilities for supervision?

1340
02:10:16,001 --> 02:10:19,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have responsibilities for duties?

1341
02:10:19,524 --> 02:10:23,327
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that is very muddy and it's not easy to even know where to go to look for those things.

1342
02:10:23,387 --> 02:10:33,034
[SPEAKER_07]: So my request is just that at some point we get back to this thing we originally unanimously supported and make sure that we're on a better path forward.

1343
02:10:37,237 --> 02:10:37,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

1344
02:10:45,879 --> 02:10:46,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1345
02:10:49,162 --> 02:10:49,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

1346
02:10:49,942 --> 02:10:50,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1347
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:51,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Hays?

1348
02:10:52,204 --> 02:10:52,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1349
02:10:52,804 --> 02:10:53,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz?

1350
02:10:53,545 --> 02:10:53,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1351
02:10:54,326 --> 02:10:55,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin?

1352
02:10:55,607 --> 02:10:55,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1353
02:10:56,067 --> 02:10:56,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Bestone?

1354
02:10:57,268 --> 02:10:57,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1355
02:10:58,829 --> 02:10:59,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau?

1356
02:10:59,609 --> 02:10:59,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1357
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:00,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Longo?

1358
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:01,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1359
02:11:01,391 --> 02:11:02,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1360
02:11:02,852 --> 02:11:03,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1361
02:11:04,433 --> 02:11:12,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Member Graham, 2023-02, whereas the Medford School Committee heard a presentation from the Andrews Middle School Global Scholars Program.

1362
02:11:13,385 --> 02:11:37,569
[SPEAKER_10]: on June 6, 2022, regarding the results of their composting pilot, including an annual cost to the Andrews School of $720, whereas the school committee unanimously voted to ask the administration to investigate the cost of composting district-wide for possible implementation in school year 2022-2023 via resolve that the administration provide an update on composting efforts in Medford Public Schools this year and plans for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year.

1363
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:37,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Grant.

1364
02:11:41,471 --> 02:11:41,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1365
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:52,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there has been a lot of work going on behind the scenes in our food service area as a result of an audit and other changes that are happening.

1366
02:11:52,416 --> 02:11:58,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought it would be a good time to remind everybody that we were interested in pursuing

1367
02:11:59,933 --> 02:12:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: some more information about composting based on the report that the Global Scholars presented last year.

1368
02:12:06,058 --> 02:12:11,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been asked about it by my daughter, who was one of the presenters several times, and I keep telling her, I don't know.

1369
02:12:11,101 --> 02:12:14,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to put that back on everybody's radar.

1370
02:12:14,824 --> 02:12:22,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, just, you know, if there are things happening in the district that we're unaware of, I think people would be happy to hear about those things.

1371
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:25,552
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think also, you know, what is our plan for next year?

1372
02:12:25,712 --> 02:12:28,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And is composting part of the food service plan, I think is the question.

1373
02:12:29,318 --> 02:12:32,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't have to be today, but as we talk about food service.

1374
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:37,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I may, through the chair, I met with the chair of the Energy and Environment Committee.

1375
02:12:37,243 --> 02:12:42,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it was maybe Thursday or Friday, and they have five goals.

1376
02:12:42,926 --> 02:12:50,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And one is to learn more from students and get more active in the school system.

1377
02:12:50,251 --> 02:12:54,053
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe your daughter can go to the committee, one of their meetings.

1378
02:12:54,093 --> 02:12:55,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're on Monday nights.

1379
02:12:56,366 --> 02:12:59,547
[SPEAKER_10]: But they are looking to interact more with students and try to get more involved.

1380
02:12:59,607 --> 02:13:03,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And they could be a huge asset to trying to get composting in our schools.

1381
02:13:03,848 --> 02:13:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will also talk to Director Hunt.

1382
02:13:06,548 --> 02:13:20,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the city side, we're working on, we have a task force in place, because we're doing a new RFP for recycling, composting, and trash pickup in the city, as we want to encourage more composting and recycling versus trash.

1383
02:13:21,171 --> 02:13:24,752
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see if they have anything in mind for the schools as well.

1384
02:13:25,589 --> 02:13:25,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1385
02:13:25,989 --> 02:13:27,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So just looking for an update at some point.

1386
02:13:28,611 --> 02:13:29,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Update from the school system.

1387
02:13:30,391 --> 02:13:30,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1388
02:13:31,072 --> 02:13:35,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And motion for approval by Member Graham seconded by Member Hays.

1389
02:13:35,594 --> 02:13:36,254

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_16]: Members, oh yes, Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1401
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:48,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1402
02:13:51,629 --> 02:14:17,050
[SPEAKER_10]: New business, we have member Graham and member McLaughlin, 2023-08, whereas the Medford School Committee seeks to increase transparency and community engagement, and whereas Medford Public Schools has recently relaunched its website on a modernized platform that enables regular maintenance, be resolved if the Communications and Family Engagement Subcommittee meet to discuss updates to the website that would promote family engagement

1403
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:33,632
[SPEAKER_10]: improve accessibility and ensure transparency for all medical public school families and residents of Medford, be it further resolved that the communications and family engagement subcommittee will invite miss Lisa Miller and her students who work to launch the site, and are currently working on plans for phase two, two of development.

1404
02:14:35,394 --> 02:14:52,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we talked about this when we had a presentation for the website that there's potentially some connections to some of the school committee's goals around accessibility and translation that probably just warrant a little bit of understanding.

1405
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:59,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I think on our part about what the website's capabilities are and really talk about what those next phases might look like for phase two.

1406
02:15:01,004 --> 02:15:05,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So just officially asking the committee to push this to committee so that we can work on it.

1407
02:15:06,126 --> 02:15:08,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.
