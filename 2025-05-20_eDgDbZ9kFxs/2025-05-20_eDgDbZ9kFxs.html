    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1185.943s">Medford</a>  City Council Committee of the Whole May 20 2025 is called to order Mr. Clerk please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1191.007s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1193.468s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1196.831s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1199.032s">Councilor</a>  Leming is absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1199.953s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1201.654s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1202.735s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1203.396s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1204.236s">Six</a>  present one absent the meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1206.178s">There'll</a>  be a meeting in the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6pm in the City Council Chamber second floor Medford City Hall 85 George P. Hassett Drive Medford MA and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1216.808s">action</a>  and discussion items. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1219.029s">25</a>  039 annual budget process for fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget meeting three. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1222.67s">It</a>  will be the third preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 26 budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1227.091s">The</a>  mayor has communicated the following departments will be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1230.092s">Chevalier,</a>  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Library, Human Resources, Planning, Development and Sustainability, and the Liquor Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1238.054s">The</a>  police were on the agenda, but the chief is not available, so that has been moved to next Tuesday, the 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1244.235s">We'll</a>  be starting at 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1247.578s">along</a>  with DPW and the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1250.2s">So</a>  with that, we will take Chevalier first, and I'll just read quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1256.824s">We</a>  had fiscal year 2025 budget, 32,000, fiscal 2026 budget proposed 32,640. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1263.549s">And</a>  with that, we have Director Riggi, and I'm gonna ask you just to describe the budget, any changes, some fiscal 25 accomplishments, goals for next year, and if there are any <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1277.282s">key</a>  needs and priorities that aren't funded this year that you'd like to see funded in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1281.184s">And</a>  I will go to our Facilities Director, Paul Ringy.</p>

    <p>[Paul Righi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1284.825s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1287.887s">The</a>  budget that's reflected shows the personnel budget for the Chevalier Theatre. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1294.209s">What</a>  our plan is to actually move that personnel line item over to the facilities budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1300.19s">since</a>  he's part of the facility staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1302.894s">So</a>  that would come for fiscal year 2026 as part of the facility's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1311.467s">The</a>  rest of the funding that we use at the Chevalier is in special funding accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1318.014s">Part</a>  of that money is used for general wear and tear and upkeep to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1323.817s">Part</a>  of it's used to enhancements like the new LED lighting in the ceiling and the new video signage outside that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1333.363s">Previous</a>  projects were redoing the masonry on the front facade of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1339.965s">I'm</a>  looking in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1341.246s">We're</a>  looking at emergency lighting that is needed inside the theater at the seats because it's lacking when the show lights go down there, especially in the balcony area. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1352.09s">There</a>  is not emergency lighting strips. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1354.671s">We</a>  had installed some emergency lighting strips. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1359.132s">on</a>  the main floor of the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1361.454s">And</a>  now we find that there is a need for the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1363.955s">So</a>  that will be a priority for fiscal year 26 to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1369.699s">And</a>  we're hoping to get funding from the casino mitigation fund that we could actually repaint the entire interior of the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1378.404s">Right</a>  now it's a salmon and green, which is not conducive to show. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1383.608s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we get the $350,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1387.63s">that</a>  we requested so we can do that work in the theater.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1394.556s">Thank</a>  you, Director Riggi. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1396.797s">You</a>  brought up something that's a great note for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1400.4s">We're</a>  talking about the general fund budget, but that's not all of the money that our different city departments and schools use. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1408.505s">So</a>  thank you for mentioning what's going on with other funds from the state and casino, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1415.851s">Do</a>  we have any questions from members of the Council for Director Riggi about the Chevalier budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1425.138s">Seeing</a>  none, do we have any questions from the public either in person or on Zoom about the Chevalier general fund budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1436.227s">Seeing</a>  none, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Paul Righi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1437.548s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1443.402s">Next</a>  up we have the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office Budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1448.586s">Director</a>  Nwaje is here with us on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1450.947s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1452.248s">We're</a>  making you a co-host. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1453.529s">I</a>  think you had a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1454.87s">You</a>  might want to share it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1455.771s">I'm</a>  seeing a thumbs up, so you'll be able to unmute and share your presentation, but I will just quickly read off <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1464.29s">We</a>  had a fiscal 25 budget of $118,502. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1466.351s">A</a>  fiscal 26 proposed budget of $120,911. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1467.371s">And</a>  this is an increase of $2,409. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1468.831s">There's</a>  an increase in the permanent employees for a COLA increase and an increase of $1,000 in office supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1473.672s">And</a>  those are both fixed cost increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1494.577s">With</a>  that, turning it over to Director Nwaje for the presentation and also, you know, the general prompt is just to talk about the budget change, any other details you might want to share about the budget, talk about any accomplishments of the previous year, goals for next year, and items that are key needs and priorities that were not funded this year that you'd like to see funded in future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1517.53s">And</a>  with that, I'll turn it over to Director Nwaje.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1522.972s">Thank</a>  you so much for allowing me to do this via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1527.735s">I</a>  think that some of the questions will be answered through the PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1543.165s">Just</a>  let me know if you can see it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1547.407s">Yes,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1548.088s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1548.938s">All</a>  right, fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1550.198s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1551.939s">So</a>  again, Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is a space for all who live, work, learn and do business in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1561.962s">And</a>  the way that we do that is by upholding the civil rights laws, ensuring that there's access to our programs and access is beyond the physical. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1572.666s">It</a>  is anything from somebody needing <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1575.807s">a</a>  large print document so that they can file for an abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1581.471s">And</a>  that document is actually a state form. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1584.374s">It</a>  doesn't come in large print. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1585.915s">So</a>  we've got to figure out the best way to handle that situation so that we can assist the constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1593.56s">For</a>  the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, our work is regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1604.248s">disability</a>  status, language ability, socioeconomic status, immigration status and political affiliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1612.339s">It's</a>  really important for people to know and understand that it really is a space for all people and sometimes that can be misinterpreted. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1622.072s">We</a>  also continue to address inequities, whether they're institutional or systemic, through our work within our own City of Medford agencies and departments, as well as external work with state and federal agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1641.653s">Some</a>  of our collaborations have included the library, Medford Community Media, who I have to thank Kevin Harrington for his support in one of the accomplishments, the Medford Fire Department, Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1657.175s">public</a>  schools, the senior center, the Office of Prevention and Outreach, and that's just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1664.165s">Our</a>  external partnerships include Boston Center for Independent Living, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the MassAbility <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1672.257s">The</a>  Job Accommodation Network, which is huge for a lot of the ADA needs that take place throughout the city, whether it is a constituent who is in need of accessibility services or an employee who is in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1689.18s">the</a>  MCAD, Mass Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, for always fulfilling my interpreter requests, Medford Housing Authority, Medford Health Matters, the Mass Office on Disability, New England ADA Center, who is our go-to resource, Tufts University, and of course, my strongest community partner, the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1714.559s">As</a>  you know our office has put on a variety of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1718.961s">We</a>  hosted the first salute to our veterans dinner back in November of last year and this was done in collaboration with the office of veterans affairs and it was a dinner because we were trying to target <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1735.268s">veterans</a>  within a specific age group. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1738.151s">Those</a>  are the veterans that under-report and under-utilize services. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1744.197s">So</a>  that was why it was done in that format. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1747.36s">Lunar</a>  New Year hosted in collaboration with Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1750.523s">High</a>  School Asian Club, the Black History Month Community Event, the Black History Month Employee Luncheon, where we had Oma Moses as a guest speaker, Medford Connect's partner retreat that was done in partnership with the Office of Prevention and Outreach, and the Disability Fair hosted in partnership with the Commission on Persons with Disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1775.032s">and</a>  just, you know, just put in some corresponding flyers to break up the verbal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1787.979s">So</a>  our upcoming events include the Pride flag raising ceremony and festival that is taking place on Friday, May 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1797.424s">It</a>  starts at 4.30 and that would be followed by the <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1803.107s">Juneteenth</a>  flag-raising celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1806.41s">That's</a>  on Wednesday, June 18th, and that starts at four. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1811.936s">And</a>  if you remember last year's event, I will say remember to bring your dancing shoes this year because we have confirmed with a band from Texas, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1826.096s">flyer</a>  for the Pride event and thank you to Councilor Lazzaro for being kind enough to share remarks on behalf of City Council at this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1840.031s">And</a>  Juneteenth is in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1845.547s">So</a>  our accomplishments so far, and remember the work of this office is very fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1852.43s">It's</a>  responsive to what is happening in the moment and time, and also a lot of projection and forecasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1861.494s">So</a>  just like the tide, it comes in, it goes out, and it shifts and changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1867.736s">We</a>  were able to acquire upgraded accessible listening devices, which we now have in the sort of hall chambers utilizing ARPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1879.519s">So</a>  that was where Medford Community Media was instrumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1884.401s">We</a>  also acquired accessible seating in the chambers because all the chairs that we had for guests, none of the chairs had any arms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1894.243s">So</a>  we were able to utilize some ARPA funds to bring those in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1899.144s">Completed</a>  the MCAD training series for the entire Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1904.746s">Completed</a>  the TRIO series of trainings for SEIU and Teamsters employees at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1913.528s">And</a>  that was done in partnership with Teamsters Union and SEIU. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1919.089s">So</a>  thank you to both Brian Hatch and <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1922.542s">Joe</a>  Montana for their willingness to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1926.566s">And</a>  we started the foundational build of the diversity dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1934.173s">So</a>  what is the diversity dashboard? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1936.815s">It's</a>  a voluntary self-identification and affirmative action capturing system. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1942.321s">It</a>  utilizes the criterias of identification that are <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1947.56s">already</a>  identified by the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1950.481s">So</a>  if we had online systems, these forms would already pop up, but it allows people to self-report, which is, you know, the real, where the real value is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1963.284s">The</a>  dashboard was created with support of a student intern from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1971.033s">The</a>  dashboard can be, the information that goes onto the dashboard can be done in two ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1977.398s">Paper</a>  copies, so paper copies are on hand city side and also on hand school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1984.863s">Or</a>  a link can be sent and the employee can enter <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1989.643s">the</a>  information directly into the online system. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1994.286s">The</a>  dashboard is beneficial because it's a real data set. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=1998.448s">It's</a>  a snapshot of who we are as an employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2003.17s">Granted,</a>  it's a snapshot based on the number of employees that choose to participate, but it is still a snapshot on who we are as an employer, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2015.096s">It</a>  can be utilized when we're discussing benefits, when you're reviewing hiring trends and practices, when you want to look at where are you pulling your talent from. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2030.894s">And</a>  the ultimate goal is for this to continue to be built out and live on the ODEI webpage and be utilized as an interactive tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2042.761s">So</a>  it's still in the infancy stages, but the foundational build is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2048.444s">It</a>  is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2049.325s">It</a>  auto-populates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2051.186s">And</a>  as time moves on, you know, we will be able to build out more and add a variety of different criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2060.461s">So</a>  example of screenshot from the dashboard itself, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2066.825s">This</a>  is based on, I believe it's 172 respondents. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2071.348s">If</a>  we're just looking at gender distribution, as you can see from the chart, we are a heavily female employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2082.596s">That's</a>  what the data shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2085.137s">It's</a>  74%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2089.435s">look</a>  at veteran status out of 156 that chose to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2096.661s">really</a>  don't have that many veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2099.683s">And</a>  it could be a variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2101.844s">Veteran</a>  status is always underreported for many reasons, primarily stigma associated with hiring veterans, difficulty in converting military resumes into civilian resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2120.553s">That's</a>  why it's really important to ensure that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2125.255s">When</a>  you are in talent management, recruitment, you understand and you are out with your other counterparts and your other colleagues and you are connected with the important agencies such as veteran services that will do that type of work and help support their veterans in getting <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2146.83s">their</a>  desired jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2148.652s">And</a>  then if you take a look, this one is about disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2152.356s">It</a>  was simply a yes, no, I wish not to disclose. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2155.319s">So</a>  again, we primarily are an employer that does not have a lot of employees with disability in comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2168.122s">So</a>  I'm going to stop sharing because I would like to use this opportunity now to introduce you to what the online version looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2183.807s">So</a>  what happens is the Microsoft online form auto-populates, and then it also creates Excel spreadsheets, which can also be utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2197.776s">So</a>  here, this is the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2199.498s">As</a>  you can see, our heaviest respondents came from the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2203.6s">57%</a>  of the 172 responses received were from school employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2212.706s">So</a>  thank you to the school department for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2217.959s">When</a>  you look at again, you look at gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2222.552s">shows</a>  right there, female 72%, male 23%, gender non-conforming 2%, and I do not wish to disclose 1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2235.62s">And</a>  I wanna add that gender non-conforming was a risk that ODEI took. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2240.963s">The</a>  federal forms actually don't really give you much leeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2244.725s">It's</a>  either male, female, or I choose not to disclose. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2248.767s">And</a>  in respect of all the other identities that are out there, we felt that it was important to have something that people could check beyond I choose not to disclose. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2261.452s">And</a>  as you can see, race and ethnicity right here, 172 respondents, 83% identify as being white. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2266.014s">So</a>  this is who we are as an agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2279.227s">and</a>  98% identify as not being a veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2286.214s">So</a>  less than 2% of our employees are veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2297.104s">Pardon</a>  me for one second, I've got to find you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2307.068s">Right,</a>  so we are back to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2320.029s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2322.171s">So,</a>  you know, at this point, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion would like to advocate on behalf of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2333.721s">As</a>  we review the functions and the duties and responsibilities, it is important to note that beyond bringing the lived experience <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2345.151s">to</a>  volunteer to be on this commission, there is also a tremendous amount of technical knowledge that is required in order to be able to fulfill the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2357.921s">This</a>  information is taken directly from the ordinance, section 2-303, 2 and 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2369.347s">in</a>  order for commissioners to ensure that there is compliance, they must actually attend trainings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2379.691s">Powers</a>  and duties, section 2-304. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2384.633s">Again,</a>  in order to understand how to review programs, policies, assist with implementation, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2394.997s">commissioners</a>  have to go to a two-day CAM training. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2400.004s">I</a>  look at the Commission for Persons with Disabilities as an extension of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2408.535s">It</a>  is three different full-time roles in one umbrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2413.441s">An</a>  ADA need for an employee is very different from a need for a resident, which is very different from a person with a disability that is not able to access a business that is in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2431.269s">It</a>  does not matter whether or not it is a private business. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2435.25s">I</a>  really do rely on the commissioners for their support. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2440.433s">The</a>  camp training, as I said, is two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2444.236s">It</a>  is six hours each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2446.857s">So</a>  if people are employed, they're taking time off work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2450.66s">A</a>  lot of times I cannot get to the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2454.163s">I'm</a>  fortunate to have Nick for 15 hours a week, but one two-hour trip to the state house and back is his four-hour workday. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2466.131s">So,</a>  it's nice if there are conflicting meetings happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2470.095s">I</a>  can take 1 and it can take another 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2472.658s">1</a>  of the commissioners can take another 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2475.36s">So,</a>  as a result, I feel that I would not be doing my due diligence, especially based on a SWOT analysis that was done last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2484.789s">If</a>  I did not advocate on behalf of the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2488.633s">by</a>  requesting a stipend for the commissioners who are serving so that they can acquire the knowledge needed to fulfill their role. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2497.199s">That</a>  is really where the equity and inclusion lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2502.823s">And</a>  so, as I like to say, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, we have a tissue for every nose. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2512.489s">But</a>  we also say, let love be your superpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2516.052s">Let</a>  courage be your guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2518.111s">Let</a>  hope be your light. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2519.972s">Within</a>  you lies the power to do what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2525.056s">And</a>  on that note, thank you all so much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2527.998s">I'm</a>  open to questions.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2536.005s">Thank</a>  you, Director Nwaje for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2538.466s">Do</a>  you have any questions for the Director about the budget for the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2552.357s">See</a>  no hands, I do have a couple of questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2557.295s">Number</a>  one, I just wanted to thank you for the advocacy for the Disability Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2564.14s">That's</a>  much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2565.141s">I</a>  hope we can support that advocacy as well as part of our request for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2570.566s">I</a>  did have a question around that and some other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2572.967s">Is</a>  there any impact on your office of the uncertainty around any federal funding and programs or any outside grant funding?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2584.103s">I</a>  mean, yes, I mean, there is definite impact because you use the key word, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2588.706s">Uncertainty.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2591.028s">I</a>  think that what we have to continue to do is forge ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2595.371s">This</a>  is very similar to 2008 when Massachusetts had a recession and Governor Deval Patrick had to freeze everything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2607.04s">We</a>  continue to do what we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2609.522s">until</a>  we can no longer do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2612.264s">Because</a>  the unknown is too wide, it's too time consuming, and it will drain the energy from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2619.249s">I</a>  do believe that there are organizations out there that are holding strong, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2627.816s">And</a>  that are looking at other avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2632.299s">But</a>  if federal funds do get pulled, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2636.728s">Yes,</a>  the organizations that receive federal funding that distribute that funding through other sources, so that work such as what my office does can get done will be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2649.451s">That</a>  is the unfortunate reality.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2653.832s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2654.173s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Lazzaro, and then I have one more question after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2657.393s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2658.274s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2660.114s">I</a>  just wanted to echo President Bearsar's <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2663.759s">appreciation</a>  for your advocacy for the Disability Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2668.103s">And</a>  I would 100% agree, it really seems like staying the course and sticking to what we believe to be the right things to do for our residents and the employees of the city and the people that need representation and can benefit from <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2688.096s">us</a>  continuing to do the right thing for them and moving forward and forging ahead is really the way to ensure that we can keep, you know, enjoying the benefits that we've enjoyed thus far until we can't, if we can't, you know, cross that bridge when we come to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2704.004s">And</a>  I really appreciate that energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2706.165s">So</a>  this budget looks totally appropriate to me, and I appreciate the presentation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2711.248s">It</a>  was really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2712.209s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2713.97s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2715.961s">Thank</a>  you, Council is our director knowledge I just had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2721.205s">One</a>  and a half more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2724.666s">I</a>  just noticed the self-response on the demographic snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2729.347s">Definitely,</a>  you know, we were missing a lot of men, we were missing a lot of police, fire, DPW, and I'm wondering, do we have any kind of strategy or thoughts on how to try to get a little bit more engagement from those areas in that survey?</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2748.792s">I</a>  think the real issue is the trust that people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2753.877s">I</a>  think that this is very new, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2757.059s">We're</a>  asking people to put something on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2760.282s">What</a>  does it mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2761.203s">Why</a>  do you want and why do you need all this information? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2766.747s">My</a>  hope is that now that we at least have some responses, it can be used to show that this is not information that is, you know, going to be harmful to you in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2781.995s">This</a>  is information that we can utilize so that we can become better. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2786.637s">We</a>  can actually become what is known as a model employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2792.601s">So</a>  maybe every six months sending out the link as well as the option of utilizing the form could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2802.87s">I've</a>  not really given much thought to that yet because my mind has gone to the build out already. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2813.038s">But</a>  yeah, that's an idea every six months, you know, a brief reminder. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2817.439s">I</a>  think that we will start to see an increase because it seems like newer employees who are more accustomed to forms such as these, right, are the ones that are completing the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2831.543s">Continue</a>  to work on relationship management with the police department, with my fire department to see if I can increase <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2842.848s">on</a>  the responses, but it would be nice because I do believe that we are not at 1.8% for veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2853.956s">We</a>  are higher than that because our veterans are primarily in our law enforcement and fire department.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2863.042s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2863.543s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2863.843s">That</a>  was a thought that I had had as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2865.864s">So</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2868.566s">Any</a>  further questions for Director Nwaje? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2874.028s">Seeing</a>  none, Frances, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2876.772s">Much</a>  appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Frances Nwajei]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2877.753s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2878.714s">Thank</a>  you all for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2879.876s">Take</a>  care.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2881.538s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2883.12s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2883.641s">Next,</a>  we will take up HR Workers' Comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2887.947s">Sorry,</a>  Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2898.285s">We'll</a>  get you out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2901.166s">Just</a>  really quickly, thanks for being here Director Crowley. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2905.528s">Just</a>  going to go quickly through this we have HR and workers comp the budget for human resources fiscal 25 was 269 480. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2911.13s">And</a>  for fiscal 26 it's proposed at 324 93 for an increase net increase of 51,013. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2922.836s">which</a>  is pretty significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2924.517s">The</a>  main thing are some fixed cost growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2926.397s">There</a>  was an employee hired in fiscal 25, and the fiscal 25 budget was lower than the expected pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2934.762s">There</a>  were also COLA and step increases, and inflationary costs for office supplies and advertising and recruitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2941.865s">And</a>  there's a new expense called case management at $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2944.807s">And</a>  that's explained as an amount that's added for various medical expenses for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2951.696s">And</a>  then we also have workers comp which is going up from 788,000 fiscal 25 to 928,000 fiscal 26 that's $140,000 or about 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2956.221s">So</a>  with that I will turn it over to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2966.01s">to</a>  talk about the change in those two budgets, any other details you might want to share, talk about some of your accomplishments for the previous year, some goals for next year, and then what needs and priorities are not funded this year that we need to see funded in future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2980.881s">And</a>  with that, I'll turn it over to our HR director.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2983.343s">Thank</a>  you, President Paz and Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2984.885s">Sorry</a>  if you can't hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2986.486s">I'm</a>  losing my voice.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2987.206s">We</a>  might need to move you closer or move you further.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2990.129s">Move</a>  me closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2991.85s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2992.65s">So</a>  some of the highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=2994.833s">for</a>  this past year where we were able to ratify five contracts with fire clerical, DPW, parking and traffic supervisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3004.217s">So</a>  that was, so that we have done since last June or July. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3011.721s">We're</a>  now currently working with the library and dispatches on renewing their contracts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3017.043s">And</a>  we have a few more to go through the police and superiors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3020.966s">We've</a>  also established a master tracking for all employees which we didn't have prior to my arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3027.55s">We</a>  like to call it the Enzo project because we had an intern who started it with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3031.712s">His</a>  name was Enzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3033.133s">So</a>  that is a lifetime tracking of all our current employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3037.215s">from</a>  their steps to their start dates to when they get promoted, what their current position is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3044.057s">If</a>  somebody asks how many clerical personnel do we have, we can take that in a snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3049.719s">So</a>  that's something that we've developed and we've been updating as we do any kind of changes for personnel for the HR office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3057.181s">So</a>  that was pretty exciting because we didn't have that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3060.082s">before,</a>  so it's very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3063.503s">We've</a>  created a new hire process, which we've been working on for about the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3068.745s">We</a>  didn't really have anything that was streamlined or standardized beforehand, so we are working through that process, which is very helpful when we're posting and we're looking for qualified candidates where we're posting, how we're posting, working with the DEI director to make sure that we're trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3086.972s">cast</a>  a wider net. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3088.073s">So</a>  we're looking at how our job descriptions are labeled and looking for really the minimum requirements for the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3095.357s">A</a>  lot of our job descriptions were updated where they said you needed a master's degree, but really you may have not even needed a high school diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3102.602s">So</a>  when we limit or we expand what the education is beyond what the education is needed, we shorten that net. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3109.786s">So</a>  we're trying to cast a wide net and get the qualified people in for each position. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3117.048s">We</a>  have developed an internal process for updating our policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3123.309s">That's</a>  a process where when we're developing, we talk with it up hot and as we work with the administration, most of the time we actually have to send them to the unions for their approval, give them 10 days to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3134.752s">so</a>  that we can come up with a comprehensive policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3137.634s">So</a>  we've been working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3138.855s">We're</a>  working on updating our quarries every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3143.778s">That's</a>  by state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3146.419s">You</a>  need to update everybody's quarry, whether they're an employee, they're a part-time employee, a full-time employee, every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3154.244s">So</a>  we have it on a rotating schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3157.306s">So</a>  you may see yourselves even in three years asking for a new quarry. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3161.808s">We've</a>  also completed an I-9 audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3164.53s">Those</a>  are really important because if we ever get audited by the government, the cost for just one wrong I-9 is very costly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3173.614s">So</a>  we went through every single personnel file and they're kept separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3179.296s">So</a>  we went through every file to make sure that every personnel in the city had an updated I-9 or actually had an I-9 <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3187.174s">in</a>  the I-9 jacket. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3189.876s">So</a>  we've implemented partnerships with JJ Keller, who is the safety training for our DPW employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3198.34s">We</a>  have been hearing that employees like the training, they want the training, they want some professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3203.283s">So</a>  in last year's budget, the council had approved us updating that training, so that has been very helpful moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3210.187s">We</a>  also partnered with Trolliant and they are doing our state and federal compliance training. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3215.69s">It's</a>  very helpful because it's online and they can start and stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3218.752s">So</a>  if police and fire are starting a training and they need to stop to go on a call or what have you, they can stop the training and pick up from where they left off and still get full credit when they complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3229.058s">There's</a>  a back portion to that where I get notification when somebody hasn't completed their training. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3235.763s">So</a>  we'll send out a notification saying, you started the training on May 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3240.005s">It's</a>  May 15 you still haven't finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3242.986s">What</a>  else you need we give them time, you know time restraints for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3246.107s">So</a>  that's very helpful so that we know that everybody's completed the required trainings that they're they're supposed to be doing throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3254.051s">So</a>  goals for the HR department. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3256.572s">We</a>  want to develop a comprehensive employee handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3260.213s">We</a>  do have a handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3261.394s">I</a>  think it's outdated, and it's not complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3264.536s">So</a>  we're working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3265.677s">We're</a>  working on a newsletter that will come out every month, spotlighting various projects throughout the city, employees, 20 year employees, 10 year employees, giving them some information about the benefits that we offer, how they can link to different things like FMLA forms and workers comp forms and whatever they might need, and some <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3287.162s">educational</a>  training that we have linked to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3289.404s">So</a>  if somebody really likes the training in the library, they can just do it at their own time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3294.107s">If</a>  they want to, it's more voluntary than something that we're going to require them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3298.41s">And</a>  some trivia and some fun facts as we go along so that the first newsletter, I think, is set for June or July. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3307.476s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3308.097s">We</a>  are also working on implementing, hopefully, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3313.595s">Some</a>  kind of HR system that we can use that is more online to apply for a job instead of being so paper heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3322.632s">So</a>  we're looking into that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3325.748s">more</a>  training for our department heads and our middle management. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3329.629s">We</a>  are partnering with Adam Sutton Consulting, and they do half-day retreats with department heads, and they do, you know, education, and we find out where our weaknesses are, and then we kind of tie it together so that we can funnel that down through our employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3347.065s">working</a>  closely now that we have our new solicitor, that our departments will work very closely together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3353.932s">So</a>  those are just some of the ongoing projects we're trying to also make sure that when we ratify a CBA or a collective bargaining agreement that we get one agreement instead of having like four or five MOAs or side letters that everything's <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3369.028s">complete</a>  one place so that's pretty much where we're trying to go this year seems it's a lot of work it's not a lot of tasks, but it's a lot of work to each task. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3380.289s">If</a>  I can get to the increases in the budget, excuse me, like you said, President Bears, most of it is personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3386.754s">We</a>  went from a full part-time to a full-time HR administrator, and some of those funds were upper funds last year, so we have to absorb the full cost of that position this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3397.604s">Also,</a>  just market increases with advertising, supplies, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3402.748s">where</a>  we post. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3403.91s">So</a>  it's really just market increases, not much more increases to the budget, the HR budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3411.557s">Unfortunately,</a>  on the workers comp side, I'll probably talk about them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3418.504s">That's</a>  a little bit harder to budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3420.886s">Because</a>  we never know who's going to get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3423.651s">The</a>  problem with that is we also pay for the medicals. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3427.294s">There's</a>  no way to really budget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3428.775s">So</a>  we kind of do like a three-year back look to see what it looked like. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3433.659s">When</a>  I got here, it was under-budgeted by a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3437.542s">So</a>  last year I had to kind of bridge that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3440.024s">And</a>  then this year I'm trying to finish the bridge of that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3444.768s">So</a>  that's really Worker's Comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3446.929s">We</a>  pay about, right now we pay $8,335 a week <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3453.495s">and</a>  workers' comp payouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3454.996s">So</a>  that's about $433,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3460.0s">And</a>  that's just, you know, we can't really budget for when that will go. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3464.964s">We</a>  do have a couple of people on there that will be lifers, that will be on there for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3469.007s">So</a>  that's where the increase of the workers' comp into us as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3476.192s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3476.792s">Do</a>  we have any questions?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3478.614s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3481.216s">Thank</a>  you so much for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3483.355s">I</a>  know they just clarify, you know, it's like one of my big sticking points is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3488.882s">ratifying</a>  contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3490.002s">And</a>  I know that it's good to see that we're moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3492.443s">So</a>  I appreciate the hard work, but I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3494.724s">So</a>  it's Medford, patrolmen, supervisors, library, dispatch, and building, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3501.586s">Are</a>  those the last ones that we ratified? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3503.886s">Are</a>  these the ones that are still open?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3506.147s">Still</a>  open is superiors, police, inspectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3511.668s">Dispatch</a>  is just up for renewal and libraries for renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3515.069s">So</a>  we're working on those as well.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3516.33s">Are</a>  we getting close?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3517.672s">dispatching</a>  library. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3518.632s">I</a>  hope so.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3519.293s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3520.053s">Other</a>  ones still have some time.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3521.513s">We're</a>  still working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3522.573s">Okay,</a>  so I know some of them are in fact finding right now.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3524.934s">So</a>  I know that, you know, I work in a municipality next door, and I just saw what What neighbor community just offered their police department and with four year retro, and it's a lot of money.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3540.398s">So</a>  I</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3543.976s">be</a>  interesting to see how we can fund that.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3546.378s">We're</a>  trying to be as fair as we can.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3550.082s">Not</a>  easy.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3550.683s">No,</a>  it's not.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3552.264s">I</a>  think the other issue and concern that I've had for a long time is, and it might not fall with your department, but it'd be interesting to know, as we've had so many concerned issues with legal issues with <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3568.34s">grievances</a>  through our employees, not particularly anyone in personnel to keep it confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3578.105s">Is</a>  there a line here that does it come out of your department for arbitration costs, for attorney's fees?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3586.59s">I</a>  believe that comes out of the legal budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3589.331s">I</a>  mean, I'm the one who handles them, but the results come out of the legal budget.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3600.922s">seems</a>  pretty substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3602.503s">So</a>  from what I've gotten for legal documents from union representation, and it's a lot of money.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3610.927s">It's</a>  a lot of work.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3612.628s">And</a>  it's a I would hope we could find a way to tighten up these legalities in these, these battles that go back and forth with, I think losing and then appealing and then so it's something that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3629.56s">you</a>  know, when we look at good money leaving the city, I think that a lot of it has to do with fair labor practice and making sure that we're doing the right thing with our employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3639.046s">So</a>  I appreciate your input, and I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3643.929s">It's</a>  something that I'll keep asking as we move forward, because I think that if we look at many of the lines, and if we look to the actuals and month to month, and we see where monies are going, there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3658.537s">legal</a>  departments that are getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3660.633s">chunks</a>  of chunks of money throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3662.774s">And</a>  even though we did get a $7.5 million increase in an override and still have money in free cash, and even though that's supposedly not a lot of money, I guess we're still in fiscal constraints and supposedly in some dire funding needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3682.503s">So</a>  be interesting to see where we can, as we move forward, where we can recover and what we can do better to make sure we're not using <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3690.96s">funds</a>  that don't need to be spent.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3692.661s">I</a>  think building those relationships, we're starting to build relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3697.602s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3699.003s">And</a>  I'm hoping that the solicitor's office will be able to make those even stronger.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3701.884s">I</a>  hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3702.884s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3703.524s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3705.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3705.745s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3710.147s">Seeing</a>  none, I have a couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3712.227s">Give</a>  me a second here, get some feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3721.031s">Could</a>  you talk a little bit more about the case management line item?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3725.154s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3725.514s">So</a>  the case management is, so when we're working with our workers' comp, sometimes we need investigations or nurses to work on the cases because the employees aren't being very responsive with their physicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3738.604s">And</a>  instead of us just saying, okay, we'll wait for you to get your doctor's note, and they stay on long, we can hire a case manager who can actually <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3746.249s">not</a>  violate any HIPAA laws and actually go out and talk with the doctors to try to get their information so we can make sure that the employee is up on compensation is really doing what he's supposed to do to try to get back to work.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3758.838s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3759.098s">Along</a>  those lines, do we expect a much smaller increase for workers' comp next year, or how much of the gap have we closed?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3768.604s">So</a>  I don't see workers' comp going <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3773.49s">down.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3774.01s">I'm</a>  hoping we can kind of level it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3776.151s">The</a>  school department has their own, so I'm not sure how their claims are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3781.434s">But</a>  we seem to kind of find some kind of place right now where we don't see it moving too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3789.758s">Somebody</a>  could get hurt tomorrow, and it could be catastrophic. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3794.16s">So</a>  it's really hard to judge.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3802.72s">Is</a>  there any way, I mean, this is supposed to be a form of insurance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3806.341s">Like,</a>  seems like we're paying a lot of money.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3814.383s">So</a>  if you're talking about like using their health insurance opposed to using their workers comp?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3819.444s">Just</a>  in general, like their workers comp, like, you know, is there a better deal out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3824.125s">Are</a>  we getting the best deal?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3825.466s">So</a>  I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3827.729s">I</a>  think every time that you look at that and you go out and you try to bid, sometimes you can get more rates, but they're pretty standard across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3836.057s">We</a>  just went from Metatrol who stopped working on the 111F to Future Comp, so that actually helped us save money because they were already working on our workers' comp side. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3846.607s">So</a>  to bring in the 111F, there wasn't a lot of more <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3851.192s">additives</a>  that they have, because they're already charging us to run the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3854.695s">So</a>  we actually saved a little money doing that and switch.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3858.498s">What's</a>  the difference between 111F and the workers comps?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3861.061s">So</a>  111F will be police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3862.742s">It's</a>  just chapter 111F. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3864.704s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3865.384s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3865.645s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3865.865s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3866.646s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3866.966s">Workers</a>  comp on the city.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3867.786s">So</a>  now it's everyone in the city is on the same.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3869.888s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3870.449s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3873.111s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3873.511s">Two</a>  more things, just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3876.207s">seems</a>  like we've been able to fill more open positions than over the previous years.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3881.368s">I</a>  don't know if you want to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3882.968s">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3883.548s">So,</a>  I mean, with the help of now another full-time staff member, that's really been helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3889.59s">I</a>  think I had the numbers here somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3892.23s">We've</a>  brought on about 32 professional staff, including department heads, and maybe about 20 to 30 new police officers and firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3903.052s">And</a>  we're just putting 13, 12 now, possibly 13 firefighters into the academy over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3909.896s">So</a>  we'll be increasing those numbers by 13, and we have a few coming out of the police academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3915.458s">So</a>  because of the extra staff, we're able to turn that over much quicker.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3920.461s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3922.782s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3924.583s">Last</a>  question, classification and compensation study. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3927.644s">What's</a>  the progress on that?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3929.025s">And</a>  when are we going to be able to implement it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3932.752s">So</a>  the project actually started, I think, before I started, and it started out as the city trying to find out if they had any outliers of somebody who's really underpaid or within the comparable cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3946.025s">Preliminary</a>  numbers that proposed that have come in as methods kind of right in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3951.25s">We're</a>  not on the upper high, we're not on the low, we're kind of in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3953.953s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3954.727s">which</a>  was really good for us, that we found that we don't have a lot of people that are underpaid, even though we have people complaining that they're underpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3962.711s">The</a>  study shows that we're pretty much in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3965.072s">So</a>  with that information, now we have to really solidify the job descriptions because you can't look at a compensation study after that until you know what the job descriptions are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3976.557s">And</a>  some of us are from the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3978.618s">So</a>  we're bringing those up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3980.479s">We've</a>  done the employee questionnaire <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3983.407s">So</a>  right now, the employees have reviewed their job descriptions, the department heads have reviewed what the employees say they do, opposed to what they are actually supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3992.672s">We</a>  did an administrator review, myself and Nina reviewed all of them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=3997.615s">They</a>  went out to the comp and class, which is call-in center, and they drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4002.277s">Now</a>  we have final drafts for us to do a final review on for the job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4008.568s">Once</a>  we get that finalized, we're hoping to have that done by September. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4012.31s">It's</a>  a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4013.03s">There's</a>  like we did 125 titles, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4017.732s">We</a>  have to send them out to the unions, because now the union employee or union position, I should say, not employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4024.734s">The</a>  unions now have to look at it, give their comments, see if they agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4030.277s">Then</a>  we get that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4031.694s">We</a>  look at them, see if we agree with what the union said, send it back to the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4036.098s">They</a>  have to revamp it and send it back to us for a final review. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4039.982s">So</a>  hopefully in September, we'll have some more information on where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4044.026s">It's</a>  a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4045.067s">I</a>  understand it's been a long process, but I think it started, then it stopped for a little while because there was nobody in the office to run it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4052.914s">And</a>  then when I came in just about two years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4056.534s">That</a>  was my second initiative to get it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4059.335s">And</a>  so although it seems like it's been going for a very long time, it was a big chunk of time where nothing was happening because there was nobody to manage it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4067.736s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4068.336s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4071.337s">In</a>  a final report, will we be able to see both the compensation elements as well as the new job descriptions? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4076.518s">And</a>  that will be available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4078.839s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4080.719s">And</a>  it sounds like if we're really lucky, January?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4086.172s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4086.833s">If</a>  you put me before Frances next year, because her presentations are amazing, and I'm tired of following them.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4094.66s">Everyone's</a>  jockeying for position in these. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4097.162s">I've</a>  already disappointed Barbara. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4099.304s">So,</a>  you know, I don't even want to know what happened with Richly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4104.989s">But</a>  no, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4106.71s">You</a>  know, I appreciate the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4108.752s">Any</a>  further questions on our HR or worker's comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4114.59s">Seeing</a>  none, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Crowley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4116.491s">Thank</a>  you, have a good evening.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4117.831s">All</a>  right, library. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4122.553s">We</a>  have director Barbara Kerr and we have Grace David from our trustees here and maybe lost a trustee. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4131.936s">Sorry</a>  about that.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4132.736s">Bonnie</a>  had to go to the band concert at school.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4134.997s">We</a>  gained one, we lost one.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4140.138s">John</a>  Grace Caldara who are two of my five.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4143.724s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4144.444s">I'm</a>  turning you down. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4145.265s">We</a>  had a way up for Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4147.486s">Okay,</a>  so you'll be good.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4148.806s">It's</a>  a new system.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4150.387s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4152.728s">I</a>  have stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4154.069s">Well,</a>  first I need to read.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4160.332s">We</a>  want to hear the stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4161.412s">We</a>  love the stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4162.733s">All</a>  right, I have what I have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4166.115s">Alrighty.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4167.573s">Library,</a>  Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4169.494s">We</a>  had from the general fund, subsidy general fund, fiscal 25, $2,247,934. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4173.696s">We're</a>  looking at for fiscal 26, $2,324,029 for an increase of $76,095 or about 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4176.016s">And</a>  we have there, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4191.608s">an</a>  increase of one position, it looks like, which is good, although I'm sure you'll tell me maybe that that's not coming from the general fund at all, or maybe it's a typo, I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4204.116s">What</a>  position is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4206.978s">It's</a>  a professional assistant, it says, that we're going from 14 to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4214.343s">Seems</a>  no one knows about that except for what's on the sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4219.375s">But</a>  we can come back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4221.256s">But</a>  as I said, there's a net increase of 76,095. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4226.739s">Most</a>  of this is in our fixed cost growth, the vast majority, with step raises and COLA increases for permanent employees, an increase in rates for part-time employees, longevity and a sick leave buyback estimate for fiscal 26 retirements, contracted services increase for some stormable landscaping and other service costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4248.59s">increase</a>  in the price of office supplies, increase in the price of cleaning supplies, an increase for the audiovisual budget, physical media being in high demand, and AV costs being cut last year or reduced from the initial proposal last year, $5,000 increase, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4265.988s">for</a>  library books and periodicals, and then there's one new expense, continuing education, the PLA convention in 2026, the big national conference for public libraries, multiple staff are attending, so there's more expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4279.377s">So</a>  with that, we have Director Kerr with us, and we're going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4285.607s">The</a>  prompt is just three things, talking about your budget and what the change was, two, talking about accomplishments for the last year, goals for next year, and three, what are key needs and priorities that you'd like to see funded that we weren't able to fund this year?</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4298.696s">So</a>  Nina and I are still working on a couple of personnel things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4302.118s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4302.859s">There</a>  was a children's department position that's been vacant for a couple of years, so we're trying to make that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4309.966s">We</a>  would also very much like to get the hourly part time rates to the equivalent of the same full time jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4318.151s">That's</a>  not going to happen this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4319.332s">I</a>  think they're going to get a small increase, but that's sort of my long term collaborative maybe we could all work on it because <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4328.16s">Right</a>  now, we have somebody who she works for us for $19 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4331.862s">And</a>  when she substitutes at Winchester, she gets 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4335.123s">And</a>  that's pretty much the way it is across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4337.644s">Our</a>  part-time salary rates are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4340.946s">And</a>  we're a revolving door. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4342.206s">We've</a>  been through so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4343.647s">It's</a>  like, why would you stay here if you go to Winchester? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4347.649s">Because</a>  it's more fun here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4349.069s">But</a>  I think they're, in order to work for us full-time, part-time, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4357.095s">you</a>  have three part-time jobs, or you have somebody at home who's paying the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4362.159s">And</a>  so we don't keep people forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4364.641s">So</a>  that's something we would very much like to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4368.283s">To</a>  get that to happen would be a very substantial increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4371.626s">I</a>  think this year is going to be a smaller one, which we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4374.588s">So</a>  hopefully that will work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4375.749s">And</a>  I think we're also working on the children's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4379.292s">So</a>  that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4380.272s">But</a>  the other stuff, pretty much everything we asked for in our expenses we got, which was terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4386.692s">And</a>  you want the stats now? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4389.515s">Here's</a>  the stats.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4390.116s">Let's</a>  go. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4390.316s">Yeah,</a>  how do we do it?</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4391.377s">So</a>  we are crazy busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4393.339s">And</a>  there are 370 libraries in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4396.762s">And</a>  we were 18th in terms of circulation, 13th in total programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4403.669s">8th</a>  in teen programs, although they tell me they're actually 7th because Bellingham cheated. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4410.315s">And</a>  then they were counting attendance at a drop-in afternoon, which is just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4414.779s">And</a>  then 9th in children's programming for ages 0 to 5, and 23rd for programming for ages 6 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4422.446s">And</a>  we had 860 programs last year with an attendance of 16,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4426.65s">So</a>  we are very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4430.977s">And</a>  it's been a very good year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4432.398s">We</a>  got a Cummings grant that is actually funding two people for the Makerspace. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4438.002s">So</a>  the Makerspace programming has tripled since they started. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4441.365s">They're</a>  a bit compulsive, so it should really only be doubled, but they want to do everything now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4448.19s">And</a>  we're also able to do a part-time programming librarian from that grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4452.978s">And</a>  that's been very good too, because with all those programs you need somebody to expedite to manage things and do the scheduling and the publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4462.812s">And</a>  this year we also started 55 plus programming, we have a senior advisory board who <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4470.073s">They</a>  heckle each other a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4471.854s">They</a>  have monthly meetings, but they come up with program ideas and then we work the staff works with them to fit in great here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4480.677s">Now</a>  that I am a senior, I appreciate the heckling. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4484.578s">And</a>  I was going to mention that I'm planning to retire next April. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4488.779s">This</a>  might actually be my last budget hearing.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4491.32s">We've</a>  got to lead with that.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4493.221s">It's</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4494.002s">Well,</a>  I was going to but I got so excited.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4497.764s">Too</a>  excited about all the great things you're doing.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4500.706s">We</a>  had 202,000 people come into the building last year.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4503.387s">Wow.</a> </p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4505.679s">The</a>  fairytale ball is coming up in a couple of weeks, and that's usually 700 people, most of them under the age of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4512.141s">I</a>  got strep two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4514.282s">I'm</a>  hoping not. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4515.182s">I'm</a>  planning not to this year, but I said I wouldn't go last year because I didn't want to get sick, so I will be braver this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4524.504s">What</a>  are other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4525.225s">55</a>  plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4528.123s">Youth</a>  services is trying to do a lot more outreach, so we've added some part time people so they are doing a couple of them go once a month to after school programs and Nicole who is the head of youth services has a deal with the librarian at the high school which is great she goes and she presents to every single class at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4547.408s">And</a>  they like us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4549.208s">She</a>  had teen trivia night Friday, and apparently all the sixth grader boys came. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4554.329s">And</a>  it was very loud, and they all sang along to things. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4557.89s">But</a>  it's good that they want to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4560.851s">And</a>  now that there are fewer early release days, everybody's much calmer, because that was interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4565.932s">So</a>  that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4568.872s">With</a>  that, I took out my dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4573.333s">Oh,</a>  so we also got a Bloomberg digital, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4577.013s">digital</a>  innovation grant for $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4579.954s">With</a>  that, we're going to be digitizing a large portion of the local history collection, which is terrific, because right now, in order to do research, you have to go in there and handle everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4593.397s">So</a>  this is good.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4594.057s">I</a>  heard you took my microfilm.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4595.958s">I'm</a>  sorry, your microfilm is actually in boxes in the back hallway, but it's going out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4601.139s">And</a>  then you'll be able to do it from home in a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4603.259s">No,</a>  it'll be great.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4604.28s">You</a>  remember, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Barbara Kerr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/eDgDbZ9kFxs&t=4605.498s">So</a>  they're taking the microfilm, the yearbooks, a lot of the town reports, the lists of persons.</p>
