1
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:17,610
Test one, two.

2
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:50,827
Medford City Council Committee of the Whole May 20 2025 is called to order Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

3
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:51,667
Councilor Kellyanne.

4
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:54,389
Vice President Collins.

5
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:57,651
Councilor Lazaro.

6
00:19:59,032 --> 00:19:59,913
Councilor Lemming is absent.

7
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:00,654
Councilor Scarpelli.

8
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:02,235
Councilor Seng.

9
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,335
President Behrs.

10
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:03,936
Present.

11
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,097
Six present one absent the meeting is called to order.

12
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:14,904
There'll be a meeting in the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6pm in the City Council Chamber second floor Medford City Hall 85 George P. Hassett Drive Medford MA and via Zoom.

13
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,009
action and discussion items.

14
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,650
25 039 annual budget process for fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget meeting three.

15
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,011
It will be the third preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 26 budget process.

16
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,371
The mayor has communicated the following departments will be present.

17
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:37,754
Chevalier, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Library, Human Resources, Planning, Development and Sustainability, and the Liquor Commission.

18
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:44,055
The police were on the agenda, but the chief is not available, so that has been moved to next Tuesday, the 27th.

19
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,116
We'll be starting at 5.30.

20
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,619
along with DPW and the schools.

21
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,764
So with that, we will take Chevalier first, and I'll just read quickly.

22
00:20:56,824 --> 00:21:02,929
We had fiscal year 2025 budget, 32,000, fiscal 2026 budget proposed 32,640.

23
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:16,518
And with that, we have Director Riggi, and I'm gonna ask you just to describe the budget, any changes, some fiscal 25 accomplishments, goals for next year, and if there are any

24
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:21,164
key needs and priorities that aren't funded this year that you'd like to see funded in the future.

25
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,145
And I will go to our Facilities Director, Paul Ringy.

26
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,046
Thank you, President Behrs.

27
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:33,329
The budget that's reflected shows the personnel budget for the Chevalier Theatre.

28
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:39,432
What our plan is to actually move that personnel line item over to the facilities budget.

29
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,854
since he's part of the facility staff.

30
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:48,282
So that would come for fiscal year 2026 as part of the facility's budget.

31
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:56,254
The rest of the funding that we use at the Chevalier is in special funding accounts.

32
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:03,417
Part of that money is used for general wear and tear and upkeep to the building.

33
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:12,223
Part of it's used to enhancements like the new LED lighting in the ceiling and the new video signage outside that we did.

34
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:19,027
Previous projects were redoing the masonry on the front facade of the building.

35
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,226
I'm looking in the future.

36
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:32,030
We're looking at emergency lighting that is needed inside the theater at the seats because it's lacking when the show lights go down there, especially in the balcony area.

37
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,551
There is not emergency lighting strips.

38
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:37,993
We had installed some emergency lighting strips.

39
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:40,933
on the main floor of the theater.

40
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:43,875
And now we find that there is a need for the second floor.

41
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:48,198
So that will be a priority for fiscal year 26 to do.

42
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:57,584
And we're hoping to get funding from the casino mitigation fund that we could actually repaint the entire interior of the theater.

43
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:03,487
Right now it's a salmon and green, which is not conducive to show.

44
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,489
So I'm hoping that we get the $350,000

45
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,853
that we requested so we can do that work in the theater.

46
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:15,556
Thank you, Director Riggi.

47
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,339
You brought up something that's a great note for everyone.

48
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,245
We're talking about the general fund budget, but that's not all of the money that our different city departments and schools use.

49
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:34,129
So thank you for mentioning what's going on with other funds from the state and casino, etc.

50
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:40,635
Do we have any questions from members of the Council for Director Riggi about the Chevalier budget?

51
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:51,803
Seeing none, do we have any questions from the public either in person or on Zoom about the Chevalier general fund budget?

52
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,167
Seeing none, thank you very much.

53
00:23:57,548 --> 00:23:57,828
Thank you.

54
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:07,385
Next up we have the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office Budget.

55
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,907
Director Nwaje is here with us on Zoom.

56
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,168
Thank you for being here.

57
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,429
We're making you a co-host.

58
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:14,810
I think you had a presentation.

59
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,750
You might want to share it.

60
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:23,536
I'm seeing a thumbs up, so you'll be able to unmute and share your presentation, but I will just quickly read off

61
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,310
We had a fiscal 25 budget of $118,502.

62
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,211
A fiscal 26 proposed budget of $120,911.

63
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,671
And this is an increase of $2,409.

64
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:33,652
There's an increase in the permanent employees for a COLA increase and an increase of $1,000 in office supplies.

65
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:38,033
And those are both fixed cost increases.

66
00:24:54,577 --> 00:25:16,789
With that, turning it over to Director Nwaje for the presentation and also, you know, the general prompt is just to talk about the budget change, any other details you might want to share about the budget, talk about any accomplishments of the previous year, goals for next year, and items that are key needs and priorities that were not funded this year that you'd like to see funded in future years.

67
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,491
And with that, I'll turn it over to Director Nwaje.

68
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:26,875
Thank you so much for allowing me to do this via Zoom.

69
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:33,579
I think that some of the questions will be answered through the PowerPoint.

70
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:46,006
Just let me know if you can see it.

71
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:48,048
Yes, we can.

72
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:48,388
Thank you.

73
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,098
All right, fantastic.

74
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:50,739
Thank you.

75
00:25:51,939 --> 00:26:00,762
So again, Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is a space for all who live, work, learn and do business in the city of Medford.

76
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:12,406
And the way that we do that is by upholding the civil rights laws, ensuring that there's access to our programs and access is beyond the physical.

77
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,007
It is anything from somebody needing

78
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:21,311
a large print document so that they can file for an abatement.

79
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,933
And that document is actually a state form.

80
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,855
It doesn't come in large print.

81
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:32,319
So we've got to figure out the best way to handle that situation so that we can assist the constituents.

82
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:43,688
For the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, our work is regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age,

83
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:51,598
disability status, language ability, socioeconomic status, immigration status and political affiliation.

84
00:26:52,339 --> 00:27:00,991
It's really important for people to know and understand that it really is a space for all people and sometimes that can be misinterpreted.

85
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:20,423
We also continue to address inequities, whether they're institutional or systemic, through our work within our own City of Medford agencies and departments, as well as external work with state and federal agencies.

86
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:36,614
Some of our collaborations have included the library, Medford Community Media, who I have to thank Kevin Harrington for his support in one of the accomplishments, the Medford Fire Department, Police Department.

87
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:43,625
public schools, the senior center, the Office of Prevention and Outreach, and that's just to name a few.

88
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:51,817
Our external partnerships include Boston Center for Independent Living, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the MassAbility

89
00:27:52,257 --> 00:28:08,359
The Job Accommodation Network, which is huge for a lot of the ADA needs that take place throughout the city, whether it is a constituent who is in need of accessibility services or an employee who is in need.

90
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:33,418
the MCAD, Mass Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, for always fulfilling my interpreter requests, Medford Housing Authority, Medford Health Matters, the Mass Office on Disability, New England ADA Center, who is our go-to resource, Tufts University, and of course, my strongest community partner, the West Medford Community Center.

91
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,521
As you know our office has put on a variety of events.

92
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:53,947
We hosted the first salute to our veterans dinner back in November of last year and this was done in collaboration with the office of veterans affairs and it was a dinner because we were trying to target

93
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:57,370
veterans within a specific age group.

94
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:03,436
Those are the veterans that under-report and under-utilize services.

95
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,920
So that was why it was done in that format.

96
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,083
Lunar New Year hosted in collaboration with Medford

97
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:34,192
High School Asian Club, the Black History Month Community Event, the Black History Month Employee Luncheon, where we had Oma Moses as a guest speaker, Medford Connect's partner retreat that was done in partnership with the Office of Prevention and Outreach, and the Disability Fair hosted in partnership with the Commission on Persons with Disabilities.

98
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:41,416
and just, you know, just put in some corresponding flyers to break up the verbal.

99
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:57,184
So our upcoming events include the Pride flag raising ceremony and festival that is taking place on Friday, May 30th.

100
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:02,207
It starts at 4.30 and that would be followed by the

101
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,590
Juneteenth flag-raising celebration.

102
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,255
That's on Wednesday, June 18th, and that starts at four.

103
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:23,148
And if you remember last year's event, I will say remember to bring your dancing shoes this year because we have confirmed with a band from Texas, so.

104
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:38,209
flyer for the Pride event and thank you to Councillor Lozaro for being kind enough to share remarks on behalf of City Council at this event.

105
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,115
And Juneteenth is in the works.

106
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:51,830
So our accomplishments so far, and remember the work of this office is very fluid.

107
00:30:52,430 --> 00:31:00,993
It's responsive to what is happening in the moment and time, and also a lot of projection and forecasting.

108
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:06,676
So just like the tide, it comes in, it goes out, and it shifts and changes.

109
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:18,339
We were able to acquire upgraded accessible listening devices, which we now have in the sort of hall chambers utilizing ARPA funds.

110
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,780
So that was where Medford Community Media was instrumental.

111
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:33,223
We also acquired accessible seating in the chambers because all the chairs that we had for guests, none of the chairs had any arms.

112
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:38,224
So we were able to utilize some ARPA funds to bring those in.

113
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:43,685
Completed the MCAD training series for the entire Medford Fire Department.

114
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:53,088
Completed the TRIO series of trainings for SEIU and Teamsters employees at Medford Public Schools.

115
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:59,029
And that was done in partnership with Teamsters Union and SEIU.

116
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,590
So thank you to both Brian Hatch and

117
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:05,605
Joe Montana for their willingness to support that.

118
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:10,790
And we started the foundational build of the diversity dashboard.

119
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:16,535
So what is the diversity dashboard?

120
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:22,301
It's a voluntary self-identification and affirmative action capturing system.

121
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:27,025
It utilizes the criterias of identification that are

122
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,061
already identified by the federal government.

123
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:42,144
So if we had online systems, these forms would already pop up, but it allows people to self-report, which is, you know, the real, where the real value is.

124
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:49,946
The dashboard was created with support of a student intern from Tufts University.

125
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:56,337
The dashboard can be, the information that goes onto the dashboard can be done in two ways.

126
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:03,862
Paper copies, so paper copies are on hand city side and also on hand school side.

127
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:08,846
Or a link can be sent and the employee can enter

128
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:13,025
the information directly into the online system.

129
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:18,308
The dashboard is beneficial because it's a real data set.

130
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:22,610
It's a snapshot of who we are as an employer.

131
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:34,136
Granted, it's a snapshot based on the number of employees that choose to participate, but it is still a snapshot on who we are as an employer,

132
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:48,868
It can be utilized when we're discussing benefits, when you're reviewing hiring trends and practices, when you want to look at where are you pulling your talent from.

133
00:33:50,894 --> 00:34:01,800
And the ultimate goal is for this to continue to be built out and live on the ODEI webpage and be utilized as an interactive tool.

134
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:08,304
So it's still in the infancy stages, but the foundational build is done.

135
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:09,265
It is working.

136
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,685
It auto-populates.

137
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:18,350
And as time moves on, you know, we will be able to build out more and add a variety of different criteria.

138
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:26,325
So example of screenshot from the dashboard itself, right?

139
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:30,928
This is based on, I believe it's 172 respondents.

140
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:40,694
If we're just looking at gender distribution, as you can see from the chart, we are a heavily female employer.

141
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,057
That's what the data shows.

142
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:45,298
It's 74%.

143
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,302
look at veteran status out of 156 that chose to respond.

144
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,962
really don't have that many veterans.

145
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,744
And it could be a variety of reasons.

146
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:20,153
Veteran status is always underreported for many reasons, primarily stigma associated with hiring veterans, difficulty in converting military resumes into civilian resumes.

147
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:24,715
That's why it's really important to ensure that

148
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:45,449
When you are in talent management, recruitment, you understand and you are out with your other counterparts and your other colleagues and you are connected with the important agencies such as veteran services that will do that type of work and help support their veterans in getting

149
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,951
their desired jobs.

150
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:52,336
And then if you take a look, this one is about disability.

151
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:55,259
It was simply a yes, no, I wish not to disclose.

152
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:05,811
So again, we primarily are an employer that does not have a lot of employees with disability in comparison.

153
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:22,003
So I'm going to stop sharing because I would like to use this opportunity now to introduce you to what the online version looks like.

154
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:37,136
So what happens is the Microsoft online form auto-populates, and then it also creates Excel spreadsheets, which can also be utilized.

155
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:39,418
So here, this is the map.

156
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:43,580
As you can see, our heaviest respondents came from the school department.

157
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,442
57% of the 172 responses received were from school employees.

158
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:55,754
So thank you to the school department for that.

159
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:00,867
When you look at again, you look at gender.

160
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:14,379
shows right there, female 72%, male 23%, gender non-conforming 2%, and I do not wish to disclose 1%.

161
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,222
And I wanna add that gender non-conforming was a risk that ODEI took.

162
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:24,705
The federal forms actually don't really give you much leeway.

163
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,927
It's either male, female, or I choose not to disclose.

164
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:39,151
And in respect of all the other identities that are out there, we felt that it was important to have something that people could check beyond I choose not to disclose.

165
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:45,994
And as you can see, race and ethnicity right here, 172 respondents, 83% identify as being white.

166
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,114
So this is who we are as an agency.

167
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:05,853
and 98% identify as not being a veteran.

168
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:10,017
So less than 2% of our employees are veterans.

169
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:21,809
Pardon me for one second, I've got to find you again.

170
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:30,461
Right, so we are back to this.

171
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:40,650
There we go.

172
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:53,060
So, you know, at this point, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion would like to advocate on behalf of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

173
00:38:53,721 --> 00:39:04,130
As we review the functions and the duties and responsibilities, it is important to note that beyond bringing the lived experience

174
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:16,440
to volunteer to be on this commission, there is also a tremendous amount of technical knowledge that is required in order to be able to fulfill the role.

175
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:24,587
This information is taken directly from the ordinance, section 2-303, 2 and 4.

176
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:36,010
in order for commissioners to ensure that there is compliance, they must actually attend trainings.

177
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,472
Powers and duties, section 2-304.

178
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:53,196
Again, in order to understand how to review programs, policies, assist with implementation,

179
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:59,022
commissioners have to go to a two-day CAM training.

180
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:07,594
I look at the Commission for Persons with Disabilities as an extension of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

181
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:12,761
It is three different full-time roles in one umbrella.

182
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:30,848
An ADA need for an employee is very different from a need for a resident, which is very different from a person with a disability that is not able to access a business that is in the city of Medford.

183
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,710
It does not matter whether or not it is a private business.

184
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,912
I really do rely on the commissioners for their support.

185
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:43,015
The camp training, as I said, is two days.

186
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,837
It is six hours each day.

187
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:49,940
So if people are employed, they're taking time off work.

188
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,462
A lot of times I cannot get to the meetings.

189
00:40:54,163 --> 00:41:04,970
I'm fortunate to have Nick for 15 hours a week, but one two-hour trip to the state house and back is his four-hour workday.

190
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,515
So, it's nice if there are conflicting meetings happening.

191
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,197
I can take 1 and it can take another 1.

192
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:14,680
1 of the commissioners can take another 1.

193
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:24,309
So, as a result, I feel that I would not be doing my due diligence, especially based on a SWOT analysis that was done last year.

194
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:27,612
If I did not advocate on behalf of the commission.

195
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:36,158
by requesting a stipend for the commissioners who are serving so that they can acquire the knowledge needed to fulfill their role.

196
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,861
That is really where the equity and inclusion lies.

197
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:51,429
And so, as I like to say, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, we have a tissue for every nose.

198
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:55,592
But we also say, let love be your superpower.

199
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:57,553
Let courage be your guide.

200
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,532
Let hope be your light.

201
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:03,135
Within you lies the power to do what is right.

202
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,978
And on that note, thank you all so much for your time.

203
00:42:07,998 --> 00:42:10,500
I'm open to questions.

204
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:18,446
Thank you, Director Nwaje for the presentation.

205
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:25,652
Do you have any questions for the Director about the budget for the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion?

206
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:35,729
See no hands, I do have a couple of questions for you.

207
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:43,480
Number one, I just wanted to thank you for the advocacy for the Disability Commission.

208
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,121
That's much appreciated.

209
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,405
I hope we can support that advocacy as well as part of our request for the budget.

210
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:52,607
I did have a question around that and some other things.

211
00:42:52,967 --> 00:43:02,355
Is there any impact on your office of the uncertainty around any federal funding and programs or any outside grant funding?

212
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:08,566
I mean, yes, I mean, there is definite impact because you use the key word, right?

213
00:43:08,706 --> 00:43:09,827
Uncertainty.

214
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:14,951
I think that what we have to continue to do is forge ahead.

215
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:26,620
This is very similar to 2008 when Massachusetts had a recession and Governor Deval Patrick had to freeze everything, right?

216
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,922
We continue to do what we can.

217
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:31,183
until we can no longer do it.

218
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:39,229
Because the unknown is too wide, it's too time consuming, and it will drain the energy from you.

219
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:47,676
I do believe that there are organizations out there that are holding strong, right?

220
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:51,298
And that are looking at other avenues.

221
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,722
But if federal funds do get pulled,

222
00:43:56,728 --> 00:44:09,331
Yes, the organizations that receive federal funding that distribute that funding through other sources, so that work such as what my office does can get done will be affected.

223
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:11,612
That is the unfortunate reality.

224
00:44:13,832 --> 00:44:14,153
Thank you.

225
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,353
I'm going to go to Councilor Zaro, and then I have one more question after that.

226
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:18,074
Councilor Zaro.

227
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:18,874
Thank you.

228
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:23,115
I just wanted to echo President Bexar's

229
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:28,063
appreciation for your advocacy for the Disability Commission.

230
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:47,219
And I would 100% agree, it really seems like staying the course and sticking to what we believe to be the right things to do for our residents and the employees of the city and the people that need representation and can benefit from

231
00:44:48,096 --> 00:45:03,764
us continuing to do the right thing for them and moving forward and forging ahead is really the way to ensure that we can keep, you know, enjoying the benefits that we've enjoyed thus far until we can't, if we can't, you know, cross that bridge when we come to it.

232
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,065
And I really appreciate that energy.

233
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:11,228
So this budget looks totally appropriate to me, and I appreciate the presentation as well.

234
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:12,029
It was really helpful.

235
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:12,549
Thank you.

236
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:14,770
Thank you, Councillor.

237
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:20,402
Thank you, Council is our director knowledge I just had one.

238
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:23,946
One and a half more questions.

239
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:28,427
I just noticed the self-response on the demographic snapshot.

240
00:45:29,347 --> 00:45:47,072
Definitely, you know, we were missing a lot of men, we were missing a lot of police, fire, DPW, and I'm wondering, do we have any kind of strategy or thoughts on how to try to get a little bit more engagement from those areas in that survey?

241
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:53,856
I think the real issue is the trust that people have.

242
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,959
I think that this is very new, right?

243
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,822
We're asking people to put something on paper.

244
00:46:00,282 --> 00:46:01,063
What does it mean?

245
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:05,587
Why do you want and why do you need all this information?

246
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:21,515
My hope is that now that we at least have some responses, it can be used to show that this is not information that is, you know, going to be harmful to you in any way.

247
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:26,497
This is information that we can utilize so that we can become better.

248
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:31,480
We can actually become what is known as a model employer.

249
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:42,810
So maybe every six months sending out the link as well as the option of utilizing the form could work.

250
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:51,858
I've not really given much thought to that yet because my mind has gone to the build out already.

251
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:56,939
But yeah, that's an idea every six months, you know, a brief reminder.

252
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:10,483
I think that we will start to see an increase because it seems like newer employees who are more accustomed to forms such as these, right, are the ones that are completing the forms.

253
00:47:11,543 --> 00:47:21,926
Continue to work on relationship management with the police department, with my fire department to see if I can increase

254
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:33,035
on the responses, but it would be nice because I do believe that we are not at 1.8% for veterans.

255
00:47:33,956 --> 00:47:41,641
We are higher than that because our veterans are primarily in our law enforcement and fire department.

256
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:43,263
Yeah.

257
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:43,803
Yeah.

258
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:45,684
That was a thought that I had had as well.

259
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,726
So great.

260
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,708
Any further questions for Director Nwaje?

261
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:55,831
Seeing none, Frances, thank you so much.

262
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:57,733
Much appreciated.

263
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:58,634
All right.

264
00:47:58,714 --> 00:47:59,816
Thank you all for your time.

265
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:00,337
Take care.

266
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:01,859
Thanks.

267
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,501
All right.

268
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:07,326
Next, we will take up HR Workers' Comp.

269
00:48:07,947 --> 00:48:08,507
Sorry, Barbara.

270
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:19,185
We'll get you out of here.

271
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,027
Just really quickly, thanks for being here Director Crowley.

272
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:31,030
Just going to go quickly through this we have HR and workers comp the budget for human resources fiscal 25 was 269 480.

273
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,752
And for fiscal 26 it's proposed at 324 93 for an increase net increase of 51,013.

274
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,896
which is pretty significant.

275
00:48:44,517 --> 00:48:46,357
The main thing are some fixed cost growth.

276
00:48:46,397 --> 00:48:54,722
There was an employee hired in fiscal 25, and the fiscal 25 budget was lower than the expected pay for that.

277
00:48:54,762 --> 00:49:01,285
There were also COLA and step increases, and inflationary costs for office supplies and advertising and recruitment.

278
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:04,307
And there's a new expense called case management at $10,000.

279
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:10,790
And that's explained as an amount that's added for various medical expenses for the city.

280
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:16,141
And then we also have workers comp which is going up from 788,000 fiscal 25 to 928,000 fiscal 26 that's $140,000 or about 18%.

281
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,582
So with that I will turn it over to you.

282
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:40,801
to talk about the change in those two budgets, any other details you might want to share, talk about some of your accomplishments for the previous year, some goals for next year, and then what needs and priorities are not funded this year that we need to see funded in future years.

283
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:43,323
And with that, I'll turn it over to our HR director.

284
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:44,865
Thank you, President Paz and Council.

285
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:46,045
Sorry if you can't hear me.

286
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,186
I'm losing my voice.

287
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:50,109
We might need to move you closer or move you further.

288
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:51,450
Move me closer.

289
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,210
Here we go.

290
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,092
So some of the highlights.

291
00:49:54,833 --> 00:50:03,817
for this past year where we were able to ratify five contracts with fire clerical, DPW, parking and traffic supervisors.

292
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:11,000
So that was, so that we have done since last June or July.

293
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:16,403
We're now currently working with the library and dispatches on renewing their contracts as well.

294
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:20,165
And we have a few more to go through the police and superiors.

295
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:26,609
We've also established a master tracking for all employees which we didn't have prior to my arrival.

296
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:31,392
We like to call it the Enzo project because we had an intern who started it with us.

297
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:32,412
His name was Enzo.

298
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:36,595
So that is a lifetime tracking of all our current employees.

299
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:43,937
from their steps to their start dates to when they get promoted, what their current position is.

300
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:49,159
If somebody asks how many clerical personnel do we have, we can take that in a snapshot.

301
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:57,161
So that's something that we've developed and we've been updating as we do any kind of changes for personnel for the HR office.

302
00:50:57,181 --> 00:50:59,322
So that was pretty exciting because we didn't have that data.

303
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:01,463
before, so it's very helpful.

304
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:08,705
We've created a new hire process, which we've been working on for about the past year.

305
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:25,912
We didn't really have anything that was streamlined or standardized beforehand, so we are working through that process, which is very helpful when we're posting and we're looking for qualified candidates where we're posting, how we're posting, working with the DEI director to make sure that we're trying to

306
00:51:26,972 --> 00:51:27,953
cast a wider net.

307
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:34,717
So we're looking at how our job descriptions are labeled and looking for really the minimum requirements for the job.

308
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:42,122
A lot of our job descriptions were updated where they said you needed a master's degree, but really you may have not even needed a high school diploma.

309
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:49,206
So when we limit or we expand what the education is beyond what the education is needed, we shorten that net.

310
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:56,248
So we're trying to cast a wide net and get the qualified people in for each position.

311
00:51:57,048 --> 00:52:02,369
We have developed an internal process for updating our policies and procedures.

312
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:14,292
That's a process where when we're developing, we talk with it up hot and as we work with the administration, most of the time we actually have to send them to the unions for their approval, give them 10 days to respond.

313
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:17,254
so that we can come up with a comprehensive policy.

314
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,795
So we've been working on that.

315
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:23,297
We're working on updating our quarries every three years.

316
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,399
That's by state and federal law.

317
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:33,764
You need to update everybody's quarry, whether they're an employee, they're a part-time employee, a full-time employee, every three years.

318
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:36,666
So we have it on a rotating schedule.

319
00:52:37,306 --> 00:52:40,828
So you may see yourselves even in three years asking for a new quarry.

320
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:44,029
We've also completed an I-9 audit.

321
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:53,174
Those are really important because if we ever get audited by the government, the cost for just one wrong I-9 is very costly.

322
00:52:53,614 --> 00:52:59,256
So we went through every single personnel file and they're kept separately.

323
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:06,320
So we went through every file to make sure that every personnel in the city had an updated I-9 or actually had an I-9

324
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:08,215
in the I-9 jacket.

325
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:17,180
So we've implemented partnerships with JJ Keller, who is the safety training for our DPW employees.

326
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,803
We have been hearing that employees like the training, they want the training, they want some professional development.

327
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:29,587
So in last year's budget, the council had approved us updating that training, so that has been very helpful moving forward.

328
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:35,270
We also partnered with Trolliant and they are doing our state and federal compliance training.

329
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,712
It's very helpful because it's online and they can start and stop.

330
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:48,558
So if police and fire are starting a training and they need to stop to go on a call or what have you, they can stop the training and pick up from where they left off and still get full credit when they complete.

331
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:55,322
There's a back portion to that where I get notification when somebody hasn't completed their training.

332
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:59,105
So we'll send out a notification saying, you started the training on May 1st.

333
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:02,066
It's May 15 you still haven't finished.

334
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:06,027
What else you need we give them time, you know time restraints for that.

335
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:11,950
So that's very helpful so that we know that everybody's completed the required trainings that they're they're supposed to be doing throughout the year.

336
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,172
So goals for the HR department.

337
00:54:16,572 --> 00:54:19,693
We want to develop a comprehensive employee handbook.

338
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,354
We do have a handbook.

339
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:24,436
I think it's outdated, and it's not complete.

340
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:25,617
So we're working on that.

341
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:46,250
We're working on a newsletter that will come out every month, spotlighting various projects throughout the city, employees, 20 year employees, 10 year employees, giving them some information about the benefits that we offer, how they can link to different things like FMLA forms and workers comp forms and whatever they might need, and some

342
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:49,344
educational training that we have linked to that.

343
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:53,707
So if somebody really likes the training in the library, they can just do it at their own time.

344
00:54:54,107 --> 00:54:57,709
If they want to, it's more voluntary than something that we're going to require them to do.

345
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:05,315
And some trivia and some fun facts as we go along so that the first newsletter, I think, is set for June or July.

346
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:07,957
Excuse me.

347
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:12,260
We are also working on implementing, hopefully,

348
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:22,131
Some kind of HR system that we can use that is more online to apply for a job instead of being so paper heavy.

349
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:24,055
So we're looking into that as well.

350
00:55:25,748 --> 00:55:29,149
more training for our department heads and our middle management.

351
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:45,813
We are partnering with Adam Sutton Consulting, and they do half-day retreats with department heads, and they do, you know, education, and we find out where our weaknesses are, and then we kind of tie it together so that we can funnel that down through our employees.

352
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:53,552
working closely now that we have our new solicitor, that our departments will work very closely together.

353
00:55:53,932 --> 00:56:08,327
So those are just some of the ongoing projects we're trying to also make sure that when we ratify a CBA or a collective bargaining agreement that we get one agreement instead of having like four or five MOAs or side letters that everything's

354
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:18,550
complete one place so that's pretty much where we're trying to go this year seems it's a lot of work it's not a lot of tasks, but it's a lot of work to each task.

355
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:26,254
If I can get to the increases in the budget, excuse me, like you said, President Baird, most of it is personnel.

356
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:36,643
We went from a full part-time to a full-time HR administrator, and some of those funds were upper funds last year, so we have to absorb the full cost of that position this year.

357
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:41,687
Also, just market increases with advertising, supplies,

358
00:56:42,748 --> 00:56:43,769
where we post.

359
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:51,137
So it's really just market increases, not much more increases to the budget, the HR budget.

360
00:56:51,557 --> 00:56:55,221
Unfortunately, on the workers comp side, I'll probably talk about them together.

361
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:00,546
That's a little bit harder to budget, right?

362
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:02,408
Because we never know who's going to get hurt.

363
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:06,633
The problem with that is we also pay for the medicals.

364
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:08,755
There's no way to really budget it.

365
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:12,878
So we kind of do like a three-year back look to see what it looked like.

366
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:17,502
When I got here, it was under-budgeted by a lot.

367
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,004
So last year I had to kind of bridge that gap.

368
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:23,006
And then this year I'm trying to finish the bridge of that gap.

369
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:26,289
So that's really Worker's Comp.

370
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:30,012
We pay about, right now we pay $8,335 a week

371
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,736
and workers' comp payouts.

372
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:38,639
So that's about $433,000 a year.

373
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,924
And that's just, you know, we can't really budget for when that will go.

374
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:48,947
We do have a couple of people on there that will be lifers, that will be on there for life.

375
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,950
So that's where the increase of the workers' comp into us as well.

376
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:56,452
Great.

377
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:57,953
Do we have any questions?

378
00:57:58,614 --> 00:57:59,434
Councilor Scarpelli.

379
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,617
Thank you so much for your presentation.

380
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:08,233
I know they just clarify, you know, it's like one of my big sticking points is.

381
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:09,982
ratifying contracts.

382
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:12,423
And I know that it's good to see that we're moving forward.

383
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:14,144
So I appreciate the hard work, but I know that.

384
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:21,526
So it's Medford, patrolmen, supervisors, library, dispatch, and building, correct?

385
00:58:21,586 --> 00:58:23,866
Are those the last ones that we ratified?

386
00:58:23,886 --> 00:58:26,087
Are these the ones that are still open?

387
00:58:26,147 --> 00:58:30,428
Still open is superiors, police, inspectors.

388
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:35,049
Dispatch is just up for renewal and libraries for renewal.

389
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:36,310
So we're working on those as well.

390
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:36,970
Are we getting close?

391
00:58:37,672 --> 00:58:38,612
dispatching library.

392
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:39,052
I hope so.

393
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:39,613
Okay.

394
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:41,493
Other ones still have some time.

395
00:58:41,513 --> 00:58:42,433
We're still working on that.

396
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:44,894
Okay, so I know some of them are in fact finding right now.

397
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:59,978
So I know that, you know, I work in a municipality next door, and I just saw what What neighbor community just offered their police department and with four year retro, and it's a lot of money.

398
00:59:00,398 --> 00:59:00,678
So I

399
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:05,698
be interesting to see how we can fund that.

400
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:08,681
We're trying to be as fair as we can.

401
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:10,563
Not easy.

402
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:11,504
No, it's not.

403
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:27,299
I think the other issue and concern that I've had for a long time is, and it might not fall with your department, but it'd be interesting to know, as we've had so many concerned issues with legal issues with

404
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:35,984
grievances through our employees, not particularly anyone in personnel to keep it confidential.

405
00:59:38,105 --> 00:59:45,449
Is there a line here that does it come out of your department for arbitration costs, for attorney's fees?

406
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,611
I believe that comes out of the legal budget.

407
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:54,914
I mean, I'm the one who handles them, but the results come out of the legal budget.

408
01:00:00,922 --> 01:00:02,423
seems pretty substantial.

409
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:10,447
So from what I've gotten for legal documents from union representation, and it's a lot of money.

410
01:00:10,927 --> 01:00:12,188
It's a lot of work.

411
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:28,937
And it's a I would hope we could find a way to tighten up these legalities in these, these battles that go back and forth with, I think losing and then appealing and then so it's something that

412
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:39,006
you know, when we look at good money leaving the city, I think that a lot of it has to do with fair labor practice and making sure that we're doing the right thing with our employees.

413
01:00:39,046 --> 01:00:43,909
So I appreciate your input, and I think that's important.

414
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:56,856
It's something that I'll keep asking as we move forward, because I think that if we look at many of the lines, and if we look to the actuals and month to month, and we see where monies are going, there's a lot of

415
01:00:58,537 --> 01:00:59,847
legal departments that are getting.

416
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,734
chunks of chunks of money throughout the community.

417
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:22,423
And even though we did get a $7.5 million increase in an override and still have money in free cash, and even though that's supposedly not a lot of money, I guess we're still in fiscal constraints and supposedly in some dire funding needs.

418
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:29,927
So be interesting to see where we can, as we move forward, where we can recover and what we can do better to make sure we're not using

419
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,441
funds that don't need to be spent.

420
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:37,522
I think building those relationships, we're starting to build relationships.

421
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:38,583
I appreciate it.

422
01:01:39,003 --> 01:01:41,784
And I'm hoping that the solicitor's office will be able to make those even stronger.

423
01:01:41,884 --> 01:01:42,304
I hope so.

424
01:01:42,884 --> 01:01:43,244
Thank you.

425
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:43,785
Thank you.

426
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:45,705
Thank you.

427
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:46,866
Any other questions?

428
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:52,207
Seeing none, I have a couple.

429
01:01:52,227 --> 01:01:56,569
Give me a second here, get some feedback.

430
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:05,114
Could you talk a little bit more about the case management line item?

431
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:05,414
Sure.

432
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:17,883
So the case management is, so when we're working with our workers' comp, sometimes we need investigations or nurses to work on the cases because the employees aren't being very responsive with their physicians.

433
01:02:18,604 --> 01:02:25,408
And instead of us just saying, okay, we'll wait for you to get your doctor's note, and they stay on long, we can hire a case manager who can actually

434
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:37,277
not violate any HIPAA laws and actually go out and talk with the doctors to try to get their information so we can make sure that the employee is up on compensation is really doing what he's supposed to do to try to get back to work.

435
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,058
Great.

436
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:48,104
Along those lines, do we expect a much smaller increase for workers' comp next year, or how much of the gap have we closed?

437
01:02:48,604 --> 01:02:52,227
So I don't see workers' comp going

438
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:53,950
down.

439
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,751
I'm hoping we can kind of level it off.

440
01:02:56,151 --> 01:03:00,933
The school department has their own, so I'm not sure how their claims are going.

441
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:08,457
But we seem to kind of find some kind of place right now where we don't see it moving too far.

442
01:03:09,758 --> 01:03:13,279
Somebody could get hurt tomorrow, and it could be catastrophic.

443
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,960
So it's really hard to judge.

444
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,301
Is there any way, I mean, this is supposed to be a form of insurance, right?

445
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:28,682
Like, seems like we're paying a lot of money.

446
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:39,404
So if you're talking about like using their health insurance opposed to using their workers comp?

447
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:44,045
Just in general, like their workers comp, like, you know, is there a better deal out there?

448
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:45,266
Are we getting the best deal?

449
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:46,046
So I mean,

450
01:03:47,729 --> 01:03:55,677
I think every time that you look at that and you go out and you try to bid, sometimes you can get more rates, but they're pretty standard across the board.

451
01:03:56,057 --> 01:04:06,187
We just went from Metatrol who stopped working on the 111F to Future Comp, so that actually helped us save money because they were already working on our workers' comp side.

452
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:10,271
So to bring in the 111F, there wasn't a lot of more

453
01:04:11,192 --> 01:04:14,675
additives that they have, because they're already charging us to run the program.

454
01:04:14,695 --> 01:04:18,038
So we actually saved a little money doing that and switch.

455
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:20,860
What's the difference between 111F and the workers comps?

456
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:22,522
So 111F will be police and fire.

457
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:24,524
It's just chapter 111F.

458
01:04:24,704 --> 01:04:25,364
Oh, OK.

459
01:04:25,384 --> 01:04:25,625
Got it.

460
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:25,845
Got it.

461
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:26,105
Got it.

462
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:26,806
OK.

463
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:27,766
Workers comp on the city.

464
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:29,688
So now it's everyone in the city is on the same.

465
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:30,329
Correct.

466
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,210
All right.

467
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:33,311
OK.

468
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:34,973
Two more things, just in general.

469
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:41,348
seems like we've been able to fill more open positions than over the previous years.

470
01:04:41,368 --> 01:04:42,648
I don't know if you want to talk about that.

471
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:43,488
Yeah, sure.

472
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:49,470
So, I mean, with the help of now another full-time staff member, that's really been helpful.

473
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,150
I think I had the numbers here somewhere.

474
01:04:52,230 --> 01:05:02,252
We've brought on about 32 professional staff, including department heads, and maybe about 20 to 30 new police officers and firefighters.

475
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:09,415
And we're just putting 13, 12 now, possibly 13 firefighters into the academy over the summer.

476
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:14,538
So we'll be increasing those numbers by 13, and we have a few coming out of the police academy.

477
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:20,020
So because of the extra staff, we're able to turn that over much quicker.

478
01:05:20,461 --> 01:05:21,101
Okay.

479
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:23,082
Great.

480
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:27,384
Last question, classification and compensation study.

481
01:05:27,644 --> 01:05:28,845
What's the progress on that?

482
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,286
And when are we going to be able to implement it?

483
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:45,224
So the project actually started, I think, before I started, and it started out as the city trying to find out if they had any outliers of somebody who's really underpaid or within the comparable cities.

484
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:51,130
Preliminary numbers that proposed that have come in as methods kind of right in the middle.

485
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,913
We're not on the upper high, we're not on the low, we're kind of in the middle.

486
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:54,093
So

487
01:05:54,727 --> 01:06:01,670
which was really good for us, that we found that we don't have a lot of people that are underpaid, even though we have people complaining that they're underpaid.

488
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:04,992
The study shows that we're pretty much in the middle.

489
01:06:05,072 --> 01:06:16,277
So with that information, now we have to really solidify the job descriptions because you can't look at a compensation study after that until you know what the job descriptions are.

490
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,938
And some of us are from the 80s.

491
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:20,059
So we're bringing those up to date.

492
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:22,820
We've done the employee questionnaire

493
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:31,751
So right now, the employees have reviewed their job descriptions, the department heads have reviewed what the employees say they do, opposed to what they are actually supposed to do.

494
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:37,555
We did an administrator review, myself and Nina reviewed all of them as well.

495
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:42,257
They went out to the comp and class, which is call-in center, and they drafted.

496
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:47,680
Now we have final drafts for us to do a final review on for the job descriptions.

497
01:06:48,568 --> 01:06:51,809
Once we get that finalized, we're hoping to have that done by September.

498
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:52,970
It's a lot of work.

499
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:56,971
There's like we did 125 titles, I believe.

500
01:06:57,732 --> 01:07:04,274
We have to send them out to the unions, because now the union employee or union position, I should say, not employee.

501
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:09,436
The unions now have to look at it, give their comments, see if they agree with it.

502
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,157
Then we get that back.

503
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,058
We look at them, see if we agree with what the union said, send it back to the Collins Center.

504
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,582
They have to revamp it and send it back to us for a final review.

505
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:23,565
So hopefully in September, we'll have some more information on where we are.

506
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,007
It's a long process.

507
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:32,474
I understand it's been a long process, but I think it started, then it stopped for a little while because there was nobody in the office to run it.

508
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,417
And then when I came in just about two years ago,

509
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:39,175
That was my second initiative to get it started.

510
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:46,196
And so although it seems like it's been going for a very long time, it was a big chunk of time where nothing was happening because there was nobody to manage it.

511
01:07:47,736 --> 01:07:48,296
Got it.

512
01:07:48,336 --> 01:07:48,937
Thank you for that.

513
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:56,438
In a final report, will we be able to see both the compensation elements as well as the new job descriptions?

514
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:58,038
And that will be available to us.

515
01:07:58,839 --> 01:07:59,739
Great.

516
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,160
And it sounds like if we're really lucky, January?

517
01:08:06,172 --> 01:08:06,552
Sure.

518
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:14,239
If you put me before Frances next year, because her presentations are amazing, and I'm tired of following them.

519
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,102
Everyone's jockeying for position in these.

520
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:18,483
I've already disappointed Barbara.

521
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:24,488
So, you know, I don't even want to know what happened with Richly.

522
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:26,650
But no, thank you.

523
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,152
You know, I appreciate the hard work.

524
01:08:28,752 --> 01:08:31,895
Any further questions on our HR or worker's comments?

525
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,451
Seeing none, thank you very much.

526
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:37,391
Thank you, have a good evening.

527
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:40,312
All right, library.

528
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:50,975
We have director Barbara Kerr and we have Grace David from our trustees here and maybe lost a trustee.

529
01:08:51,936 --> 01:08:52,716
Sorry about that.

530
01:08:52,736 --> 01:08:54,937
Bonnie had to go to the band concert at school.

531
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,997
We gained one, we lost one.

532
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:02,599
John Grace Caldara who are two of my five.

533
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:04,164
Great.

534
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:05,245
I'm turning you down.

535
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:07,286
We had a way up for Lisa.

536
01:09:07,486 --> 01:09:08,746
Okay, so you'll be good.

537
01:09:08,806 --> 01:09:09,887
It's a new system.

538
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:10,827
That's great.

539
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:13,529
I have stats.

540
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:19,792
Well, first I need to read.

541
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:21,372
We want to hear the stats.

542
01:09:21,412 --> 01:09:22,273
We love the stats.

543
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:25,835
All right, I have what I have here.

544
01:09:26,115 --> 01:09:26,555
Alrighty.

545
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:29,474
Library, Medford Public Library.

546
01:09:29,494 --> 01:09:33,636
We had from the general fund, subsidy general fund, fiscal 25, $2,247,934.

547
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:35,936
We're looking at for fiscal 26, $2,324,029 for an increase of $76,095 or about 3%.

548
01:09:36,016 --> 01:09:36,417
And we have there,

549
01:09:51,608 --> 01:10:03,776
an increase of one position, it looks like, which is good, although I'm sure you'll tell me maybe that that's not coming from the general fund at all, or maybe it's a typo, I see.

550
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,938
What position is it?

551
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:10,841
It's a professional assistant, it says, that we're going from 14 to 15.

552
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,764
Seems no one knows about that except for what's on the sheet.

553
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,456
But we can come back to that.

554
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:24,938
But as I said, there's a net increase of 76,095.

555
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:47,690
Most of this is in our fixed cost growth, the vast majority, with step raises and COLA increases for permanent employees, an increase in rates for part-time employees, longevity and a sick leave buyback estimate for fiscal 26 retirements, contracted services increase for some stormable landscaping and other service costs.

556
01:10:48,590 --> 01:11:03,666
increase in the price of office supplies, increase in the price of cleaning supplies, an increase for the audiovisual budget, physical media being in high demand, and AV costs being cut last year or reduced from the initial proposal last year, $5,000 increase,

557
01:11:05,988 --> 01:11:18,397
for library books and periodicals, and then there's one new expense, continuing education, the PLA convention in 2026, the big national conference for public libraries, multiple staff are attending, so there's more expense.

558
01:11:19,377 --> 01:11:24,201
So with that, we have Director Kerr with us, and we're going to be

559
01:11:25,607 --> 01:11:38,436
The prompt is just three things, talking about your budget and what the change was, two, talking about accomplishments for the last year, goals for next year, and three, what are key needs and priorities that you'd like to see funded that we weren't able to fund this year?

560
01:11:38,696 --> 01:11:41,598
So Nina and I are still working on a couple of personnel things.

561
01:11:42,118 --> 01:11:42,639
Okay.

562
01:11:42,859 --> 01:11:47,842
There was a children's department position that's been vacant for a couple of years, so we're trying to make that work.

563
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:57,671
We would also very much like to get the hourly part time rates to the equivalent of the same full time jobs.

564
01:11:58,151 --> 01:11:59,312
That's not going to happen this year.

565
01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:06,716
I think they're going to get a small increase, but that's sort of my long term collaborative maybe we could all work on it because

566
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,842
Right now, we have somebody who she works for us for $19 an hour.

567
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:13,883
And when she substitutes at Winchester, she gets 35.

568
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,504
And that's pretty much the way it is across the board.

569
01:12:17,644 --> 01:12:20,445
Our part-time salary rates are very low.

570
01:12:20,946 --> 01:12:22,166
And we're a revolving door.

571
01:12:22,206 --> 01:12:23,627
We've been through so many people.

572
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:27,629
It's like, why would you stay here if you go to Winchester?

573
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:28,989
Because it's more fun here.

574
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:35,092
But I think they're, in order to work for us full-time, part-time,

575
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:41,538
you have three part-time jobs, or you have somebody at home who's paying the bills.

576
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,541
And so we don't keep people forever.

577
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:46,822
So that's something we would very much like to work on.

578
01:12:48,283 --> 01:12:51,065
To get that to happen would be a very substantial increase.

579
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:54,448
I think this year is going to be a smaller one, which we're working on.

580
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:55,669
So hopefully that will work.

581
01:12:55,749 --> 01:12:57,830
And I think we're also working on the children's position.

582
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,232
So that's good.

583
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:05,136
But the other stuff, pretty much everything we asked for in our expenses we got, which was terrific.

584
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:09,255
And you want the stats now?

585
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,096
Here's the stats.

586
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:10,296
Let's go.

587
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:11,077
Yeah, how do we do it?

588
01:13:11,377 --> 01:13:12,718
So we are crazy busy.

589
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:16,562
And there are 370 libraries in Massachusetts.

590
01:13:16,762 --> 01:13:22,248
And we were 18th in terms of circulation, 13th in total programs.

591
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:28,113
8th in teen programs, although they tell me they're actually 7th because Bellingham cheated.

592
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:34,259
And then they were counting attendance at a drop-in afternoon, which is just wrong.

593
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:41,545
And then 9th in children's programming for ages 0 to 5, and 23rd for programming for ages 6 to 11.

594
01:13:42,446 --> 01:13:46,590
And we had 860 programs last year with an attendance of 16,000.

595
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,390
So we are very busy.

596
01:13:50,977 --> 01:13:52,358
And it's been a very good year.

597
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:57,802
We got a Cummings grant that is actually funding two people for the Makerspace.

598
01:13:58,002 --> 01:14:00,764
So the Makerspace programming has tripled since they started.

599
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:07,449
They're a bit compulsive, so it should really only be doubled, but they want to do everything now.

600
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:12,073
And we're also able to do a part-time programming librarian from that grant.

601
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:21,070
And that's been very good too, because with all those programs you need somebody to expedite to manage things and do the scheduling and the publicity.

602
01:14:22,812 --> 01:14:28,040
And this year we also started 55 plus programming, we have a senior advisory board who

603
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:31,774
They heckle each other a lot.

604
01:14:31,854 --> 01:14:38,336
They have monthly meetings, but they come up with program ideas and then we work the staff works with them to fit in great here.

605
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:43,177
Now that I am a senior, I appreciate the heckling.

606
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:47,859
And I was going to mention that I'm planning to retire next April.

607
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:50,800
This might actually be my last budget hearing.

608
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,741
We've got to lead with that.

609
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:53,982
It's time.

610
01:14:54,002 --> 01:14:57,744
Well, I was going to but I got so excited.

611
01:14:57,764 --> 01:15:00,586
Too excited about all the great things you're doing.

612
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:03,187
We had 202,000 people come into the building last year.

613
01:15:03,387 --> 01:15:03,507
Wow.

614
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,781
The fairytale ball is coming up in a couple of weeks, and that's usually 700 people, most of them under the age of 10.

615
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:14,121
I got strep two years ago.

616
01:15:14,282 --> 01:15:15,022
I'm hoping not.

617
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:24,264
I'm planning not to this year, but I said I wouldn't go last year because I didn't want to get sick, so I will be braver this year.

618
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:25,205
What are other things?

619
01:15:25,225 --> 01:15:25,345
55 plus.

620
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:46,688
Youth services is trying to do a lot more outreach, so we've added some part time people so they are doing a couple of them go once a month to after school programs and Nicole who is the head of youth services has a deal with the librarian at the high school which is great she goes and she presents to every single class at the high school.

621
01:15:47,408 --> 01:15:48,688
And they like us.

622
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:53,429
She had teen trivia night Friday, and apparently all the sixth grader boys came.

623
01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:57,290
And it was very loud, and they all sang along to things.

624
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:00,051
But it's good that they want to be there.

625
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:05,752
And now that there are fewer early release days, everybody's much calmer, because that was interesting.

626
01:16:05,932 --> 01:16:06,992
So that's good.

627
01:16:08,872 --> 01:16:13,113
With that, I took out my dinner.

628
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:16,334
Oh, so we also got a Bloomberg digital, what is it?

629
01:16:17,013 --> 01:16:19,874
digital innovation grant for $200,000.

630
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:33,337
With that, we're going to be digitizing a large portion of the local history collection, which is terrific, because right now, in order to do research, you have to go in there and handle everything.

631
01:16:33,397 --> 01:16:34,037
So this is good.

632
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,398
I heard you took my microfilm.

633
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,379
I'm sorry, your microfilm is actually in boxes in the back hallway, but it's going out today.

634
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,239
And then you'll be able to do it from home in a few months.

635
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:43,800
No, it'll be great.

636
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,220
You remember, yeah.

637
01:16:45,498 --> 01:16:51,500
So they're taking the microfilm, the yearbooks, a lot of the town reports, the lists of persons.

638
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:52,961
The budgets, please.

639
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:53,761
The budgets.

640
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:55,302
Yeah, I think the budgets are in there.

641
01:16:55,322 --> 01:16:59,664
The budgets and some of the real older, delicate stuff that is unique.

642
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:01,444
So that's great.

643
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:02,585
Will the maps go too?

644
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:08,347
Not this time, but we're going to keep digitizing stuff.

645
01:17:09,646 --> 01:17:11,288
A lot of the maps are online anyway.

646
01:17:11,588 --> 01:17:12,889
They're in various places.

647
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:14,290
But check our website.

648
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,371
There's a map section.

649
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:17,473
So that's been good.

650
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:20,436
And so the stuff has got off to be scanned.

651
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:32,346
And in the meantime, they're going to build a, they call it, it's called the DAM, which is a digital asset management platform, which is good when you're getting aggravated.

652
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:34,388
You can swear at trustee meetings.

653
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:37,164
What else?

654
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:42,929
ESOL, we started having, we did citizenship classes and we funded an ESOL class last year.

655
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,450
We did that again this year.

656
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:51,195
We're also hosting two or three, like a city class, English at Large and the Welcome Project.

657
01:17:52,196 --> 01:17:54,578
And we've added a lot of the foundation

658
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:58,470
has given us some funding for foreign language books.

659
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:02,113
And the teens, they've added a lot of books in other languages in teen.

660
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:06,877
So I was there one day when the eighth graders were there, and the teacher saying, you have to take a book.

661
01:18:07,378 --> 01:18:10,621
And one of the kids took it, and the librarian checked it on.

662
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:12,122
She said, you know, this isn't Portuguese.

663
01:18:12,142 --> 01:18:14,384
And he's like, whatever, went out the door.

664
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:15,025
So that's good.

665
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:19,213
55 plus.

666
01:18:19,253 --> 01:18:20,553
We also got a coming to rent.

667
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:21,234
Did I say that?

668
01:18:21,254 --> 01:18:23,435
Yes, coming to rent with the Makerspace.

669
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:27,037
So the Makerspace programming, it's great.

670
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:31,080
And we are getting really good attendance at everything.

671
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:34,162
I think that's pretty much.

672
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:39,105
So next year, we're going to continue with all of this stuff.

673
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:43,648
But the long term is the hourly part-time rate, if we can get that to.

674
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:52,416
to a level equivalent with other libraries, I think we'd have more luck getting qualified people and maintaining them.

675
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:54,280
Great.

676
01:18:56,802 --> 01:18:58,823
And I see everyone, you're all here on my board.

677
01:19:01,263 --> 01:19:14,688
I just wanted to say before we hear questions from councillors that it may be your last budget meeting, but we will have you back before you retire to celebrate the incredible work that you've done.

678
01:19:15,508 --> 01:19:16,688
I'll bring more statistics.

679
01:19:17,089 --> 01:19:17,409
Great.

680
01:19:18,669 --> 01:19:19,389
I'd love to hear.

681
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:26,871
bring the young ones on the staff and get them to act them out or something.

682
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:48,735
I was thinking you could do a story for for every year of the decades of service that you devoted to the city and our community or something you know maybe not every year but that might be too too in depth too much work we know everyone's very busy up there but mostly I was saying that to say that you've devoted your life to this library and it's thriving and

683
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,894
Thousands of people are deeply appreciative of that.

684
01:19:53,094 --> 01:19:53,675
So we will.

685
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:55,456
I never thought we would be this good.

686
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:59,738
I knew we had the potential, but it's really rewarding.

687
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:02,700
Thank you to you and your team.

688
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:06,622
And I have no hobbies.

689
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,044
You've given a lot to the city, so we will celebrate you.

690
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:12,986
You'll be back here, and you won't have to do a presentation for money.

691
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:14,387
Unless I want to.

692
01:20:14,587 --> 01:20:15,528
Unless you want to.

693
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:19,110
You can write your own ticket.

694
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:25,116
So with that, I'll go to Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Kellyanne, Councilor Spadafore, Councilor Lazaro.

695
01:20:26,437 --> 01:20:27,298
Thank you for being here.

696
01:20:27,318 --> 01:20:27,919
I did have

697
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,723
an opportunity to join one of the trustees meetings.

698
01:20:33,123 --> 01:20:39,829
And you did mention the request for an increase in the hourly pay.

699
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,152
And I'm frustrated because it's not that much.

700
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:46,075
It doesn't cost that much compared with the rest of the city's budget.

701
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:53,101
I know this is a hard time for all of us, but I am hopeful in the future that this can be something that we remedy.

702
01:20:54,798 --> 01:21:10,332
It's very basic and it does have lasting impacts because when people move on quickly, it costs a lot to train new people and that impact can be felt.

703
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:17,278
We might as well keep the people that we have, that we know are good, that you've invested in and you've trained.

704
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:20,601
The library is such a gem in town.

705
01:21:22,604 --> 01:21:23,505
I am a big fan.

706
01:21:23,705 --> 01:21:24,526
I use it a lot.

707
01:21:24,926 --> 01:21:35,054
And I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for still having the diary of a wimpy kid book number question mark in my home.

708
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:37,676
I think one of my kids has it in their backpack.

709
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:40,015
I'm going fine free July 1st.

710
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:40,935
See, that's great.

711
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:42,276
That's great for me.

712
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:43,116
That's great for my kids.

713
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:46,597
Pay up.

714
01:21:47,217 --> 01:21:49,478
But I do think this is something that we should be able to accomplish.

715
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:51,699
It's not a big lift.

716
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:53,860
So thank you for advocating for that.

717
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,161
And I think we can continue to put it in our requests as a council.

718
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:03,263
I mean, we've put in our requests as a council, fully fund the library and all of their requests consistently.

719
01:22:04,444 --> 01:22:05,344
We'll continue to do that.

720
01:22:05,424 --> 01:22:07,405
But I mean, we can keep beating that drum.

721
01:22:07,996 --> 01:22:09,140
And we will, Bob.

722
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:09,542
Thank you.

723
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:11,328
Thank you.

724
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,776
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

725
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:18,365
I was just hoping, I know you're excited about statistics.

726
01:22:18,385 --> 01:22:18,965
You brought them here.

727
01:22:19,025 --> 01:22:20,366
You want to bring them up next time.

728
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,628
And I'm so excited.

729
01:22:21,668 --> 01:22:27,893
I'm hoping that you can maybe just email the clerk, and then he can forward some of those to us.

730
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:29,094
Just the ones you mentioned today.

731
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,195
Don't go to any extra trouble.

732
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:32,758
I can send you a comprehensive thing.

733
01:22:32,798 --> 01:22:34,800
We do a state report that has everything.

734
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,541
So I can send that out.

735
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:39,464
I especially like the rankings and the program it provides.

736
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:44,468
the part-time pay as compared to Winchester and if you have anybody else to compare to.

737
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:51,615
And I really would like you to include the fact that people work for us because we are more fun than other cities.

738
01:22:51,635 --> 01:22:52,776
This is my theory.

739
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:55,058
Thank you.

740
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,741
Thank you Councillor Callahan.

741
01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:00,743
Councillor Scarpelli and then Councillor Hussain.

742
01:23:01,783 --> 01:23:03,064
Thank you, Council President.

743
01:23:03,705 --> 01:23:04,185
Barbara.

744
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:09,910
I was gonna say if you have another year maybe you can work on your Sunday disposition.

745
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:10,751
It's just terrible.

746
01:23:12,672 --> 01:23:13,353
So angry.

747
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:16,335
Seriously, don't you just want to get up and hug you I just I

748
01:23:18,137 --> 01:23:19,197
I so appreciate you.

749
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:25,320
I think that, like Councilor Zaro said, have a book from 1982, The Outsiders.

750
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:27,302
Good choice.

751
01:23:27,342 --> 01:23:29,143
We're expecting to get back a lot closer.

752
01:23:29,163 --> 01:23:32,404
We can fund the part-time employees with this.

753
01:23:34,085 --> 01:23:37,027
There is a maximum fine, which nobody knows about, so.

754
01:23:37,607 --> 01:23:39,288
I have a few, just one question.

755
01:23:39,308 --> 01:23:44,911
I know that one of the biggest things we always, we were nervous about as we built this new library and how we're going to maintain it.

756
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:46,272
And it sounds like,

757
01:23:46,705 --> 01:23:49,607
you're doing an amazing job, and the team's doing an amazing job.

758
01:23:49,727 --> 01:23:57,633
Do you see anything that, especially, I appreciate Mr. Riggi now, and him being active and involved.

759
01:23:57,653 --> 01:24:05,899
Do we see that that's being up at the library, the plant itself is being kept to its standards?

760
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,282
Yes, it helps having a young custodian who's tall.

761
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:14,766
When we moved in, we had Fred, who was a lovely man,

762
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:17,618
had a lot of health issues.

763
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,302
And Peter's Peter's a bundle of energy.

764
01:24:20,342 --> 01:24:23,806
So he paints and he cleans and he keeps track of stuff.

765
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:27,691
And he fights with different vendors.

766
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:29,212
And it's good, actually.

767
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:34,919
And then part of the deal with Bloomberg was the creation of a maintenance plan.

768
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:35,200
So

769
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:37,933
That was very complicated.

770
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,235
The guy who works for the foundation is doing it.

771
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:41,196
So we do have that.

772
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:45,459
And that's very helpful, because it's got a lot of information and recommendations.

773
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,161
And I think the building's in good shape.

774
01:24:48,562 --> 01:24:51,704
And solar, that's still up there?

775
01:24:51,965 --> 01:24:53,906
We are genuinely net zero.

776
01:24:54,186 --> 01:24:54,507
Excellent.

777
01:24:54,647 --> 01:24:55,608
That's a great sign.

778
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:56,588
We're one of only nine.

779
01:24:56,608 --> 01:25:01,252
We were actually featured in American Libraries this year in that they had an energy issue.

780
01:25:01,272 --> 01:25:01,853
Solar's amazing.

781
01:25:03,114 --> 01:25:04,655
So on a serious note, though,

782
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:15,485
On a more serious note, we often sit up here at city councils and thank people that have left us and we can't celebrate them while they're here.

783
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:28,851
I would hope that this council would work with the mayor and administration that the day you leave your position, you know, you're not leaving our Method Public Library, that we have something named after you.

784
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:47,437
I would hope through as we move forward and that there is something that the name Barbara Kerr is never forgotten when people look up and say hey who's Barbara Kerr, because I remember the real thin times and you kept things going when things are really bad.

785
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:54,874
You hear horror stories now and, you know, we stick our chests out when you hear what's going on in Stoneham and you feel so bad.

786
01:25:55,415 --> 01:25:59,099
But even through the toughest times, you've always kept us above ground.

787
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:03,964
So I think we can never forget that because no matter what, I mean, my kids,

788
01:26:04,843 --> 01:26:13,667
if it wasn't for the method public library, and they're 22 and 19 now, and they spent every single week in the library from their most precious years.

789
01:26:14,228 --> 01:26:20,471
And personally, as a father, I can't thank you enough and for fathers and mothers all over the city than what you've done for them.

790
01:26:20,531 --> 01:26:22,732
So I can't thank you enough.

791
01:26:22,812 --> 01:26:24,693
And, and I will hope that

792
01:26:25,148 --> 01:26:36,665
my colleagues join me when it's time and that we do find something that speaks to what you've done for us here in Medford and the Medford Public Library.

793
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:37,927
So thank you for everything.

794
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,320
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

795
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:44,842
Charlton William Bloomberg, Barbara Kerr, Metro Public Library.

796
01:26:45,442 --> 01:26:46,062
There you go.

797
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:48,403
You know, get a really big stuffed animal.

798
01:26:48,423 --> 01:26:50,744
I would ask you to put Barbara Kerr first.

799
01:26:50,824 --> 01:26:51,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:52,165
Exactly.

801
01:26:52,185 --> 01:26:52,505
That's me.

802
01:26:52,585 --> 01:26:54,546
I mean, you know, money isn't everything, Bob.

803
01:26:55,326 --> 01:26:59,868
Well, maybe it is, but... Councilor Sang.

804
01:26:59,888 --> 01:27:08,132
Director Kerr, I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work and dedication to making our library run and tick every single day.

805
01:27:08,572 --> 01:27:08,772
I know

806
01:27:09,772 --> 01:27:11,733
Lots of parents using the library here.

807
01:27:11,753 --> 01:27:14,434
I'm using it as a young adult here.

808
01:27:15,594 --> 01:27:18,055
And it truly is a gem in Medford Square.

809
01:27:18,635 --> 01:27:24,357
It's something that a lot of out-of-town residents come to me and say, oh, did you guys know about your library?

810
01:27:25,818 --> 01:27:26,738
I'm like, of course I know.

811
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:27,779
I know about the library.

812
01:27:27,799 --> 01:27:32,640
And I think there's a lot to be said.

813
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,302
Because even though we got this brand new library,

814
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,727
I remember how much work you put in to meet with us.

815
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:51,673
I remember meetings with me and Zach in previous years, really making sure that we're not just level funding the library and really trying to improve funding for the library.

816
01:27:52,513 --> 01:27:56,695
And I know as we talked about with hourly wages and stuff like that, there's still ways to go.

817
01:27:57,756 --> 01:28:04,840
But I wanted to thank you for your hard fought advocacy for the library to get into a good position.

818
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:11,542
And for you to know that we will always have your back on the side of the rail as well.

819
01:28:12,743 --> 01:28:17,644
And be it planning for the future with increasing pay.

820
01:28:19,405 --> 01:28:31,649
I know a lot of residents are clamoring about trying to get extra service on Sundays, which I know you've talked to us about, which you can feel free to address people watching at home if you want to about that point.

821
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,686
We've traditionally had a tight budget.

822
01:28:39,066 --> 01:28:41,708
We still have, you know, some of that tightness this year.

823
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:48,593
But, you know, I think a lot of the work has to be done planning long term into the future.

824
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:51,855
And I think you're helping a lot with setting that groundwork.

825
01:28:52,236 --> 01:28:52,556
Thank you.

826
01:28:53,136 --> 01:28:57,680
And I should mention, I have a really good staff, not that I haven't always, I haven't always, but

827
01:28:58,227 --> 01:29:20,918
Right now, they're a good bunch, who are probably not watching this, so don't tell them I said that, but they're really very invested in doing a good job, and they love the teens, which, you know, somebody has to, which is what she says to me sometimes.

828
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:29,641
That got recorded and now it's going down in history.

829
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:31,942
Not just recorded, it's broadcast.

830
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:34,902
It's really... I like teens.

831
01:29:35,222 --> 01:29:45,385
I didn't read it, but we are streaming on channel 22, channel 43, YouTube and medfordtv.org.

832
01:29:46,225 --> 01:29:49,946
And you can join by Zoom if you'd like.

833
01:29:50,146 --> 01:29:53,487
You can even call in and if you'd like to submit written comments, you can email.

834
01:29:54,886 --> 01:30:00,268
a her to be set mentor dash ma.gov and he'll forward them along.

835
01:30:00,288 --> 01:30:11,271
At least it's a funny last meeting.

836
01:30:13,272 --> 01:30:13,712
Thank you.

837
01:30:13,852 --> 01:30:15,313
We love a candid testimony.

838
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:19,213
Thank you for being here.

839
01:30:19,233 --> 01:30:24,036
I always appreciate your budget presentations and the overall update on how the library department is doing.

840
01:30:24,056 --> 01:30:27,299
You know, I don't have a lot of questions on your proposal.

841
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:40,529
It was very comprehensive, mostly just want to, especially if this is the last time you're formally giving a budget presentation to the council, which I'm pretty sure you need a two thirds majority vote of the city council to retire, if I'm not mistaken.

842
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:42,691
So we'll see about that.

843
01:30:43,391 --> 01:30:45,393
But would be remiss, yeah.

844
01:30:46,247 --> 01:30:47,868
Yeah, we're all putting resolutions on the agenda.

845
01:30:48,848 --> 01:30:58,534
But would be remiss not to take the opportunity to thank you for your extremely impactful hard work on behalf of our library.

846
01:30:58,574 --> 01:31:00,595
It really is incredible.

847
01:31:00,615 --> 01:31:03,616
I have been going there a lot lately.

848
01:31:03,696 --> 01:31:06,318
I use the printers quite often for work and other projects.

849
01:31:06,698 --> 01:31:12,541
I always admire seeing how many people, how many types of people are using the library any random time that I go in there.

850
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,782
And that is a testament to

851
01:31:15,723 --> 01:31:23,588
the service that we are able to provide to our community because of the work that you and your team have done over so many years to grow this library into what it is today.

852
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:36,817
And I hope that as we go forward into the future, the administration and future city councils will remain in partnership with the library department so that we can continue that kind of really bold master planning to

853
01:31:38,407 --> 01:31:40,568
see what our next really big strides for the library are.

854
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:44,689
Having it open seven days a week, I think is top of everybody's list.

855
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:52,432
And just to continue letting our public library be a model for other community libraries throughout the region.

856
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:55,954
Always appreciate your advocacy for your staff.

857
01:31:55,994 --> 01:31:56,794
It is a great staff.

858
01:31:56,874 --> 01:31:57,674
It's an incredible staff.

859
01:31:57,734 --> 01:31:59,495
Everybody there is so friendly, so helpful.

860
01:32:00,335 --> 01:32:03,376
I know that really resonates with everybody who is a patron there.

861
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:13,338
And I know that you and your team are always trying to advocate to make sure that our compensation that we enable for library staff is as competitive as could be.

862
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:25,085
I'm not surprised to hear that it seems that a lot of people work at Medford Public Library, because it's a wonderful place to work and I know that we're always trying hard to make sure that they are also

863
01:32:26,706 --> 01:32:34,827
duly compensated competitively for the very, very competitive leader level work that you and everybody else on the team is doing.

864
01:32:34,887 --> 01:32:42,569
So I know that we'll remain in partnership to make sure that that is getting better year over year, as well as overall library services are getting better year over year as well.

865
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:45,369
So just thank you so much.

866
01:32:45,429 --> 01:32:45,889
I really do.

867
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:46,550
It sounds corny.

868
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,590
It sounds like I'm exaggerating.

869
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:50,350
But every time I go in there, I'm like, wow, this is our library.

870
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:51,470
This is awesome.

871
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:52,631
These people are awesome.

872
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:54,291
So thank you.

873
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:56,152
It came out good.

874
01:32:56,912 --> 01:32:59,174
I knew it was going to, but you know.

875
01:33:00,395 --> 01:33:00,935
You did all right.

876
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:01,796
Thank you.

877
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:06,599
Originally, we had a design for the front desk that had a lion that ate you if you had overdues.

878
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:12,503
But the very serious woman from library commissioner said, don't do novelty things.

879
01:33:12,924 --> 01:33:14,505
And she thought we were serious.

880
01:33:14,825 --> 01:33:16,526
It's the best part of it.

881
01:33:18,628 --> 01:33:24,272
Do we have any more questions for Director Kerr?

882
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,062
We've seen them from the Council.

883
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:28,727
Do we have any from members of the public?

884
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:32,398
Or would the trustees like to say that we have a trustee coming up?

885
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:40,084
I've only spoken here versus Zoom once.

886
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:42,664
Hi, Grace Caldera, trustee.

887
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:49,546
Can't thank Barbara enough for everything that she's done with the library, and it's been an honor to work with her.

888
01:33:50,406 --> 01:33:54,687
And then just up here to sort of reiterate some points, which you all also know.

889
01:33:56,728 --> 01:34:02,209
The Head of Children's has been vacant, and it is one of the most trafficked areas.

890
01:34:03,249 --> 01:34:05,230
And so the department is,

891
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:12,486
busy all the time and you see nannies and you see families using it.

892
01:34:12,506 --> 01:34:21,071
And it really does require someone who's dedicated to watch over it and to continue to plan programs.

893
01:34:21,492 --> 01:34:24,474
I know we're already ranked ninth in children's.

894
01:34:24,594 --> 01:34:25,154
It'd be really awesome.

895
01:34:25,194 --> 01:34:29,557
to see that go up and what we can do when you have somebody fully dedicated to that department.

896
01:34:30,018 --> 01:34:40,025
I know we're still in talks with the city about that, but wanted to reiterate that one, as well as circling back with the part-time pay.

897
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:43,247
These are librarians.

898
01:34:43,328 --> 01:34:44,869
They have a master's degree.

899
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:50,613
they are doing the same work as the full-time librarians.

900
01:34:51,174 --> 01:35:15,434
And so I know it is in the long-term plan, but definitely something that I think we should continue to work to get there and closer and stay competitive to keep staff here to allow us to hire people quicker and not take so much time going through retraining people over and over again for these positions.

901
01:35:16,898 --> 01:35:19,298
And I also want to flag in all of this.

902
01:35:19,318 --> 01:35:26,200
I know Barbara sort of just mentioned we have two people who are a couple of people who are grant funded right now.

903
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:44,243
And so while they're covered by the grant, it is something to think about what that would take to move them over to the city budget and start planning for that future so that those programs and what they run, especially in the maker space can continue going forward.

904
01:35:46,562 --> 01:35:47,403
Great, thank you, Grace.

905
01:35:47,423 --> 01:35:54,072
All right, seeing no further questions or comments on the library.

906
01:35:54,132 --> 01:35:54,833
Oh, David's coming up.

907
01:35:54,893 --> 01:35:55,153
All right.

908
01:35:58,217 --> 01:35:58,538
Welcome.

909
01:35:59,975 --> 01:36:04,298
Hello, my name is David Cha, 14 Holton Street, and I am the chair of the trustees.

910
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:08,221
First, I want to thank all of your support.

911
01:36:08,682 --> 01:36:15,927
I know that we've been very happy in the past with your support, and we hope that it will continue.

912
01:36:15,947 --> 01:36:24,954
I want to put, you know, when you talk about thousands and tens of thousands and even millions of dollars, it's,

913
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:42,248
Maybe you've got a million dollars in your pocket, but just to give you a better sense, and for the public, when you talk to the public about how much the budget allocation for the library is, 2.32 million.

914
01:36:42,648 --> 01:36:47,851
It's basically about $8 per household per month.

915
01:36:48,951 --> 01:36:51,233
And once you walk into the library,

916
01:36:53,229 --> 01:37:07,499
Everything is free, and I'll just give you a very specific example, it just happens, I'm also on the board of an a cappella choir, and we had a concert there on Sunday, Saturday night, we charge $25 per ticket in another setting.

917
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:18,205
Sunday, it was free, because that's part of the package of going, having a program in the library.

918
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:24,028
And so that was roughly 50 people who were not paying 20 to $25 ticket.

919
01:37:24,468 --> 01:37:31,131
So that's over $1,000 that Medford people did not have to spend to go to that concert.

920
01:37:31,792 --> 01:37:37,414
And that's just one example of, you know, the over 400 programs, all free.

921
01:37:37,955 --> 01:37:38,375
And so

922
01:37:39,499 --> 01:37:47,604
for that $8 per household, not per person, per household, per month, it is one of the great bargains, if not in Medford, then anywhere.

923
01:37:48,264 --> 01:37:54,147
Another issue I want to, Councilor Stark-Pelly was asking about how well we're keeping the place up.

924
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:58,390
And as trustees, that's something that we're very concerned about.

925
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,071
It's great to have a new shiny building.

926
01:38:01,311 --> 01:38:04,033
You cut the ribbon and then things slowly

927
01:38:04,967 --> 01:38:05,607
become worse.

928
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:12,310
As trustees, we're really looking at making sure that it's maintained.

929
01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:19,492
In fact, one of the things we did early on is we went from five to six nights a week of having the people come and do the cleaning.

930
01:38:20,492 --> 01:38:26,374
We're looking right now, it's taken a while, looking at a technology plan.

931
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:28,215
Computers, printers,

932
01:38:28,906 --> 01:38:31,049
technology gets old very quickly.

933
01:38:32,831 --> 01:38:36,335
The library is three plus years old, so the computers are three plus years old.

934
01:38:36,796 --> 01:38:38,678
We don't want everything to fall apart.

935
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,662
So that's something that we're also looking at very seriously.

936
01:38:44,705 --> 01:38:46,346
Again, we appreciate your support.

937
01:38:46,946 --> 01:38:48,607
We hope to get the support.

938
01:38:49,288 --> 01:38:53,130
I won't repeat what Grace has talked about in terms of the salaries.

939
01:38:53,150 --> 01:39:06,517
Other than to say that the turnover, I mean, we just promoted someone to be the program manager who's just energetic and really a good fit.

940
01:39:07,249 --> 01:39:09,470
But even so, she's only part-time.

941
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:14,951
And she's still got to work one, I think maybe even two other jobs to make her living.

942
01:39:15,711 --> 01:39:22,233
And we wouldn't want her to disappear because someone else is going to offer her a full-time job or a much higher paying job.

943
01:39:22,493 --> 01:39:28,714
So those are the consequences of being penny wise and pound foolish.

944
01:39:29,374 --> 01:39:32,555
So I want to thank you for this time.

945
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:35,136
And again, thank you for your ongoing support.

946
01:39:36,116 --> 01:39:36,556
Thank you, David.

947
01:39:39,255 --> 01:39:39,595
All right.

948
01:39:41,136 --> 01:39:47,238
Any more questions or comments from the council, trustees, Director Kerr, or members of the public?

949
01:39:49,418 --> 01:39:53,380
Seeing none, I thank you all very much, and we'll keep fighting.

950
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,602
We'll go now to Planning, Development, and Sustainability slash Boards and Commissions.

951
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:02,563
We have our Director Alicia Hunt with us.

952
01:40:03,839 --> 01:40:10,623
And we have, we'll do PDS first then we can go through the commission budgets.

953
01:40:12,123 --> 01:40:16,165
But we're looking at fiscal 25 budgeted $819,207 fiscal 26 budgeted $917,163 for an increase of $97,956.

954
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:31,784
No change in the number of positions on the services summary.

955
01:40:31,804 --> 01:40:38,728
The main increase is fixed cost growth, which is the staff planner salary coming off of ARPA.

956
01:40:38,748 --> 01:40:42,710
And three other employees shifted in percentages with funding.

957
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:47,473
So they were added to the general fund and the COLA increases and step increases at $77,956.

958
01:40:47,553 --> 01:40:47,933
And then

959
01:40:53,356 --> 01:41:00,801
We have a new expense in professional technical expenses of 20,000 regarding continuation of the zoning work into fiscal 26.

960
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:10,887
And an increase in legal fees since PDS is covering legal fees for the appeals to boards and for support for Medford Square.

961
01:41:11,007 --> 01:41:13,169
And I guess that's Medford Square RFP.

962
01:41:13,549 --> 01:41:13,789
Great.

963
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:14,890
All right.

964
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,931
And with that, I'll go to Director Hunt.

965
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:17,672
We're going to

966
01:41:18,796 --> 01:41:34,422
ask you just if you want to talk about the specific budget change any more than that and the other details, talk about your accomplishments in fiscal 25, your goals for fiscal 26, and then what are some key needs and priorities that aren't funded this year that we would like to see funded in future years.

967
01:41:34,442 --> 01:41:36,923
Okay, Mr. President, thank you.

968
01:41:37,143 --> 01:41:39,564
Just to be clear, I am not as funny as Barbara Carr.

969
01:41:39,704 --> 01:41:41,605
It just is not possible.

970
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:42,685
She is a hard act

971
01:41:43,005 --> 01:41:43,445
follow.

972
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:49,026
Just like she didn't like following Francis, like Barb is a hard one to follow.

973
01:41:49,766 --> 01:41:51,667
So, but I love the library.

974
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:55,407
I can't go into the local history room and not get sucked in.

975
01:41:57,048 --> 01:41:58,588
So to talk about this budget.

976
01:41:59,548 --> 01:42:07,590
I think that it's really useful to just sort of explain a little bit more the whole change the staff shifting stuff.

977
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:20,293
We've made a lot of great hires in recent years in planning, and one of the hires that's notable is Laurel Siegel is managing our CDBG grant.

978
01:42:20,654 --> 01:42:29,116
And part of that is we are benefiting from the fact that Laurel was a practicing lawyer for 29 years before she became our CDBG manager.

979
01:42:29,636 --> 01:42:37,060
So one of the things she's helping us do is fully understand all the laws and regulations, especially in the shifting landscape of HUD.

980
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:44,644
HUD does monitor the grant every three years, and so we can expect future monitors.

981
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:51,367
We've had the most recent one was looking at how we spent our Community Development Block Grant coronavirus funding.

982
01:42:52,307 --> 01:42:53,648
And so it went fairly smoothly.

983
01:42:54,068 --> 01:42:57,150
But with that, one of the things Laurel has flagged is that we

984
01:42:57,650 --> 01:43:16,033
like to have our staff working on a lot of things, including we've had her helping us with additional work, and she has flagged that we should be very cautious about where we are paying staff full time in part time with CDBG funds that we are clearly documenting that everything they are doing

985
01:43:16,413 --> 01:43:17,695
is CDBG related.

986
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:22,380
So one example on this is that we asked to move her salary 10% of it.

987
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:32,932
So just a couple of hours a week to be not CDBG funded, so that over the course of the year, when we asked her to do things like help us with the Gaming Commission grant.

988
01:43:34,113 --> 01:43:35,773
that that is covered.

989
01:43:36,033 --> 01:43:38,634
We have some other source to say that's covering that.

990
01:43:38,974 --> 01:43:54,837
And so it's truly not a like, well, every week she's gonna do two hours that is not CDBG related, but rather over the course of her year, as there are things that are not truly CDBG, we have another source that we're funding that from.

991
01:43:55,677 --> 01:44:00,218
So the other two, we've been funding parts or all of multiple positions.

992
01:44:00,778 --> 01:44:03,059
So when I actually took over planning,

993
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,166
The administrative assistant head clerk was 80% funded by CDBG.

994
01:44:08,567 --> 01:44:18,682
So that's one of the positions that we have been shifting over the years, because she certainly does not spend 80% of her time supporting the low and moderate income work.

995
01:44:19,523 --> 01:44:27,331
The housing planner is 100% CDBG and the economic development planner has been 100% CDBG.

996
01:44:27,811 --> 01:44:35,499
And as you will notice that several of our small business programs are for low and moderate income people and have income limitations.

997
01:44:35,959 --> 01:44:41,203
that is because the funding to support those programs are coming from CDBG.

998
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:54,493
And so as over time, as we say, well, this program was wildly successful, but we'd like it to be accessible to more people, we would need to bring in outside funding that's not CDBG to expand it.

999
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:56,174
That's one of the things we've heard about the pop-up.

1000
01:44:56,534 --> 01:45:00,837
The pop-up is being funded so it's to help lift people out of poverty.

1001
01:45:01,298 --> 01:45:03,039
And so that's low and moderate income

1002
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:10,481
business owners or people who would like to start a business, but they personally are lower moderate income can can do that program.

1003
01:45:10,781 --> 01:45:21,165
So that's something the economic development planners running a hunt clearly that is CDBG, but when we ask her to work with other small businesses where the owners are not low and moderate income.

1004
01:45:21,585 --> 01:45:25,427
that really we should be not spending CDBG money on that.

1005
01:45:25,787 --> 01:45:37,312
So part of this is shifting some of her funding to the general fund, so that as she does her hours over the course of the year, she has a place to put hours that are not CDBG.

1006
01:45:37,592 --> 01:45:44,115
So that is really the bulk of this, and it was the climate planner that was partially funded through ARPA.

1007
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:57,025
We actually have a national grid grant, sorry, Mass Clean Energy Center grant that is paying about half of her salary, and that grant was for three years.

1008
01:45:57,466 --> 01:46:06,874
So we've had ARPA paying the other half of her salary last year, and she's moving to the general fund, because we need the work of the climate planner, she's doing amazing work for us.

1009
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:11,717
And she does all the building energy stuff like all the solar and stuff like that.

1010
01:46:11,797 --> 01:46:15,399
In addition, she's not like literally just climate.

1011
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:21,362
So I think that's sort of like in a big picture way, what we're looking at.

1012
01:46:22,823 --> 01:46:25,064
for this, and then there's some additional funding.

1013
01:46:25,124 --> 01:46:34,408
One of the things I've been saying is when there are appeals to the planning board or to the zoning board, my office pays for the legal defenses of that.

1014
01:46:34,469 --> 01:46:37,030
As we're doing the RFQ, we'll need some legal support.

1015
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:47,855
We will be asking the developer to cover a lot of our fees related to the RFQ, but we did want to make sure we had a little bit of cushion there for covering stuff.

1016
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:53,817
But in general, we do a lot of matching grants and a lot of little overruns.

1017
01:46:54,037 --> 01:47:01,259
I know Amanda was here the other week to talk about Carr Park and having linkage for unexpected costs.

1018
01:47:01,539 --> 01:47:09,402
But at Gillis Park, there was some signs that went on the outside of the park that weren't part of the grants.

1019
01:47:09,662 --> 01:47:12,143
And we said, oh, jeez, we didn't factor those in.

1020
01:47:12,263 --> 01:47:14,363
And so my budget picks up the signs.

1021
01:47:14,403 --> 01:47:16,184
We pick up little things.

1022
01:47:16,724 --> 01:47:19,887
that it's not worth going and asking somebody else for money.

1023
01:47:19,947 --> 01:47:21,889
It's a couple of thousand dollars here or there.

1024
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:24,692
But these projects tend to have that.

1025
01:47:25,533 --> 01:47:28,476
And we've been covering some stuff on the EV chargers as well.

1026
01:47:28,556 --> 01:47:30,838
Now we've moved a lot of that to the revolving fund.

1027
01:47:31,239 --> 01:47:32,760
So that's freeing up some of that money.

1028
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:34,342
So every year we kind of

1029
01:47:34,742 --> 01:47:41,846
find there are different little things that we just sort of cover and take care of in order to keep everything moving smoothly.

1030
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:49,810
The zoning project, we've asked the zoning consultant to do a lot more meetings than we had planned.

1031
01:47:50,230 --> 01:48:00,775
So we're covering like an extra not quite $10,000 from my budget from this plant professional services so that we didn't have to say, oh, wait a minute, we can't afford that.

1032
01:48:01,616 --> 01:48:03,597
We're like, no, no, we need a little bit more outreach.

1033
01:48:04,057 --> 01:48:06,459
We've got money for a little bit more outreach.

1034
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:10,783
So basically that's the, the big picture here.

1035
01:48:11,484 --> 01:48:19,672
And you'll just notice that the full time total the bottom that reflects all the full time staff, all their salaries.

1036
01:48:20,572 --> 01:48:22,753
CPA manager is on here as well.

1037
01:48:23,354 --> 01:48:30,477
And CPA will be a separate budget that is in the city council budget separate from here, but she is part of my office.

1038
01:48:31,878 --> 01:48:33,979
I manage the CPA work.

1039
01:48:34,459 --> 01:48:35,399
I managed her.

1040
01:48:35,959 --> 01:48:40,462
So her line item is showing here, but she's fully funded as well from the CPA.

1041
01:48:41,922 --> 01:48:45,224
So that's why the full-time total is a lot more

1042
01:48:45,724 --> 01:48:59,908
then the general fund is because of the number of staff that we are funding through CWG, CPA, Clean Energy Grant, and actually National Grid has a grant that we're funding a little tiny bit of the economic development planner with this year.

1043
01:49:00,929 --> 01:49:04,130
So I'll let it go there.

1044
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:04,730
That was a lot.

1045
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:06,891
Great.

1046
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:11,032
Do we have any questions?

1047
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,770
Councilor Zaro.

1048
01:49:21,252 --> 01:49:23,373
I just want to say thank you for your presentation.

1049
01:49:24,173 --> 01:49:26,774
Your department does quite a lot.

1050
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:36,099
I understand there's some squidgy stuff with the numbers and how they're funded, and that is really helpful context for us.

1051
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,261
I just appreciate that.

1052
01:49:41,502 --> 01:49:43,823
And I appreciate you coming down.

1053
01:49:45,644 --> 01:49:46,524
And thank you.

1054
01:49:46,885 --> 01:49:47,685
Pretty much level funded.

1055
01:49:49,966 --> 01:49:50,347
Absolutely.

1056
01:49:50,508 --> 01:49:50,809
Thanks.

1057
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:52,272
Great.

1058
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:02,405
Thank you.

1059
01:50:02,425 --> 01:50:03,706
Thanks for being here.

1060
01:50:03,726 --> 01:50:04,826
Thanks for the presentation.

1061
01:50:04,866 --> 01:50:06,387
I don't have a lot of specific questions.

1062
01:50:06,427 --> 01:50:07,748
I feel like I talk to you constantly.

1063
01:50:07,848 --> 01:50:11,410
So I feel like if I had questions, I'd probably ask them already.

1064
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:28,419
But just because I feel like in the day-to-day, maybe it doesn't get said often enough, I feel that the Department of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, I have constantly been in awe of just how much this department handles and bottom lines.

1065
01:50:28,519 --> 01:50:28,999
It really is.

1066
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:45,825
My goal is not simply to butter up department heads in budget hearings I really do mean it, it is quite amazing to me how much your department handles and that is a testament to your incredible staff and the curation of that staff and a really high level of resourcefulness so thank you.

1067
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:52,607
Um, really from the bottom of my heart, it is very it's wonderful to get to see the impact that it has in our city.

1068
01:50:53,368 --> 01:51:04,632
Um, of course, being closely involved with the zoning project, we've discussed the need for additional funding for in this associates really happy to see, um, that increase.

1069
01:51:04,692 --> 01:51:12,795
And I think as everybody knows throughout this process, we've continued to iterate and tried to make space for more community forums, more Q and A's more outreach.

1070
01:51:13,655 --> 01:51:22,799
And I'm really glad that we've been able to collaborate within us to find a mutually agreeable number so that we could add on to this process what the community needed to see.

1071
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:25,200
So thank you for helping shake that out as well.

1072
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,200
Appreciate it.

1073
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:26,880
Thank you.

1074
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:29,962
Great.

1075
01:51:30,822 --> 01:51:35,744
Any further questions on the PDS core budget before we go into some of the commissions?

1076
01:51:36,844 --> 01:51:46,242
I think there actually realized one thing that I should just add when CDBG grant was in front of you the numbers were still tentative and I'll just let you know that.

1077
01:51:47,482 --> 01:51:56,528
very recently in the last couple days, we were notified officially about our CDBG allocation, and it is up a teeny tiny bit from last year, so it's not down.

1078
01:51:57,128 --> 01:52:01,891
And so we were stunned, but it means that we can afford everything that was put in front of you.

1079
01:52:02,632 --> 01:52:05,794
And we are not concerned about that for this coming year.

1080
01:52:05,894 --> 01:52:07,795
It's a formula, we don't apply for it.

1081
01:52:07,875 --> 01:52:14,359
It's probably because we have a higher percentage of low-income people in the city of Medford, and not because of anything that we did.

1082
01:52:14,379 --> 01:52:17,181
I just wanted to let you know that that is actually

1083
01:52:17,581 --> 01:52:20,463
finalized.

1084
01:52:21,764 --> 01:52:22,105
Thank you.

1085
01:52:24,126 --> 01:52:31,052
All right, we'll go to boards of commissions next to Bicycle Commission, no change.

1086
01:52:31,072 --> 01:52:34,694
1500, 1000 for public safety supplies, 1000 for travel conferences and training.

1087
01:52:37,156 --> 01:52:40,559
Any further comments or questions by members of the Council on the Bicycle Commission?

1088
01:52:47,896 --> 01:53:03,744
Seeing none, we will go next to, one second here, Zoning Board of Appeals, 12,500 in fiscal 25, 12,500 fiscal 26, no change.

1089
01:53:03,764 --> 01:53:07,186
Any discussion or questions on the Zoning Board of Appeals?

1090
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:20,748
Maybe we could use this opportunity to talk about the difference between the Zoning Board and the Community Development Board a little bit.

1091
01:53:20,868 --> 01:53:26,574
So the Zoning Board considers appeals of building department decisions.

1092
01:53:27,287 --> 01:53:27,547
Right.

1093
01:53:27,848 --> 01:53:37,557
So if a building is not in compliance with zoning, the building commissioner says you're not allowed to do this, and he denies it.

1094
01:53:39,258 --> 01:53:47,225
We've been working with the technicalities of it, but basically then the applicant can, if they choose to, go to the Zoning Board of Appeals and ask for

1095
01:53:48,607 --> 01:53:53,273
an appeal, and they can get that if they meet certain legal tests.

1096
01:53:53,633 --> 01:53:56,857
So it's not at their discretion, it's not because they love the project.

1097
01:53:57,638 --> 01:54:03,105
It has to do with shape, topography, and soil conditions, whether they can get

1098
01:54:06,143 --> 01:54:09,345
a zoning appeal, a variance, and then they do that.

1099
01:54:09,686 --> 01:54:11,907
The zoning board does hear some special permits.

1100
01:54:12,328 --> 01:54:19,413
And so often that would be by use or in some complicated things around non-conforming properties.

1101
01:54:19,593 --> 01:54:29,260
So for the most part, what they do as they make legal decisions about whether this meets legal tests, we usually encourage all applicants to the zoning board

1102
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:37,346
to consider hiring a lawyer and if they are more than a small single family, if they're a single family home, our staff helps them through the process.

1103
01:54:37,686 --> 01:54:43,090
If they're more than that, then they should have a lawyer because they're making a legal argument for what they want there.

1104
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:44,851
So that's a zoning board.

1105
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:46,773
I will say that when we have had a

1106
01:54:49,053 --> 01:54:51,715
comprehensive permits known as 40 B's.

1107
01:54:52,195 --> 01:54:58,999
They also hear those and under our zoning, they also hear any cannabis locations.

1108
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:04,902
And so we actually are eligible for three cannabis locations and one is open.

1109
01:55:05,743 --> 01:55:11,726
One has been through the ZBA process and has been permitted and is under construction.

1110
01:55:12,146 --> 01:55:16,669
And the third tells us that they are actually preparing documents to come

1111
01:55:17,149 --> 01:55:18,790
file in front of the ZBA.

1112
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:29,315
And when they do that, it's not just a legal test, but it's a more broad examination, sort of like site plan review, like how does this fit with the community?

1113
01:55:29,375 --> 01:55:30,836
What are you planning at this location?

1114
01:55:30,856 --> 01:55:36,518
They look at more details than just the legal test, if this is allowed.

1115
01:55:37,239 --> 01:55:38,559
So we are expecting that this year.

1116
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,641
Where's the under construction?

1117
01:55:41,261 --> 01:55:43,002
The one under construction is at the VFW.

1118
01:55:46,749 --> 01:55:47,750
So that's the zoning board.

1119
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:51,252
Would you like me to then just speak to the community development board so we can look at what's next?

1120
01:55:51,312 --> 01:55:54,353
Community development board, fiscal 25 budget, 8,900, fiscal 26 proposed, 9,800.

1121
01:55:54,393 --> 01:55:56,595
Looks like an increase in the stipends.

1122
01:55:56,615 --> 01:55:59,757
I don't know if you want to speak to it.

1123
01:55:59,817 --> 01:56:01,838
It is not an increase in the stipends.

1124
01:56:01,938 --> 01:56:04,779
It is an increase in the number of positions on there.

1125
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,741
So, because we added some...

1126
01:56:12,249 --> 01:56:16,971
brain just dropped the word associate associate alternates in this case they're alternates.

1127
01:56:18,492 --> 01:56:25,595
And so on the Community Development Board, an alternate if a member is not there an alternate can vote in their place.

1128
01:56:25,975 --> 01:56:28,997
And if they've been following if they've been at the previous even if it's a public

1129
01:56:29,557 --> 01:56:35,000
hearing and they've been at the previous meetings and somebody's absent they can then step in and become a voting member.

1130
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:42,324
So we now have two alternate positions on there and actually we kind of had a cushion going on for a little while.

1131
01:56:42,364 --> 01:56:54,810
We've actually added those a little earlier but the finances didn't line up which was fine because we had a chair who worked for the state and she was declining her stipend because she felt it was a conflict of interest.

1132
01:56:55,131 --> 01:56:57,652
She couldn't take a payment from us and from the state.

1133
01:56:58,132 --> 01:56:58,952
at the same time.

1134
01:57:00,053 --> 01:57:08,697
So now she's no longer on the board, we are working to fill her position, and then we would, with a full board, will actually need the full amount of funding.

1135
01:57:09,477 --> 01:57:14,719
So the Community Development Board is what is often referred to as your planning board.

1136
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:21,182
So they have a say in zoning, so they are also reviewing all the zoning and making recommendations too, as you're well aware.

1137
01:57:21,682 --> 01:57:24,943
And then the other thing they spend a lot of time doing is site plan review.

1138
01:57:25,023 --> 01:57:28,605
So they look at the outside of projects, larger projects.

1139
01:57:29,025 --> 01:57:34,147
They look at the look and feel of it, the plantings, the pedestrian access, the traffic access.

1140
01:57:34,187 --> 01:57:41,890
They're the ones who ask, you know, we would really like you to do stuff for the crosswalk at this location and we'd like you to put in a pocket park.

1141
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:45,171
One of the big things that we're very happy about is if you look at

1142
01:57:46,632 --> 01:58:08,452
Wegmans and there is a new little bank in the corner of one of the parking lots and next to that is a lovely little park pocket park with a walkway and bushes and trees and benches and you we've I've seen people sitting there the CD board basically said you're putting a bank in the middle of a parking lot you don't need that much parking we'd like you to put in

1143
01:58:09,072 --> 01:58:09,993
a pocket park.

1144
01:58:10,493 --> 01:58:15,135
And they basically said, okay, and they put in the pocket park because we asked.

1145
01:58:15,215 --> 01:58:17,856
So that is the board that kind of asks for these things.

1146
01:58:19,277 --> 01:58:24,939
They have some leeway in what they're allowed to ask, like how far it has to have nexus, it has to be like right there.

1147
01:58:25,219 --> 01:58:28,861
They could not have asked them to redo the park up in North Medford.

1148
01:58:29,121 --> 01:58:33,703
They could ask them to put in a pocket park adjacent to their building.

1149
01:58:34,383 --> 01:58:35,684
So that's what they do a lot of.

1150
01:58:35,704 --> 01:58:35,784
Most

1151
01:58:37,885 --> 01:58:44,889
developers who have anything to say about the process of going through site plan review have said, wow, they actually made this a better project.

1152
01:58:45,309 --> 01:58:55,274
I didn't realize that people would want a path through there or want to access it from this direction and you pushed me to put more bike parking in and we needed it and stuff like that.

1153
01:58:56,575 --> 01:59:08,782
So that's the kinds of stuff, like at BJ's now, where there's the gas station as part of that site plan review, they requested a sidewalk all the way from Mystic Ave to the building.

1154
01:59:09,062 --> 01:59:14,946
So you can now actually walk on a sidewalk down the side of their property the entire way.

1155
01:59:15,466 --> 01:59:17,027
And you couldn't do that before.

1156
01:59:17,387 --> 01:59:21,630
There was no sidewalk at all from Mystic Ave to that building.

1157
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,831
In fact, there were no sidewalks in that parking lot at all.

1158
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:33,584
So that's the kinds of things the CD board does, I will tell you that they have now been meeting twice a month, pretty reliably, because there has been so much in front of them.

1159
01:59:34,025 --> 01:59:36,288
They also hear all Dover cases.

1160
01:59:36,809 --> 01:59:40,054
So if there's an as of right something coming out of tops.

1161
01:59:40,534 --> 01:59:44,417
or because it's educational in some manner, like we saw with 21 St.

1162
01:59:44,517 --> 01:59:55,866
Clair, they are the board that would hear that as well and review sort of how this fits into the community and what are reasonable things to ask of that as well.

1163
01:59:56,927 --> 01:59:59,649
So yeah, so they do a lot, but they do a lot more

1164
02:00:01,325 --> 02:00:02,366
the feeling of this?

1165
02:00:02,406 --> 02:00:03,367
Does this look right?

1166
02:00:03,848 --> 02:00:08,472
What does the community need to make this a better project for the community?

1167
02:00:08,593 --> 02:00:15,640
And they have the ability to ask for making this a better project where the zoning board has very legal parameters that they work in.

1168
02:00:17,021 --> 02:00:19,762
So by the way, there's an opening on the CD board right now.

1169
02:00:19,782 --> 02:00:30,087
If you know good people, we are taking applications again, both for a, I keep saying an associate, an alternate position and a full-time position.

1170
02:00:30,488 --> 02:00:41,213
And we are working, we actually by law on our CD board have a governor appointed position, and we are working on trying to figure out how to get that position appointed.

1171
02:00:41,253 --> 02:00:45,295
We usually recommend somebody, but we need somebody at the state to bless that position.

1172
02:00:45,935 --> 02:00:48,196
So anyhow, but we need an applicant to fill it.

1173
02:00:48,877 --> 02:00:59,023
The last person I recommended to fill that position, she decided she couldn't fill it because of changes at the federal government and her life was too busy.

1174
02:00:59,243 --> 02:01:00,724
Only good news, we hired her.

1175
02:01:00,784 --> 02:01:02,545
She's staff in the city of Medford now.

1176
02:01:04,346 --> 02:01:09,910
So she was an excellent applicant, but now we need another person to fill that position.

1177
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:11,051
She's our new housing planner.

1178
02:01:11,071 --> 02:01:11,191
Great.

1179
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:29,834
All right, next we have our Conservation Commission, fiscal 25 budget 7500, fiscal 26 budget 7500, no change.

1180
02:01:30,034 --> 02:01:33,935
They do Wetlands Protection Act.

1181
02:01:34,335 --> 02:01:41,677
So they also issue permits on behalf of the city of Medford, anything close to water, wetland, river, that's what they do.

1182
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:47,320
Right.

1183
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:51,443
Historic District Commission 5000 fiscal 25 5000 fiscal 26.

1184
02:01:51,963 --> 02:01:55,305
Any questions?

1185
02:01:56,926 --> 02:01:57,866
Councilor Callahan?

1186
02:02:01,048 --> 02:02:03,569
unclassified, which is almost tap.

1187
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:05,090
That's historical commission.

1188
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:05,670
We'll get there next.

1189
02:02:05,771 --> 02:02:06,311
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1190
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:08,232
Did I skip historical?

1191
02:02:08,652 --> 02:02:08,952
No.

1192
02:02:09,893 --> 02:02:10,093
I did.

1193
02:02:12,349 --> 02:02:14,231
No, I did, I did skip this one, sorry.

1194
02:02:14,812 --> 02:02:20,199
Historical commission or historic commission, 55, sorry, 35,000 fiscal 25, 35,000 fiscal 26, Councillor Kiley.

1195
02:02:27,885 --> 02:02:29,445
That was unclassified.

1196
02:02:29,465 --> 02:02:33,466
That's what you were saying, which I didn't see on this board and we do on that one.

1197
02:02:35,067 --> 02:02:46,230
Really, it's more professional services, and I am unclear of why historically, one is, they have it broken into two places but for that we hire professionals who do.

1198
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:55,557
I can't remember the exact form numbers, but they get forms for properties to determine if they're historic or not or what the history of these things are.

1199
02:02:56,598 --> 02:03:07,967
And they also so they also one of them they use for that and the other actually they've been going out and getting grants to do historic assessments of the community and typically the grant is

1200
02:03:09,635 --> 02:03:24,344
requires a match, and I can't remember if it's the 15,000 or the 20,000, that is the match for the grant that they get, but they tend to get the same grant every year and then they do studies of different parts of the city to increase our historical knowledge.

1201
02:03:25,952 --> 02:03:32,413
And everybody's, I think this board is clear the difference in the Historic Commission and the Historic District Commission.

1202
02:03:32,893 --> 02:03:34,394
We have historic districts.

1203
02:03:35,494 --> 02:03:40,675
Historic districts are a way of protecting properties in the look and feel of the community.

1204
02:03:41,195 --> 02:03:44,935
The Historic Commission speaks to older.

1205
02:03:45,396 --> 02:03:49,856
So if you wanna do anything to a property in the Historic District Commission, you need permission.

1206
02:03:50,076 --> 02:03:52,917
In the Historic District, you need permission from the HDC.

1207
02:03:53,993 --> 02:04:11,927
If you have a building that is over 75 years old, and you want to tear it down or make significant change so you can change a lot about it, but if you want to like really change it, then you have to go to the historic commission for permission, they cannot actually tell you no.

1208
02:04:12,487 --> 02:04:18,171
They can tell you there's an 18 month delay, and they can then negotiate.

1209
02:04:18,472 --> 02:04:28,439
If a developer says but what if I do it like this or what if I document this so a great example was the herb chambers the building next to it that got torn down.

1210
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:37,743
basically the Historic Commission said, we really want you to document that old building, but we see why it doesn't make sense to keep it.

1211
02:04:38,163 --> 02:04:40,704
So they said, great, we'll document it.

1212
02:04:40,844 --> 02:04:43,785
And the Historic Commission said, great, you did that really fast.

1213
02:04:43,825 --> 02:04:50,407
Your 18 month is lifted, that only took you one month, go ahead, great, do your construction.

1214
02:04:50,808 --> 02:04:57,610
So that's typically, and they'll work with developers as well, to sort of say, could you change it a little bit and make it look a little

1215
02:04:57,670 --> 02:05:00,132
more historical, and then we won't delay you.

1216
02:05:00,452 --> 02:05:02,714
So that's them.

1217
02:05:03,434 --> 02:05:03,694
Great.

1218
02:05:04,775 --> 02:05:07,137
And then historic district commission also no change.

1219
02:05:08,818 --> 02:05:11,420
I think you've described both of them.

1220
02:05:12,341 --> 02:05:14,382
No, it was at the end, I skipped over historic.

1221
02:05:15,343 --> 02:05:17,624
Oh, historic commission is no change, right?

1222
02:05:17,644 --> 02:05:17,744
Yeah.

1223
02:05:18,245 --> 02:05:22,528
Do you have any questions on historic commission or historic district commission?

1224
02:05:24,627 --> 02:05:26,067
And I'm just gonna plug my staff.

1225
02:05:26,127 --> 02:05:31,669
We support like five or six other boards that don't have budgets.

1226
02:05:31,889 --> 02:05:33,170
So they're not in front of you tonight.

1227
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:34,150
And what are those?

1228
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:43,973
Off the top of my head, the Energy and Environment Committee, the Climate Equity Commission, the Community Garden Commission.

1229
02:05:45,814 --> 02:05:50,435
Those are the ones that get in front of me a lot, but I know there's more than that.

1230
02:05:53,155 --> 02:05:54,356
Oh, Bicycle does have a note.

1231
02:05:54,496 --> 02:05:56,798
That's one I often, because we don't staff them.

1232
02:05:59,159 --> 02:06:03,503
Oh, the Affordable Housing Trust.

1233
02:06:03,603 --> 02:06:06,325
The CPA is a separate budget in front of you.

1234
02:06:06,345 --> 02:06:08,346
It's like, OK, now I'm up to five.

1235
02:06:08,366 --> 02:06:11,489
I forgot.

1236
02:06:15,451 --> 02:06:17,493
Affordable Housing Trust, the Climate Equity Commission.

1237
02:06:18,474 --> 02:06:18,634
Yes.

1238
02:06:20,422 --> 02:06:24,065
And then the Community Garden Commission, they have revolving funds.

1239
02:06:24,145 --> 02:06:27,448
So they actually collect money in from their gardeners.

1240
02:06:27,568 --> 02:06:33,693
And so we actually manage their finances, but the finances are not allocated through this body.

1241
02:06:33,813 --> 02:06:36,315
It's just they collect fees for using the plots.

1242
02:06:36,756 --> 02:06:44,202
And then when they want to spend on like compost for the whole garden at once or upgrading their shed or they need

1243
02:06:44,721 --> 02:06:50,985
more shared tools, they go to Home Depot and we pay out of the revolving fund that's set up for them.

1244
02:06:54,487 --> 02:06:54,747
Great.

1245
02:06:55,267 --> 02:06:55,567
Great.

1246
02:06:56,468 --> 02:06:57,549
Well, thank you, Director Hunt.

1247
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:00,470
Good evening.

1248
02:07:01,911 --> 02:07:03,372
And we're on to the last.

1249
02:07:03,512 --> 02:07:07,875
We have Chief Steph Mazarian to talk about the License Commission.

1250
02:07:10,271 --> 02:07:16,257
We have a fiscal year 25 budget 5800, fiscal 26 proposed 5800, no change.

1251
02:07:16,937 --> 02:07:25,245
Madam Chief of Staff, if you want to just tell us a little bit about what the License Commission does and what it's been doing and its goals for the future.

1252
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:26,911
Thank you, Mr President.

1253
02:07:27,512 --> 02:07:35,760
Um, so the for the members of the public, the License Commission is the liquor license body for the city of Medford.

1254
02:07:36,281 --> 02:07:46,913
And so the any liquor license any party that's interested in, um, holding a licorice license or presently holds a liquor license and needs a liquor license renewal.

1255
02:07:47,673 --> 02:07:50,235
would need to appear before the Liquor License Commission.

1256
02:07:50,295 --> 02:08:06,805
I'm not intimately familiar with their procedures, but I understand they are looking at some new potential changes to policy and acceptance of statutes that is presently being reviewed and maybe before the council at a future time.

1257
02:08:07,385 --> 02:08:12,628
It has something to do with extending hours of the ability to serve liquor.

1258
02:08:12,648 --> 02:08:15,210
That's all.

1259
02:08:15,898 --> 02:08:19,122
Great and about a council is our.

1260
02:08:22,386 --> 02:08:27,712
I just thank you for presenting and for staying to the end to talk for like one second.

1261
02:08:29,654 --> 02:08:34,200
I also thought this would be an appropriate time to mention that I had a quick conversation with our

1262
02:08:34,898 --> 02:08:45,841
academic development director last week about something I happened to read on the reddit post and wanted to correct a misconception.

1263
02:08:46,782 --> 02:08:50,943
Somebody had said Medford only has a certain number of liquor licenses for bars and restaurants.

1264
02:08:51,643 --> 02:08:53,044
and they've hit their cap.

1265
02:08:53,104 --> 02:08:54,905
So like they can't do that anymore.

1266
02:08:55,105 --> 02:09:00,128
And Sal helped me, verified for me, which I thought was true that that's not accurate.

1267
02:09:00,589 --> 02:09:03,710
We don't have a cap on liquor licenses for bars and restaurants.

1268
02:09:03,931 --> 02:09:05,812
That's not the case in Medford.

1269
02:09:06,212 --> 02:09:10,194
However, he said, what we do have is a cap on package store licenses.

1270
02:09:10,735 --> 02:09:17,879
So they have what amounts to a sanctioned market for like

1271
02:09:20,572 --> 02:09:30,361
selling liquor licenses for liquor stores and grocery stores that I think is kind of a bummer, but it's not a hill I'm going to die on right now.

1272
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:38,208
But like Wegmans, when they opened and they wanted to sell alcohol, bought a liquor license for like $300,000, which is super weird.

1273
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:41,491
And that is something that we all know now.

1274
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:45,081
But that's not the case for restaurants and bars.

1275
02:09:45,481 --> 02:09:51,663
Places come, they present to the license commission, they acquire a liquor license, that's allowed.

1276
02:09:51,763 --> 02:09:58,545
Anybody can try to do that, open a bar and restaurant in Medford, we're available for them to do that.

1277
02:09:58,605 --> 02:09:59,145
It's not capped.

1278
02:09:59,165 --> 02:10:04,267
It's a very interesting phenomenon that happens in a lot of cities and towns that you just mentioned, Councilor, yes.

1279
02:10:04,727 --> 02:10:04,967
Yes.

1280
02:10:06,007 --> 02:10:10,949
Is there, and this is actually to my fellow Councilor, is there a, I was just actually looking up this exact same question.

1281
02:10:13,712 --> 02:10:21,134
It looks like the special act that passed in 2012 said that they have to have a 50 seat minimum for restaurant liquor licenses.

1282
02:10:21,234 --> 02:10:22,995
Did you talk to Sal about that at all?

1283
02:10:25,316 --> 02:10:29,697
I didn't specifically, I'm sure he would know, but I didn't mention that specifically.

1284
02:10:29,817 --> 02:10:38,240
He didn't seem to be, he didn't seem to think that there was any kind of restriction actually.

1285
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:40,481
So, I mean, I would ask him that.

1286
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:46,424
And this might be a question for Alicia as much as it is a question for you, Nina.

1287
02:10:50,869 --> 02:10:55,733
In terms of bars, is that, do we allow that?

1288
02:10:55,773 --> 02:10:57,295
Did we change the zoning to allow that?

1289
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:02,340
Or does Mrs. Murphy's technically serve food?

1290
02:11:04,843 --> 02:11:05,023
OK.

1291
02:11:05,043 --> 02:11:06,944
Right, a conversation we recently had.

1292
02:11:06,984 --> 02:11:09,444
So I think what you're getting at is, do bars have to serve food?

1293
02:11:09,984 --> 02:11:20,546
And so we have been having a conversation with the Liquor Commission to get some clarity around this, because there is some feeling that that is a Medford rule.

1294
02:11:20,986 --> 02:11:23,187
And there are some that that is a statewide rule.

1295
02:11:23,307 --> 02:11:30,408
And we've been trying to find something on the state website that says bars must serve food, or that they don't have to.

1296
02:11:31,428 --> 02:11:39,318
And all I've been able to find our news articles saying that like Massachusetts repealed a law about serving food in bars.

1297
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:40,700
During the pandemic.

1298
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:44,284
And we're really actually trying to get some clarity around that right now.

1299
02:11:45,265 --> 02:11:47,628
They that Mrs Murphy's is a restaurant.

1300
02:11:50,832 --> 02:12:01,298
At this time, they have been requiring all Medford establishments that serve alcohol to serve food, and we're trying to just get some clarity around whether that's a local decision or not.

1301
02:12:01,778 --> 02:12:05,040
It has been the policy in Medford for as long as anybody can remember.

1302
02:12:06,601 --> 02:12:07,302
Perhaps that helps.

1303
02:12:09,043 --> 02:12:09,343
Great.

1304
02:12:09,363 --> 02:12:09,563
What?

1305
02:12:09,983 --> 02:12:20,129
Oh, the brewery does not count because they are a brewery and they are covered under different laws than any other bar or restaurant bar because they're a brewery.

1306
02:12:20,932 --> 02:12:24,615
And they're covered under special zoning definition here, too.

1307
02:12:24,655 --> 02:12:26,436
They have a special zoning definition here.

1308
02:12:26,556 --> 02:12:27,737
They're different.

1309
02:12:28,177 --> 02:12:32,881
It's completely different than a bar, legally, if not in effect.

1310
02:12:35,843 --> 02:12:36,163
Great.

1311
02:12:36,683 --> 02:12:38,845
And just want to send thanks back.

1312
02:12:38,905 --> 02:12:39,646
I know we're working.

1313
02:12:40,806 --> 02:12:58,129
with the clerk's office and planning and Daria and the licensing commission on this whole question of getting into a good, better place on aligning our common mixtures licenses and the liquor license and the ABCC piece and everything else, and Councilor Zaro, thank you too.

1314
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:01,490
So thanks for that.

1315
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:06,971
Do we have any questions, further questions about the Liquor License Commission for the Chief of Staff?

1316
02:13:10,899 --> 02:13:14,561
Seeing none, do we have any comments from members of the public?

1317
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:20,745
Seeing no one in the chamber, no hands on Zoom, do we have a motion?

1318
02:13:22,366 --> 02:13:29,690
Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1319
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:31,131
All those in favor?

1320
02:13:31,731 --> 02:13:32,072
Opposed?

1321
02:13:32,132 --> 02:13:33,272
Motion passes, meeting is adjourned.

1322
02:13:33,292 --> 02:13:33,572
Thank you.
