[SPEAKER_15]: action and discussion items.

14
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,650
[SPEAKER_15]: 25 039 annual budget process for fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget meeting three.

15
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,011
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be the third preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 26 budget process.

16
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,371
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor has communicated the following departments will be present.

17
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:37,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Chevalier, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Library, Human Resources, Planning, Development and Sustainability, and the Liquor Commission.

18
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:44,055
[SPEAKER_15]: The police were on the agenda, but the chief is not available, so that has been moved to next Tuesday, the 27th.

19
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,116
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be starting at 5.30.

20
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,619
[SPEAKER_15]: along with DPW and the schools.

21
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,764
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, we will take Chevalier first, and I'll just read quickly.

22
00:20:56,824 --> 00:21:02,929
[SPEAKER_15]: We had fiscal year 2025 budget, 32,000, fiscal 2026 budget proposed 32,640.

23
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:16,518
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, we have Director Riggi, and I'm gonna ask you just to describe the budget, any changes, some fiscal 25 accomplishments, goals for next year, and if there are any

24
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:21,164
[SPEAKER_15]: key needs and priorities that aren't funded this year that you'd like to see funded in the future.

25
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,145
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will go to our Facilities Director, Paul Ringy.

26
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

27
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:33,329
[SPEAKER_00]: The budget that's reflected shows the personnel budget for the Chevalier Theatre.

28
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:39,432
[SPEAKER_00]: What our plan is to actually move that personnel line item over to the facilities budget.

29
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,854
[SPEAKER_00]: since he's part of the facility staff.

30
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:48,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would come for fiscal year 2026 as part of the facility's budget.

31
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:56,254
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the funding that we use at the Chevalier is in special funding accounts.

32
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:03,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that money is used for general wear and tear and upkeep to the building.

33
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:12,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it's used to enhancements like the new LED lighting in the ceiling and the new video signage outside that we did.

34
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:19,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous projects were redoing the masonry on the front facade of the building.

35
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking in the future.

36
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:32,030
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at emergency lighting that is needed inside the theater at the seats because it's lacking when the show lights go down there, especially in the balcony area.

37
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,551
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not emergency lighting strips.

38
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:37,993
[SPEAKER_00]: We had installed some emergency lighting strips.

39
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:40,933
[SPEAKER_00]: on the main floor of the theater.

40
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:43,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we find that there is a need for the second floor.

41
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:48,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be a priority for fiscal year 26 to do.

42
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:57,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping to get funding from the casino mitigation fund that we could actually repaint the entire interior of the theater.

43
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:03,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's a salmon and green, which is not conducive to show.

44
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that we get the $350,000

45
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,853
[SPEAKER_00]: that we requested so we can do that work in the theater.

46
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:15,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Director Riggi.

47
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,339
[SPEAKER_15]: You brought up something that's a great note for everyone.

48
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,245
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about the general fund budget, but that's not all of the money that our different city departments and schools use.

49
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:34,129
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for mentioning what's going on with other funds from the state and casino, etc.

50
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:40,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any questions from members of the Council for Director Riggi about the Chevalier budget?

51
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:51,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, do we have any questions from the public either in person or on Zoom about the Chevalier general fund budget?

52
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, thank you very much.

53
00:23:57,548 --> 00:23:57,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

54
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:07,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up we have the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office Budget.

55
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Director Nwaje is here with us on Zoom.

56
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here.

57
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,429
[SPEAKER_15]: We're making you a co-host.

58
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:14,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you had a presentation.

59
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,750
[SPEAKER_15]: You might want to share it.

60
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:23,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm seeing a thumbs up, so you'll be able to unmute and share your presentation, but I will just quickly read off

61
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,310
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a fiscal 25 budget of $118,502.

62
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,211
[SPEAKER_15]: A fiscal 26 proposed budget of $120,911.

63
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,671
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is an increase of $2,409.

64
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:33,652
[SPEAKER_15]: There's an increase in the permanent employees for a COLA increase and an increase of $1,000 in office supplies.

65
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:38,033
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are both fixed cost increases.

66
00:24:54,577 --> 00:25:16,789
[SPEAKER_15]: With that, turning it over to Director Nwaje for the presentation and also, you know, the general prompt is just to talk about the budget change, any other details you might want to share about the budget, talk about any accomplishments of the previous year, goals for next year, and items that are key needs and priorities that were not funded this year that you'd like to see funded in future years.

67
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, I'll turn it over to Director Nwaje.

68
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:26,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for allowing me to do this via Zoom.

69
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:33,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that some of the questions will be answered through the PowerPoint.

70
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:46,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Just let me know if you can see it.

71
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:48,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we can.

72
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:48,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

73
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,098
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fantastic.

74
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:50,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

75
00:25:51,939 --> 00:26:00,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is a space for all who live, work, learn and do business in the city of Medford.

76
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:12,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way that we do that is by upholding the civil rights laws, ensuring that there's access to our programs and access is beyond the physical.

77
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,007
[SPEAKER_09]: It is anything from somebody needing

78
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:21,311
[SPEAKER_09]: a large print document so that they can file for an abatement.

79
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And that document is actually a state form.

80
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't come in large print.

81
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:32,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got to figure out the best way to handle that situation so that we can assist the constituents.

82
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:43,688
[SPEAKER_09]: For the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, our work is regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age,

83
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:51,598
[SPEAKER_09]: disability status, language ability, socioeconomic status, immigration status and political affiliation.

84
00:26:52,339 --> 00:27:00,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really important for people to know and understand that it really is a space for all people and sometimes that can be misinterpreted.

85
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:20,423
[SPEAKER_09]: We also continue to address inequities, whether they're institutional or systemic, through our work within our own City of Medford agencies and departments, as well as external work with state and federal agencies.

86
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:36,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of our collaborations have included the library, Medford Community Media, who I have to thank Kevin Harrington for his support in one of the accomplishments, the Medford Fire Department, Police Department.

87
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:43,625
[SPEAKER_09]: public schools, the senior center, the Office of Prevention and Outreach, and that's just to name a few.

88
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:51,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Our external partnerships include Boston Center for Independent Living, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the MassAbility

89
00:27:52,257 --> 00:28:08,359
[SPEAKER_09]: The Job Accommodation Network, which is huge for a lot of the ADA needs that take place throughout the city, whether it is a constituent who is in need of accessibility services or an employee who is in need.

90
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:33,418
[SPEAKER_09]: the MCAD, Mass Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, for always fulfilling my interpreter requests, Medford Housing Authority, Medford Health Matters, the Mass Office on Disability, New England ADA Center, who is our go-to resource, Tufts University, and of course, my strongest community partner, the West Medford Community Center.

91
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,521
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know our office has put on a variety of events.

92
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:53,947
[SPEAKER_09]: We hosted the first salute to our veterans dinner back in November of last year and this was done in collaboration with the office of veterans affairs and it was a dinner because we were trying to target

93
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:57,370
[SPEAKER_09]: veterans within a specific age group.

94
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:03,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the veterans that under-report and under-utilize services.

95
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,920
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was why it was done in that format.

96
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Lunar New Year hosted in collaboration with Medford

97
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:34,192
[SPEAKER_09]: High School Asian Club, the Black History Month Community Event, the Black History Month Employee Luncheon, where we had Oma Moses as a guest speaker, Medford Connect's partner retreat that was done in partnership with the Office of Prevention and Outreach, and the Disability Fair hosted in partnership with the Commission on Persons with Disabilities.

98
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:41,416
[SPEAKER_09]: and just, you know, just put in some corresponding flyers to break up the verbal.

99
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:57,184
[SPEAKER_09]: So our upcoming events include the Pride flag raising ceremony and festival that is taking place on Friday, May 30th.

100
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:02,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts at 4.30 and that would be followed by the

101
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Juneteenth flag-raising celebration.

102
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,255
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on Wednesday, June 18th, and that starts at four.

103
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:23,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you remember last year's event, I will say remember to bring your dancing shoes this year because we have confirmed with a band from Texas, so.

104
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:38,209
[SPEAKER_09]: flyer for the Pride event and thank you to Councilor Lazzaro for being kind enough to share remarks on behalf of City Council at this event.

105
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And Juneteenth is in the works.

106
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:51,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So our accomplishments so far, and remember the work of this office is very fluid.

107
00:30:52,430 --> 00:31:00,993
[SPEAKER_09]: It's responsive to what is happening in the moment and time, and also a lot of projection and forecasting.

108
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:06,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So just like the tide, it comes in, it goes out, and it shifts and changes.

109
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:18,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to acquire upgraded accessible listening devices, which we now have in the sort of hall chambers utilizing ARPA funds.

110
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,780
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was where Medford Community Media was instrumental.

111
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:33,223
[SPEAKER_09]: We also acquired accessible seating in the chambers because all the chairs that we had for guests, none of the chairs had any arms.

112
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:38,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were able to utilize some ARPA funds to bring those in.

113
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Completed the MCAD training series for the entire Medford Fire Department.

114
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:53,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Completed the TRIO series of trainings for SEIU and Teamsters employees at Medford Public Schools.

115
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:59,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was done in partnership with Teamsters Union and SEIU.

116
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to both Brian Hatch and

117
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:05,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Montana for their willingness to support that.

118
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:10,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And we started the foundational build of the diversity dashboard.

119
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:16,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is the diversity dashboard?

120
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:22,301
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a voluntary self-identification and affirmative action capturing system.

121
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:27,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It utilizes the criterias of identification that are

122
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,061
[SPEAKER_09]: already identified by the federal government.

123
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:42,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we had online systems, these forms would already pop up, but it allows people to self-report, which is, you know, the real, where the real value is.

124
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:49,946
[SPEAKER_09]: The dashboard was created with support of a student intern from Tufts University.

125
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:56,337
[SPEAKER_09]: The dashboard can be, the information that goes onto the dashboard can be done in two ways.

126
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:03,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper copies, so paper copies are on hand city side and also on hand school side.

127
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:08,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a link can be sent and the employee can enter

128
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:13,025
[SPEAKER_09]: the information directly into the online system.

129
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:18,308
[SPEAKER_09]: The dashboard is beneficial because it's a real data set.

130
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:22,610
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a snapshot of who we are as an employer.

131
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:34,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, it's a snapshot based on the number of employees that choose to participate, but it is still a snapshot on who we are as an employer,

132
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:48,868
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be utilized when we're discussing benefits, when you're reviewing hiring trends and practices, when you want to look at where are you pulling your talent from.

133
00:33:50,894 --> 00:34:01,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And the ultimate goal is for this to continue to be built out and live on the ODEI webpage and be utilized as an interactive tool.

134
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:08,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's still in the infancy stages, but the foundational build is done.

135
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:09,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It is working.

136
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,685
[SPEAKER_09]: It auto-populates.

137
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:18,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And as time moves on, you know, we will be able to build out more and add a variety of different criteria.

138
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:26,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So example of screenshot from the dashboard itself, right?

139
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:30,928
[SPEAKER_09]: This is based on, I believe it's 172 respondents.

140
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:40,694
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're just looking at gender distribution, as you can see from the chart, we are a heavily female employer.

141
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,057
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the data shows.

142
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:45,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 74%.

143
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,302
[SPEAKER_09]: look at veteran status out of 156 that chose to respond.

144
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,962
[SPEAKER_09]: really don't have that many veterans.

145
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And it could be a variety of reasons.

146
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:20,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Veteran status is always underreported for many reasons, primarily stigma associated with hiring veterans, difficulty in converting military resumes into civilian resumes.

147
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:24,715
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it's really important to ensure that

148
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:45,449
[SPEAKER_09]: When you are in talent management, recruitment, you understand and you are out with your other counterparts and your other colleagues and you are connected with the important agencies such as veteran services that will do that type of work and help support their veterans in getting

149
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,951
[SPEAKER_09]: their desired jobs.

150
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:52,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if you take a look, this one is about disability.

151
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:55,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It was simply a yes, no, I wish not to disclose.

152
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:05,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we primarily are an employer that does not have a lot of employees with disability in comparison.

153
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:22,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to stop sharing because I would like to use this opportunity now to introduce you to what the online version looks like.

154
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:37,136
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happens is the Microsoft online form auto-populates, and then it also creates Excel spreadsheets, which can also be utilized.

155
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:39,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So here, this is the map.

156
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:43,580
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, our heaviest respondents came from the school department.

157
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,442
[SPEAKER_09]: 57% of the 172 responses received were from school employees.

158
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:55,754
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to the school department for that.

159
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:00,867
[SPEAKER_09]: When you look at again, you look at gender.

160
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:14,379
[SPEAKER_09]: shows right there, female 72%, male 23%, gender non-conforming 2%, and I do not wish to disclose 1%.

161
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,222
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanna add that gender non-conforming was a risk that ODEI took.

162
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:24,705
[SPEAKER_09]: The federal forms actually don't really give you much leeway.

163
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,927
[SPEAKER_09]: It's either male, female, or I choose not to disclose.

164
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:39,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And in respect of all the other identities that are out there, we felt that it was important to have something that people could check beyond I choose not to disclose.

165
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:45,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you can see, race and ethnicity right here, 172 respondents, 83% identify as being white.

166
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is who we are as an agency.

167
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:05,853
[SPEAKER_09]: and 98% identify as not being a veteran.

168
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:10,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So less than 2% of our employees are veterans.

169
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:21,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon me for one second, I've got to find you again.

170
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:30,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so we are back to this.

171
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:40,650
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

172
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:53,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, at this point, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion would like to advocate on behalf of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

173
00:38:53,721 --> 00:39:04,130
[SPEAKER_09]: As we review the functions and the duties and responsibilities, it is important to note that beyond bringing the lived experience

174
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:16,440
[SPEAKER_09]: to volunteer to be on this commission, there is also a tremendous amount of technical knowledge that is required in order to be able to fulfill the role.

175
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:24,587
[SPEAKER_09]: This information is taken directly from the ordinance, section 2-303, 2 and 4.

176
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: in order for commissioners to ensure that there is compliance, they must actually attend trainings.

177
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Powers and duties, section 2-304.

178
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:53,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, in order to understand how to review programs, policies, assist with implementation,

179
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:59,022
[SPEAKER_09]: commissioners have to go to a two-day CAM training.

180
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:07,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at the Commission for Persons with Disabilities as an extension of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

181
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:12,761
[SPEAKER_09]: It is three different full-time roles in one umbrella.

182
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:30,848
[SPEAKER_09]: An ADA need for an employee is very different from a need for a resident, which is very different from a person with a disability that is not able to access a business that is in the city of Medford.

183
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,710
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not matter whether or not it is a private business.

184
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do rely on the commissioners for their support.

185
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:43,015
[SPEAKER_09]: The camp training, as I said, is two days.

186
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It is six hours each day.

187
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:49,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So if people are employed, they're taking time off work.

188
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,462
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of times I cannot get to the meetings.

189
00:40:54,163 --> 00:41:04,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fortunate to have Nick for 15 hours a week, but one two-hour trip to the state house and back is his four-hour workday.

190
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's nice if there are conflicting meetings happening.

191
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take 1 and it can take another 1.

192
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:14,680
[SPEAKER_09]: 1 of the commissioners can take another 1.

193
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:24,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So, as a result, I feel that I would not be doing my due diligence, especially based on a SWOT analysis that was done last year.

194
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:27,612
[SPEAKER_09]: If I did not advocate on behalf of the commission.

195
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:36,158
[SPEAKER_09]: by requesting a stipend for the commissioners who are serving so that they can acquire the knowledge needed to fulfill their role.

196
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,861
[SPEAKER_09]: That is really where the equity and inclusion lies.

197
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:51,429
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, as I like to say, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, we have a tissue for every nose.

198
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:55,592
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also say, let love be your superpower.

199
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:57,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Let courage be your guide.

200
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Let hope be your light.

201
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:03,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Within you lies the power to do what is right.

202
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And on that note, thank you all so much for your time.

203
00:42:07,998 --> 00:42:10,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm open to questions.

204
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:18,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Director Nwaje for the presentation.

205
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:25,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any questions for the Director about the budget for the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion?

206
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:35,729
[SPEAKER_15]: See no hands, I do have a couple of questions for you.

207
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:43,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Number one, I just wanted to thank you for the advocacy for the Disability Commission.

208
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,121
[SPEAKER_15]: That's much appreciated.

209
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,405
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope we can support that advocacy as well as part of our request for the budget.

210
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:52,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I did have a question around that and some other things.

211
00:42:52,967 --> 00:43:02,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any impact on your office of the uncertainty around any federal funding and programs or any outside grant funding?

212
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:08,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yes, I mean, there is definite impact because you use the key word, right?

213
00:43:08,706 --> 00:43:09,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Uncertainty.

214
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:14,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that what we have to continue to do is forge ahead.

215
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:26,620
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very similar to 2008 when Massachusetts had a recession and Governor Deval Patrick had to freeze everything, right?

216
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,922
[SPEAKER_09]: We continue to do what we can.

217
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:31,183
[SPEAKER_09]: until we can no longer do it.

218
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:39,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the unknown is too wide, it's too time consuming, and it will drain the energy from you.

219
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:47,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe that there are organizations out there that are holding strong, right?

220
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:51,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And that are looking at other avenues.

221
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,722
[SPEAKER_09]: But if federal funds do get pulled,

222
00:43:56,728 --> 00:44:09,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the organizations that receive federal funding that distribute that funding through other sources, so that work such as what my office does can get done will be affected.

223
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:11,612
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the unfortunate reality.

224
00:44:13,832 --> 00:44:14,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

225
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:17,353
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go to Councilor Lazzaro, and then I have one more question after that.

226
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:18,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro.

227
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:18,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

228
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:23,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to echo President Bearsar's

229
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:28,063
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciation for your advocacy for the Disability Commission.

230
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:47,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would 100% agree, it really seems like staying the course and sticking to what we believe to be the right things to do for our residents and the employees of the city and the people that need representation and can benefit from

231
00:44:48,096 --> 00:45:03,764
[SPEAKER_08]: us continuing to do the right thing for them and moving forward and forging ahead is really the way to ensure that we can keep, you know, enjoying the benefits that we've enjoyed thus far until we can't, if we can't, you know, cross that bridge when we come to it.

232
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really appreciate that energy.

233
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:11,228
[SPEAKER_08]: So this budget looks totally appropriate to me, and I appreciate the presentation as well.

234
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:12,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really helpful.

235
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:12,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

236
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:14,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

237
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:20,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Council is our director knowledge I just had one.

238
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:23,946
[SPEAKER_15]: One and a half more questions.

239
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:28,427
[SPEAKER_15]: I just noticed the self-response on the demographic snapshot.

240
00:45:29,347 --> 00:45:47,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely, you know, we were missing a lot of men, we were missing a lot of police, fire, DPW, and I'm wondering, do we have any kind of strategy or thoughts on how to try to get a little bit more engagement from those areas in that survey?

241
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:53,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the real issue is the trust that people have.

242
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is very new, right?

243
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,822
[SPEAKER_09]: We're asking people to put something on paper.

244
00:46:00,282 --> 00:46:01,063
[SPEAKER_09]: What does it mean?

245
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:05,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you want and why do you need all this information?

246
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:21,515
[SPEAKER_09]: My hope is that now that we at least have some responses, it can be used to show that this is not information that is, you know, going to be harmful to you in any way.

247
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:26,497
[SPEAKER_09]: This is information that we can utilize so that we can become better.

248
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:31,480
[SPEAKER_09]: We can actually become what is known as a model employer.

249
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:42,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe every six months sending out the link as well as the option of utilizing the form could work.

250
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not really given much thought to that yet because my mind has gone to the build out already.

251
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:56,939
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that's an idea every six months, you know, a brief reminder.

252
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:10,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we will start to see an increase because it seems like newer employees who are more accustomed to forms such as these, right, are the ones that are completing the forms.

253
00:47:11,543 --> 00:47:21,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Continue to work on relationship management with the police department, with my fire department to see if I can increase

254
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:33,035
[SPEAKER_09]: on the responses, but it would be nice because I do believe that we are not at 1.8% for veterans.

255
00:47:33,956 --> 00:47:41,641
[SPEAKER_09]: We are higher than that because our veterans are primarily in our law enforcement and fire department.

256
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:43,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

257
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:43,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

258
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:45,684
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a thought that I had had as well.

259
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,726
[SPEAKER_15]: So great.

260
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further questions for Director Nwaje?

261
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:55,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, Frances, thank you so much.

262
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:57,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Much appreciated.

263
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:58,634
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

264
00:47:58,714 --> 00:47:59,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for your time.

265
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:00,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

266
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:01,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

267
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,501
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

268
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:07,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Next, we will take up HR Workers' Comp.

269
00:48:07,947 --> 00:48:08,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Barbara.

270
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:19,185
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get you out of here.

271
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Just really quickly, thanks for being here Director Crowley.

272
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:31,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Just going to go quickly through this we have HR and workers comp the budget for human resources fiscal 25 was 269 480.

273
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,752
[SPEAKER_15]: And for fiscal 26 it's proposed at 324 93 for an increase net increase of 51,013.

274
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,896
[SPEAKER_15]: which is pretty significant.

275
00:48:44,517 --> 00:48:46,357
[SPEAKER_15]: The main thing are some fixed cost growth.

276
00:48:46,397 --> 00:48:54,722
[SPEAKER_15]: There was an employee hired in fiscal 25, and the fiscal 25 budget was lower than the expected pay for that.

277
00:48:54,762 --> 00:49:01,285
[SPEAKER_15]: There were also COLA and step increases, and inflationary costs for office supplies and advertising and recruitment.

278
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:04,307
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a new expense called case management at $10,000.

279
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:10,790
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's explained as an amount that's added for various medical expenses for the city.

280
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:16,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we also have workers comp which is going up from 788,000 fiscal 25 to 928,000 fiscal 26 that's $140,000 or about 18%.

281
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,582
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that I will turn it over to you.

282
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:40,801
[SPEAKER_15]: to talk about the change in those two budgets, any other details you might want to share, talk about some of your accomplishments for the previous year, some goals for next year, and then what needs and priorities are not funded this year that we need to see funded in future years.

283
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:43,323
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, I'll turn it over to our HR director.

284
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:44,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Paz and Council.

285
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:46,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry if you can't hear me.

286
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm losing my voice.

287
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:50,109
[SPEAKER_15]: We might need to move you closer or move you further.

288
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:51,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Move me closer.

289
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

290
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the highlights.

291
00:49:54,833 --> 00:50:03,817
[SPEAKER_05]: for this past year where we were able to ratify five contracts with fire clerical, DPW, parking and traffic supervisors.

292
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:11,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was, so that we have done since last June or July.

293
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:16,403
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now currently working with the library and dispatches on renewing their contracts as well.

294
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:20,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a few more to go through the police and superiors.

295
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:26,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also established a master tracking for all employees which we didn't have prior to my arrival.

296
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:31,392
[SPEAKER_05]: We like to call it the Enzo project because we had an intern who started it with us.

297
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:32,412
[SPEAKER_05]: His name was Enzo.

298
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:36,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a lifetime tracking of all our current employees.

299
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:43,937
[SPEAKER_05]: from their steps to their start dates to when they get promoted, what their current position is.

300
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:49,159
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody asks how many clerical personnel do we have, we can take that in a snapshot.

301
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:57,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we've developed and we've been updating as we do any kind of changes for personnel for the HR office.

302
00:50:57,181 --> 00:50:59,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty exciting because we didn't have that data.

303
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:01,463
[SPEAKER_05]: before, so it's very helpful.

304
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:08,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We've created a new hire process, which we've been working on for about the past year.

305
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:25,912
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't really have anything that was streamlined or standardized beforehand, so we are working through that process, which is very helpful when we're posting and we're looking for qualified candidates where we're posting, how we're posting, working with the DEI director to make sure that we're trying to

306
00:51:26,972 --> 00:51:27,953
[SPEAKER_05]: cast a wider net.

307
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:34,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at how our job descriptions are labeled and looking for really the minimum requirements for the job.

308
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:42,122
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of our job descriptions were updated where they said you needed a master's degree, but really you may have not even needed a high school diploma.

309
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:49,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we limit or we expand what the education is beyond what the education is needed, we shorten that net.

310
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:56,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to cast a wide net and get the qualified people in for each position.

311
00:51:57,048 --> 00:52:02,369
[SPEAKER_05]: We have developed an internal process for updating our policies and procedures.

312
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:14,292
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a process where when we're developing, we talk with it up hot and as we work with the administration, most of the time we actually have to send them to the unions for their approval, give them 10 days to respond.

313
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:17,254
[SPEAKER_05]: so that we can come up with a comprehensive policy.

314
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been working on that.

315
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:23,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on updating our quarries every three years.

316
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,399
[SPEAKER_05]: That's by state and federal law.

317
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:33,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to update everybody's quarry, whether they're an employee, they're a part-time employee, a full-time employee, every three years.

318
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:36,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have it on a rotating schedule.

319
00:52:37,306 --> 00:52:40,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may see yourselves even in three years asking for a new quarry.

320
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:44,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also completed an I-9 audit.

321
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:53,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are really important because if we ever get audited by the government, the cost for just one wrong I-9 is very costly.

322
00:52:53,614 --> 00:52:59,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went through every single personnel file and they're kept separately.

323
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:06,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went through every file to make sure that every personnel in the city had an updated I-9 or actually had an I-9

324
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:08,215
[SPEAKER_05]: in the I-9 jacket.

325
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:17,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've implemented partnerships with JJ Keller, who is the safety training for our DPW employees.

326
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been hearing that employees like the training, they want the training, they want some professional development.

327
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:29,587
[SPEAKER_05]: So in last year's budget, the council had approved us updating that training, so that has been very helpful moving forward.

328
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:35,270
[SPEAKER_05]: We also partnered with Trolliant and they are doing our state and federal compliance training.

329
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,712
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very helpful because it's online and they can start and stop.

330
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:48,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So if police and fire are starting a training and they need to stop to go on a call or what have you, they can stop the training and pick up from where they left off and still get full credit when they complete.

331
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:55,322
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a back portion to that where I get notification when somebody hasn't completed their training.

332
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:59,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll send out a notification saying, you started the training on May 1st.

333
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:02,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It's May 15 you still haven't finished.

334
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:06,027
[SPEAKER_05]: What else you need we give them time, you know time restraints for that.

335
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:11,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's very helpful so that we know that everybody's completed the required trainings that they're they're supposed to be doing throughout the year.

336
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So goals for the HR department.

337
00:54:16,572 --> 00:54:19,693
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to develop a comprehensive employee handbook.

338
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,354
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a handbook.

339
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:24,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's outdated, and it's not complete.

340
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:25,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're working on that.

341
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:46,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on a newsletter that will come out every month, spotlighting various projects throughout the city, employees, 20 year employees, 10 year employees, giving them some information about the benefits that we offer, how they can link to different things like FMLA forms and workers comp forms and whatever they might need, and some

342
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:49,344
[SPEAKER_05]: educational training that we have linked to that.

343
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:53,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody really likes the training in the library, they can just do it at their own time.

344
00:54:54,107 --> 00:54:57,709
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want to, it's more voluntary than something that we're going to require them to do.

345
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:05,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And some trivia and some fun facts as we go along so that the first newsletter, I think, is set for June or July.

346
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:07,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

347
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:12,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We are also working on implementing, hopefully,

348
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:22,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kind of HR system that we can use that is more online to apply for a job instead of being so paper heavy.

349
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:24,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking into that as well.

350
00:55:25,748 --> 00:55:29,149
[SPEAKER_05]: more training for our department heads and our middle management.

351
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:45,813
[SPEAKER_05]: We are partnering with Adam Sutton Consulting, and they do half-day retreats with department heads, and they do, you know, education, and we find out where our weaknesses are, and then we kind of tie it together so that we can funnel that down through our employees.

352
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:53,552
[SPEAKER_05]: working closely now that we have our new solicitor, that our departments will work very closely together.

353
00:55:53,932 --> 00:56:08,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are just some of the ongoing projects we're trying to also make sure that when we ratify a CBA or a collective bargaining agreement that we get one agreement instead of having like four or five MOAs or side letters that everything's

354
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:18,550
[SPEAKER_05]: complete one place so that's pretty much where we're trying to go this year seems it's a lot of work it's not a lot of tasks, but it's a lot of work to each task.

355
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:26,254
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can get to the increases in the budget, excuse me, like you said, President Bears, most of it is personnel.

356
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:36,643
[SPEAKER_05]: We went from a full part-time to a full-time HR administrator, and some of those funds were upper funds last year, so we have to absorb the full cost of that position this year.

357
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:41,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, just market increases with advertising, supplies,

358
00:56:42,748 --> 00:56:43,769
[SPEAKER_05]: where we post.

359
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:51,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really just market increases, not much more increases to the budget, the HR budget.

360
00:56:51,557 --> 00:56:55,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, on the workers comp side, I'll probably talk about them together.

361
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:00,546
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bit harder to budget, right?

362
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:02,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we never know who's going to get hurt.

363
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:06,633
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with that is we also pay for the medicals.

364
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:08,755
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way to really budget it.

365
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:12,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of do like a three-year back look to see what it looked like.

366
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:17,502
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got here, it was under-budgeted by a lot.

367
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year I had to kind of bridge that gap.

368
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:23,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this year I'm trying to finish the bridge of that gap.

369
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:26,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really Worker's Comp.

370
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:30,012
[SPEAKER_05]: We pay about, right now we pay $8,335 a week

371
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,736
[SPEAKER_05]: and workers' comp payouts.

372
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:38,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's about $433,000 a year.

373
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just, you know, we can't really budget for when that will go.

374
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:48,947
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a couple of people on there that will be lifers, that will be on there for life.

375
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where the increase of the workers' comp into us as well.

376
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:56,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

377
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:57,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any questions?

378
00:57:58,614 --> 00:57:59,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

379
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for your presentation.

380
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:08,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they just clarify, you know, it's like one of my big sticking points is.

381
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:09,982
[SPEAKER_11]: ratifying contracts.

382
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:12,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that it's good to see that we're moving forward.

383
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:14,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the hard work, but I know that.

384
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:21,526
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's Medford, patrolmen, supervisors, library, dispatch, and building, correct?

385
00:58:21,586 --> 00:58:23,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Are those the last ones that we ratified?

386
00:58:23,886 --> 00:58:26,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Are these the ones that are still open?

387
00:58:26,147 --> 00:58:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Still open is superiors, police, inspectors.

388
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:35,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Dispatch is just up for renewal and libraries for renewal.

389
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:36,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're working on those as well.

390
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:36,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we getting close?

391
00:58:37,672 --> 00:58:38,612
[SPEAKER_05]: dispatching library.

392
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:39,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

393
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:39,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

394
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:41,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Other ones still have some time.

395
00:58:41,513 --> 00:58:42,433
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still working on that.

396
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:44,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I know some of them are in fact finding right now.

397
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:59,978
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that, you know, I work in a municipality next door, and I just saw what What neighbor community just offered their police department and with four year retro, and it's a lot of money.

398
00:59:00,398 --> 00:59:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So I

399
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:05,698
[SPEAKER_11]: be interesting to see how we can fund that.

400
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:08,681
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to be as fair as we can.

401
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:10,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Not easy.

402
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:11,504
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

403
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:27,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the other issue and concern that I've had for a long time is, and it might not fall with your department, but it'd be interesting to know, as we've had so many concerned issues with legal issues with

404
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:35,984
[SPEAKER_11]: grievances through our employees, not particularly anyone in personnel to keep it confidential.

405
00:59:38,105 --> 00:59:45,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a line here that does it come out of your department for arbitration costs, for attorney's fees?

406
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that comes out of the legal budget.

407
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:54,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm the one who handles them, but the results come out of the legal budget.

408
01:00:00,922 --> 01:00:02,423
[SPEAKER_11]: seems pretty substantial.

409
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:10,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So from what I've gotten for legal documents from union representation, and it's a lot of money.

410
01:00:10,927 --> 01:00:12,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of work.

411
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:28,937
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a I would hope we could find a way to tighten up these legalities in these, these battles that go back and forth with, I think losing and then appealing and then so it's something that

412
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:39,006
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when we look at good money leaving the city, I think that a lot of it has to do with fair labor practice and making sure that we're doing the right thing with our employees.

413
01:00:39,046 --> 01:00:43,909
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate your input, and I think that's important.

414
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:56,856
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that I'll keep asking as we move forward, because I think that if we look at many of the lines, and if we look to the actuals and month to month, and we see where monies are going, there's a lot of

415
01:00:58,537 --> 01:00:59,847
[SPEAKER_11]: legal departments that are getting.

416
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,734
[SPEAKER_11]: chunks of chunks of money throughout the community.

417
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:22,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though we did get a $7.5 million increase in an override and still have money in free cash, and even though that's supposedly not a lot of money, I guess we're still in fiscal constraints and supposedly in some dire funding needs.

418
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:29,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So be interesting to see where we can, as we move forward, where we can recover and what we can do better to make sure we're not using

419
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,441
[SPEAKER_11]: funds that don't need to be spent.

420
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:37,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I think building those relationships, we're starting to build relationships.

421
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:38,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

422
01:01:39,003 --> 01:01:41,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that the solicitor's office will be able to make those even stronger.

423
01:01:41,884 --> 01:01:42,304
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope so.

424
01:01:42,884 --> 01:01:43,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

425
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:43,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

426
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:45,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

427
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:46,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions?

428
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:52,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, I have a couple.

429
01:01:52,227 --> 01:01:56,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me a second here, get some feedback.

430
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:05,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you talk a little bit more about the case management line item?

431
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:05,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

432
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:17,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So the case management is, so when we're working with our workers' comp, sometimes we need investigations or nurses to work on the cases because the employees aren't being very responsive with their physicians.

433
01:02:18,604 --> 01:02:25,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of us just saying, okay, we'll wait for you to get your doctor's note, and they stay on long, we can hire a case manager who can actually

434
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:37,277
[SPEAKER_05]: not violate any HIPAA laws and actually go out and talk with the doctors to try to get their information so we can make sure that the employee is up on compensation is really doing what he's supposed to do to try to get back to work.

435
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

436
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:48,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Along those lines, do we expect a much smaller increase for workers' comp next year, or how much of the gap have we closed?

437
01:02:48,604 --> 01:02:52,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see workers' comp going

438
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:53,950
[SPEAKER_05]: down.

439
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping we can kind of level it off.

440
01:02:56,151 --> 01:03:00,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The school department has their own, so I'm not sure how their claims are going.

441
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:08,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But we seem to kind of find some kind of place right now where we don't see it moving too far.

442
01:03:09,758 --> 01:03:13,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody could get hurt tomorrow, and it could be catastrophic.

443
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really hard to judge.

444
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any way, I mean, this is supposed to be a form of insurance, right?

445
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:28,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, seems like we're paying a lot of money.

446
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:39,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're talking about like using their health insurance opposed to using their workers comp?

447
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:44,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in general, like their workers comp, like, you know, is there a better deal out there?

448
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:45,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we getting the best deal?

449
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:46,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean,

450
01:03:47,729 --> 01:03:55,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I think every time that you look at that and you go out and you try to bid, sometimes you can get more rates, but they're pretty standard across the board.

451
01:03:56,057 --> 01:04:06,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We just went from Metatrol who stopped working on the 111F to Future Comp, so that actually helped us save money because they were already working on our workers' comp side.

452
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:10,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So to bring in the 111F, there wasn't a lot of more

453
01:04:11,192 --> 01:04:14,675
[SPEAKER_05]: additives that they have, because they're already charging us to run the program.

454
01:04:14,695 --> 01:04:18,038
[SPEAKER_05]: So we actually saved a little money doing that and switch.

455
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:20,860
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the difference between 111F and the workers comps?

456
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:22,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So 111F will be police and fire.

457
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:24,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just chapter 111F.

458
01:04:24,704 --> 01:04:25,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

459
01:04:25,384 --> 01:04:25,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

460
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:25,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

461
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:26,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

462
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:26,806
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

463
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:27,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Workers comp on the city.

464
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:29,688
[SPEAKER_15]: So now it's everyone in the city is on the same.

465
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:30,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

466
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,210
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

467
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:33,311
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

468
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:34,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Two more things, just in general.

469
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:41,348
[SPEAKER_15]: seems like we've been able to fill more open positions than over the previous years.

470
01:04:41,368 --> 01:04:42,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want to talk about that.

471
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:43,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.

472
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:49,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, with the help of now another full-time staff member, that's really been helpful.

473
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had the numbers here somewhere.

474
01:04:52,230 --> 01:05:02,252
[SPEAKER_05]: We've brought on about 32 professional staff, including department heads, and maybe about 20 to 30 new police officers and firefighters.

475
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:09,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just putting 13, 12 now, possibly 13 firefighters into the academy over the summer.

476
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:14,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be increasing those numbers by 13, and we have a few coming out of the police academy.

477
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of the extra staff, we're able to turn that over much quicker.

478
01:05:20,461 --> 01:05:21,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

479
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:23,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

480
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:27,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Last question, classification and compensation study.

481
01:05:27,644 --> 01:05:28,845
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the progress on that?

482
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And when are we going to be able to implement it?

483
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:45,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So the project actually started, I think, before I started, and it started out as the city trying to find out if they had any outliers of somebody who's really underpaid or within the comparable cities.

484
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:51,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Preliminary numbers that proposed that have come in as methods kind of right in the middle.

485
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not on the upper high, we're not on the low, we're kind of in the middle.

486
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:54,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So

487
01:05:54,727 --> 01:06:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: which was really good for us, that we found that we don't have a lot of people that are underpaid, even though we have people complaining that they're underpaid.

488
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:04,992
[SPEAKER_05]: The study shows that we're pretty much in the middle.

489
01:06:05,072 --> 01:06:16,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that information, now we have to really solidify the job descriptions because you can't look at a compensation study after that until you know what the job descriptions are.

490
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of us are from the 80s.

491
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:20,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're bringing those up to date.

492
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done the employee questionnaire

493
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:31,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, the employees have reviewed their job descriptions, the department heads have reviewed what the employees say they do, opposed to what they are actually supposed to do.

494
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:37,555
[SPEAKER_05]: We did an administrator review, myself and Nina reviewed all of them as well.

495
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: They went out to the comp and class, which is call-in center, and they drafted.

496
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:47,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we have final drafts for us to do a final review on for the job descriptions.

497
01:06:48,568 --> 01:06:51,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we get that finalized, we're hoping to have that done by September.

498
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:52,970
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of work.

499
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:56,971
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like we did 125 titles, I believe.

500
01:06:57,732 --> 01:07:04,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to send them out to the unions, because now the union employee or union position, I should say, not employee.

501
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:09,436
[SPEAKER_05]: The unions now have to look at it, give their comments, see if they agree with it.

502
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we get that back.

503
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at them, see if we agree with what the union said, send it back to the Collins Center.

504
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to revamp it and send it back to us for a final review.

505
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:23,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully in September, we'll have some more information on where we are.

506
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a long process.

507
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:32,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it's been a long process, but I think it started, then it stopped for a little while because there was nobody in the office to run it.

508
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I came in just about two years ago,

509
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:39,175
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my second initiative to get it started.

510
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:46,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And so although it seems like it's been going for a very long time, it was a big chunk of time where nothing was happening because there was nobody to manage it.

511
01:07:47,736 --> 01:07:48,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

512
01:07:48,336 --> 01:07:48,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.

513
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:56,438
[SPEAKER_15]: In a final report, will we be able to see both the compensation elements as well as the new job descriptions?

514
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:58,038
[SPEAKER_15]: And that will be available to us.

515
01:07:58,839 --> 01:07:59,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

516
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,160
[SPEAKER_15]: And it sounds like if we're really lucky, January?

517
01:08:06,172 --> 01:08:06,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

518
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:14,239
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put me before Frances next year, because her presentations are amazing, and I'm tired of following them.

519
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone's jockeying for position in these.

520
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:18,483
[SPEAKER_15]: I've already disappointed Barbara.

521
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:24,488
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I don't even want to know what happened with Richly.

522
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:26,650
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, thank you.

523
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,152
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I appreciate the hard work.

524
01:08:28,752 --> 01:08:31,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further questions on our HR or worker's comments?

525
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, thank you very much.

526
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:37,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, have a good evening.

527
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:40,312
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, library.

528
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:50,975
[SPEAKER_15]: We have director Barbara Kerr and we have Grace David from our trustees here and maybe lost a trustee.

529
01:08:51,936 --> 01:08:52,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry about that.

530
01:08:52,736 --> 01:08:54,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Bonnie had to go to the band concert at school.

531
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,997
[SPEAKER_15]: We gained one, we lost one.

532
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:02,599
[SPEAKER_04]: John Grace Caldara who are two of my five.

533
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:04,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

534
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:05,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm turning you down.

535
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:07,286
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a way up for Lisa.

536
01:09:07,486 --> 01:09:08,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so you'll be good.

537
01:09:08,806 --> 01:09:09,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new system.

538
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:10,827
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

539
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:13,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I have stats.

540
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:19,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first I need to read.

541
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:21,372
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to hear the stats.

542
01:09:21,412 --> 01:09:22,273
[SPEAKER_15]: We love the stats.

543
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:25,835
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I have what I have here.

544
01:09:26,115 --> 01:09:26,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrighty.

545
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:29,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Library, Medford Public Library.

546
01:09:29,494 --> 01:09:33,636
[SPEAKER_15]: We had from the general fund, subsidy general fund, fiscal 25, $2,247,934.

547
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:35,936
[SPEAKER_15]: We're looking at for fiscal 26, $2,324,029 for an increase of $76,095 or about 3%.

548
01:09:36,016 --> 01:09:36,417
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have there,

549
01:09:51,608 --> 01:10:03,776
[SPEAKER_15]: an increase of one position, it looks like, which is good, although I'm sure you'll tell me maybe that that's not coming from the general fund at all, or maybe it's a typo, I see.

550
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,938
[SPEAKER_15]: What position is it?

551
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:10,841
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a professional assistant, it says, that we're going from 14 to 15.

552
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Seems no one knows about that except for what's on the sheet.

553
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,456
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can come back to that.

554
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:24,938
[SPEAKER_15]: But as I said, there's a net increase of 76,095.

555
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:47,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of this is in our fixed cost growth, the vast majority, with step raises and COLA increases for permanent employees, an increase in rates for part-time employees, longevity and a sick leave buyback estimate for fiscal 26 retirements, contracted services increase for some stormable landscaping and other service costs.

556
01:10:48,590 --> 01:11:03,666
[SPEAKER_15]: increase in the price of office supplies, increase in the price of cleaning supplies, an increase for the audiovisual budget, physical media being in high demand, and AV costs being cut last year or reduced from the initial proposal last year, $5,000 increase,

557
01:11:05,988 --> 01:11:18,397
[SPEAKER_15]: for library books and periodicals, and then there's one new expense, continuing education, the PLA convention in 2026, the big national conference for public libraries, multiple staff are attending, so there's more expense.

558
01:11:19,377 --> 01:11:24,201
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, we have Director Kerr with us, and we're going to be

559
01:11:25,607 --> 01:11:38,436
[SPEAKER_15]: The prompt is just three things, talking about your budget and what the change was, two, talking about accomplishments for the last year, goals for next year, and three, what are key needs and priorities that you'd like to see funded that we weren't able to fund this year?

560
01:11:38,696 --> 01:11:41,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nina and I are still working on a couple of personnel things.

561
01:11:42,118 --> 01:11:42,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

562
01:11:42,859 --> 01:11:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a children's department position that's been vacant for a couple of years, so we're trying to make that work.

563
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:57,671
[SPEAKER_04]: We would also very much like to get the hourly part time rates to the equivalent of the same full time jobs.

564
01:11:58,151 --> 01:11:59,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to happen this year.

565
01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:06,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to get a small increase, but that's sort of my long term collaborative maybe we could all work on it because

566
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, we have somebody who she works for us for $19 an hour.

567
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:13,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And when she substitutes at Winchester, she gets 35.

568
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much the way it is across the board.

569
01:12:17,644 --> 01:12:20,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Our part-time salary rates are very low.

570
01:12:20,946 --> 01:12:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're a revolving door.

571
01:12:22,206 --> 01:12:23,627
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been through so many people.

572
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:27,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, why would you stay here if you go to Winchester?

573
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:28,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's more fun here.

574
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:35,092
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think they're, in order to work for us full-time, part-time,

575
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:41,538
[SPEAKER_04]: you have three part-time jobs, or you have somebody at home who's paying the bills.

576
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we don't keep people forever.

577
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:46,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something we would very much like to work on.

578
01:12:48,283 --> 01:12:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: To get that to happen would be a very substantial increase.

579
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:54,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this year is going to be a smaller one, which we're working on.

580
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:55,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully that will work.

581
01:12:55,749 --> 01:12:57,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're also working on the children's position.

582
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

583
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other stuff, pretty much everything we asked for in our expenses we got, which was terrific.

584
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:09,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want the stats now?

585
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the stats.

586
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:10,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.

587
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:11,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how do we do it?

588
01:13:11,377 --> 01:13:12,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are crazy busy.

589
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:16,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are 370 libraries in Massachusetts.

590
01:13:16,762 --> 01:13:22,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were 18th in terms of circulation, 13th in total programs.

591
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:28,113
[SPEAKER_04]: 8th in teen programs, although they tell me they're actually 7th because Bellingham cheated.

592
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:34,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they were counting attendance at a drop-in afternoon, which is just wrong.

593
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:41,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And then 9th in children's programming for ages 0 to 5, and 23rd for programming for ages 6 to 11.

594
01:13:42,446 --> 01:13:46,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had 860 programs last year with an attendance of 16,000.

595
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are very busy.

596
01:13:50,977 --> 01:13:52,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a very good year.

597
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:57,802
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a Cummings grant that is actually funding two people for the Makerspace.

598
01:13:58,002 --> 01:14:00,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Makerspace programming has tripled since they started.

599
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:07,449
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a bit compulsive, so it should really only be doubled, but they want to do everything now.

600
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:12,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're also able to do a part-time programming librarian from that grant.

601
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:21,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been very good too, because with all those programs you need somebody to expedite to manage things and do the scheduling and the publicity.

602
01:14:22,812 --> 01:14:28,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And this year we also started 55 plus programming, we have a senior advisory board who

603
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: They heckle each other a lot.

604
01:14:31,854 --> 01:14:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: They have monthly meetings, but they come up with program ideas and then we work the staff works with them to fit in great here.

605
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:43,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I am a senior, I appreciate the heckling.

606
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:47,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to mention that I'm planning to retire next April.

607
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:50,800
[SPEAKER_04]: This might actually be my last budget hearing.

608
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,741
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to lead with that.

609
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:53,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time.

610
01:14:54,002 --> 01:14:57,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was going to but I got so excited.

611
01:14:57,764 --> 01:15:00,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Too excited about all the great things you're doing.

612
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:03,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We had 202,000 people come into the building last year.

613
01:15:03,387 --> 01:15:03,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

614
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The fairytale ball is coming up in a couple of weeks, and that's usually 700 people, most of them under the age of 10.

615
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I got strep two years ago.

616
01:15:14,282 --> 01:15:15,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping not.

617
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm planning not to this year, but I said I wouldn't go last year because I didn't want to get sick, so I will be braver this year.

618
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:25,205
[SPEAKER_04]: What are other things?

619
01:15:25,225 --> 01:15:25,345
[SPEAKER_04]: 55 plus.

620
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Youth services is trying to do a lot more outreach, so we've added some part time people so they are doing a couple of them go once a month to after school programs and Nicole who is the head of youth services has a deal with the librarian at the high school which is great she goes and she presents to every single class at the high school.

621
01:15:47,408 --> 01:15:48,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And they like us.

622
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:53,429
[SPEAKER_04]: She had teen trivia night Friday, and apparently all the sixth grader boys came.

623
01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:57,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very loud, and they all sang along to things.

624
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:00,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's good that they want to be there.

625
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that there are fewer early release days, everybody's much calmer, because that was interesting.

626
01:16:05,932 --> 01:16:06,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

627
01:16:08,872 --> 01:16:13,113
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I took out my dinner.

628
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:16,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so we also got a Bloomberg digital, what is it?

629
01:16:17,013 --> 01:16:19,874
[SPEAKER_04]: digital innovation grant for $200,000.

630
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:33,337
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, we're going to be digitizing a large portion of the local history collection, which is terrific, because right now, in order to do research, you have to go in there and handle everything.

631
01:16:33,397 --> 01:16:34,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is good.

632
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,398
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard you took my microfilm.

633
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, your microfilm is actually in boxes in the back hallway, but it's going out today.

634
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll be able to do it from home in a few months.

635
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:43,800
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it'll be great.

636
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,220
[SPEAKER_15]: You remember, yeah.

637
01:16:45,498 --> 01:16:51,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're taking the microfilm, the yearbooks, a lot of the town reports, the lists of persons.

638
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:52,961
[SPEAKER_15]: The budgets, please.

639
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:53,761
[SPEAKER_15]: The budgets.

640
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:55,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the budgets are in there.

641
01:16:55,322 --> 01:16:59,664
[SPEAKER_04]: The budgets and some of the real older, delicate stuff that is unique.

642
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:01,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's great.

643
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:02,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Will the maps go too?

644
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:08,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this time, but we're going to keep digitizing stuff.

645
01:17:09,646 --> 01:17:11,288
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the maps are online anyway.

646
01:17:11,588 --> 01:17:12,889
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in various places.

647
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:14,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But check our website.

648
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,371
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a map section.

649
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:17,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's been good.

650
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:20,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the stuff has got off to be scanned.

651
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:32,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the meantime, they're going to build a, they call it, it's called the DAM, which is a digital asset management platform, which is good when you're getting aggravated.

652
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:34,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You can swear at trustee meetings.

653
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:37,164
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

654
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:42,929
[SPEAKER_04]: ESOL, we started having, we did citizenship classes and we funded an ESOL class last year.

655
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,450
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that again this year.

656
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:51,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also hosting two or three, like a city class, English at Large and the Welcome Project.

657
01:17:52,196 --> 01:17:54,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've added a lot of the foundation

658
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:58,470
[SPEAKER_04]: has given us some funding for foreign language books.

659
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And the teens, they've added a lot of books in other languages in teen.

660
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:06,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was there one day when the eighth graders were there, and the teacher saying, you have to take a book.

661
01:18:07,378 --> 01:18:10,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the kids took it, and the librarian checked it on.

662
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:12,122
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, you know, this isn't Portuguese.

663
01:18:12,142 --> 01:18:14,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, whatever, went out the door.

664
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:15,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

665
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:19,213
[SPEAKER_04]: 55 plus.

666
01:18:19,253 --> 01:18:20,553
[SPEAKER_04]: We also got a coming to rent.

667
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:21,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say that?

668
01:18:21,254 --> 01:18:23,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, coming to rent with the Makerspace.

669
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:27,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Makerspace programming, it's great.

670
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:31,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are getting really good attendance at everything.

671
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:34,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's pretty much.

672
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:39,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So next year, we're going to continue with all of this stuff.

673
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:43,648
[SPEAKER_04]: But the long term is the hourly part-time rate, if we can get that to.

674
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:52,416
[SPEAKER_04]: to a level equivalent with other libraries, I think we'd have more luck getting qualified people and maintaining them.

675
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:54,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

676
01:18:56,802 --> 01:18:58,823
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see everyone, you're all here on my board.

677
01:19:01,263 --> 01:19:14,688
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say before we hear questions from councillors that it may be your last budget meeting, but we will have you back before you retire to celebrate the incredible work that you've done.

678
01:19:15,508 --> 01:19:16,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bring more statistics.

679
01:19:17,089 --> 01:19:17,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

680
01:19:18,669 --> 01:19:19,389
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love to hear.

681
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:26,871
[SPEAKER_04]: bring the young ones on the staff and get them to act them out or something.

682
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:48,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking you could do a story for for every year of the decades of service that you devoted to the city and our community or something you know maybe not every year but that might be too too in depth too much work we know everyone's very busy up there but mostly I was saying that to say that you've devoted your life to this library and it's thriving and

683
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Thousands of people are deeply appreciative of that.

684
01:19:53,094 --> 01:19:53,675
[SPEAKER_15]: So we will.

685
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:55,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought we would be this good.

686
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:59,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew we had the potential, but it's really rewarding.

687
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:02,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to you and your team.

688
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:06,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have no hobbies.

689
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,044
[SPEAKER_15]: You've given a lot to the city, so we will celebrate you.

690
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:12,986
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll be back here, and you won't have to do a presentation for money.

691
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:14,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless I want to.

692
01:20:14,587 --> 01:20:15,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you want to.

693
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:19,110
[SPEAKER_15]: You can write your own ticket.

694
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:25,116
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lazzaro.

695
01:20:26,437 --> 01:20:27,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for being here.

696
01:20:27,318 --> 01:20:27,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have

697
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,723
[SPEAKER_08]: an opportunity to join one of the trustees meetings.

698
01:20:33,123 --> 01:20:39,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And you did mention the request for an increase in the hourly pay.

699
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm frustrated because it's not that much.

700
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:46,075
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't cost that much compared with the rest of the city's budget.

701
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:53,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is a hard time for all of us, but I am hopeful in the future that this can be something that we remedy.

702
01:20:54,798 --> 01:21:10,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very basic and it does have lasting impacts because when people move on quickly, it costs a lot to train new people and that impact can be felt.

703
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:17,278
[SPEAKER_08]: We might as well keep the people that we have, that we know are good, that you've invested in and you've trained.

704
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:20,601
[SPEAKER_08]: The library is such a gem in town.

705
01:21:22,604 --> 01:21:23,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a big fan.

706
01:21:23,705 --> 01:21:24,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I use it a lot.

707
01:21:24,926 --> 01:21:35,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for still having the diary of a wimpy kid book number question mark in my home.

708
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:37,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of my kids has it in their backpack.

709
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:40,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going fine free July 1st.

710
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:40,935
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's great.

711
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:42,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great for me.

712
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:43,116
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great for my kids.

713
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:46,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay up.

714
01:21:47,217 --> 01:21:49,478
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think this is something that we should be able to accomplish.

715
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:51,699
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a big lift.

716
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:53,860
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for advocating for that.

717
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we can continue to put it in our requests as a council.

718
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:03,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we've put in our requests as a council, fully fund the library and all of their requests consistently.

719
01:22:04,444 --> 01:22:05,344
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll continue to do that.

720
01:22:05,424 --> 01:22:07,405
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, we can keep beating that drum.

721
01:22:07,996 --> 01:22:09,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will, Bob.

722
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:09,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

723
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:11,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

724
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

725
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:18,365
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just hoping, I know you're excited about statistics.

726
01:22:18,385 --> 01:22:18,965
[SPEAKER_16]: You brought them here.

727
01:22:19,025 --> 01:22:20,366
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to bring them up next time.

728
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,628
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm so excited.

729
01:22:21,668 --> 01:22:27,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping that you can maybe just email the clerk, and then he can forward some of those to us.

730
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:29,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the ones you mentioned today.

731
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't go to any extra trouble.

732
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:32,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I can send you a comprehensive thing.

733
01:22:32,798 --> 01:22:34,800
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a state report that has everything.

734
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can send that out.

735
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:39,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I especially like the rankings and the program it provides.

736
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:44,468
[SPEAKER_16]: the part-time pay as compared to Winchester and if you have anybody else to compare to.

737
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:51,615
[SPEAKER_16]: And I really would like you to include the fact that people work for us because we are more fun than other cities.

738
01:22:51,635 --> 01:22:52,776
[SPEAKER_16]: This is my theory.

739
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:55,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

740
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you Councilor Callahan.

741
01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:00,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Tseng.

742
01:23:01,783 --> 01:23:03,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Council President.

743
01:23:03,705 --> 01:23:04,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Barbara.

744
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:09,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gonna say if you have another year maybe you can work on your Sunday disposition.

745
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:10,751
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just terrible.

746
01:23:12,672 --> 01:23:13,353
[SPEAKER_11]: So angry.

747
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:16,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, don't you just want to get up and hug you I just I

748
01:23:18,137 --> 01:23:19,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I so appreciate you.

749
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:25,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, like Councilor Lazzaro said, have a book from 1982, The Outsiders.

750
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Good choice.

751
01:23:27,342 --> 01:23:29,143
[SPEAKER_15]: We're expecting to get back a lot closer.

752
01:23:29,163 --> 01:23:32,404
[SPEAKER_15]: We can fund the part-time employees with this.

753
01:23:34,085 --> 01:23:37,027
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a maximum fine, which nobody knows about, so.

754
01:23:37,607 --> 01:23:39,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a few, just one question.

755
01:23:39,308 --> 01:23:44,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that one of the biggest things we always, we were nervous about as we built this new library and how we're going to maintain it.

756
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:46,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sounds like,

757
01:23:46,705 --> 01:23:49,607
[SPEAKER_11]: you're doing an amazing job, and the team's doing an amazing job.

758
01:23:49,727 --> 01:23:57,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you see anything that, especially, I appreciate Mr. Riggi now, and him being active and involved.

759
01:23:57,653 --> 01:24:05,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we see that that's being up at the library, the plant itself is being kept to its standards?

760
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it helps having a young custodian who's tall.

761
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:14,766
[SPEAKER_04]: When we moved in, we had Fred, who was a lovely man,

762
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:17,618
[SPEAKER_04]: had a lot of health issues.

763
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter's Peter's a bundle of energy.

764
01:24:20,342 --> 01:24:23,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So he paints and he cleans and he keeps track of stuff.

765
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:27,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And he fights with different vendors.

766
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:29,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's good, actually.

767
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:34,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And then part of the deal with Bloomberg was the creation of a maintenance plan.

768
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:35,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So

769
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:37,933
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very complicated.

770
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,235
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who works for the foundation is doing it.

771
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:41,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have that.

772
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:45,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's very helpful, because it's got a lot of information and recommendations.

773
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the building's in good shape.

774
01:24:48,562 --> 01:24:51,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And solar, that's still up there?

775
01:24:51,965 --> 01:24:53,906
[SPEAKER_04]: We are genuinely net zero.

776
01:24:54,186 --> 01:24:54,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

777
01:24:54,647 --> 01:24:55,608
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great sign.

778
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:56,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We're one of only nine.

779
01:24:56,608 --> 01:25:01,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We were actually featured in American Libraries this year in that they had an energy issue.

780
01:25:01,272 --> 01:25:01,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Solar's amazing.

781
01:25:03,114 --> 01:25:04,655
[SPEAKER_11]: So on a serious note, though,

782
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:15,485
[SPEAKER_11]: On a more serious note, we often sit up here at city councils and thank people that have left us and we can't celebrate them while they're here.

783
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:28,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that this council would work with the mayor and administration that the day you leave your position, you know, you're not leaving our Method Public Library, that we have something named after you.

784
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:47,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope through as we move forward and that there is something that the name Barbara Kerr is never forgotten when people look up and say hey who's Barbara Kerr, because I remember the real thin times and you kept things going when things are really bad.

785
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:54,874
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear horror stories now and, you know, we stick our chests out when you hear what's going on in Stoneham and you feel so bad.

786
01:25:55,415 --> 01:25:59,099
[SPEAKER_11]: But even through the toughest times, you've always kept us above ground.

787
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:03,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we can never forget that because no matter what, I mean, my kids,

788
01:26:04,843 --> 01:26:13,667
[SPEAKER_11]: if it wasn't for the method public library, and they're 22 and 19 now, and they spent every single week in the library from their most precious years.

789
01:26:14,228 --> 01:26:20,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And personally, as a father, I can't thank you enough and for fathers and mothers all over the city than what you've done for them.

790
01:26:20,531 --> 01:26:22,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't thank you enough.

791
01:26:22,812 --> 01:26:24,693
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and I will hope that

792
01:26:25,148 --> 01:26:36,665
[SPEAKER_11]: my colleagues join me when it's time and that we do find something that speaks to what you've done for us here in Medford and the Medford Public Library.

793
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:37,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for everything.

794
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

795
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:44,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Charlton William Bloomberg, Barbara Kerr, Metro Public Library.

796
01:26:45,442 --> 01:26:46,062
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

797
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:48,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, get a really big stuffed animal.

798
01:26:48,423 --> 01:26:50,744
[SPEAKER_12]: I would ask you to put Barbara Kerr first.

799
01:26:50,824 --> 01:26:51,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:52,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

801
01:26:52,185 --> 01:26:52,505
[SPEAKER_15]: That's me.

802
01:26:52,585 --> 01:26:54,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, money isn't everything, Bob.

803
01:26:55,326 --> 01:26:59,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe it is, but... Councilor Tseng.

804
01:26:59,888 --> 01:27:08,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Director Kerr, I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work and dedication to making our library run and tick every single day.

805
01:27:08,572 --> 01:27:08,772
[SPEAKER_12]: I know

806
01:27:09,772 --> 01:27:11,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of parents using the library here.

807
01:27:11,753 --> 01:27:14,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm using it as a young adult here.

808
01:27:15,594 --> 01:27:18,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And it truly is a gem in Medford Square.

809
01:27:18,635 --> 01:27:24,357
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that a lot of out-of-town residents come to me and say, oh, did you guys know about your library?

810
01:27:25,818 --> 01:27:26,738
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, of course I know.

811
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:27,779
[SPEAKER_12]: I know about the library.

812
01:27:27,799 --> 01:27:32,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's a lot to be said.

813
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Because even though we got this brand new library,

814
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,727
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember how much work you put in to meet with us.

815
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:51,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember meetings with me and Zach in previous years, really making sure that we're not just level funding the library and really trying to improve funding for the library.

816
01:27:52,513 --> 01:27:56,695
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know as we talked about with hourly wages and stuff like that, there's still ways to go.

817
01:27:57,756 --> 01:28:04,840
[SPEAKER_12]: But I wanted to thank you for your hard fought advocacy for the library to get into a good position.

818
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:11,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And for you to know that we will always have your back on the side of the rail as well.

819
01:28:12,743 --> 01:28:17,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And be it planning for the future with increasing pay.

820
01:28:19,405 --> 01:28:31,649
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of residents are clamoring about trying to get extra service on Sundays, which I know you've talked to us about, which you can feel free to address people watching at home if you want to about that point.

821
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,686
[SPEAKER_12]: We've traditionally had a tight budget.

822
01:28:39,066 --> 01:28:41,708
[SPEAKER_12]: We still have, you know, some of that tightness this year.

823
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:48,593
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I think a lot of the work has to be done planning long term into the future.

824
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:51,855
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you're helping a lot with setting that groundwork.

825
01:28:52,236 --> 01:28:52,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

826
01:28:53,136 --> 01:28:57,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And I should mention, I have a really good staff, not that I haven't always, I haven't always, but

827
01:28:58,227 --> 01:29:20,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they're a good bunch, who are probably not watching this, so don't tell them I said that, but they're really very invested in doing a good job, and they love the teens, which, you know, somebody has to, which is what she says to me sometimes.

828
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:29,641
[SPEAKER_04]: That got recorded and now it's going down in history.

829
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:31,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Not just recorded, it's broadcast.

830
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:34,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really... I like teens.

831
01:29:35,222 --> 01:29:45,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't read it, but we are streaming on channel 22, channel 43, YouTube and medfordtv.org.

832
01:29:46,225 --> 01:29:49,946
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can join by Zoom if you'd like.

833
01:29:50,146 --> 01:29:53,487
[SPEAKER_15]: You can even call in and if you'd like to submit written comments, you can email.

834
01:29:54,886 --> 01:30:00,268
[SPEAKER_15]: a her to be set mentor dash ma.gov and he'll forward them along.

835
01:30:00,288 --> 01:30:11,271
[SPEAKER_15]: At least it's a funny last meeting.

836
01:30:13,272 --> 01:30:13,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

837
01:30:13,852 --> 01:30:15,313
[SPEAKER_02]: We love a candid testimony.

838
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here.

839
01:30:19,233 --> 01:30:24,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I always appreciate your budget presentations and the overall update on how the library department is doing.

840
01:30:24,056 --> 01:30:27,299
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't have a lot of questions on your proposal.

841
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:40,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very comprehensive, mostly just want to, especially if this is the last time you're formally giving a budget presentation to the council, which I'm pretty sure you need a two thirds majority vote of the city council to retire, if I'm not mistaken.

842
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:42,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see about that.

843
01:30:43,391 --> 01:30:45,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But would be remiss, yeah.

844
01:30:46,247 --> 01:30:47,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're all putting resolutions on the agenda.

845
01:30:48,848 --> 01:30:58,534
[SPEAKER_02]: But would be remiss not to take the opportunity to thank you for your extremely impactful hard work on behalf of our library.

846
01:30:58,574 --> 01:31:00,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is incredible.

847
01:31:00,615 --> 01:31:03,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been going there a lot lately.

848
01:31:03,696 --> 01:31:06,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the printers quite often for work and other projects.

849
01:31:06,698 --> 01:31:12,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I always admire seeing how many people, how many types of people are using the library any random time that I go in there.

850
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a testament to

851
01:31:15,723 --> 01:31:23,588
[SPEAKER_02]: the service that we are able to provide to our community because of the work that you and your team have done over so many years to grow this library into what it is today.

852
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:36,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that as we go forward into the future, the administration and future city councils will remain in partnership with the library department so that we can continue that kind of really bold master planning to

853
01:31:38,407 --> 01:31:40,568
[SPEAKER_02]: see what our next really big strides for the library are.

854
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:44,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Having it open seven days a week, I think is top of everybody's list.

855
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:52,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to continue letting our public library be a model for other community libraries throughout the region.

856
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:55,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Always appreciate your advocacy for your staff.

857
01:31:55,994 --> 01:31:56,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a great staff.

858
01:31:56,874 --> 01:31:57,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an incredible staff.

859
01:31:57,734 --> 01:31:59,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody there is so friendly, so helpful.

860
01:32:00,335 --> 01:32:03,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that really resonates with everybody who is a patron there.

861
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:13,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you and your team are always trying to advocate to make sure that our compensation that we enable for library staff is as competitive as could be.

862
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:25,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised to hear that it seems that a lot of people work at Medford Public Library, because it's a wonderful place to work and I know that we're always trying hard to make sure that they are also

863
01:32:26,706 --> 01:32:34,827
[SPEAKER_02]: duly compensated competitively for the very, very competitive leader level work that you and everybody else on the team is doing.

864
01:32:34,887 --> 01:32:42,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that we'll remain in partnership to make sure that that is getting better year over year, as well as overall library services are getting better year over year as well.

865
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:45,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So just thank you so much.

866
01:32:45,429 --> 01:32:45,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

867
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:46,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds corny.

868
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like I'm exaggerating.

869
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:50,350
[SPEAKER_02]: But every time I go in there, I'm like, wow, this is our library.

870
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:51,470
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.

871
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:52,631
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are awesome.

872
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:54,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

873
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:56,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out good.

874
01:32:56,912 --> 01:32:59,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was going to, but you know.

875
01:33:00,395 --> 01:33:00,935
[SPEAKER_15]: You did all right.

876
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:01,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

877
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:06,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, we had a design for the front desk that had a lion that ate you if you had overdues.

878
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:12,503
[SPEAKER_04]: But the very serious woman from library commissioner said, don't do novelty things.

879
01:33:12,924 --> 01:33:14,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And she thought we were serious.

880
01:33:14,825 --> 01:33:16,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best part of it.

881
01:33:18,628 --> 01:33:24,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any more questions for Director Kerr?

882
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,062
[SPEAKER_15]: We've seen them from the Council.

883
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:28,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any from members of the public?

884
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:32,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Or would the trustees like to say that we have a trustee coming up?

885
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:40,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only spoken here versus Zoom once.

886
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:42,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Grace Caldera, trustee.

887
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:49,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't thank Barbara enough for everything that she's done with the library, and it's been an honor to work with her.

888
01:33:50,406 --> 01:33:54,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just up here to sort of reiterate some points, which you all also know.

889
01:33:56,728 --> 01:34:02,209
[SPEAKER_07]: The Head of Children's has been vacant, and it is one of the most trafficked areas.

890
01:34:03,249 --> 01:34:05,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the department is,

891
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:12,486
[SPEAKER_07]: busy all the time and you see nannies and you see families using it.

892
01:34:12,506 --> 01:34:21,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really does require someone who's dedicated to watch over it and to continue to plan programs.

893
01:34:21,492 --> 01:34:24,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're already ranked ninth in children's.

894
01:34:24,594 --> 01:34:25,154
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be really awesome.

895
01:34:25,194 --> 01:34:29,557
[SPEAKER_07]: to see that go up and what we can do when you have somebody fully dedicated to that department.

896
01:34:30,018 --> 01:34:40,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're still in talks with the city about that, but wanted to reiterate that one, as well as circling back with the part-time pay.

897
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:43,247
[SPEAKER_07]: These are librarians.

898
01:34:43,328 --> 01:34:44,869
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a master's degree.

899
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:50,613
[SPEAKER_07]: they are doing the same work as the full-time librarians.

900
01:34:51,174 --> 01:35:15,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I know it is in the long-term plan, but definitely something that I think we should continue to work to get there and closer and stay competitive to keep staff here to allow us to hire people quicker and not take so much time going through retraining people over and over again for these positions.

901
01:35:16,898 --> 01:35:19,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also want to flag in all of this.

902
01:35:19,318 --> 01:35:26,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Barbara sort of just mentioned we have two people who are a couple of people who are grant funded right now.

903
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:44,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And so while they're covered by the grant, it is something to think about what that would take to move them over to the city budget and start planning for that future so that those programs and what they run, especially in the maker space can continue going forward.

904
01:35:46,562 --> 01:35:47,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you, Grace.

905
01:35:47,423 --> 01:35:54,072
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, seeing no further questions or comments on the library.

906
01:35:54,132 --> 01:35:54,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, David's coming up.

907
01:35:54,893 --> 01:35:55,153
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

908
01:35:58,217 --> 01:35:58,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

909
01:35:59,975 --> 01:36:04,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is David Cha, 14 Holton Street, and I am the chair of the trustees.

910
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:08,221
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I want to thank all of your support.

911
01:36:08,682 --> 01:36:15,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we've been very happy in the past with your support, and we hope that it will continue.

912
01:36:15,947 --> 01:36:24,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put, you know, when you talk about thousands and tens of thousands and even millions of dollars, it's,

913
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:42,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got a million dollars in your pocket, but just to give you a better sense, and for the public, when you talk to the public about how much the budget allocation for the library is, 2.32 million.

914
01:36:42,648 --> 01:36:47,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically about $8 per household per month.

915
01:36:48,951 --> 01:36:51,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you walk into the library,

916
01:36:53,229 --> 01:37:07,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is free, and I'll just give you a very specific example, it just happens, I'm also on the board of an a cappella choir, and we had a concert there on Sunday, Saturday night, we charge $25 per ticket in another setting.

917
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:18,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday, it was free, because that's part of the package of going, having a program in the library.

918
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:24,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was roughly 50 people who were not paying 20 to $25 ticket.

919
01:37:24,468 --> 01:37:31,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's over $1,000 that Medford people did not have to spend to go to that concert.

920
01:37:31,792 --> 01:37:37,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just one example of, you know, the over 400 programs, all free.

921
01:37:37,955 --> 01:37:38,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And so

922
01:37:39,499 --> 01:37:47,604
[SPEAKER_01]: for that $8 per household, not per person, per household, per month, it is one of the great bargains, if not in Medford, then anywhere.

923
01:37:48,264 --> 01:37:54,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Another issue I want to, Councilor Stark-Pelly was asking about how well we're keeping the place up.

924
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:58,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And as trustees, that's something that we're very concerned about.

925
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,071
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have a new shiny building.

926
01:38:01,311 --> 01:38:04,033
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut the ribbon and then things slowly

927
01:38:04,967 --> 01:38:05,607
[SPEAKER_01]: become worse.

928
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:12,310
[SPEAKER_01]: As trustees, we're really looking at making sure that it's maintained.

929
01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:19,492
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of the things we did early on is we went from five to six nights a week of having the people come and do the cleaning.

930
01:38:20,492 --> 01:38:26,374
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking right now, it's taken a while, looking at a technology plan.

931
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:28,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Computers, printers,

932
01:38:28,906 --> 01:38:31,049
[SPEAKER_01]: technology gets old very quickly.

933
01:38:32,831 --> 01:38:36,335
[SPEAKER_01]: The library is three plus years old, so the computers are three plus years old.

934
01:38:36,796 --> 01:38:38,678
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want everything to fall apart.

935
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we're also looking at very seriously.

936
01:38:44,705 --> 01:38:46,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we appreciate your support.

937
01:38:46,946 --> 01:38:48,607
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to get the support.

938
01:38:49,288 --> 01:38:53,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't repeat what Grace has talked about in terms of the salaries.

939
01:38:53,150 --> 01:39:06,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than to say that the turnover, I mean, we just promoted someone to be the program manager who's just energetic and really a good fit.

940
01:39:07,249 --> 01:39:09,470
[SPEAKER_01]: But even so, she's only part-time.

941
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:14,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's still got to work one, I think maybe even two other jobs to make her living.

942
01:39:15,711 --> 01:39:22,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wouldn't want her to disappear because someone else is going to offer her a full-time job or a much higher paying job.

943
01:39:22,493 --> 01:39:28,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the consequences of being penny wise and pound foolish.

944
01:39:29,374 --> 01:39:32,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you for this time.

945
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:35,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, thank you for your ongoing support.

946
01:39:36,116 --> 01:39:36,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, David.

947
01:39:39,255 --> 01:39:39,595
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

948
01:39:41,136 --> 01:39:47,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Any more questions or comments from the council, trustees, Director Kerr, or members of the public?

949
01:39:49,418 --> 01:39:53,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, I thank you all very much, and we'll keep fighting.

950
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,602
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go now to Planning, Development, and Sustainability slash Boards and Commissions.

951
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:02,563
[SPEAKER_15]: We have our Director Alicia Hunt with us.

952
01:40:03,839 --> 01:40:10,623
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have, we'll do PDS first then we can go through the commission budgets.

953
01:40:12,123 --> 01:40:16,165
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're looking at fiscal 25 budgeted $819,207 fiscal 26 budgeted $917,163 for an increase of $97,956.

954
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:31,784
[SPEAKER_15]: No change in the number of positions on the services summary.

955
01:40:31,804 --> 01:40:38,728
[SPEAKER_15]: The main increase is fixed cost growth, which is the staff planner salary coming off of ARPA.

956
01:40:38,748 --> 01:40:42,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And three other employees shifted in percentages with funding.

957
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:47,473
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were added to the general fund and the COLA increases and step increases at $77,956.

958
01:40:47,553 --> 01:40:47,933
[SPEAKER_15]: And then

959
01:40:53,356 --> 01:41:00,801
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a new expense in professional technical expenses of 20,000 regarding continuation of the zoning work into fiscal 26.

960
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:10,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And an increase in legal fees since PDS is covering legal fees for the appeals to boards and for support for Medford Square.

961
01:41:11,007 --> 01:41:13,169
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess that's Medford Square RFP.

962
01:41:13,549 --> 01:41:13,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

963
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:14,890
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

964
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,931
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, I'll go to Director Hunt.

965
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:17,672
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to

966
01:41:18,796 --> 01:41:34,422
[SPEAKER_15]: ask you just if you want to talk about the specific budget change any more than that and the other details, talk about your accomplishments in fiscal 25, your goals for fiscal 26, and then what are some key needs and priorities that aren't funded this year that we would like to see funded in future years.

967
01:41:34,442 --> 01:41:36,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Mr. President, thank you.

968
01:41:37,143 --> 01:41:39,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to be clear, I am not as funny as Barbara Carr.

969
01:41:39,704 --> 01:41:41,605
[SPEAKER_13]: It just is not possible.

970
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:42,685
[SPEAKER_13]: She is a hard act

971
01:41:43,005 --> 01:41:43,445
[SPEAKER_13]: follow.

972
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:49,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like she didn't like following Francis, like Barb is a hard one to follow.

973
01:41:49,766 --> 01:41:51,667
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but I love the library.

974
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:55,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't go into the local history room and not get sucked in.

975
01:41:57,048 --> 01:41:58,588
[SPEAKER_13]: So to talk about this budget.

976
01:41:59,548 --> 01:42:07,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's really useful to just sort of explain a little bit more the whole change the staff shifting stuff.

977
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:20,293
[SPEAKER_13]: We've made a lot of great hires in recent years in planning, and one of the hires that's notable is Laurel Siegel is managing our CDBG grant.

978
01:42:20,654 --> 01:42:29,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And part of that is we are benefiting from the fact that Laurel was a practicing lawyer for 29 years before she became our CDBG manager.

979
01:42:29,636 --> 01:42:37,060
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the things she's helping us do is fully understand all the laws and regulations, especially in the shifting landscape of HUD.

980
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:44,644
[SPEAKER_13]: HUD does monitor the grant every three years, and so we can expect future monitors.

981
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:51,367
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had the most recent one was looking at how we spent our Community Development Block Grant coronavirus funding.

982
01:42:52,307 --> 01:42:53,648
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it went fairly smoothly.

983
01:42:54,068 --> 01:42:57,150
[SPEAKER_13]: But with that, one of the things Laurel has flagged is that we

984
01:42:57,650 --> 01:43:16,033
[SPEAKER_13]: like to have our staff working on a lot of things, including we've had her helping us with additional work, and she has flagged that we should be very cautious about where we are paying staff full time in part time with CDBG funds that we are clearly documenting that everything they are doing

985
01:43:16,413 --> 01:43:17,695
[SPEAKER_13]: is CDBG related.

986
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:22,380
[SPEAKER_13]: So one example on this is that we asked to move her salary 10% of it.

987
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:32,932
[SPEAKER_13]: So just a couple of hours a week to be not CDBG funded, so that over the course of the year, when we asked her to do things like help us with the Gaming Commission grant.

988
01:43:34,113 --> 01:43:35,773
[SPEAKER_13]: that that is covered.

989
01:43:36,033 --> 01:43:38,634
[SPEAKER_13]: We have some other source to say that's covering that.

990
01:43:38,974 --> 01:43:54,837
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's truly not a like, well, every week she's gonna do two hours that is not CDBG related, but rather over the course of her year, as there are things that are not truly CDBG, we have another source that we're funding that from.

991
01:43:55,677 --> 01:44:00,218
[SPEAKER_13]: So the other two, we've been funding parts or all of multiple positions.

992
01:44:00,778 --> 01:44:03,059
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I actually took over planning,

993
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,166
[SPEAKER_13]: The administrative assistant head clerk was 80% funded by CDBG.

994
01:44:08,567 --> 01:44:18,682
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's one of the positions that we have been shifting over the years, because she certainly does not spend 80% of her time supporting the low and moderate income work.

995
01:44:19,523 --> 01:44:27,331
[SPEAKER_13]: The housing planner is 100% CDBG and the economic development planner has been 100% CDBG.

996
01:44:27,811 --> 01:44:35,499
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you will notice that several of our small business programs are for low and moderate income people and have income limitations.

997
01:44:35,959 --> 01:44:41,203
[SPEAKER_13]: that is because the funding to support those programs are coming from CDBG.

998
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:54,493
[SPEAKER_13]: And so as over time, as we say, well, this program was wildly successful, but we'd like it to be accessible to more people, we would need to bring in outside funding that's not CDBG to expand it.

999
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:56,174
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the things we've heard about the pop-up.

1000
01:44:56,534 --> 01:45:00,837
[SPEAKER_13]: The pop-up is being funded so it's to help lift people out of poverty.

1001
01:45:01,298 --> 01:45:03,039
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's low and moderate income

1002
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:10,481
[SPEAKER_13]: business owners or people who would like to start a business, but they personally are lower moderate income can can do that program.

1003
01:45:10,781 --> 01:45:21,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something the economic development planners running a hunt clearly that is CDBG, but when we ask her to work with other small businesses where the owners are not low and moderate income.

1004
01:45:21,585 --> 01:45:25,427
[SPEAKER_13]: that really we should be not spending CDBG money on that.

1005
01:45:25,787 --> 01:45:37,312
[SPEAKER_13]: So part of this is shifting some of her funding to the general fund, so that as she does her hours over the course of the year, she has a place to put hours that are not CDBG.

1006
01:45:37,592 --> 01:45:44,115
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is really the bulk of this, and it was the climate planner that was partially funded through ARPA.

1007
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:57,025
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually have a national grid grant, sorry, Mass Clean Energy Center grant that is paying about half of her salary, and that grant was for three years.

1008
01:45:57,466 --> 01:46:06,874
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've had ARPA paying the other half of her salary last year, and she's moving to the general fund, because we need the work of the climate planner, she's doing amazing work for us.

1009
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:11,717
[SPEAKER_13]: And she does all the building energy stuff like all the solar and stuff like that.

1010
01:46:11,797 --> 01:46:15,399
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, she's not like literally just climate.

1011
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:21,362
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's sort of like in a big picture way, what we're looking at.

1012
01:46:22,823 --> 01:46:25,064
[SPEAKER_13]: for this, and then there's some additional funding.

1013
01:46:25,124 --> 01:46:34,408
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things I've been saying is when there are appeals to the planning board or to the zoning board, my office pays for the legal defenses of that.

1014
01:46:34,469 --> 01:46:37,030
[SPEAKER_13]: As we're doing the RFQ, we'll need some legal support.

1015
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:47,855
[SPEAKER_13]: We will be asking the developer to cover a lot of our fees related to the RFQ, but we did want to make sure we had a little bit of cushion there for covering stuff.

1016
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:53,817
[SPEAKER_13]: But in general, we do a lot of matching grants and a lot of little overruns.

1017
01:46:54,037 --> 01:47:01,259
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Amanda was here the other week to talk about Carr Park and having linkage for unexpected costs.

1018
01:47:01,539 --> 01:47:09,402
[SPEAKER_13]: But at Gillis Park, there was some signs that went on the outside of the park that weren't part of the grants.

1019
01:47:09,662 --> 01:47:12,143
[SPEAKER_13]: And we said, oh, jeez, we didn't factor those in.

1020
01:47:12,263 --> 01:47:14,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And so my budget picks up the signs.

1021
01:47:14,403 --> 01:47:16,184
[SPEAKER_13]: We pick up little things.

1022
01:47:16,724 --> 01:47:19,887
[SPEAKER_13]: that it's not worth going and asking somebody else for money.

1023
01:47:19,947 --> 01:47:21,889
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a couple of thousand dollars here or there.

1024
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:24,692
[SPEAKER_13]: But these projects tend to have that.

1025
01:47:25,533 --> 01:47:28,476
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've been covering some stuff on the EV chargers as well.

1026
01:47:28,556 --> 01:47:30,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we've moved a lot of that to the revolving fund.

1027
01:47:31,239 --> 01:47:32,760
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's freeing up some of that money.

1028
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:34,342
[SPEAKER_13]: So every year we kind of

1029
01:47:34,742 --> 01:47:41,846
[SPEAKER_13]: find there are different little things that we just sort of cover and take care of in order to keep everything moving smoothly.

1030
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:49,810
[SPEAKER_13]: The zoning project, we've asked the zoning consultant to do a lot more meetings than we had planned.

1031
01:47:50,230 --> 01:48:00,775
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're covering like an extra not quite $10,000 from my budget from this plant professional services so that we didn't have to say, oh, wait a minute, we can't afford that.

1032
01:48:01,616 --> 01:48:03,597
[SPEAKER_13]: We're like, no, no, we need a little bit more outreach.

1033
01:48:04,057 --> 01:48:06,459
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got money for a little bit more outreach.

1034
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:10,783
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically that's the, the big picture here.

1035
01:48:11,484 --> 01:48:19,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'll just notice that the full time total the bottom that reflects all the full time staff, all their salaries.

1036
01:48:20,572 --> 01:48:22,753
[SPEAKER_13]: CPA manager is on here as well.

1037
01:48:23,354 --> 01:48:30,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And CPA will be a separate budget that is in the city council budget separate from here, but she is part of my office.

1038
01:48:31,878 --> 01:48:33,979
[SPEAKER_13]: I manage the CPA work.

1039
01:48:34,459 --> 01:48:35,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I managed her.

1040
01:48:35,959 --> 01:48:40,462
[SPEAKER_13]: So her line item is showing here, but she's fully funded as well from the CPA.

1041
01:48:41,922 --> 01:48:45,224
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why the full-time total is a lot more

1042
01:48:45,724 --> 01:48:59,908
[SPEAKER_13]: then the general fund is because of the number of staff that we are funding through CWG, CPA, Clean Energy Grant, and actually National Grid has a grant that we're funding a little tiny bit of the economic development planner with this year.

1043
01:49:00,929 --> 01:49:04,130
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll let it go there.

1044
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:04,730
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a lot.

1045
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:06,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1046
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:11,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any questions?

1047
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1048
01:49:21,252 --> 01:49:23,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say thank you for your presentation.

1049
01:49:24,173 --> 01:49:26,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Your department does quite a lot.

1050
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:36,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand there's some squidgy stuff with the numbers and how they're funded, and that is really helpful context for us.

1051
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I just appreciate that.

1052
01:49:41,502 --> 01:49:43,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate you coming down.

1053
01:49:45,644 --> 01:49:46,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you.

1054
01:49:46,885 --> 01:49:47,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much level funded.

1055
01:49:49,966 --> 01:49:50,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1056
01:49:50,508 --> 01:49:50,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1057
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:52,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1058
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:02,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1059
01:50:02,425 --> 01:50:03,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being here.

1060
01:50:03,726 --> 01:50:04,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the presentation.

1061
01:50:04,866 --> 01:50:06,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot of specific questions.

1062
01:50:06,427 --> 01:50:07,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I talk to you constantly.

1063
01:50:07,848 --> 01:50:11,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like if I had questions, I'd probably ask them already.

1064
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:28,419
[SPEAKER_02]: But just because I feel like in the day-to-day, maybe it doesn't get said often enough, I feel that the Department of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, I have constantly been in awe of just how much this department handles and bottom lines.

1065
01:50:28,519 --> 01:50:28,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1066
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:45,825
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is not simply to butter up department heads in budget hearings I really do mean it, it is quite amazing to me how much your department handles and that is a testament to your incredible staff and the curation of that staff and a really high level of resourcefulness so thank you.

1067
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, really from the bottom of my heart, it is very it's wonderful to get to see the impact that it has in our city.

1068
01:50:53,368 --> 01:51:04,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, of course, being closely involved with the zoning project, we've discussed the need for additional funding for in this associates really happy to see, um, that increase.

1069
01:51:04,692 --> 01:51:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as everybody knows throughout this process, we've continued to iterate and tried to make space for more community forums, more Q and A's more outreach.

1070
01:51:13,655 --> 01:51:22,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really glad that we've been able to collaborate within us to find a mutually agreeable number so that we could add on to this process what the community needed to see.

1071
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:25,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for helping shake that out as well.

1072
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

1073
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:26,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1074
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:29,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1075
01:51:30,822 --> 01:51:35,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further questions on the PDS core budget before we go into some of the commissions?

1076
01:51:36,844 --> 01:51:46,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there actually realized one thing that I should just add when CDBG grant was in front of you the numbers were still tentative and I'll just let you know that.

1077
01:51:47,482 --> 01:51:56,528
[SPEAKER_13]: very recently in the last couple days, we were notified officially about our CDBG allocation, and it is up a teeny tiny bit from last year, so it's not down.

1078
01:51:57,128 --> 01:52:01,891
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we were stunned, but it means that we can afford everything that was put in front of you.

1079
01:52:02,632 --> 01:52:05,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are not concerned about that for this coming year.

1080
01:52:05,894 --> 01:52:07,795
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a formula, we don't apply for it.

1081
01:52:07,875 --> 01:52:14,359
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably because we have a higher percentage of low-income people in the city of Medford, and not because of anything that we did.

1082
01:52:14,379 --> 01:52:17,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to let you know that that is actually

1083
01:52:17,581 --> 01:52:20,463
[SPEAKER_13]: finalized.

1084
01:52:21,764 --> 01:52:22,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1085
01:52:24,126 --> 01:52:31,052
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we'll go to boards of commissions next to Bicycle Commission, no change.

1086
01:52:31,072 --> 01:52:34,694
[SPEAKER_15]: 1500, 1000 for public safety supplies, 1000 for travel conferences and training.

1087
01:52:37,156 --> 01:52:40,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further comments or questions by members of the Council on the Bicycle Commission?

1088
01:52:47,896 --> 01:53:03,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, we will go next to, one second here, Zoning Board of Appeals, 12,500 in fiscal 25, 12,500 fiscal 26, no change.

1089
01:53:03,764 --> 01:53:07,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Any discussion or questions on the Zoning Board of Appeals?

1090
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:20,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we could use this opportunity to talk about the difference between the Zoning Board and the Community Development Board a little bit.

1091
01:53:20,868 --> 01:53:26,574
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Zoning Board considers appeals of building department decisions.

1092
01:53:27,287 --> 01:53:27,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1093
01:53:27,848 --> 01:53:37,557
[SPEAKER_13]: So if a building is not in compliance with zoning, the building commissioner says you're not allowed to do this, and he denies it.

1094
01:53:39,258 --> 01:53:47,225
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been working with the technicalities of it, but basically then the applicant can, if they choose to, go to the Zoning Board of Appeals and ask for

1095
01:53:48,607 --> 01:53:53,273
[SPEAKER_13]: an appeal, and they can get that if they meet certain legal tests.

1096
01:53:53,633 --> 01:53:56,857
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not at their discretion, it's not because they love the project.

1097
01:53:57,638 --> 01:54:03,105
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to do with shape, topography, and soil conditions, whether they can get

1098
01:54:06,143 --> 01:54:09,345
[SPEAKER_13]: a zoning appeal, a variance, and then they do that.

1099
01:54:09,686 --> 01:54:11,907
[SPEAKER_13]: The zoning board does hear some special permits.

1100
01:54:12,328 --> 01:54:19,413
[SPEAKER_13]: And so often that would be by use or in some complicated things around non-conforming properties.

1101
01:54:19,593 --> 01:54:29,260
[SPEAKER_13]: So for the most part, what they do as they make legal decisions about whether this meets legal tests, we usually encourage all applicants to the zoning board

1102
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:37,346
[SPEAKER_13]: to consider hiring a lawyer and if they are more than a small single family, if they're a single family home, our staff helps them through the process.

1103
01:54:37,686 --> 01:54:43,090
[SPEAKER_13]: If they're more than that, then they should have a lawyer because they're making a legal argument for what they want there.

1104
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:44,851
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a zoning board.

1105
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:46,773
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that when we have had a

1106
01:54:49,053 --> 01:54:51,715
[SPEAKER_13]: comprehensive permits known as 40 B's.

1107
01:54:52,195 --> 01:54:58,999
[SPEAKER_13]: They also hear those and under our zoning, they also hear any cannabis locations.

1108
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:04,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we actually are eligible for three cannabis locations and one is open.

1109
01:55:05,743 --> 01:55:11,726
[SPEAKER_13]: One has been through the ZBA process and has been permitted and is under construction.

1110
01:55:12,146 --> 01:55:16,669
[SPEAKER_13]: And the third tells us that they are actually preparing documents to come

1111
01:55:17,149 --> 01:55:18,790
[SPEAKER_13]: file in front of the ZBA.

1112
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:29,315
[SPEAKER_13]: And when they do that, it's not just a legal test, but it's a more broad examination, sort of like site plan review, like how does this fit with the community?

1113
01:55:29,375 --> 01:55:30,836
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you planning at this location?

1114
01:55:30,856 --> 01:55:36,518
[SPEAKER_13]: They look at more details than just the legal test, if this is allowed.

1115
01:55:37,239 --> 01:55:38,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are expecting that this year.

1116
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Where's the under construction?

1117
01:55:41,261 --> 01:55:43,002
[SPEAKER_13]: The one under construction is at the VFW.

1118
01:55:46,749 --> 01:55:47,750
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the zoning board.

1119
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:51,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like me to then just speak to the community development board so we can look at what's next?

1120
01:55:51,312 --> 01:55:54,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Community development board, fiscal 25 budget, 8,900, fiscal 26 proposed, 9,800.

1121
01:55:54,393 --> 01:55:56,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Looks like an increase in the stipends.

1122
01:55:56,615 --> 01:55:59,757
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you want to speak to it.

1123
01:55:59,817 --> 01:56:01,838
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not an increase in the stipends.

1124
01:56:01,938 --> 01:56:04,779
[SPEAKER_13]: It is an increase in the number of positions on there.

1125
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,741
[SPEAKER_13]: So, because we added some...

1126
01:56:12,249 --> 01:56:16,971
[SPEAKER_13]: brain just dropped the word associate associate alternates in this case they're alternates.

1127
01:56:18,492 --> 01:56:25,595
[SPEAKER_13]: And so on the Community Development Board, an alternate if a member is not there an alternate can vote in their place.

1128
01:56:25,975 --> 01:56:28,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they've been following if they've been at the previous even if it's a public

1129
01:56:29,557 --> 01:56:35,000
[SPEAKER_13]: hearing and they've been at the previous meetings and somebody's absent they can then step in and become a voting member.

1130
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:42,324
[SPEAKER_13]: So we now have two alternate positions on there and actually we kind of had a cushion going on for a little while.

1131
01:56:42,364 --> 01:56:54,810
[SPEAKER_13]: We've actually added those a little earlier but the finances didn't line up which was fine because we had a chair who worked for the state and she was declining her stipend because she felt it was a conflict of interest.

1132
01:56:55,131 --> 01:56:57,652
[SPEAKER_13]: She couldn't take a payment from us and from the state.

1133
01:56:58,132 --> 01:56:58,952
[SPEAKER_13]: at the same time.

1134
01:57:00,053 --> 01:57:08,697
[SPEAKER_13]: So now she's no longer on the board, we are working to fill her position, and then we would, with a full board, will actually need the full amount of funding.

1135
01:57:09,477 --> 01:57:14,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Community Development Board is what is often referred to as your planning board.

1136
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:21,182
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have a say in zoning, so they are also reviewing all the zoning and making recommendations too, as you're well aware.

1137
01:57:21,682 --> 01:57:24,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other thing they spend a lot of time doing is site plan review.

1138
01:57:25,023 --> 01:57:28,605
[SPEAKER_13]: So they look at the outside of projects, larger projects.

1139
01:57:29,025 --> 01:57:34,147
[SPEAKER_13]: They look at the look and feel of it, the plantings, the pedestrian access, the traffic access.

1140
01:57:34,187 --> 01:57:41,890
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the ones who ask, you know, we would really like you to do stuff for the crosswalk at this location and we'd like you to put in a pocket park.

1141
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:45,171
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the big things that we're very happy about is if you look at

1142
01:57:46,632 --> 01:58:08,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Wegmans and there is a new little bank in the corner of one of the parking lots and next to that is a lovely little park pocket park with a walkway and bushes and trees and benches and you we've I've seen people sitting there the CD board basically said you're putting a bank in the middle of a parking lot you don't need that much parking we'd like you to put in

1143
01:58:09,072 --> 01:58:09,993
[SPEAKER_13]: a pocket park.

1144
01:58:10,493 --> 01:58:15,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And they basically said, okay, and they put in the pocket park because we asked.

1145
01:58:15,215 --> 01:58:17,856
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is the board that kind of asks for these things.

1146
01:58:19,277 --> 01:58:24,939
[SPEAKER_13]: They have some leeway in what they're allowed to ask, like how far it has to have nexus, it has to be like right there.

1147
01:58:25,219 --> 01:58:28,861
[SPEAKER_13]: They could not have asked them to redo the park up in North Medford.

1148
01:58:29,121 --> 01:58:33,703
[SPEAKER_13]: They could ask them to put in a pocket park adjacent to their building.

1149
01:58:34,383 --> 01:58:35,684
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what they do a lot of.

1150
01:58:35,704 --> 01:58:35,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Most

1151
01:58:37,885 --> 01:58:44,889
[SPEAKER_13]: developers who have anything to say about the process of going through site plan review have said, wow, they actually made this a better project.

1152
01:58:45,309 --> 01:58:55,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't realize that people would want a path through there or want to access it from this direction and you pushed me to put more bike parking in and we needed it and stuff like that.

1153
01:58:56,575 --> 01:59:08,782
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the kinds of stuff, like at BJ's now, where there's the gas station as part of that site plan review, they requested a sidewalk all the way from Mystic Ave to the building.

1154
01:59:09,062 --> 01:59:14,946
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can now actually walk on a sidewalk down the side of their property the entire way.

1155
01:59:15,466 --> 01:59:17,027
[SPEAKER_13]: And you couldn't do that before.

1156
01:59:17,387 --> 01:59:21,630
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no sidewalk at all from Mystic Ave to that building.

1157
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,831
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, there were no sidewalks in that parking lot at all.

1158
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:33,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the kinds of things the CD board does, I will tell you that they have now been meeting twice a month, pretty reliably, because there has been so much in front of them.

1159
01:59:34,025 --> 01:59:36,288
[SPEAKER_13]: They also hear all Dover cases.

1160
01:59:36,809 --> 01:59:40,054
[SPEAKER_13]: So if there's an as of right something coming out of tops.

1161
01:59:40,534 --> 01:59:44,417
[SPEAKER_13]: or because it's educational in some manner, like we saw with 21 St.

1162
01:59:44,517 --> 01:59:55,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Clair, they are the board that would hear that as well and review sort of how this fits into the community and what are reasonable things to ask of that as well.

1163
01:59:56,927 --> 01:59:59,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, so they do a lot, but they do a lot more

1164
02:00:01,325 --> 02:00:02,366
[SPEAKER_13]: the feeling of this?

1165
02:00:02,406 --> 02:00:03,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Does this look right?

1166
02:00:03,848 --> 02:00:08,472
[SPEAKER_13]: What does the community need to make this a better project for the community?

1167
02:00:08,593 --> 02:00:15,640
[SPEAKER_13]: And they have the ability to ask for making this a better project where the zoning board has very legal parameters that they work in.

1168
02:00:17,021 --> 02:00:19,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So by the way, there's an opening on the CD board right now.

1169
02:00:19,782 --> 02:00:30,087
[SPEAKER_13]: If you know good people, we are taking applications again, both for a, I keep saying an associate, an alternate position and a full-time position.

1170
02:00:30,488 --> 02:00:41,213
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are working, we actually by law on our CD board have a governor appointed position, and we are working on trying to figure out how to get that position appointed.

1171
02:00:41,253 --> 02:00:45,295
[SPEAKER_13]: We usually recommend somebody, but we need somebody at the state to bless that position.

1172
02:00:45,935 --> 02:00:48,196
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyhow, but we need an applicant to fill it.

1173
02:00:48,877 --> 02:00:59,023
[SPEAKER_13]: The last person I recommended to fill that position, she decided she couldn't fill it because of changes at the federal government and her life was too busy.

1174
02:00:59,243 --> 02:01:00,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Only good news, we hired her.

1175
02:01:00,784 --> 02:01:02,545
[SPEAKER_13]: She's staff in the city of Medford now.

1176
02:01:04,346 --> 02:01:09,910
[SPEAKER_13]: So she was an excellent applicant, but now we need another person to fill that position.

1177
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:11,051
[SPEAKER_13]: She's our new housing planner.

1178
02:01:11,071 --> 02:01:11,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1179
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:29,834
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, next we have our Conservation Commission, fiscal 25 budget 7500, fiscal 26 budget 7500, no change.

1180
02:01:30,034 --> 02:01:33,935
[SPEAKER_13]: They do Wetlands Protection Act.

1181
02:01:34,335 --> 02:01:41,677
[SPEAKER_13]: So they also issue permits on behalf of the city of Medford, anything close to water, wetland, river, that's what they do.

1182
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:47,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1183
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:51,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Historic District Commission 5000 fiscal 25 5000 fiscal 26.

1184
02:01:51,963 --> 02:01:55,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions?

1185
02:01:56,926 --> 02:01:57,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Callahan?

1186
02:02:01,048 --> 02:02:03,569
[SPEAKER_16]: unclassified, which is almost tap.

1187
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:05,090
[SPEAKER_15]: That's historical commission.

1188
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:05,670
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get there next.

1189
02:02:05,771 --> 02:02:06,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

1190
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:08,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I skip historical?

1191
02:02:08,652 --> 02:02:08,952
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1192
02:02:09,893 --> 02:02:10,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

1193
02:02:12,349 --> 02:02:14,231
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I did, I did skip this one, sorry.

1194
02:02:14,812 --> 02:02:20,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Historical commission or historic commission, 55, sorry, 35,000 fiscal 25, 35,000 fiscal 26, Councilor Kiley.

1195
02:02:27,885 --> 02:02:29,445
[SPEAKER_13]: That was unclassified.

1196
02:02:29,465 --> 02:02:33,466
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you were saying, which I didn't see on this board and we do on that one.

1197
02:02:35,067 --> 02:02:46,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, it's more professional services, and I am unclear of why historically, one is, they have it broken into two places but for that we hire professionals who do.

1198
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:55,557
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember the exact form numbers, but they get forms for properties to determine if they're historic or not or what the history of these things are.

1199
02:02:56,598 --> 02:03:07,967
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also so they also one of them they use for that and the other actually they've been going out and getting grants to do historic assessments of the community and typically the grant is

1200
02:03:09,635 --> 02:03:24,344
[SPEAKER_13]: requires a match, and I can't remember if it's the 15,000 or the 20,000, that is the match for the grant that they get, but they tend to get the same grant every year and then they do studies of different parts of the city to increase our historical knowledge.

1201
02:03:25,952 --> 02:03:32,413
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody's, I think this board is clear the difference in the Historic Commission and the Historic District Commission.

1202
02:03:32,893 --> 02:03:34,394
[SPEAKER_13]: We have historic districts.

1203
02:03:35,494 --> 02:03:40,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Historic districts are a way of protecting properties in the look and feel of the community.

1204
02:03:41,195 --> 02:03:44,935
[SPEAKER_13]: The Historic Commission speaks to older.

1205
02:03:45,396 --> 02:03:49,856
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you wanna do anything to a property in the Historic District Commission, you need permission.

1206
02:03:50,076 --> 02:03:52,917
[SPEAKER_13]: In the Historic District, you need permission from the HDC.

1207
02:03:53,993 --> 02:04:11,927
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a building that is over 75 years old, and you want to tear it down or make significant change so you can change a lot about it, but if you want to like really change it, then you have to go to the historic commission for permission, they cannot actually tell you no.

1208
02:04:12,487 --> 02:04:18,171
[SPEAKER_13]: They can tell you there's an 18 month delay, and they can then negotiate.

1209
02:04:18,472 --> 02:04:28,439
[SPEAKER_13]: If a developer says but what if I do it like this or what if I document this so a great example was the herb chambers the building next to it that got torn down.

1210
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:37,743
[SPEAKER_13]: basically the Historic Commission said, we really want you to document that old building, but we see why it doesn't make sense to keep it.

1211
02:04:38,163 --> 02:04:40,704
[SPEAKER_13]: So they said, great, we'll document it.

1212
02:04:40,844 --> 02:04:43,785
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Historic Commission said, great, you did that really fast.

1213
02:04:43,825 --> 02:04:50,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Your 18 month is lifted, that only took you one month, go ahead, great, do your construction.

1214
02:04:50,808 --> 02:04:57,610
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's typically, and they'll work with developers as well, to sort of say, could you change it a little bit and make it look a little

1215
02:04:57,670 --> 02:05:00,132
[SPEAKER_13]: more historical, and then we won't delay you.

1216
02:05:00,452 --> 02:05:02,714
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's them.

1217
02:05:03,434 --> 02:05:03,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1218
02:05:04,775 --> 02:05:07,137
[SPEAKER_15]: And then historic district commission also no change.

1219
02:05:08,818 --> 02:05:11,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you've described both of them.

1220
02:05:12,341 --> 02:05:14,382
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was at the end, I skipped over historic.

1221
02:05:15,343 --> 02:05:17,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, historic commission is no change, right?

1222
02:05:17,644 --> 02:05:17,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1223
02:05:18,245 --> 02:05:22,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have any questions on historic commission or historic district commission?

1224
02:05:24,627 --> 02:05:26,067
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just gonna plug my staff.

1225
02:05:26,127 --> 02:05:31,669
[SPEAKER_13]: We support like five or six other boards that don't have budgets.

1226
02:05:31,889 --> 02:05:33,170
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're not in front of you tonight.

1227
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:34,150
[SPEAKER_15]: And what are those?

1228
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:43,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Off the top of my head, the Energy and Environment Committee, the Climate Equity Commission, the Community Garden Commission.

1229
02:05:45,814 --> 02:05:50,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the ones that get in front of me a lot, but I know there's more than that.

1230
02:05:53,155 --> 02:05:54,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Bicycle does have a note.

1231
02:05:54,496 --> 02:05:56,798
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one I often, because we don't staff them.

1232
02:05:59,159 --> 02:06:03,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the Affordable Housing Trust.

1233
02:06:03,603 --> 02:06:06,325
[SPEAKER_13]: The CPA is a separate budget in front of you.

1234
02:06:06,345 --> 02:06:08,346
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, OK, now I'm up to five.

1235
02:06:08,366 --> 02:06:11,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot.

1236
02:06:15,451 --> 02:06:17,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Affordable Housing Trust, the Climate Equity Commission.

1237
02:06:18,474 --> 02:06:18,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1238
02:06:20,422 --> 02:06:24,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the Community Garden Commission, they have revolving funds.

1239
02:06:24,145 --> 02:06:27,448
[SPEAKER_13]: So they actually collect money in from their gardeners.

1240
02:06:27,568 --> 02:06:33,693
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we actually manage their finances, but the finances are not allocated through this body.

1241
02:06:33,813 --> 02:06:36,315
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just they collect fees for using the plots.

1242
02:06:36,756 --> 02:06:44,202
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when they want to spend on like compost for the whole garden at once or upgrading their shed or they need

1243
02:06:44,721 --> 02:06:50,985
[SPEAKER_13]: more shared tools, they go to Home Depot and we pay out of the revolving fund that's set up for them.

1244
02:06:54,487 --> 02:06:54,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1245
02:06:55,267 --> 02:06:55,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1246
02:06:56,468 --> 02:06:57,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you, Director Hunt.

1247
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:00,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1248
02:07:01,911 --> 02:07:03,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're on to the last.

1249
02:07:03,512 --> 02:07:07,875
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Chief Steph Mazarian to talk about the License Commission.

1250
02:07:10,271 --> 02:07:16,257
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a fiscal year 25 budget 5800, fiscal 26 proposed 5800, no change.

1251
02:07:16,937 --> 02:07:25,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Chief of Staff, if you want to just tell us a little bit about what the License Commission does and what it's been doing and its goals for the future.

1252
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:26,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1253
02:07:27,512 --> 02:07:35,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so the for the members of the public, the License Commission is the liquor license body for the city of Medford.

1254
02:07:36,281 --> 02:07:46,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the any liquor license any party that's interested in, um, holding a licorice license or presently holds a liquor license and needs a liquor license renewal.

1255
02:07:47,673 --> 02:07:50,235
[SPEAKER_06]: would need to appear before the Liquor License Commission.

1256
02:07:50,295 --> 02:08:06,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not intimately familiar with their procedures, but I understand they are looking at some new potential changes to policy and acceptance of statutes that is presently being reviewed and maybe before the council at a future time.

1257
02:08:07,385 --> 02:08:12,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It has something to do with extending hours of the ability to serve liquor.

1258
02:08:12,648 --> 02:08:15,210
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1259
02:08:15,898 --> 02:08:19,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Great and about a council is our.

1260
02:08:22,386 --> 02:08:27,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thank you for presenting and for staying to the end to talk for like one second.

1261
02:08:29,654 --> 02:08:34,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I also thought this would be an appropriate time to mention that I had a quick conversation with our

1262
02:08:34,898 --> 02:08:45,841
[SPEAKER_08]: academic development director last week about something I happened to read on the reddit post and wanted to correct a misconception.

1263
02:08:46,782 --> 02:08:50,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody had said Medford only has a certain number of liquor licenses for bars and restaurants.

1264
02:08:51,643 --> 02:08:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: and they've hit their cap.

1265
02:08:53,104 --> 02:08:54,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So like they can't do that anymore.

1266
02:08:55,105 --> 02:09:00,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sal helped me, verified for me, which I thought was true that that's not accurate.

1267
02:09:00,589 --> 02:09:03,710
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a cap on liquor licenses for bars and restaurants.

1268
02:09:03,931 --> 02:09:05,812
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the case in Medford.

1269
02:09:06,212 --> 02:09:10,194
[SPEAKER_08]: However, he said, what we do have is a cap on package store licenses.

1270
02:09:10,735 --> 02:09:17,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have what amounts to a sanctioned market for like

1271
02:09:20,572 --> 02:09:30,361
[SPEAKER_08]: selling liquor licenses for liquor stores and grocery stores that I think is kind of a bummer, but it's not a hill I'm going to die on right now.

1272
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:38,208
[SPEAKER_08]: But like Wegmans, when they opened and they wanted to sell alcohol, bought a liquor license for like $300,000, which is super weird.

1273
02:09:39,589 --> 02:09:41,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is something that we all know now.

1274
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not the case for restaurants and bars.

1275
02:09:45,481 --> 02:09:51,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Places come, they present to the license commission, they acquire a liquor license, that's allowed.

1276
02:09:51,763 --> 02:09:58,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody can try to do that, open a bar and restaurant in Medford, we're available for them to do that.

1277
02:09:58,605 --> 02:09:59,145
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not capped.

1278
02:09:59,165 --> 02:10:04,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very interesting phenomenon that happens in a lot of cities and towns that you just mentioned, Councilor, yes.

1279
02:10:04,727 --> 02:10:04,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1280
02:10:06,007 --> 02:10:10,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there, and this is actually to my fellow Councilor, is there a, I was just actually looking up this exact same question.

1281
02:10:13,712 --> 02:10:21,134
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like the special act that passed in 2012 said that they have to have a 50 seat minimum for restaurant liquor licenses.

1282
02:10:21,234 --> 02:10:22,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you talk to Sal about that at all?

1283
02:10:25,316 --> 02:10:29,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't specifically, I'm sure he would know, but I didn't mention that specifically.

1284
02:10:29,817 --> 02:10:38,240
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't seem to be, he didn't seem to think that there was any kind of restriction actually.

1285
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:40,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, I would ask him that.

1286
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:46,424
[SPEAKER_15]: And this might be a question for Alicia as much as it is a question for you, Nina.

1287
02:10:50,869 --> 02:10:55,733
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of bars, is that, do we allow that?

1288
02:10:55,773 --> 02:10:57,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we change the zoning to allow that?

1289
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:02,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Or does Mrs. Murphy's technically serve food?

1290
02:11:04,843 --> 02:11:05,023
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1291
02:11:05,043 --> 02:11:06,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, a conversation we recently had.

1292
02:11:06,984 --> 02:11:09,444
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think what you're getting at is, do bars have to serve food?

1293
02:11:09,984 --> 02:11:20,546
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we have been having a conversation with the Liquor Commission to get some clarity around this, because there is some feeling that that is a Medford rule.

1294
02:11:20,986 --> 02:11:23,187
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are some that that is a statewide rule.

1295
02:11:23,307 --> 02:11:30,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've been trying to find something on the state website that says bars must serve food, or that they don't have to.

1296
02:11:31,428 --> 02:11:39,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And all I've been able to find our news articles saying that like Massachusetts repealed a law about serving food in bars.

1297
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:40,700
[SPEAKER_13]: During the pandemic.

1298
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:44,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're really actually trying to get some clarity around that right now.

1299
02:11:45,265 --> 02:11:47,628
[SPEAKER_13]: They that Mrs. Murphy's is a restaurant.

1300
02:11:50,832 --> 02:12:01,298
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, they have been requiring all Medford establishments that serve alcohol to serve food, and we're trying to just get some clarity around whether that's a local decision or not.

1301
02:12:01,778 --> 02:12:05,040
[SPEAKER_13]: It has been the policy in Medford for as long as anybody can remember.

1302
02:12:06,601 --> 02:12:07,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps that helps.

1303
02:12:09,043 --> 02:12:09,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1304
02:12:09,363 --> 02:12:09,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1305
02:12:09,983 --> 02:12:20,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the brewery does not count because they are a brewery and they are covered under different laws than any other bar or restaurant bar because they're a brewery.

1306
02:12:20,932 --> 02:12:24,615
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're covered under special zoning definition here, too.

1307
02:12:24,655 --> 02:12:26,436
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a special zoning definition here.

1308
02:12:26,556 --> 02:12:27,737
[SPEAKER_13]: They're different.

1309
02:12:28,177 --> 02:12:32,881
[SPEAKER_13]: It's completely different than a bar, legally, if not in effect.

1310
02:12:35,843 --> 02:12:36,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1311
02:12:36,683 --> 02:12:38,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And just want to send thanks back.

1312
02:12:38,905 --> 02:12:39,646
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we're working.

1313
02:12:40,806 --> 02:12:58,129
[SPEAKER_15]: with the clerk's office and planning and Daria and the licensing commission on this whole question of getting into a good, better place on aligning our common mixtures licenses and the liquor license and the ABCC piece and everything else, and Councilor Lazzaro, thank you too.

1314
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:01,490
[SPEAKER_15]: So thanks for that.

1315
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:06,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any questions, further questions about the Liquor License Commission for the Chief of Staff?

1316
02:13:10,899 --> 02:13:14,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none, do we have any comments from members of the public?

1317
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:20,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing no one in the chamber, no hands on Zoom, do we have a motion?

1318
02:13:22,366 --> 02:13:29,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1319
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:31,131
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1320
02:13:31,731 --> 02:13:32,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?

1321
02:13:32,132 --> 02:13:33,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes, meeting is adjourned.

1322
02:13:33,292 --> 02:13:33,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
