1
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:15,320
Sign your name if you want to let us know if you support or oppose any of the projects that have been proposed.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,823
So with that, I'd like to invite our first applicant to come forward.

3
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:27,187
And that is the Mayor's Office City of Medford Condon Shell Renovations.

4
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:33,229
Thank you.

5
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:48,168
I just want to add that if people do stand up to speak, if you can give us your name and address for the record.

6
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:48,569
Thank you.

7
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:57,529
All right, should I get started?

8
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,630
Great.

9
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,112
I'm Allie Fisk, 22 Dearborn Street here in Medford.

10
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:11,880
I am the business and cultural liaison in the mayor's office and today I'm presenting on an application the mayor's office submitted for restoration to the Condon Shell.

11
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,042
So just a little bit of background.

12
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:23,671
The Condon Shell is a concrete bandshell structure located on DCR Parkland between the Mystic River as well as Route 16 over near Whole Foods.

13
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:30,136
It was constructed in 1956 and is a National Register of Historic Places nominee.

14
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:34,961
Over the last three years, it has seen a tremendous increase in usage.

15
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:39,625
Particularly in the last year, there were 50 events total that took place there.

16
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,987
The farmers market now is there on a weekly basis.

17
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:45,990
There are various festivals as well as a concert series that happen there.

18
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:50,895
So there are about 10,000 people a year that are being served by the Condon Shelf.

19
00:01:52,336 --> 00:02:01,024
It's one of the Medford's most recognizable landmarks, and you can see it from Route 16, and it really represents Medford's dedication to arts and culture here in the city.

20
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:12,634
The exterior, of course, is being used for concerts as well as festivals, and the interior currently is being used for storage for the Medford Farmers Market, which is taking place there every week now.

21
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:18,799
And I wanted to talk a little bit about what the current conditions are and why I'm here today.

22
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,262
So the Condon shell right now has a tremendous number of leaks.

23
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:38,193
That's one of the primary issues is that the leaks not only of course get into the interior of the shell and can affect people's ability to store stuff there, it really can compromise the integrity of the masonry itself and over time is going to continue to wear on the masonry and become an issue.

24
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:43,316
And it can also affect the electrical equipment in there if the water were to get in.

25
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,157
So that is a primary concern right now.

26
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:53,101
Also significant is the exterior of the shell has really seen a lot of wear and tear over the last 60 years.

27
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,683
And we have all seen that it has a nice

28
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:04,146
film of grime on it, and we'd really like to see it restored to its beautiful state that it was in in the 50s when it was originally built.

29
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:07,308
And another concern about the space is that there's no lighting.

30
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:14,591
Right now, there are two large lampposts that are directly in front of the shell that are not working, and there's no lighting behind the shell.

31
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:24,355
So events that happen there in the evening, at this point, it's a safety concern that there's no lighting on the exterior of the shell when the farmer's market, for instance, loads in and unloads their equipment.

32
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,516
So that's a big issue that we have as well.

33
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:47,923
So the proposed work right now is pressure washing the exterior of the shell, cleaning, prepping, and sealing all of the cracks to fix the leaks, covering the entire exterior of the shell with a waterproof, water-resistant coating to prevent further wear, and then repairing existing lighting and installing new lighting to the exterior of the shell.

34
00:03:48,863 --> 00:04:03,239
So the Condon shell sits right now on DCR own property, but the city has a joint management and license agreement with this with DCR in order to be able to renovate the shell to make these restorations we do have their permission.

35
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,442
We also have checked in with the Massachusetts Historic Commission.

36
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:13,825
They have ruled that this will have no adverse effects on the historic integrity of the facility.

37
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:21,830
And I'm in communication with the Secretary of the Conservation Commission to ensure that the project won't have any environmental effects as well.

38
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,724
So the total estimate for the project is $111,520.

39
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:36,992
This will cover the cost of labor, mobilization, as well as material costs for both the masonry of the shell as well as the electrical work.

40
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,035
So the amount being requested from the CPC is $80,265.

41
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,316
That is 75% of the project cost.

42
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,061
The city will also be putting in in-kind donations for the electrical labor.

43
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:56,183
It'll be city work, and we'll be covering the remaining 25% of the cost of the project.

44
00:04:57,804 --> 00:05:11,548
The quote was gathered through detailed conversations with a contractor who has experience with masonry, as well as is familiar with the shell, and we've also been working closely with the building department and the electrical department to make sure that our quote is very thorough.

45
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:17,560
And DCR was approached to ask whether or not they had available funds for the project, and they do not.

46
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,385
So that is not a possibility at this time.

47
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:26,081
Once the project begins, it will take about four weeks to complete, barring any weather concerns.

48
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:32,147
We did originally, when we submitted the application, say that we were ready to commence the work in June of 2018.

49
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,269
Of course, that would be next month.

50
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:42,897
But given the timing, we now realize that that's going to impair too many of the events already scheduled to use the show and could displace many of them.

51
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,579
So we feel it would be more appropriate

52
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,164
to begin the project in May of 2019 before the festival season and the concert season has begun.

53
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:59,450
So in conclusion, I do feel like this project very closely aligns with the goals of the Community Preservation Act.

54
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:09,958
Certainly when the plan was created and there were public meetings, the content shell came up on numerous occasions as being a project people really wanted to see potentially funded.

55
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:22,404
And I know that it does fit into two of the funding categories, historic preservation, as well as open space and recreation, and really nails a couple of the boxes there when talking about those priorities.

56
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:26,386
There's no question at all that this is a really valuable resource in the city.

57
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:30,588
There are people here today who can say that as well, that they're using it on a regular basis.

58
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:39,553
There's people here who likely remember it when it was first built, and we really want to see it restored to what it was at that time so it can be used for that purpose moving forward.

59
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,677
There's somebody from the building department as well as myself available to answer questions.

60
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,662
Thank you.

61
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:57,631
We may not be able to use the mic for every question, but I'll try to repeat people's questions so that we can be assured that it's recorded.

62
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,755
So are there any questions from committee members?

63
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Hi.

64
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:12,251
The application noted that over the last couple of years, the estimate has increased quite a bit.

65
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:17,282
And if this is delayed a little bit more, is there any concern that that will go up again?

66
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,594
In speaking with the building department about this, we do know that there is a potential for an increase.

67
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:29,078
We don't think that it will be substantial enough that the quote that we've provided won't still apply.

68
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,142
I think that we will manage to do the work that needs to be done with the budget that we've been giving you.

69
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,824
And if it is an increase, it's certainly something that the city will cover the cost of.

70
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:45,591
But I do think that we're going to make a point to really try to see what we can do this winter to cover some of the leaks, even with industrial tarps.

71
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,612
to see if we can prevent there to be further wear over the winter.

72
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:50,612
So we're very aware of that.

73
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:55,693
And that's a good question because we did take that into consideration when we discussed delaying the project for a year.

74
00:07:58,474 --> 00:07:59,474
Can I ask one more question?

75
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:09,756
Will there be any, the surface that's currently there, is it just being repaired or is it actually being an entirely new surface?

76
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:14,560
When you say surface, do you mean the actual coating on it?

77
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,224
The masonry itself is just being, the leaks are being sealed.

78
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:24,449
The masonry itself is just being then cleaned and then recoded with weatherproof coating.

79
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,135
The masonry itself is not being added to, if there's a word that I could, yeah, exactly.

80
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:39,145
We'll ask the committee members to ask questions first, and then we'll take questions from you.

81
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:39,526
Thank you.

82
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,107
Any more questions from committee members?

83
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:44,629
Yep?

84
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:45,670
Just a quick one.

85
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,853
You mentioned that it is on the historic register as a nominee.

86
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:54,156
That's what the state, what about the city of Medford?

87
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,497
What do they deem this?

88
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,719
I don't think they have any official dedication.

89
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:06,757
I do have a letter from them in the application that states that it's the nominee, and I do have their support for the project.

90
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:11,099
I don't know what that means in terms of where it stands on any particular historic record in the city.

91
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:16,502
I think what it means is that we value its cultural significance as a commission.

92
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:16,942
Perfect.

93
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:25,206
So we think it's important as a visual landscape piece in Medford that's been around now for going on three generations, essentially.

94
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,173
Okay, a question on the other side.

95
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:35,797
Yeah, so that's in the application.

96
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:46,303
I have talked with the building department about doing quarterly check-ins on the space to, after the work has been done, make sure that these leaks that were sealed have not reopened and there aren't additional leaks.

97
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:50,325
When there are leaks, to be able to employ the right contractor to fix them.

98
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,125
The

99
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:57,991
Department of Public Works does go on a regular basis to maintain the space.

100
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:03,957
And we also, those who are using the space, the Medford Farmers Market, for instance, are huge advocates for it.

101
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:07,701
And they let us know the minute they see something is not quite right about it.

102
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:14,787
So there is a regular maintenance plan as well as a kind of as it goes along plan to alert us of issues.

103
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:24,793
Can you tell me more about the vision for handicap accessibility improvements in the short term and the long term?

104
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:25,934
Yeah, absolutely.

105
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:40,068
We talked extensively about this and we do have a long-term goal to make the shell ADA accessible, particularly the stage so people in wheelchairs have access or people who have mobility issues have access to be able to enter the stage.

106
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:50,973
What we're focusing on right now is we really want to see the Shell restored to a point where we feel like its longevity warrants that type of attention.

107
00:10:51,313 --> 00:11:03,437
And as soon as we are able to secure funding for this, we will immediately be looking for funding through the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, as well as potentially CPA funding, to do the necessary upgrades to make the Shell ADA accessible.

108
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,678
And we'd be doing an audit of what that would mean.

109
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,979
In the meantime, city events that are held there

110
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:14,182
are very careful to make sure that the event in and of itself is accessible.

111
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,065
So we know that grass, for instance, is not an accessible surface.

112
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:23,951
So using MOBI mats or making sure that activities are happening along the path, we focus on that.

113
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:30,896
And I know that the space itself has become more accessible over time as DCR has given it attention.

114
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:37,362
But the shell, at this moment, we want to focus on restoring it and then coming up with a plan for ADA accessibility.

115
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,853
Are the Moby mats available now?

116
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,674
We have Moby mats that we use at Wright's Pond.

117
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,194
So they are available.

118
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:48,536
It's possible we could purchase additional mats to accommodate this particular space.

119
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:52,158
Right now, off season, they're available.

120
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,579
During season, when Wright's Pond is open, we'd have to find another alternative.

121
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,760
Thank you.

122
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,694
Allie, aesthetically, what is the final look of the product going to be?

123
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,776
Will we maintain the murals, the graphics?

124
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,017
Will we be all one color?

125
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:09,597
Right.

126
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:14,081
So it's not feasibly possible to maintain the mural that exists.

127
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:18,664
The wear on the mural is substantial, and it's not possible to restore it at this point in time.

128
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,206
We have put a lot of thought into the mural.

129
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,888
There's been a tremendous amount of community input about it.

130
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:35,891
The mural, it's a beautiful mural and it has a lot of significance for the people who created it, but we do believe that moving forward when the shell is recoded, there needs to be a different surface put on the face.

131
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:48,035
I think we still want to see it as a public art piece, but we need to understand that the shell is used for performers and we want to complement the performances, not distract from them, which is how we see this current mural.

132
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:57,163
kind of operating, but we believe that the mural would be a community input process and would also be facilitated by arts organizations in Medford.

133
00:12:57,183 --> 00:13:02,969
Thank you.

134
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:06,232
Are there any permits, approvals, or

135
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,893
collaboration that you need to do with DCR that could have the potential to delay this project?

136
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,395
We don't anticipate that because we've had them on the phone on numerous occasions.

137
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:20,419
The mayor and I have spoken with their entire team, legal and otherwise.

138
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:32,349
We know that we need to submit a construction permit, which I can now do now that I've gotten a letter from the Massachusetts Historic Commission stating that the construction would not have any adverse effects

139
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,792
on the historic integrity of the building.

140
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,457
So that is the next step, is to submit that permit.

141
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,540
We do not anticipate running into any issues.

142
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,661
Thank you.

143
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:54,456
I think once we are able to secure funding, I've spoken with the Secretary extensively about this.

144
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:56,557
I believe he's spoken with the Conservation Commission.

145
00:13:57,157 --> 00:14:06,762
There at the moment are very few concerns about issues because what I've been understanding is that a lot of concerns would come if we were digging, and at this moment,

146
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,985
There is minor digging that would need to be done for electrical.

147
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:19,415
He did say that as soon as we know the details of the project, he would work with me to figure out what paperwork we needed to submit and what variances, if any, we'd need to secure.

148
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:25,342
But he did not have any concerns that this project would be stalled because of the Conservation Commission at this time.

149
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:28,946
LA, a couple of comments.

150
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:33,690
I'm glad to hear the accessibility stuff is already being thought of.

151
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:46,881
I would suggest, because you're talking about almost a year, really a year before you start, that you could do the design for that pretty quickly and have it shovel-ready so it's ready for whatever round makes sense, whatever funding source makes sense.

152
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:50,805
You don't have to start from scratch and have it almost catch up as quickly as possible.

153
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:52,853
Two other comments.

154
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,314
This is very well organized.

155
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,875
I think it's very good.

156
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,256
I think you're selling the City of Medford-Libermatch a little short here.

157
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:08,820
$4,500 is not that many hours, and it seems like the contribution would actually be more, just because of all the people in the building department, your time, other people's time.

158
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,800
It seems like it'd be more.

159
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:19,144
And also the contingency is that it's about 10%, which is typical for projects, but not for renovation projects, especially ones that probably have some

160
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:24,846
hidden landmines in it once you actually start exposing stuff and you know finding it.

161
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:31,209
It tends to be closer to 20 for projects that are of this nature, older buildings, a lot of unknown existing conditions.

162
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,692
But that would be on the city's dime anyway because obviously our number is, as you know, is limited by whatever the application is.

163
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:40,233
So if there's an overrun, it's on the city's dime.

164
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,874
But it's just it's good to have a bigger number.

165
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:42,695
Understood.

166
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,295
But it looks great.

167
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:43,555
Thank you.

168
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:53,219
All right, questions or comments from those of you who are in attendance this evening?

169
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,320
Yes.

170
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:56,842
Can you please use a mic?

171
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:58,363
You can use this mic.

172
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:02,907
Should I just stay static?

173
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:03,467
Yeah, or either.

174
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,390
I just.

175
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:11,855
Cindy Watson, Framingham State Prison.

176
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:14,815
No, 65 Alley Street, Medford, Mass.

177
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:19,056
I just want to echo Doug's comments.

178
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:30,199
I belong to a lot of efforts in Medford, and I don't know if anybody noticed, front page of the Globe magazine last week in the Boston Globe, top spots to live.

179
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,539
One of them was Medford.

180
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,860
Within the last year,

181
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:43,467
There was a report that was sent out, not just in this state, in the country, that 02155 was one of the fastest-selling zip codes in the U.S.

182
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,308
Small town in Texas was number one.

183
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,891
But at any rate, all the more reason to come to the Condon show.

184
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:58,778
I think this is a great project, so without question, here on behalf of CACHE, which is the Coalition for the Arts and Culture for a Healthy and Heightened Economy.

185
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:00,179
So, thank you.

186
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,361
Cindy Watson.

187
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:03,602
You're welcome.

188
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:10,769
More comments?

189
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,830
Yes?

190
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:22,821
Since the Carnton was built by the MTC and the state,

191
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:30,184
I think that, I don't know, did the state totally give it to the city?

192
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,965
Or did the state still own it?

193
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:47,612
And if they still own it, I think since you're doing this a year in advance, the state should be responsible, like for the Shell and all the others.

194
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:53,278
state-owned property that's now under DCR.

195
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:02,290
Did I hear right that the state is not going to give funding for what they built?

196
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:04,111
That is true.

197
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:08,832
We did ask them and they said during their funding cycle at this moment in time, they don't have any funds.

198
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:10,273
We will ask them again.

199
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,933
But at this moment in time, they don't have any funds.

200
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:13,933
The state does own it.

201
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:23,075
The city has a management agreement and it is the expectation that under that management agreement, we are the ones who maintain and in this case, restore the shell.

202
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:25,356
Thank you.

203
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:30,077
Other comment?

204
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:30,257
Yeah.

205
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:40,896
I'm Marie Cassidy, formerly of 38 Roosevelt Road in Medford, now of 8 Osborne Hill Drive in Salem.

206
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:46,059
And for the past 24 years, I've been honored to be the director of the Medford Family Network.

207
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,082
15 years ago, we started family concerts in the summertime.

208
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:57,046
And I've been having them at Wright's Pond and gathering all kinds of families and really wonderful activities for families.

209
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,148
Five years ago, we started at the Condon Show.

210
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:06,833
That drew an interesting new and different demographic to pull from that we had never been able to draw from before.

211
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:16,601
It also invited vendors to come and invited companies and businesses to offer in-kind services and products and other things that we hadn't expected.

212
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:21,746
So an incredible boon, I think, to our city, both for all of its families and for businesses.

213
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:28,211
We will hope to have four concerts there again this August and offer all of our families

214
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:41,959
another opportunity to be together and it's a place where our goal is to have make sure that all families know that they belong to Medford and belong to every part of Medford and we like having that another place where they can belong.

215
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,440
So, good job.

216
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,182
More comments?

217
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:47,943
Yes?

218
00:19:56,367 --> 00:20:11,256
I just want to reinforce the importance of this project because not so many years ago it was idle for a long time and that's when a lot of the disrepair happened.

219
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,759
It's kind of typical, but now that

220
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:29,834
I would say about seven or eight years ago, various groups in the city, in particular Cachet in Medford, began organizing a major arts festival there.

221
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,396
It's a beautiful location along the river.

222
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:39,363
And as Marie said, it's a place where families and friends and

223
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,873
can come together and enjoy a relaxing day.

224
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:48,297
So I think that this is an appropriate project for this kind of money.

225
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,361
The entire city will benefit from it.

226
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:57,144
And I think a lot of other communities would hope that they would have something like this.

227
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:57,825
Thank you.

228
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:07,493
Thank you.

229
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,517
Heather Meeker Green, 73 Bonner Avenue in Medford.

230
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:15,602
I am currently on the board of the Medford Farmers Market, as you've heard.

231
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:19,366
It is an extremely important area for us now.

232
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:24,351
We have had the benefit and grace of being able to be by the river.

233
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:29,716
We've decided this year, because of the wonderful location, the increase in

234
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:34,761
community who has come to join us during the spring, summer, and now fall.

235
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:37,303
We've extended till October 25th.

236
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:41,366
So it is an extremely important project for us.

237
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,728
The foot traffic has increased.

238
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:49,152
We've created a community festival event every Thursday, pretty much, we have.

239
00:21:50,173 --> 00:21:54,676
Wonderful support from Medford Arts Council to help us with musicians.

240
00:21:54,756 --> 00:22:05,963
We have all kinds of businesses that come and local food and we've been able to support our EBT snap matching program and senior share to help feed our community.

241
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:19,673
So we really would love to see this beautiful piece of historic space be preserved for years and years to come so that our community can continue to enjoy it.

242
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:26,558
And whatever way we can support and help as a small volunteer run board, please let us know.

243
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,099
Thank you.

244
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:31,342
Thank you.

245
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,363
Do we have any more comments?

246
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:39,706
Well, thank you very much for your presentation and for the question and answer.

247
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:40,747
This has been very helpful.

248
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:56,373
Before I move on to the next applicant on the agenda, I just want to remind everyone, since a few people came in after the last time I made the reminder, that we have a sign-in sheet by the door, as well as comment cards.

249
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:59,475
And we invite people to submit written comments

250
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,418
if they prefer to do so instead of coming up to the mic.

251
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:15,787
And also, there are posters that you can sign to indicate whether you support or oppose any of the projects that have been proposed for this funding round.

252
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:25,174
And with that, I would like to invite the Somerville Community Corporation to give a presentation about the St.

253
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,355
Clement and St.

254
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,937
Francis Affordable Housing Unit development.

255
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:29,638
Thank you.

256
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:35,487
Thank you.

257
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:39,928
I'm going to do the best I can to not cough on any of you.

258
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:41,789
I'm fending off a cold a little bit.

259
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:49,410
My name is Danny LeBlanc, and I'm the chief executive officer of the Somerville Community Corporation.

260
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:54,751
I've lived in Somerville for the last 42 years, and I've been at the Somerville Community Corporation the last 18.

261
00:23:57,252 --> 00:24:01,953
So you might ask, why is the Somerville Community Corporation submitting a CPA proposal in Medford?

262
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,994
And so I'll explain that a little bit.

263
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:16,397
In Somerville, for most of the years of my organization's existence, which will be 50 years next year, we've been known as the principal affordable housing organization in the city.

264
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:21,219
We've developed 219 units of rental housing.

265
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:26,060
We've developed about 125 units of affordable ownership housing over the years.

266
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:33,044
We're also the principal organization that advocates for policies around affordability in Somerville.

267
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:38,027
Does anybody here not know that Somerville's gotten pretty expensive lately?

268
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:39,968
As I know Medford has as well.

269
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:46,272
And we do things like first-time home buyer training and financial education and so forth.

270
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:55,258
All of it in our mission in Somerville has been wrapped around the questions of affordability and diversity and trying to maintain that flavor in our community.

271
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:02,760
We saw an opportunity, frankly, I first stepped foot in St.

272
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,961
Clemens Elementary School in 1978, so 40 years ago.

273
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:13,964
I've been around for a while, and we happened to notice that the archdiocese, and you all know St.

274
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:23,147
Clemens, the elementary school is right literally on the line, so from a community process, most of the abutters actually residentially would be in Somerville.

275
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:27,691
So we took a look at it when we noticed that the elementary school was up for sale.

276
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:32,930
and began, or I shouldn't say for sale, it's actually for lease.

277
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:36,293
And I can explain that in detail if you want me to.

278
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:40,556
But we began to engage in conversations with the archdiocese.

279
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:43,438
We had had a history of working with them in Somerville.

280
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:46,040
Our organization purchased the former St.

281
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,523
Polycarp's Parish, which some of you may be familiar with, on Mystic Avenue in 2006.

282
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:55,227
And we developed some new housing there and preserved two of the buildings.

283
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:07,162
Along the way of discussions with the Catholic Archdiocese, they actually asked us if we might also be interested in a convent at St.

284
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:07,563
Francis.

285
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:12,510
which is much further into Medford than we had originally been looking to go.

286
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:19,534
But as an organization that's generally interested in questions of affordable housing and affordability in the region, we said, sure.

287
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,755
And we began to look at both of them.

288
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:27,718
And we've packaged the proposal, which I will say is still at a fairly early stage.

289
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,260
But we've had an architect look at both buildings.

290
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,544
In both cases, we would retrofit the existing buildings.

291
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:39,886
So the intention would be to preserve the buildings.

292
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:46,331
Possibly, we don't know this yet, but there may be some historic worthiness to both buildings, actually.

293
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:50,414
And our intention would be to preserve the shells and retrofit the insides.

294
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,283
I did not personally go inside the convent at St.

295
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,044
Francis but colleagues of mine did.

296
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:59,866
I did go into the elementary school at St.

297
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:06,150
Clemens and remarkably the classrooms as they exist divide up almost perfectly into unit sizes.

298
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:16,095
They're almost the exact square footage that you would want for unit sizes and our projections are that we could do 18 units adaptive reuse in St.

299
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:16,456
Clemens.

300
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,998
and 11 in the St.

301
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:19,838
Francis convent.

302
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,703
So we are requesting, we have a request for $600,000 of CPA funds.

303
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:36,978
I fully recognize that's a lot of money, and I'm used to doing affordable housing projects.

304
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,240
Our projection is that this would be a roughly $12 million project to do in total.

305
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:51,904
And the remainder of the funds would be a fairly complicated combination of state and federal sources, which our organization is sort of used to doing.

306
00:27:52,994 --> 00:28:02,359
Timeline-wise, I would say that this generally takes a couple of years to put together the financing for, and then probably a year of construction.

307
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,360
Again, our organization is used to that.

308
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,061
We're used to sort of waiting in line with the state.

309
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:10,963
That's just the way it works if you want to build affordable housing.

310
00:28:11,463 --> 00:28:14,805
But our intention would be to make all 29 units affordable.

311
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:21,084
We are still in the process of determining what kind of population.

312
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:27,306
The buildings are, they have beneficial features and some challenges.

313
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:29,666
So for example, parking is a challenge at St.

314
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:31,587
Clements, which is something we'd have to work on.

315
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:36,748
On the other hand, it is gonna be located between two of the new Green Line stops when those finally open.

316
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:42,109
So we're looking at all of that and looking at what would be the kind of the suitable population.

317
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,590
The one thing I can say for sure

318
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:55,358
is that it would be a relatively low to moderate income population that would be eligible for the kind of affordable housing and this would be restricted in perpetuity affordable housing.

319
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:59,501
So I think I'll leave it at that.

320
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:06,725
I'm sure there's probably lots of questions that maybe committee members and folks here would have and I'd be happy to answer any and all of them that I can.

321
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:13,469
Questions from the committee?

322
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:24,238
So I just bumped on, you said it's your intention to have them be affordable housing units.

323
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,489
Is that something that may not happen as you go down the road?

324
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:33,903
No.

325
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:43,449
Well, let me just say, we have never not done an affordable development in Somerville and we would not seek to do one in Medford.

326
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:54,235
I would tell you quite honestly, worst case scenario, we would walk away from the project and allow somebody else to develop it before we would develop a market rate use there.

327
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:55,896
That's just not what we're in business to do.

328
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:06,166
And you also said 600,000, but I think in your application it was 200 a year over three years?

329
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:06,646
Right.

330
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:11,928
That kind of, and we would be happy to sort of collaborate and work with the committee.

331
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:18,589
I'm being realistic about the time frame for these, so it would take us two to three years to get to completion.

332
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,170
So if it worked better,

333
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:29,275
What would be important for us to proceed would be some level of commitment from the municipality.

334
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:33,318
And it looks to me like CPA funds might be the most logical source.

335
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:39,582
It's very hard to proceed competitively for state funds and federal allocations if you don't have a local commitment.

336
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:48,728
But a commitment of 200,000 a year over three years would be perfectly fine to meet the needs of what we're trying to do and the timetable that we would anticipate anyway.

337
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,498
This is a question I think as much for the board as it is for you.

338
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:59,186
We're only voting on the request for this round, the 200,000, right?

339
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:02,510
We, can we encumber funds to a year or two ahead?

340
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,633
So the committee is not actually able to make a commitment in the future.

341
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:24,746
So we may decide amongst ourselves when we deliberate whether we would want to consider making one, two, or three years worth of commitment all at once in order to ensure that

342
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:38,532
the funding that you would have is available, given that we have, over the funding rounds that are available this year, two years' worth of funding that are in front of us right now.

343
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:44,995
And then next year, we would be able to access the third year of funding.

344
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:53,478
So that's a discussion that we'll have amongst ourselves, is how much we would want to put on the table versus leave to chance in the future.

345
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:54,078
Yeah.

346
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:57,739
I would just say that we'd be happy to work with the committee.

347
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:07,863
I'm accustomed to this because in Somerville we're both an applicant and I actually sit on the board that is responsible for allocating some of the CPA funds for housing.

348
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,243
So I understand how the rolling out can work.

349
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:13,244
Two questions if I could.

350
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:20,407
One is can you point to a project in Somerville or one that you've developed that would be a good model for what this is?

351
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:25,799
just so maybe the committee could see it, see how it fits into the context, understand.

352
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,860
We don't need an answer right now.

353
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,421
Just think about it and just get back to us if you could.

354
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:33,421
I'd be happy to do that.

355
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:46,485
And just to be a little bit more specific, are you looking for something that would be, is the most important thing that it be an adaptive reuse of an existing building or that it be a population roughly like what we're talking about?

356
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,026
I think it's a population in scale more than anything else.

357
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:53,889
But I mean, a couple, you can give us more than one, I just want to understand, because it's a new thing for us.

358
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,011
I haven't seen this before and I'm intrigued by it.

359
00:32:57,631 --> 00:33:05,095
I can follow up with you, but we actually have a 20-year-old building that was a historic renovation, 18 units right in Union Square.

360
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:09,558
So not a church property, but it was a restoration historic

361
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,121
and otherwise, and it's an all-affordable 18-unit building.

362
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,002
I could follow up with the address.

363
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:15,683
Sure.

364
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:16,984
A couple other questions.

365
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:22,229
I sit on the Historic Commission, so I'm curious about, you know, the architecture of the building, its significance.

366
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:31,437
Has it been looked at for its history, for, you know, there's a Form B that we normally develop for these properties that are going to be changed.

367
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:34,218
We don't usually do it unless they're being a threat of demolition.

368
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:38,219
This is obviously not that case, but it's a good thing, I think, to kind of put on the radar.

369
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:49,802
We haven't done that yet, but it would be our intention to, you know, our first steps are to actually secure the lease with the archdiocese, begin to secure funding around the affordability question.

370
00:33:50,702 --> 00:34:02,025
We do think, though, this is just a layman's view and our architect, but we do think, looking at the buildings, that there is some preservation worthiness there that we'd like to pay attention to once we get down the road.

371
00:34:02,285 --> 00:34:04,387
Yeah, I'm familiar with Davis Square Architects.

372
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:05,809
They're an excellent firm there.

373
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:06,510
Good choice there.

374
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:19,844
My final question is about the population, because I think the specifics says that you'll be considered to serve homeless and or disabled vets, people with disabilities, and other low-income populations.

375
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:20,165
Could you

376
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:24,873
Do you know exactly what that population is in any way at this point?

377
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:25,954
We don't yet.

378
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,617
We'd have to do more work on that.

379
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,280
Some of it depends on funding availability.

380
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,726
Some of it depends on a community process where the needs would be determined.

381
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,348
I mean, I think, for example, it's

382
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:44,451
It's commonly understood and accepted that vets are up against it for housing in many cases.

383
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:51,153
We have not actually done a veterans housing project, but it's something that we would look at.

384
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:54,454
There are certain funds that are dedicated for that kind of use.

385
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,695
We have done housing for formerly homeless households.

386
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,256
Huge need.

387
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:03,497
It's a way to get people out of motels and shelters and into permanent housing.

388
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:05,578
That's something we would consider.

389
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:09,937
These units are going to be relatively small households.

390
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:13,219
If you look at the unit size breakdowns, it's going to be one and two bedrooms.

391
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:19,141
So it's not, the buildings aren't very suitable for large families, so we're not going to be looking at that kind of housing.

392
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:32,006
So, but some of that is kind of the work that we'll do down the road in the community, see exactly what the interests and the needs are that have felt most in the community, what funding possibilities there are, and try to marry those.

393
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:33,427
Okay, thank you.

394
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,111
Hi, Danny.

395
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,374
This is a new kind of project for Medford.

396
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:52,758
So I think Medford residents have a couple of questions about the process.

397
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:00,345
Could you explain a little bit more community engagement, what that typically looks like on your real estate projects and how Medford residents

398
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:01,566
might be involved.

399
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:15,934
And then secondly, there have been some questions I know that have arisen already about, well, why would a Somerville Community Corporation come into Medford and why would we give money to provide housing to Somerville residents?

400
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:26,160
So can you just clarify exactly how Medford residents could benefit from this housing and whether there might be any local preference for Medford residents?

401
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:27,681
Yeah.

402
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:29,583
Let me start with that.

403
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:30,844
And what was the first question?

404
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:32,746
Community engagement.

405
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:33,066
OK.

406
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:37,650
Let me start with the second question first, because I had heard that that had come up.

407
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,835
And it's actually not our intention at all to build housing in Medford for Somerville residents.

408
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:47,339
Our intention would be to build housing in Medford that would have a first preference for Medford residents.

409
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:51,082
Now, there are laws about that, fair housing laws and others.

410
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:51,763
It isn't true.

411
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:56,866
And I've been in the trenches on this in Somerville for years.

412
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:03,529
Every project we've ever done, the local residents and local aldermen want the people on their street to get the housing.

413
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:04,850
That's kind of the way it goes.

414
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,091
You can't actually do that legally.

415
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:14,450
What we have been able to do in Somerville, though, and this is what we would do in Medford, is to create a 70% local preference.

416
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:26,522
And what that means is that 70% of the units in this project, the first people who would have a crack at those, and these are all distributed by lottery, would be Medford residents.

417
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:30,406
The only Medford residents would go into that pool for 70% of the units.

418
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:39,853
And the only way that non-Medford residents would get them is if there's not enough Medford residents who apply, which I think is doubtful, frankly, given my experience in Somerville.

419
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:45,637
And I say 70% because fair housing law, generally speaking, our experience is it won't let you go higher than that.

420
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,443
The other 30%, Medford residents are also allowed to be in that pool, but so is everybody else, okay?

421
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:58,207
So that's kind of how, and we don't have any intention in trying to preference Somerville people at all.

422
00:37:58,227 --> 00:37:59,367
That isn't what we would do.

423
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:03,349
It's what we do in Somerville and Medford, we'd be preferencing the local community here.

424
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,873
As far as community process, it's one of the things our organization prides ourself in.

425
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:11,274
I'm a community organizer by training.

426
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:12,415
That's what I've been doing for 40 years.

427
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:20,505
So we would, once we actually have site control, which we don't have yet, we're very close with the archdiocese.

428
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:25,311
I mentioned it's a little bit complicated because they want to lease these properties, not sell them.

429
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:30,518
That creates different layers of complexity and legal arrangement on the finances.

430
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,755
Honestly, for us, it'd be simpler if we could buy them from them, but that's not what's going to happen.

431
00:38:36,216 --> 00:38:46,288
Once we do that, once we're clear on that, and hopefully maybe once we have some commitment going forward of CPA funds, we would begin a process of reaching out to the community.

432
00:38:47,249 --> 00:39:00,528
Our method is to fly our neighborhoods, go door to door, and invite a pretty wide circumference of people to come and attend meetings and begin to tell people this is who we are, this is what we're thinking of doing, what do you think?

433
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:02,070
And then work from there.

434
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:09,062
We've done community processes that have been two or three meetings and everything's been fine and moved forward.

435
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:15,267
We've had community processes that have been a dozen meetings before we really get to the place where everybody's comfortable.

436
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:24,433
Our goal is always to be going to the zoning board because we'll inevitably need, you know, zoning approval with support from the local community.

437
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:28,917
And by the time we get to the zoning board, we seek to have that, so.

438
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:45,249
Actually, that brings up a question that I have, which is, have you had conversations with the city about how you would approach the permitting process for this project?

439
00:39:45,983 --> 00:40:08,183
In a general sense, yes, I think we haven't gotten down to the particulars yet, but we have met with the mayor once, and we've had several conversations with Lauren DiLorenzo from the Community Development Department about proceeding and what it would take to proceed in the Medford context, because for us, you know, we're used to zoning in Somerville, but it's Somerville, and we need to do this in Medford.

440
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:14,729
So we've had those conversations, I want to say preliminarily, so that we have an understanding of what we would need to do.

441
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:25,078
But again, we get at it in earnest once we get past the hurdle of having site control from the archdiocese and maybe the beginnings of some funding commitments.

442
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:37,447
So another question I have is, so you have indicated that you anticipate it might be a year or two that this project is in the pipeline to get funding, and then a year for construction.

443
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:46,350
But prior to it being in the pipeline to get funding, do you need, how much time do you think you need for the permitting process itself before you're ready to get into that pipeline?

444
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:49,154
It depends.

445
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,815
It depends on how that community process goes.

446
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:53,916
Honestly, that's the first stage of it.

447
00:40:54,516 --> 00:41:05,340
We're not going to want to file for zoning without having had enough community process to feel like we know where we're at and that the community surrounding these properties is comfortable with what we're proposing.

448
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:11,243
We hope that can happen in three to four months, but sometimes it takes longer, to be honest.

449
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:19,632
Another element of going to the state for funding, you need to show local financial commitment.

450
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,037
You also need to show progress locally on the zoning front.

451
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,120
That's a factor in applying.

452
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,861
So progress, not...

453
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:32,667
Not necessarily, but the closer you are to approval, the better your chances are, to be honest.

454
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:46,016
And anybody who's in my business knows that the lines at the state level are only getting longer, unfortunately, and there's typically one funding round a year, maybe once every 10 months, but it's close to once a year.

455
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,420
So we'll try to time everything with that and be as ready as we can to go forward.

456
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,581
Okay.

457
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:53,662
More questions from the board?

458
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,615
All right, comments, questions?

459
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,476
Where am I supposed to stand here?

460
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:03,876
Oh, OK.

461
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:09,038
Sorry.

462
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,098
My name is Tom Lincoln.

463
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:11,799
A couple of things here.

464
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:14,880
I'm a little unclear about something.

465
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,400
Forgive me if I'm a little thick here.

466
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,081
It's been a long day.

467
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:18,901
I hear you.

468
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:29,885
I understand that the process of putting together the funding involves many parties, many pots of money, typically, et cetera.

469
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:36,551
But it's not clear to me whether if you get CPA money, whether that would be contingent on getting the rest of the money.

470
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:42,896
Is it sort of earnest money, or is it certainly part of the pot, so to speak?

471
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:44,377
Can you explain that a little bit first?

472
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:49,882
Yeah, it would be a commitment unless and until

473
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,963
we secured the rest of the funding and were able to close on the financing of the entire project.

474
00:42:56,003 --> 00:43:05,348
So in other words, what I'm saying is the commitment would be there, but no dollars would be spent of CPA dollars unless and until the entire financial package was put together.

475
00:43:05,468 --> 00:43:14,774
So the obvious question is, if it takes, I have no idea, but say it takes five years, you're waiting in line with the state, you know, you're hoping that doesn't happen.

476
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:20,137
I mean, how long, maybe this is a question for the board too, how long can that commitment

477
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:21,309
last.

478
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,892
It's not like a life estate or something.

479
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:25,312
Yeah, no.

480
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:39,102
And one would, I would think, and I'll say honestly and with some pride, we've never bumped into this in some rule, but I would think at some point the Medford CPC would say, wait a minute, we might be able to put this money to better purposes.

481
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:40,423
And I think you have that right.

482
00:43:41,944 --> 00:43:43,745
That would be a question that they could answer.

483
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:44,506
Oh, OK.

484
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:45,406
But again,

485
00:43:48,468 --> 00:43:57,352
My expectation would be two to three years just based on the, you know, the 30 or so years of experience we have doing this in Somerville when we get a local commitment.

486
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,214
It used to be quicker, to be honest with you, but two or three years is more realistic now.

487
00:44:01,394 --> 00:44:04,975
So it will be faster than the Green Line then?

488
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:06,216
Yeah, I think so.

489
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:06,816
I hope so.

490
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:08,157
Okay, thanks.

491
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:14,529
I just want to respond to a couple of Tom's questions there.

492
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:27,360
One of the points is that the committee would be very likely to make funding contingent upon permitting and funding from other sources where there are projects that require those things.

493
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:38,008
So that if the permitting and funding from other sources don't come through, then the funding that we committed can be taken back and put back into the pool for everyone else.

494
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:49,718
And also, there's an understanding that for some kinds of projects like open space and recreation, they were ready to go yesterday and they'll spend the funds the moment that it's approved.

495
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:55,620
Whereas for a housing project, it can be expected to take longer for it to be ready.

496
00:44:56,141 --> 00:45:07,645
So we will probably have to apply a different standard to affordable housing projects in terms of when we anticipate projects being completed than the other types of projects.

497
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,067
More questions, comments?

498
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:11,267
Yeah.

499
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:21,421
Just for my understanding, I'm this is all new to me You said it was on the line of Medford and Somerville.

500
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:24,103
It's it would be a Medford address.

501
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:24,663
Is that correct?

502
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:26,224
It's a Medford address, right?

503
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:27,824
595 the the st.

504
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:29,345
Clemens property the st.

505
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:43,872
Francis is well into it, you know It's a Medford address but when you do zoning processes do it legally but also just the way we run a community process a lot of the Immediately surrounding community is actually in Somerville because it's right on the line

506
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:44,553
No, I understand that.

507
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:49,900
I just want to make sure it wasn't one of those where you have half the residents have a Somerville address, half have a Medford, but it's all Medford.

508
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:51,843
All the approvals will be Medford.

509
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:52,264
That's right.

510
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:53,565
And all the residents will be Medford.

511
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:54,627
Thank you.

512
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:57,391
Other questions and comments?

513
00:45:58,652 --> 00:45:58,833
Yes.

514
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:05,467
Hi, my name is Susan Campbell-Trainer, and I've been a parishioner of St.

515
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:06,949
Francis for 41 years.

516
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,336
Now, where do you intend, if you want to take over the convent, where are we going to park?

517
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:17,582
Because if I'm not mistaken, you have to have almost two parking spaces per unit.

518
00:46:20,025 --> 00:46:29,067
The exact parking requirement is something that we would have to determine down the road with the city and the planning board, the zoning board approval authorities.

519
00:46:29,447 --> 00:46:32,348
And we do understand that that's a tricky question at St.

520
00:46:32,428 --> 00:46:32,908
Francis.

521
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:41,190
One, we've only had conversations so far with the pastor and I'm forgetting the woman's name but a woman who does.

522
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:41,830
Laura.

523
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,431
Laura that does business at St.

524
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:43,911
Francis.

525
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:44,031
Yes.

526
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:48,412
As well as with the, you know, the guys from the archdiocese that do the real estate there.

527
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:50,994
That's a question we're going to have to work on.

528
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:52,955
It's also a question we're going to have to work on at St.

529
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:55,677
Clemens, too, for anybody who's familiar with the elementary school.

530
00:46:56,177 --> 00:47:02,722
So these are things that we'll discuss with folks in the community and try to figure out an answer that works.

531
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:08,146
And, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, if you can't come up with an answer that works, then you don't have a project.

532
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:10,008
But we think that it's possible over there.

533
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:13,592
Because we don't have a lot of land around the convent.

534
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:14,753
It's very, very small.

535
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:19,717
There's just a small parking lot that has a parking, like three cars.

536
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:20,778
There's nothing.

537
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:24,481
I mean, the nuns had a porch in the back, a screened-in porch.

538
00:47:24,501 --> 00:47:25,421
And that's where they sat.

539
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:28,184
There was no place for anybody to be around, children.

540
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:32,349
It's really, really, really tight space here.

541
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:35,293
And the lady next door will not sell to anybody.

542
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:36,454
I've heard that.

543
00:47:36,675 --> 00:47:36,915
Yes.

544
00:47:37,536 --> 00:47:44,865
I wanted to make an offer that she couldn't refuse, but she wouldn't because we could mow it down and that would take care of our parking lot.

545
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:48,468
Well, really, it's a very, very tight spot.

546
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:54,151
And the people who bought the school, they paid $750,000 for the condo on the top floor.

547
00:47:54,712 --> 00:47:55,952
And that's nothing to sneeze at.

548
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,974
And they have a beautiful parking lot.

549
00:47:58,434 --> 00:47:59,895
And now this is some...

550
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,904
this whole thing coming in, and I just was very concerned.

551
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,746
I'm very concerned, as you can tell.

552
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:15,133
But the preservation, I just couldn't picture why you'd even come and ask for money from them.

553
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:20,418
This is the first time we've heard of this.

554
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,580
We did not hear about this before.

555
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,241
We heard about the convent.

556
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:26,903
Because I'm on the parish council.

557
00:48:27,063 --> 00:48:31,646
But none of this was mentioned about you coming to the city and asking for money for this.

558
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:36,429
And my honest opinion right now is I don't see why we should give it to them.

559
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:40,451
However, this is just in the preliminary whole thing.

560
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:41,752
And there's going to be a lot.

561
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:45,514
I'm sure I'm not the only person in town who feels this way.

562
00:48:45,894 --> 00:48:48,676
And I mean, this is nothing against you, because you have a business.

563
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:50,437
And you're obviously here to make money.

564
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:51,978
And that's the life.

565
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,462
There's a lot of people, and the people who live all around there, they have a beautiful neighborhood.

566
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:05,785
And the people who abut it, I mean, it's such a small piece of land.

567
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:07,526
It really is.

568
00:49:08,326 --> 00:49:12,168
And I don't know if any of you have been down around our convent or anything, but it's very, very tiny.

569
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:19,152
So, well, I didn't mean to upset anybody, but it's just a point of contact.

570
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:23,074
If I could, the first set of questions you're raising,

571
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:29,338
completely understood, as I said, I live and work in Somerville, so I'm used to tight parking and all that kind of stuff.

572
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:33,842
We would expect to have that conversation with folks in the community.

573
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:39,286
As to the second question, I just want to explain it has to do with the affordability.

574
00:49:39,406 --> 00:49:48,753
I think one of the funding priorities for Community Preservation Act funds on the state level is to support affordable housing.

575
00:49:48,773 --> 00:49:50,294
This would be a 100% affordable development.

576
00:49:52,135 --> 00:50:06,701
And it actually, part of the reason why it takes two or three years, just to be honest, I'm used to doing these numbers, it takes about a quarter of a million dollars per unit to make something permanently affordable.

577
00:50:06,822 --> 00:50:08,422
That's a huge figure, I realize.

578
00:50:09,163 --> 00:50:21,308
So some amount of local money along with all the other state and federal money, that's just what it takes to make housing affordable permanently as opposed to five or six or $700,000 condos that we see everywhere.

579
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:34,541
So that's, we're pitching that, and obviously if there's support for that, that's what we would like to do, and if there's questions and concerns about that, we'll be there to have conversations for sure before this ever gets to the zoning board.

580
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:36,062
Okay, thank you.

581
00:50:41,287 --> 00:50:42,668
I left the prison, now I'm in the convent.

582
00:50:43,008 --> 00:50:45,470
Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street.

583
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:50,973
I think one of the problems is that we were a little bit blindsided.

584
00:50:51,073 --> 00:50:52,194
I'm a parishioner of St.

585
00:50:52,214 --> 00:50:52,655
Francis.

586
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,036
So there's a couple of issues going on here.

587
00:50:56,217 --> 00:50:58,398
These are the folks in the audience that have really made St.

588
00:50:58,438 --> 00:50:59,299
Francis what it is.

589
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,481
So we just had to collaborate with St.

590
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,122
Joseph's over the last couple of years.

591
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:05,203
So that was a tough.

592
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:05,943
hit.

593
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:10,145
Second of all, the convent, we were generating $10,000 a month.

594
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:11,665
That's $120,000 annualized that we're losing.

595
00:51:11,685 --> 00:51:13,126
That's what we were getting, $10,000 a month from that property.

596
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:22,470
We've rented it.

597
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,532
I can address that one a little bit if you want to, but go ahead.

598
00:51:25,812 --> 00:51:26,993
You continue first.

599
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:31,557
So now we're in a position where we need transparency.

600
00:51:32,978 --> 00:51:47,950
Folks didn't know about this until Saturday or Sunday, Danny, and we're all for having those units remodeled, whatever, but there's a couple of other issues too.

601
00:51:49,863 --> 00:51:57,490
The way that you have it stated, it will be allocated for people with disabilities, homeless, veterans, special needs, et cetera.

602
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:59,032
So it's a wide array, which is great.

603
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,815
My background is actually, I used to be a cop surveyor.

604
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:07,961
So I used to go across the country and evaluate facilities to make sure they were in compliance with the law, et cetera.

605
00:52:08,822 --> 00:52:09,863
But now we've just...

606
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:21,173
built a condo, okay, which is within, I don't know, 25 yards, and I had a friend's son come in yesterday to look at the second level.

607
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:22,755
A million dollars they're asking.

608
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,138
As Susan said, the top floor just went for $750,000.

609
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,886
Okay, it was a million dollars as of yesterday.

610
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,347
They went to the open house.

611
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:46,193
So that's going to be the other elephant in the room, too, is that, you know, you're going out to buy a condo, and again, I'm all for, you know, mixed use, integration, heightened people with disabilities, the AD Act.

612
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:53,658
But there's a number of issues that we need to address and we need to start now, whether it be, you know, the pastor, the archdiocese.

613
00:52:53,698 --> 00:53:01,384
The archdiocese just gave $500,000 to Arch Street for a mental health clinic for women who are homeless, which is great.

614
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:06,848
So it's not that we're opposed to it, but it has to be done properly and there has to be some transparency.

615
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:09,989
So two things I will say.

616
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:13,991
I'm not going to speak for the archdiocese because I don't represent the archdiocese.

617
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:19,473
And it's a little challenging for us because we don't have the agreement yet with the archdiocese.

618
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:24,475
So it would actually have been inappropriate for us to come around and start talking to people at this point.

619
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:26,476
And I'm not going to answer for the archdiocese.

620
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:29,817
any questions of transparency on their side.

621
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:39,260
The one thing I can say, though, because I do know the business side of this, is that the parish will still be getting a comparable, if not slightly greater, lease payment out of this.

622
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,480
That's why the Archdiocese wants to lease.

623
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,721
They want that regular flow of funds to the parish.

624
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,882
That's why we've been in negotiations.

625
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:53,312
For 99 years, well, 99 years we treat as forever.

626
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:56,173
None of us will be around 99 years from now.

627
00:53:56,193 --> 00:54:03,175
But I suspect there would be a renegotiation for anybody who's around then, and payments would continue.

628
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:07,676
They don't want to sell the property, I think, in part because they want to retain cash flow to the parishes.

629
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:08,836
This is true of St.

630
00:54:08,856 --> 00:54:09,396
Clement's too.

631
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:12,457
But I'm not going to speak to the transparency question.

632
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:16,098
I'll let you take that up with the archdiocese and the parish leaders.

633
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:22,380
All right, thank you.

634
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:38,527
Shouldn't you talk to the abutters and everybody before this goes much further to let them know what's going on and to, I mean, as Cindy just said, a million dollars for a condo and it's like, you know, a stone's throw away from this building.

635
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:46,751
I think that the abutters, do they know about this, this coming in, this section eight or the, you know, and I don't have a problem with helping people, believe me, but

636
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:51,375
this is a beautiful neighborhood all around it.

637
00:54:52,396 --> 00:54:55,198
And it's very small land, extremely small.

638
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:59,782
Yeah, I mean, I accept that all as part of the process that we'll go forward on.

639
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:06,287
And I think as you've heard, I guess all I can say is that it's a reasonable question to say, how come we're here?

640
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:09,248
And we haven't started that part of the process yet.

641
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:14,732
Our experience in Somerville would say you kind of have to assemble things in pieces.

642
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:23,116
And typically, we wouldn't start a community process until we actually have an agreement with the seller, or in this case, the entity that's going to lease to us.

643
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:24,237
It's the archdiocese.

644
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:26,158
That's the way we've done things in Somerville.

645
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:34,143
We are often in the position of having to put in funding requests because of timing and cycles before we engage the community.

646
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:43,392
I fully expect to get the full brunt of this when we do go out into the community, all the questions that people would have, all the concerns, so forth.

647
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:46,836
We'd be prepared for that, I guess is all I would say.

648
00:55:47,957 --> 00:55:48,758
Okay, thank you.

649
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:55,384
Do we have more questions and comments?

650
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:55,725
Yes?

651
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:04,126
There was one thing I don't think you mentioned, Danny, but I heard in the comments about the development side of things.

652
00:56:04,146 --> 00:56:09,632
Can you just clarify that you're a non-profit developer?

653
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:10,794
Yeah, I'm sorry.

654
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,315
We are a non-profit developer.

655
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:18,820
And I will say, I guess it came up that we're in business to make money.

656
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,022
We're kind of in business to sustain our business so that we can keep doing affordable housing.

657
00:56:23,482 --> 00:56:27,605
And yes, people, we have to make enough money for people to get paid in order to do that.

658
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:30,886
But that's, this is a non-profit development.

659
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:38,250
And the way the finances get structured, there's a fixed fee that comes from this that our organization earns.

660
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:40,812
And frankly, if we don't build, we don't earn anything.

661
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:42,833
We spend our time and we don't make any money.

662
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:49,180
But all of the proceeds go back into the organization to try to keep doing more work like this, basically.

663
00:56:50,835 --> 00:56:52,316
Just a couple quick comments.

664
00:56:53,296 --> 00:57:05,261
In a previous affordable housing application at our last meeting, the issue of parking came up and obviously Medford has zoning that's decades old requiring two cars per unit.

665
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:16,646
I think believe the applicants in that application, which is a site that is actually not as connected, doesn't have a red line and a green line stop literally five and ten minutes away from this property.

666
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:24,554
They didn't think it would be a lot less than two for the demand side because of the population, because of your population.

667
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:26,707
Experience with that.

668
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:30,810
I think that's an important thing when you go out to the community and obviously it's clear You have work to do here.

669
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:37,775
Yeah for multiple reasons that you need to Show those debt show the demographics show the demand side.

670
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:48,264
Yeah, you know that people are not gonna have two cars per unit This is almost no apartment built today in Medford or some of them comes anywhere near that demand wise It's just not happening anymore.

671
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:49,385
It's dropping every year and

672
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:52,927
So I think that's an important thing to keep on top of.

673
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:53,388
Yeah.

674
00:57:53,468 --> 00:57:56,030
And I will say just thanks for that invitation.

675
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,592
And we would produce this data for people.

676
00:57:58,672 --> 00:58:10,401
But in the units that we own in Somerville, and I realize Somerville is not Medford, it averages out to a half a car per unit across our whole 219 units that we own right now.

677
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:12,783
Some of that is it's low income people.

678
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:14,585
Some of it is the availability of transit.

679
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:16,466
And that's a cheaper alternative for people.

680
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:17,067
Thank you.

681
00:58:20,168 --> 00:58:20,368
Yes.

682
00:58:28,273 --> 00:58:32,595
Hi, I'm David Brosnan, 32 Cotting Street in Medford.

683
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:38,959
I'm also a board member at Medford Community Housing, so I'm very much in favor of affordable housing.

684
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:41,920
But I'm curious about a couple of things.

685
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:49,225
The first thing is that in your application, it said that you would deal with zoning issues

686
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:55,819
through the use of 40B, Chapter 40B of the state law.

687
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:03,989
And in our experience, that has never really happened before in Medford.

688
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,432
So I'm wondering.

689
00:59:08,555 --> 00:59:13,018
Have you had discussions with the city about doing a 40B development?

690
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:14,460
Yeah, we have.

691
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,142
And let me characterize it.

692
00:59:17,462 --> 00:59:19,804
We would call this a friendly 40B.

693
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:22,445
In the world of 40B, there's friendly and unfriendly.

694
00:59:22,886 --> 00:59:28,610
The unfriendly is when a developer is trying to move forward despite significant opposition in the community.

695
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,813
We have had conversations with Lauren DiLorenzo in particular.

696
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:34,454
And we're aware that this would be new.

697
00:59:35,275 --> 00:59:47,644
for Medford and some of the conversations that my colleagues have had with Lauren around what would that look like and would it work and is it something to be feared or not.

698
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:54,629
The reality of Chapter 40B is that it allows you to go forward comprehensively in some ways that

699
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:00,973
It sort of streamlines the zoning process in ways that you can't do without using 40B.

700
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:11,558
And of course, as you know, in Medford, the community is under the 10% statutory standard for the use of 40B, although it is true

701
01:00:12,578 --> 01:00:18,660
in other communities, you can actually use 40B for the streamlining impact even if you're above 10%.

702
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:24,082
So that would be our intention because our experience says that that's the most effective way to go forward.

703
01:00:24,602 --> 01:00:30,044
But we would, again, we wouldn't want to do it in an unfriendly atmosphere.

704
01:00:30,104 --> 01:00:38,127
So we would work our tails off to have the conversations with the community and the city so that everybody was comfortable when we went forward.

705
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:38,747
Okay.

706
01:00:39,147 --> 01:00:40,668
The other little

707
01:00:41,228 --> 01:01:07,846
Curiosity in my mind is that with one of our applications, the issue had been raised I think by Roberta of the anti-aid amendment that it was somehow unlawful to use city money to support a non-profit organization directly.

708
01:01:10,663 --> 01:01:15,448
I'm wondering how does that work when you're paying a lease to a church?

709
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:18,171
Does that actually?

710
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:18,251
Yes.

711
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:37,908
So where we would have to have a concern about the anti-aid amendment is that city funds, in this case CPA funds, could not be used to benefit a non-profit organization.

712
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:44,354
But in the case of developing affordable housing, the city funds are being used to develop affordable housing.

713
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:57,265
And so if their organization has a long-term relationship with another organization, that's outside of the process of developing affordable housing.

714
01:01:57,285 --> 01:02:06,632
I think that was, so I think that addresses the anti-aid amendment.

715
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:08,013
I don't think that that would be an issue here.

716
01:02:12,965 --> 01:02:17,572
Are you basing this on a legal opinion you've gotten from something?

717
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:20,677
From the city or from the state?

718
01:02:26,135 --> 01:02:46,967
This is my understanding of how the NTA amendment applies and why it is that we can provide, we can use CPA funds to support projects that are creating an asset for the city and affordable housing is defined as one of the assets that we can use.

719
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:48,929
City funds to create.

720
01:02:50,830 --> 01:03:07,707
There are many, many of the organizations that may be eligible to utilize CPA funds have additional activities that are not creating new assets and we are not funding those activities.

721
01:03:08,147 --> 01:03:14,113
but we are funding activities that are eligible for CPA funding.

722
01:03:14,473 --> 01:03:18,557
So creating new affordable housing is an eligible activity.

723
01:03:19,778 --> 01:03:26,344
Supporting the operating, the operations of an organization may not be an eligible activity.

724
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:32,229
That's the anti-aid amendment to the Massachusetts state constitution.

725
01:03:32,249 --> 01:03:33,110
Yeah.

726
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,418
All right, thank you very much.

727
01:03:54,665 --> 01:04:04,037
Next on our agenda, we would like to invite the Medford Housing Authority to talk with us about LaPrize Village gas conversion.

728
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:15,146
Good evening.

729
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:16,908
My name is Jeffrey Driscoll.

730
01:04:17,248 --> 01:04:20,271
I am the executive director of the Medford Housing Authority.

731
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:30,843
With me this evening, Arlosa Janvia, who is the chairperson of the Medford Housing Authority Board of Commissioners and also a resident at LaPree Village.

732
01:04:31,572 --> 01:04:36,375
and Gabriel Ciccarella who is our Director of Modernization and Procurement.

733
01:04:36,936 --> 01:04:49,745
I'm here this evening to speak about the oil to gas conversion of the heating systems at LaPree Village and I'd like to pass out a handout to each one of the board members.

734
01:05:16,273 --> 01:05:21,438
This is intended to provide a supplement to our application to provide you with some additional information.

735
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:28,744
LaPree Village is one of eight public housing developments in the city of Medford.

736
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:44,313
The Medford Housing Authority has 843 public housing units that provide subsidized housing to individuals, elderly, disabled, and families.

737
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,921
LaPree Village is one of seven federally subsidized developments.

738
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:53,102
It's subsidized by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

739
01:05:54,362 --> 01:05:58,103
There are 142 units at LaPree Village.

740
01:05:58,343 --> 01:06:01,284
LaPree Village is a family development.

741
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,925
And it is, we are requesting, excuse me, 138 units to convert from oil

742
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:10,535
to gas.

743
01:06:11,456 --> 01:06:28,652
The primary emphasis of this is the fact that it is an extreme hardship for our residents to maintain oil tanks, in particular during the winter, when the cost of oil is in the vicinity of approximately $700 per tank.

744
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:33,236
It's the responsibility of the residents.

745
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:45,710
What occurs then is that the residents who don't provide sufficient oil for their heating system utilize their ovens, and in some cases, space heaters.

746
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:49,873
for the heating of the unit.

747
01:06:50,653 --> 01:07:06,105
You'll see in the handout that we have a letter from the MedFed fire department, in particular the chief, indicating concern with the use of ovens to heat apartments.

748
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:10,088
This was an issue that was raised to us by the residents.

749
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:22,043
Majority of the residents who live at this site are 30% or below of the median income.

750
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:22,763
That's $16,000.

751
01:07:24,645 --> 01:07:29,889
There's a definitive need for us to be able to address their needs, their concerns.

752
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:32,190
They are all residents of Medford.

753
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:38,095
There are over 400 individuals who reside at that development.

754
01:07:39,172 --> 01:07:47,185
The Housing Authority does not have the ability at this point in time to address this, and that's why we're looking for $452,000.

755
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:53,375
That price has been developed through our modernization department.

756
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:59,163
That is an estimate that we anticipate will be a solid estimate.

757
01:07:59,623 --> 01:08:11,252
We have also gotten from National Grid a commitment of over $100,000 for them to provide gas lines into the development and up to the building.

758
01:08:11,572 --> 01:08:12,613
We will core the building.

759
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:15,114
We will pipe inside the building.

760
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:21,098
We will change the gun on the heating system, the boiler right now.

761
01:08:21,658 --> 01:08:26,281
And we will also dismantle, remove the oil tanks.

762
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:36,147
And we will safely dispose of, through certified contractors, the remaining oil that is in the tank.

763
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:48,655
The significance here is that the Housing Authority has a concern insofar as we do not want to see our residents put themselves in danger.

764
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:53,438
The buildings themselves have units that are adjacent to each other.

765
01:08:53,899 --> 01:09:00,083
If there is a fire in one, very likely that it is going to impact up to possibly six total units.

766
01:09:00,823 --> 01:09:11,809
There's a significant concern for the residents who are providing the appropriate level of oil and heat in the units that other folks are not doing that.

767
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:18,512
And as much as we try to counsel the residents to work with them, we have situations where we do have fires.

768
01:09:19,052 --> 01:09:19,933
We do address that.

769
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:29,738
In discussions with the fire department, they indicated that there is a great and significant concern for individuals who do this in order to heat their units.

770
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:43,294
We have an anticipation that if we were funded for this, we would have this complete by the next heating season and that's next fall.

771
01:09:44,495 --> 01:09:56,021
I have for the committee a project manual for siding replacement at Willis Avenue.

772
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:58,662
There we're replacing siding, we're replacing windows.

773
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:08,120
January 31st of 2018, we began this construction this past week.

774
01:10:09,281 --> 01:10:13,425
So that this is a similar project, similar amount of money, approximately $450,000.

775
01:10:13,866 --> 01:10:17,810
I'm going to leave that here so the committee can take a look at it.

776
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:22,215
We will have the ability to immediately

777
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,571
immediately begin to bid this.

778
01:10:24,651 --> 01:10:25,652
It will be publicly bid.

779
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:30,434
Housing Authority has statutory requirements to ensure that we do publicly bid that.

780
01:10:30,955 --> 01:10:34,016
We have requirements from HUD that we have to follow.

781
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:36,938
But we're fully prepared to be able to expend the money.

782
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:38,879
There's a contingency that's built into that.

783
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,341
We will have our modernization department

784
01:10:42,921 --> 01:10:51,405
working with an engineer to ensure that this is done correctly and expediently.

785
01:10:51,745 --> 01:11:02,871
If we can just take a look quickly at what I've provided to you, there's on the first page, you'll see that there's some pictures of LaPree Village, a short synopsis of the project.

786
01:11:03,811 --> 01:11:05,832
There's an aerial view of LaPree.

787
01:11:07,853 --> 01:11:11,315
You'll see on the third page is the correspondence from the fire department.

788
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:30,728
You'll see on the fourth page is correspondence from National Grid indicating their willingness to provide 1,500 feet of 4-inch gas main, 2-inch services to 28 buildings with 142 new meters.

789
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:43,921
As I said, there are four buildings, excuse me, four units that have already been converted because they're accessible.

790
01:11:44,522 --> 01:11:50,184
We also have a design that we provided, a schematic that we provided to you in the application that we provide to you again.

791
01:11:51,844 --> 01:11:59,647
In addition, the Housing Authority has received in-kind services of approximately $2 million.

792
01:12:01,355 --> 01:12:09,220
over the course of the last few years in cooperation and in coordination with National Grid.

793
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:25,871
The Housing Authority has changed out the majority of its boiler systems, its hot water systems, has undertaken a significant improvement of the lighting, all with the attempt to go green.

794
01:12:26,897 --> 01:12:34,600
The Saltonstall building, where our office is located, it's an 11-story building, has solar panels on the roof.

795
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:54,026
We feel that this, and this is only a secondary aspect of this project, but we feel that in going from oil to gas, we will be impacting significantly the environment because the burning of gas is much cleaner than the burning of oil.

796
01:12:55,472 --> 01:13:11,125
So we would ask your support, not for the Medford Housing Authority, but we would ask your support for the residents at LaPree Village, because this really is a safety issue, and this is something that needs to be addressed, and it is something that we need to do.

797
01:13:11,906 --> 01:13:20,853
As I indicated, and I need to emphasize, our residents, the majority of our residents, are 30% or below the median income, $16,000.

798
01:13:21,574 --> 01:13:24,036
They do not have, and they are required to have,

799
01:13:25,273 --> 01:13:35,615
cash, not a credit card, not a check, but they're required to have cash available when that oil truck comes to deliver oil when it's three degrees out.

800
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:41,057
And they have to make a choice as far as whether or not they're going to heat their apartment or feed their children.

801
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,657
And so that's what we're faced with.

802
01:13:43,617 --> 01:13:52,319
We have an anticipation and a hope that we are going to be of assistance with them, and we ask for your assistance to allow us to do that.

803
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:54,320
Thank you.

804
01:13:57,085 --> 01:13:57,445
Thank you.

805
01:13:57,505 --> 01:13:58,806
Do we have questions from the board?

806
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:03,890
Thank you.

807
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:16,300
I note that on your application, it is noted that the MHA may be able to consider phasing for the project over a few years, but only be able to do so if there was a commitment of funds for future years.

808
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:23,985
And that in addition, that you do not have a commitment from National Grid for their donation of their services for anything less than the $138

809
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:29,973
And do you have any documentation of that commitment from National Grid?

810
01:14:30,213 --> 01:14:33,575
We have the correspondence that they provided to us indicating a willingness.

811
01:14:34,196 --> 01:14:35,457
They sent us also a contract.

812
01:14:35,497 --> 01:14:40,400
I was going to include that, but it's just a basic service contract for them to come out and do that.

813
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,204
That correspondence is our acceptance of going forward with what they proposed in the letter that I provided to you.

814
01:14:50,446 --> 01:14:54,409
And if I can just address the first comment, and that is to do this phased in.

815
01:14:55,565 --> 01:15:03,613
We would hope not to do that in a phased-in project or process simply because of the significance that we place on this.

816
01:15:04,474 --> 01:15:08,578
When we were looking for a project to undertake,

817
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,241
and to provide to this committee for consideration.

818
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:18,144
We had numerous projects to think of and we could have come forward with any one of that.

819
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:21,106
But this was of significance to us.

820
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:25,788
It was raised by the residents who indicated to us that this is a legitimate safety concern.

821
01:15:26,169 --> 01:15:38,195
And quite frankly, I think that's, to me as the executive director, that's my responsibility to ensure that our residents are safe so that any other project was certainly at least in second place to this.

822
01:15:45,025 --> 01:15:52,067
I thought I was going to get off easy here.

823
01:15:52,747 --> 01:16:03,030
I understand the cost factor with the oil and they have to pay up front, but if they can't pay for the oil, what happens with the gas when they can't pay?

824
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:09,792
You know, it's a lot longer before they shut them off, but there's still a monetary cost there that they have to pay for the gas.

825
01:16:10,312 --> 01:16:12,173
So how does National Grid address that?

826
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:18,711
It's my understanding that National Grid will work with them during the wintertime as far as the shutoffs are concerned.

827
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:23,954
More importantly to us is the fact that we would be able to work with our residents.

828
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:26,115
We have a vested interest in the building.

829
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:27,336
We don't want to see the pipes freeze.

830
01:16:27,977 --> 01:16:32,919
And we had some issues this year with frozen pipes when it was three degrees out.

831
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,160
We don't want to see that occur.

832
01:16:35,881 --> 01:16:39,443
We are going to have a discussion with National Grid because I know

833
01:16:40,043 --> 01:17:03,181
From my experience at other housing authorities that there's an ability to be a backup So that when someone's heat is going to be shut off it's transferred to the owner of the property which would be the housing authority I Know on the residential side a national grid in the past that's come across with a lot more funding to convert to gas Why are they not doing in the public sector where they're still going to get a customer out of it?

834
01:17:04,523 --> 01:17:10,165
It's my understanding that, and I said that it's over $100,000, which they're providing.

835
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:12,606
That's an estimate on our part.

836
01:17:12,786 --> 01:17:14,567
It could be in excess of that.

837
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:24,091
Their willingness to bring in 1,500 feet of gas lines is something that we could not accomplish without their assistance.

838
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:29,993
I understand that, but at the end, they're walking away with,

839
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:31,751
more customers.

840
01:17:32,512 --> 01:17:34,312
Wouldn't it behoove them to bring in the gasoline?

841
01:17:34,873 --> 01:17:40,475
I'm willing to discuss that further with them as far as if there's anything else that they will be able to provide to us.

842
01:17:41,275 --> 01:17:44,096
At this point, that's what they have offered to us.

843
01:17:45,057 --> 01:17:47,878
I mean, at Medford High Project, they brought in a high pressure line.

844
01:17:48,338 --> 01:17:48,518
Right.

845
01:17:48,738 --> 01:17:52,400
And the cost was, as long as we used the gas, they were providing it.

846
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,240
There's no cost.

847
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,161
There's no national grade cost here at all.

848
01:17:58,302 --> 01:18:00,643
They're bringing those in to us free of charge.

849
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,249
They're bringing the gas lines in.

850
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:02,770
Yes, sir.

851
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:03,370
Yes.

852
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:04,972
All the way to the buildings.

853
01:18:04,992 --> 01:18:06,233
So just the conversion?

854
01:18:07,114 --> 01:18:08,435
We're looking at the conversion costs.

855
01:18:08,495 --> 01:18:08,856
Yes, sir.

856
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:11,138
Are they kicking in for any of the conversion costs?

857
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:11,598
No, they're not.

858
01:18:11,678 --> 01:18:14,641
What they're doing is they're bringing the lines to each one of the 28 buildings.

859
01:18:15,763 --> 01:18:17,905
And in some case, that's a fairly long distance.

860
01:18:18,926 --> 01:18:19,386
Thank you.

861
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:19,967
Thank you.

862
01:18:22,249 --> 01:18:23,210
Other questions from the board?

863
01:18:26,985 --> 01:18:29,607
Thank you for all the work that you and your colleagues do.

864
01:18:29,627 --> 01:18:33,951
I'm a neighbor actually on Riverside Ave, just a few blocks away.

865
01:18:35,032 --> 01:18:40,716
Definitely interested in seeing improvements and investment in the property.

866
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:44,539
My question is around

867
01:18:45,695 --> 01:18:57,251
It looks like the stoves are electric, so I'm just curious as to how that will address the public safety issue, if there's still an issue.

868
01:18:57,271 --> 01:19:00,315
And maybe part of it is what you just answered with Mike around,

869
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:10,682
You know, the housing authority can be the backup so that the gas won't get shut off, but it looks like what's the incentive not to continue using the electric stove?

870
01:19:10,882 --> 01:19:11,662
Very good question.

871
01:19:12,382 --> 01:19:16,505
The incentive is that there will be no necessity to do that because they will have heat.

872
01:19:17,465 --> 01:19:18,646
They'll have the natural gas.

873
01:19:18,686 --> 01:19:22,688
What's happening now is that the oil tanks run dry.

874
01:19:23,988 --> 01:19:31,050
They have to pay to have them primed, and they have to pay for the oil to be put in there, and they don't have the ability to do that.

875
01:19:31,451 --> 01:19:34,832
So in the meantime, they use the electric stoves, which overheat.

876
01:19:35,892 --> 01:19:42,534
And anything in the vicinity of that, there's a very high likelihood that they will catch on fire.

877
01:19:43,795 --> 01:19:47,076
And we have had burned out stoves on a number of occasions.

878
01:19:48,831 --> 01:20:00,960
My second tough question is how does the CPA investment relate to the housing authority's ongoing capital and maintenance plans?

879
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:19,172
You know, my question always when a public agency is asking us to fund them is, you know, we want to make sure that we're funding things that the public can't fund, right, that the, you know, nonprofits and others need assistance with.

880
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:24,094
So I just want to understand, you know, is this a one-off thing?

881
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:29,915
Is, you know, how does it fit in with overall investments in the property?

882
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:45,880
Well, if you were to look at the President's budget that was announced within the last month to maybe month and a half, you will see that he has eliminated

883
01:20:46,561 --> 01:20:56,828
the capital fund program, which the housing authority would utilize to rehabilitate its property, which the housing authority would use to pay for this.

884
01:20:57,508 --> 01:21:01,871
The difficulty is that even if that program is not eliminated,

885
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:10,653
Neither the federal government nor the state government provide the housing authority with sufficient funds to be able to modernize its developments.

886
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:16,855
The eight developments that we have do not get anywhere near the sufficient funds that are necessary.

887
01:21:18,355 --> 01:21:26,717
To do that, we have to look at those things that are most important, and this to us was extraordinarily important, and that's why we're coming here today.

888
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:37,257
because we think that this is, the funding for this would not be in the forefront if it weren't before this committee.

889
01:21:38,778 --> 01:21:42,302
We would not be able to do this, certainly not before the next heating season.

890
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:57,465
I'm going to follow up with a question related to this, and that is, would this project be eligible for CDBG funding, and have you sought CDBG funds for this project or projects like this?

891
01:21:58,085 --> 01:21:58,646
We haven't.

892
01:21:59,306 --> 01:22:04,268
We have sought funding for our state development, Walkling Court.

893
01:22:05,369 --> 01:22:09,511
Just recently, we had requested approximately $160,000 worth of funding for

894
01:22:14,114 --> 01:22:18,097
projects that we want to undertake at Walkling Court.

895
01:22:18,818 --> 01:22:21,660
Those were also priority issues for us.

896
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:26,204
It was with sidewalk repair, it was with curb repair, which were trip and falls.

897
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:33,389
It was with the replacement of smoke detectors, seal tube detectors, things such as that.

898
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:38,413
We're always looking at, we would love to have additional funds to be able to do things.

899
01:22:39,294 --> 01:22:45,940
that don't border on health and safety, but unfortunately we don't get sufficient funds to be able to do that.

900
01:22:47,081 --> 01:22:50,064
The way that the Housing Authority works is we don't receive a tax dollar.

901
01:22:50,524 --> 01:22:51,705
We don't receive tax dollars.

902
01:22:51,765 --> 01:22:54,848
We have to exist on the rents that are collected.

903
01:22:55,529 --> 01:22:59,873
So that if it costs us a million dollars to run

904
01:23:01,742 --> 01:23:08,645
121 Riverside apartments, and our rents equal $800,000, then the federal government will give us a subsidy of $200,000.

905
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:24,772
If we collect $1.1 million, and the cost to run that development is $1 million a year, then we will have an additional $100,000 that we would put into our reserve account, our savings account.

906
01:23:25,152 --> 01:23:26,493
And we would be able to utilize that

907
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:31,591
to be able to undertake projects such as this and developments such as L'Pree.

908
01:23:32,491 --> 01:23:38,253
That's the way it works across the entire spectrum of our public housing developments.

909
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:42,395
We're dealing with people who pay 30% of their income.

910
01:23:42,775 --> 01:23:46,396
51% of the people who live at L'Pree Village have an income of $16,000 or less.

911
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:59,695
30% of their income isn't sufficient for us to be able to run LaPree Village without the assistance of CDBG or without the assistance of you folks here.

912
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:04,679
So you have used CDBG funds for LaPree Village in the past?

913
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:06,320
That I'm not aware of.

914
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,161
Lohser, I will ask you that.

915
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:11,523
I'm not aware that the authority has.

916
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:15,185
I've been the executive director since June of last year.

917
01:24:16,206 --> 01:24:17,327
Kind of a difficult question.

918
01:24:17,347 --> 01:24:19,808
A little bit more difficult than the ones you asked.

919
01:24:20,349 --> 01:24:27,594
But I can tell you that we are interested in partnering with the city in any way, shape, or form that will help our residents.

920
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:29,265
Okay.

921
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:40,131
Another question that I have, I'm kind of curious, how typical is it that in a public housing development serving this population that they're paying for their own fuel?

922
01:24:41,512 --> 01:24:45,214
They are paying, oftentimes they are paying for their own fuel, and there is fuel assistance.

923
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,635
We don't have numbers on that.

924
01:24:48,495 --> 01:24:54,019
The difficulty that our residents are faced with, though, is, like I said, they have to come up with cash at the time of delivery.

925
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:56,280
And I have

926
01:24:57,025 --> 01:25:01,048
sought out an answer to that question, and I have not yet received it.

927
01:25:01,748 --> 01:25:17,799
The difficulty I have is that if someone is on a fuel assistance program, then the individuals who deliver to that development, and from what I understand, there are 41 delivery companies, oil delivery companies in this area who participate in that.

928
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:21,942
I don't understand why the individuals at LaPree Village have to pay cash up front.

929
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,744
And I haven't been able to find that answer out.

930
01:25:25,744 --> 01:25:26,525
Okay, thank you.

931
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,642
Hi, my name is Losa Julie Genevieve.

932
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:45,325
I am a resident of the pre for the past 17 years.

933
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:49,549
And also, I've been serving on the board on the chair.

934
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:56,095
This time around, when residents seek out for fuel assistant.

935
01:25:57,256 --> 01:26:04,401
you have to imagine that it's not only the Medford housing resident that seek out for this type of assistance.

936
01:26:04,861 --> 01:26:11,565
It's everyone that needs assistance, regardless if they own a rent apartment elsewhere.

937
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:25,474
So whatever the state provides for the year to address for the city of Medford, all these folks are going and dip into that amount that they provided for.

938
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:37,128
So, therefore, for the year, for the heating system, that sometime that people provided that depend on your income and also on the people that you have children and so forth.

939
01:26:37,849 --> 01:26:44,417
And unfortunately, sometimes people only get $400 for the whole heating season.

940
01:26:45,473 --> 01:26:58,744
And could you imagine that when you called the oil company that's going to deliver it, and then you let them know that they already received the information from the fuel assistant how much that person is, you know, allowing for the heating season.

941
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:04,508
And once that happens, so if they only are giving that person $400 for the whole heating system,

942
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:17,737
and the price of oil is more, say it's 500, that person is going to have to cough up the remainder, you know, $100 or more to match up because if they don't have that, they're not going to deliver it.

943
01:27:18,457 --> 01:27:19,518
They don't deliver it over 100.

944
01:27:19,558 --> 01:27:23,280
If you're not ordering 100 gallons, they're not going to come.

945
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,481
Don't bother to call.

946
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:28,183
It's 100 gallons of oil per delivery.

947
01:27:29,187 --> 01:27:36,976
And also that when you consider the fact that, like he mentioned, I myself, I lived in L'Apprit, like I said, for 17 years.

948
01:27:37,116 --> 01:27:38,458
I have kids and I have grandkids.

949
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,183
Even if I don't heat my apartment with the stove,

950
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:53,197
my neighbor made, which means putting my life, my granddaughter, my son, my next door neighbor's life in jeopardy.

951
01:27:53,817 --> 01:28:00,338
Because it could happen in the middle of the night when a person is eating their popcorn on the stove, and God forbid, something, anything could fall.

952
01:28:00,518 --> 01:28:02,879
A piece of paper could fall.

953
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:04,559
During the day, a kid could be playing.

954
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:09,220
Something could just jump right into that oven, and there goes

955
01:28:10,974 --> 01:28:17,559
So, you know, when you talk about the cost, it's just like you get assistance, but it's this much assistance that you get.

956
01:28:18,339 --> 01:28:19,160
It's not that much.

957
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:27,065
And again, when you call for delivery, if you don't have the cash on hand, they're not going to deliver.

958
01:28:27,626 --> 01:28:31,648
So this is what the residents are facing, you know, when it comes to things like that.

959
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,133
More questions, comments?

960
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:46,227
Could you break down the ROI if you could?

961
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:50,512
You said the savings would be 77,000 a year in the application.

962
01:28:51,133 --> 01:28:55,258
Is that the residents all saving that over the course of one year is your estimate?

963
01:28:58,361 --> 01:29:13,634
total amount of the savings that we anticipated from the residents, the payments that would be made, the residents on behalf of the not having to spend for oil.

964
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:19,258
And that it would be the difference we think that there would be between the oil cost and the gas cost.

965
01:29:20,039 --> 01:29:20,379
Thank you.

966
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:20,940
Per unit.

967
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,300
Which is an ROI.

968
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,301
Per unit in total, yes.

969
01:29:23,481 --> 01:29:23,721
Okay.

970
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:24,541
Per unit in total.

971
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:24,981
Very good.

972
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:29,844
So that's an ROI of roughly five to six years to actually get that savings back, obviously.

973
01:29:29,884 --> 01:29:30,024
Yes.

974
01:29:30,084 --> 01:29:30,324
Okay.

975
01:29:30,484 --> 01:29:31,565
Yes, as we anticipate.

976
01:29:31,665 --> 01:29:32,925
Which is pretty good, I think.

977
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:42,570
And it seems crazy to me that, obviously, the $700 cash in the middle of the winter, that's obviously an insane system that this would solve.

978
01:29:44,531 --> 01:29:48,213
And I believe all these companies, certainly National Grid, have the ability to spread it over

979
01:29:48,947 --> 01:29:51,129
payments over the whole year, regardless of how much.

980
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:54,212
So you don't have a big bump in the middle of the year.

981
01:29:54,232 --> 01:29:58,516
You've got $100 a month rather than $400 in December, that kind of thing, which will also help, I assume.

982
01:29:58,636 --> 01:30:03,120
And it takes more than one tank of oil to heat throughout the season.

983
01:30:03,501 --> 01:30:05,523
And I thank LOSA for explaining that to me.

984
01:30:06,163 --> 01:30:09,967
That's not something that I was as familiar with as LOSA is.

985
01:30:10,787 --> 01:30:16,769
But that's the issue that we have, is that the residents don't have the ability to come up with that money to pay whomever it is that's delivering.

986
01:30:16,889 --> 01:30:17,729
Makes complete sense.

987
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:20,550
My last question is about the schedule.

988
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:24,430
You mentioned you want to get this done before the heating season of this calendar year.

989
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:24,811
Yes, sir.

990
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:25,251
Okay.

991
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:30,172
So that's, I'm just, just the schedule here in terms of award, in terms of

992
01:30:31,115 --> 01:30:35,881
You know, the city's bidding process is, from my experience, bidding, it's been, it's like a month minimum.

993
01:30:36,482 --> 01:30:37,123
It's not the city.

994
01:30:37,543 --> 01:30:38,364
It's the housing authority.

995
01:30:38,404 --> 01:30:39,385
We're separate and distinct from the city.

996
01:30:39,405 --> 01:30:41,208
Okay, so that's, you have the ability to speed that up then?

997
01:30:41,288 --> 01:30:41,608
Yes, sir.

998
01:30:41,748 --> 01:30:42,409
Okay, that's good.

999
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:42,910
Okay.

1000
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:43,891
Gabe, do you want to address that?

1001
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,113
Yes, so.

1002
01:30:45,193 --> 01:30:45,773
Come up to the mic.

1003
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:46,554
Sure.

1004
01:30:47,636 --> 01:30:48,277
Appreciate it, thank you.

1005
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:58,468
Yes, once we have a preliminary design in place, National Grid is all set to go once we give them the okay.

1006
01:30:59,609 --> 01:31:04,314
Once they get started, or as soon as we get the okay, we can have our plans in place.

1007
01:31:04,434 --> 01:31:06,155
We have to go out to bid for two weeks.

1008
01:31:07,016 --> 01:31:12,119
And then our board has to approve, but we could hold a special meeting as soon as we get the bids in place.

1009
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:21,524
And the, all the materials to perform this installation or there's no long lead times for anything.

1010
01:31:21,624 --> 01:31:31,630
So part of our award would be a contractor that is ready to go, you know, within a short timeframe, we could specify that on.

1011
01:31:32,548 --> 01:31:38,413
on our bid package that we are, you know, we need someone who's ready to hit the ground running.

1012
01:31:42,776 --> 01:31:48,921
One of the challenges I have experienced on projects is that utilities aren't always very responsive.

1013
01:31:49,222 --> 01:31:53,045
I don't, are these, is National Grid going to, are they absolutely committing?

1014
01:31:53,065 --> 01:31:56,828
Because if they were off by a month, obviously that could really hurt you.

1015
01:32:00,453 --> 01:32:03,675
It's my understanding that they have committed to us.

1016
01:32:03,755 --> 01:32:06,376
It's my understanding that they want to prioritize this.

1017
01:32:06,756 --> 01:32:11,779
We've utilized them, as I said, for close to $2 million worth of work.

1018
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:16,162
They've been very generous to the Housing Authority, and we've benefited from that.

1019
01:32:16,602 --> 01:32:17,963
I wouldn't expect anything different.

1020
01:32:18,043 --> 01:32:20,845
I know that Gabe is the one who's had the direct conversations with them.

1021
01:32:21,865 --> 01:32:25,646
Of course, the sooner we can give them an answer, the quicker we can line things up.

1022
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,927
But they said they can get to us this year.

1023
01:32:28,027 --> 01:32:28,227
Yeah.

1024
01:32:28,487 --> 01:32:33,829
And I think we can get things going simultaneously.

1025
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:36,810
More questions, comments?

1026
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:37,010
Yeah.

1027
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:44,113
I'll speak quickly so that Doug doesn't cut me off here.

1028
01:32:44,553 --> 01:32:49,975
It seems crazy to me to have gas heat and electric stoves, unless I'm missing something here.

1029
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:58,614
And we certainly hope that if you put gas heat in, that you wouldn't preclude the possibility of adding gas stoves.

1030
01:32:58,674 --> 01:33:02,798
In fact, I don't even know if electric stoves and gas lines are a good idea.

1031
01:33:03,879 --> 01:33:08,925
I've just never heard of a residential unit that had an electric stove and gas lines.

1032
01:33:11,387 --> 01:33:12,507
So I'm just curious about that.

1033
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:13,948
That does happen.

1034
01:33:14,508 --> 01:33:17,949
My own residence, I have natural gas and I have an electric stove.

1035
01:33:18,149 --> 01:33:20,630
You too.

1036
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:32,733
It's certainly a very good suggestion and it's maybe something that we might come forth to the committee in the future if you so choose to allow us to put the gas lines in.

1037
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:38,935
It might be a nice project and I would hope that you would show up in support of that if we do.

1038
01:33:41,737 --> 01:33:42,217
Hi again.

1039
01:33:42,778 --> 01:33:57,386
Another thing that I felt to mention is that most of the reason why the people that actually utilize the stove is because we use the oil all year round because this is what we use for hot water to shower.

1040
01:33:57,846 --> 01:34:00,988
So what they in their mind is thinking that

1041
01:34:02,065 --> 01:34:04,966
I'm only getting the fuel system for the winter.

1042
01:34:05,527 --> 01:34:18,632
So I'm going to utilize it and whatever else that I, if I have to force to take money out of my pocket to pay for extra, I'm not gonna heat my home because I have to use that hot water to take a shower during the summer.

1043
01:34:19,193 --> 01:34:30,558
So this is where they're thinking like, okay, I'm saving, but they're not thinking about the safety of that comes along with that, you know, because again, I'm a single mom.

1044
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:33,481
I know how hard it is for me.

1045
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,424
And it's people that's worse off than me.

1046
01:34:36,984 --> 01:34:40,468
So, and this is also, you know, the concern.

1047
01:34:41,224 --> 01:35:01,194
And at first when we, when Medford Housing had came on board that people were, you know, kind of wasn't, you know, thing, but they were so, I thought they wasn't going to really wanted to go for it, but they were so happy that actually, you know, Medford Housing was going, and myself, was going to take, you know, over and do something like that.

1048
01:35:01,274 --> 01:35:02,235
So it really will be,

1049
01:35:02,975 --> 01:35:24,238
great thing not just for myself but I'm speaking on behalf I represent all the expert housing residents you know that lives there that couldn't be here and and if this is something that you guys really will think about it will be very appreciative not just for us that lives here right now but for the people that's coming my my reason I serve on the board is

1050
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,302
not because I wanted to be known.

1051
01:35:27,142 --> 01:35:45,579
I served on the Medford Housing Board because I was lucky enough to have found Medford Housing when I moved here 17 years ago, that I'm hoping that I'm doing something so when I leave 17 years later, someone else could utilize this and they will benefit from it.

1052
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:46,620
Thank you.

1053
01:35:49,178 --> 01:35:49,618
Thank you.

1054
01:35:50,438 --> 01:36:08,225
I have one last question which is, how old are these heating systems and is there a concern that the oil burners themselves are potentially dangerous regardless of how the stoves are being used?

1055
01:36:09,285 --> 01:36:11,986
The development was constructed in 1951.

1056
01:36:14,216 --> 01:36:17,919
Gabe, can you answer the remainder of that question?

1057
01:36:17,979 --> 01:36:21,581
So the boilers that are in place now are about nine years old.

1058
01:36:22,422 --> 01:36:28,506
The manufacturer of the boilers makes a conversion kit that you can convert.

1059
01:36:28,687 --> 01:36:30,548
It's called a gas burner.

1060
01:36:30,568 --> 01:36:31,929
It's the front part of the burner.

1061
01:36:31,969 --> 01:36:38,874
You just swap that out and replace the oil burner with the gas burner.

1062
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,076
So it's a quick turnover.

1063
01:36:42,256 --> 01:36:45,857
can hopefully do an apartment in about a day, two days tops.

1064
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:47,037
Thank you.

1065
01:36:47,918 --> 01:36:54,260
Can I just, before you end, just give you some insight into LaPree Village.

1066
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:04,963
The Housing Authority on April 3rd underwent an intensive two-day inspection of LaPree Village.

1067
01:37:06,694 --> 01:37:18,400
HUD mandates that housing authorities have the Real Estate Assessment Center, as they call it, which is a separate entity that comes in and evaluates housing authority properties.

1068
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:24,323
They did this for us in the fall at Bradley Road, Weldon Apartments.

1069
01:37:24,863 --> 01:37:26,664
I think you all might be familiar with that.

1070
01:37:27,285 --> 01:37:30,306
Housing authority, on a scale of 1 to 100, the housing authority received a 95.

1071
01:37:30,346 --> 01:37:31,747
It was 95.3 or .7, something to that effect.

1072
01:37:37,302 --> 01:37:48,566
Points off for things such as one resident didn't have a rubber stopper in the tub, so they took off 0.7 points.

1073
01:37:48,806 --> 01:37:56,708
There was a wall that had a small crack in it on the outside, and they took off three points for that.

1074
01:37:58,569 --> 01:38:04,791
We had the inspection at LaPree, and we have in the vicinity of a 93.

1075
01:38:07,063 --> 01:38:13,188
We went out and inspected each one of those apartments, each one of the 142 apartments.

1076
01:38:14,209 --> 01:38:19,114
And in some cases, we went back and inspected them a second time or a third time.

1077
01:38:19,754 --> 01:38:28,622
And out of the 142 units, we had two residents who were not cooperative.

1078
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:33,624
Two residents who didn't move their furniture so they weren't blocking a door.

1079
01:38:34,024 --> 01:38:40,485
Two residents who, in the pictures that you see there, the basement, didn't have their belongings in the middle of the basement.

1080
01:38:40,845 --> 01:38:44,106
We had significant cooperation from the residents.

1081
01:38:44,706 --> 01:38:53,988
And to say that a family housing site, the inspection results from HUD, no nonsense inspection, is comparable

1082
01:38:54,857 --> 01:39:01,879
to Weld and Gardens is a compliment to the residents there, is a compliment to our modernization staff, and to our maintenance staff.

1083
01:39:02,299 --> 01:39:11,981
So that when you, if you have an opportunity tomorrow, drive through L'Esprit and take a look at it, and you'll see that the Housing Authority has done a significant amount of work.

1084
01:39:12,381 --> 01:39:16,642
We're moving into Willis to address the difficulties we have at Willis.

1085
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:22,483
We're addressing all of our projects, excuse me, our developments, and we have projects ongoing

1086
01:39:23,035 --> 01:39:24,236
through modernization.

1087
01:39:24,516 --> 01:39:31,642
We're trying to utilize the money that the federal government gives to us and what little the state gives to us to maximize that.

1088
01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:36,405
We, though, need your assistance to be able to do what our residents deserve.

1089
01:39:36,565 --> 01:39:39,488
And when I say our residents, I'm not talking about the Housing Authority's residents.

1090
01:39:39,568 --> 01:39:40,949
I'm talking about MEDFED residents.

1091
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:42,460
Thank you.

1092
01:39:44,842 --> 01:40:05,756
All right, so I think that concludes the Housing Authority, and we would like to invite our final applicant up for this evening, which is the Medford Historical Society and Museum, which has two projects, textile collection preservation and museum quality HVAC improvements.

1093
01:40:06,397 --> 01:40:11,080
Would it be all right with you if we did the building improvements first?

1094
01:40:11,593 --> 01:40:13,314
Yes.

1095
01:40:28,121 --> 01:40:34,904
Well, it looks like I've lost most of my audience.

1096
01:40:35,845 --> 01:40:39,447
I'm John Anderson, president of the Bedford Historical Society and Museum.

1097
01:40:40,772 --> 01:40:45,234
And I just want to say briefly about our museum.

1098
01:40:45,854 --> 01:40:47,635
We've been here for over 100 years.

1099
01:40:48,576 --> 01:40:59,961
We have something like 20,000 to 30,000 items in our collection, which we curate in addition to providing public programs.

1100
01:41:00,601 --> 01:41:02,082
We're open on Sundays.

1101
01:41:02,302 --> 01:41:07,765
People come in to do research about primarily genealogy, house history,

1102
01:41:08,631 --> 01:41:12,613
We also have scholars who come from time to time to use our collections.

1103
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:24,398
I just want to quote briefly from the National Park Service regarding collections.

1104
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:31,582
They say, many objects will come to your museum collections damaged and deteriorated from use and exposure.

1105
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,521
Because of their history, some objects will need treatment.

1106
01:41:36,001 --> 01:41:40,483
You should develop a treatment plan for immediate problems in your collection.

1107
01:41:41,303 --> 01:41:48,826
Your primary goal, however, is to create a facility that will minimize damage and maintain the collection through preventative measures.

1108
01:41:50,307 --> 01:41:54,330
That's what the focus of this project is.

1109
01:41:54,390 --> 01:42:11,563
What I'm asking your support for, in particular, is a new HVAC system that will enable us to convert from oil to gas and also replace very obsolete air conditioning equipment.

1110
01:42:13,585 --> 01:42:14,025
Let's see.

1111
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:30,098
Since I last spoke with you, which was when we were asking to be qualified for this grant, I just want to bring you up to date on some of the things we've done.

1112
01:42:30,338 --> 01:42:39,902
Since I submitted the application, what we've done, we've met with multiple HVAC installers.

1113
01:42:41,103 --> 01:42:45,045
We've also completed projects on our own to upgrade the building.

1114
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:58,524
And volunteers have continued their efforts of cataloging the collection and making improvements throughout the building, such as building shelving, painting, cleaning, and so forth and so on.

1115
01:42:59,545 --> 01:43:01,387
So I'm ready to take your questions.

1116
01:43:06,426 --> 01:43:07,407
Thank you, that was very quick.

1117
01:43:07,828 --> 01:43:11,732
You caught me with my pencil still going.

1118
01:43:12,193 --> 01:43:13,934
I could rattle on if you like.

1119
01:43:14,335 --> 01:43:14,996
That's all right.

1120
01:43:16,778 --> 01:43:18,600
Any questions from the committee members?

1121
01:43:25,341 --> 01:43:27,242
So, I have a question for you.

1122
01:43:28,362 --> 01:43:44,025
You know, given where you are today and what you expect to be able to do with the CPA funds to improve your building, what other capital improvements do you see necessary to bring this building up to the level that you feel it needs to be?

1123
01:43:44,805 --> 01:43:50,927
Well, we had a reserve study done, an engineering study done to look at the long-range requirements of the building.

1124
01:43:54,195 --> 01:44:00,139
Other than maintenance, I would say the biggest thing looming perhaps would be window replacement.

1125
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,542
We had windows replaced maybe 25 years ago.

1126
01:44:04,562 --> 01:44:08,765
They're sort of conventional vinyl windows.

1127
01:44:09,906 --> 01:44:17,412
They were certified as appropriate by the historic commission at the time, but I think

1128
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:30,853
When we get around to doing it, when we need to do this again, I suspect that the historic district commission will be a little more particular about what we put in.

1129
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:35,855
I would see that as the biggest looming capital thing, and it's not an immediate need.

1130
01:44:39,233 --> 01:44:44,376
I just have to ask, is there any hope for handicapped accessibility in this building?

1131
01:44:45,117 --> 01:44:45,917
I had Ms.

1132
01:44:45,937 --> 01:44:50,100
McLeod check the building out, in fact, when we first moved in there.

1133
01:44:50,921 --> 01:44:54,664
She told us she had good news and bad news.

1134
01:44:55,564 --> 01:44:58,086
The bad news was we weren't handicapped accessible.

1135
01:44:58,126 --> 01:45:01,629
The good news was there was no practical way to make it accessible.

1136
01:45:02,409 --> 01:45:03,330
The problem is,

1137
01:45:04,696 --> 01:45:08,018
You see the ramp that goes into the front door there?

1138
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:15,281
If you constructed a ramp the way our property is situated, the ramp would be running downhill.

1139
01:45:16,468 --> 01:45:20,531
And the sidewalk is actually steeper than what a ramp allows.

1140
01:45:20,972 --> 01:45:25,315
So you keep going, you'd have to go across High Street or something.

1141
01:45:28,738 --> 01:45:30,619
You'd have to have a drawbridge on the ramp.

1142
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:34,642
So she said there was no real practical way to do it.

1143
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:43,489
The same situation applies to our neighbor, the medical building at 0 Governors Avenue, where handicapped accessibility is even more important.

1144
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:47,740
Thank you.

1145
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,501
Other questions, comments?

1146
01:45:52,803 --> 01:45:53,484
Come on, Doug.

1147
01:45:55,465 --> 01:45:56,486
You've got to have a question.

1148
01:45:57,166 --> 01:45:57,426
I do.

1149
01:45:57,446 --> 01:46:08,133
First of all, I want to just remind that when the inappropriate windows were put, non-historical windows were put into the Historical Society and Museum building,

1150
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:10,791
I was in college, I had nothing to do with it.

1151
01:46:13,593 --> 01:46:19,817
That's a small disclaimer, but I do appreciate you undoing a mistake of the past.

1152
01:46:20,037 --> 01:46:25,141
That's really important for building an organization like yourself to maintain a high standard.

1153
01:46:25,181 --> 01:46:25,781
I know because

1154
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:43,382
You've been communicating with the commission and others about things you're doing, your shopping list of things that you're doing to the building is actually even longer than what you described because you've been reaching out to us for years about that stuff and we appreciate the

1155
01:46:44,163 --> 01:46:47,966
diligence of putting that building and making it good for the next hundred years.

1156
01:46:49,547 --> 01:46:54,330
I guess I do hope at some point there's some creative way to think about ADA.

1157
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:57,352
Obviously, the street is what the street is.

1158
01:46:57,392 --> 01:46:58,352
You can't do anything about that.

1159
01:46:58,392 --> 01:47:04,716
But within the building, you know, whether we just we had a real challenging time and... Sorry?

1160
01:47:05,157 --> 01:47:09,019
No, I mean, in the building, the steps are too high to go to the next level.

1161
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:11,201
Again, you'd have to have a ramp down.

1162
01:47:13,418 --> 01:47:19,460
I understand, but we spent 150 grand doing it in the Brooks Estate and that was not easy either.

1163
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,801
Perhaps we had less of a challenge, but it was not easy.

1164
01:47:23,641 --> 01:47:25,061
Well, I'll come back next year.

1165
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:26,902
Yeah, maybe.

1166
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:43,336
In terms of schedule, can you talk a little bit about that, about would you do this in the next 12 months?

1167
01:47:43,396 --> 01:47:44,997
I think it's probably buried in here.

1168
01:47:45,858 --> 01:47:52,824
Well, the logical way to do it would be to do it during the summer.

1169
01:47:54,814 --> 01:47:59,177
and it's going to be tight because there are a lot of moving pieces here.

1170
01:48:00,758 --> 01:48:01,859
I've worked with the gas company.

1171
01:48:02,019 --> 01:48:06,301
I've reached out to the gas company and determined that there is a gas line in the street.

1172
01:48:06,582 --> 01:48:10,104
I mean, I've kind of already knew that but you have to get them to say it.

1173
01:48:10,604 --> 01:48:12,265
So we have gas in front of the building.

1174
01:48:12,906 --> 01:48:21,451
The problem is scheduling it so that it can get done and the line can be put in in time but you really have to have a contractor

1175
01:48:22,148 --> 01:48:30,038
and finalize the equipment that you're using before they can really schedule it.

1176
01:48:31,159 --> 01:48:32,721
So we're going to have to get busy soon.

1177
01:48:36,963 --> 01:48:46,290
And you've talked to a number of HVAC because there's some that are more less intrusive visually than others in terms of where the equipment goes and what it looks like within the building.

1178
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:49,392
Are you satisfied that you have the best solution in front of you?

1179
01:48:49,572 --> 01:48:53,515
We're planning on using the furnace room that we currently have.

1180
01:48:54,396 --> 01:48:56,137
We have this little room down in the basement.

1181
01:48:57,178 --> 01:49:02,542
And in terms of the air conditioning, there's already two compressors in the back.

1182
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:08,515
which were used for the kind of 25-year-old splits on your split systems.

1183
01:49:09,215 --> 01:49:13,379
So the condenser or whatever you call it, the outdoor unit would be in the back.

1184
01:49:13,579 --> 01:49:13,840
OK.

1185
01:49:15,561 --> 01:49:15,882
Thank you.

1186
01:49:19,245 --> 01:49:20,326
Further questions, comments?

1187
01:49:20,366 --> 01:49:20,446
Yeah?

1188
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,962
Just a couple of questions.

1189
01:49:25,402 --> 01:49:33,876
One, and I don't mean this in any way to be offensive, but given the level of- With all due respect.

1190
01:49:35,522 --> 01:49:51,791
Given the level of investment that the property needs, have you explored at all co-locating with another organization or, for example, you know, the Medford Library is going to be undergoing a major project potentially being incorporated into that?

1191
01:49:51,811 --> 01:49:58,335
I'm just curious about all of that because I know this isn't going to be the last project that you need done.

1192
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:07,761
Well, we have explored from time to time options like that.

1193
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:16,447
At one point, one of the Medford Square redevelopment plans anticipated maybe having some display space in Medford Square.

1194
01:50:19,208 --> 01:50:23,631
We like our location because there's actually parking there.

1195
01:50:26,193 --> 01:50:29,975
Certainly, working with the library is an intriguing possibility.

1196
01:50:31,486 --> 01:50:33,628
We cooperate with them extensively.

1197
01:50:34,789 --> 01:50:40,912
We're kind of working out an understanding where certain kinds of records such as city records would reside there.

1198
01:50:41,473 --> 01:50:42,914
Other things would reside with us.

1199
01:50:46,036 --> 01:50:53,481
I really don't think the library would have a lot of time to spend figuring out how to do this given the schedule they're under.

1200
01:50:54,581 --> 01:50:56,102
We have thought about it from time to time.

1201
01:50:56,142 --> 01:50:56,983
We sort of like

1202
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:03,496
Our meeting room seems to be about the right size.

1203
01:51:04,097 --> 01:51:09,320
It accommodates up to 40-45 people and that's our typical sort of audience.

1204
01:51:12,763 --> 01:51:19,048
There would be advantages, but I haven't found a really plausible way of doing that.

1205
01:51:20,535 --> 01:51:34,623
My second question is whether you have any base of deep-pocketed individual donors who could match if matching funds were provided.

1206
01:51:36,724 --> 01:51:38,265
What do you mean by deep-pocketed?

1207
01:51:39,746 --> 01:51:44,029
If you got half of the money for this, do you have people who could contribute the other half?

1208
01:51:44,089 --> 01:51:45,850
We do double handstands when we get $500.

1209
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:46,550
Let me put it that way.

1210
01:51:50,869 --> 01:52:02,094
We did have one Bluebird donation of $20,000 a couple of years ago, which is what's really funding all the other improvements we're doing, such as the stucco repair.

1211
01:52:02,114 --> 01:52:11,339
Now that the stucco has been repaired, we have to repaint the building, improving the drainage around the building, things of that nature.

1212
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,041
Any further questions, comments?

1213
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:21,381
Can I just make a comment?

1214
01:52:21,422 --> 01:52:21,502
Yes.

1215
01:52:21,522 --> 01:52:27,124
Remember, we're building an average new library.

1216
01:52:27,164 --> 01:52:37,567
And we have literally, I was working with Barbara today, there's not going to be any space for 20,000 to 30,000 additional items, reading and research spaces, et cetera.

1217
01:52:37,807 --> 01:52:40,228
We are not building a library that is beyond average.

1218
01:52:40,388 --> 01:52:43,469
You heard that great speech by that gentleman the other night.

1219
01:52:45,761 --> 01:52:48,143
I'll be consulting with you on the color.

1220
01:53:00,905 --> 01:53:05,526
So my one question relates actually to your next presentation.

1221
01:53:05,686 --> 01:53:20,410
So it says that in the next presentation for the preserve and protect the historical textile pieces that they will not be available for public access and display after the cleaning.

1222
01:53:21,451 --> 01:53:25,932
And I'm thinking if we're spending money to cleaning, we can't see them after that.

1223
01:53:26,372 --> 01:53:30,233
So is that not what it said in the application?

1224
01:53:31,832 --> 01:53:33,013
I'll have to re-read it.

1225
01:53:33,093 --> 01:53:34,374
Should we let them come up?

1226
01:53:34,775 --> 01:53:35,095
Okay.

1227
01:53:35,275 --> 01:53:40,900
I was thinking maybe the updated HVAC upgrade would fix that issue.

1228
01:53:41,361 --> 01:53:43,923
You can't display all of them because there are 400 items.

1229
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:45,104
Hold your fire.

1230
01:53:45,244 --> 01:53:47,246
Okay.

1231
01:53:47,306 --> 01:53:50,949
I'll hold my question until you present the next one.

1232
01:53:50,969 --> 01:53:51,189
Thank you.

1233
01:53:51,209 --> 01:53:53,591
Would you like to come and present?

1234
01:53:53,631 --> 01:53:53,912
Thank you.

1235
01:54:05,661 --> 01:54:19,066
And do you mind if I not use the microphone just because I'd rather face you, if that's okay?

1236
01:54:19,466 --> 01:54:20,047
It's okay.

1237
01:54:20,067 --> 01:54:25,949
We have permission from our, yeah, we have permission.

1238
01:54:26,369 --> 01:54:28,790
Or you could take this microphone and talk into it.

1239
01:54:28,830 --> 01:54:29,410
That's okay.

1240
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:30,170
I think I would.

1241
01:54:32,501 --> 01:54:35,743
So I also just want to point out that this sign was literally installed today.

1242
01:54:36,563 --> 01:54:46,608
Hi, I'm Heather Shampney Anderson, a member of the Collections Committee, and I'm here with Beth Hayes, who is our textile expert.

1243
01:54:46,668 --> 01:54:55,212
We are very fortunate to have her as a member, which means we've gotten hundreds of hours of free work, which we would not be able to afford from a consultant.

1244
01:54:56,173 --> 01:55:08,566
The textile project, and I think this is kind of what you're referring to, we have spent approximately 500 hours over the last two years inventorying our textiles.

1245
01:55:09,287 --> 01:55:11,829
This is the resulting kind of work.

1246
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:15,133
We also have photographed, et cetera, this research.

1247
01:55:17,723 --> 01:55:26,710
When we found most of these textiles, and they still are, they have already shown damage due to mildew, to dust.

1248
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:41,602
There was a smoky oil fire a number of years ago, which some of the textiles, as we went through and inventoried them, we had to actually dispose of because they were in such bad shape and would never be able to be taken care of.

1249
01:55:42,601 --> 01:55:52,395
What we're asking in this grant is we have looked at over 400 items, not all of them are textiles, because we did include accessories, for example, that would not necessarily be made of material.

1250
01:55:55,159 --> 01:56:13,357
We went through and very specifically picked out 35 items, some, and we have two of them here for you tonight, one which is 200 years old, one which is 100 years old, which we feel will benefit and have already discussed with a specialized dry cleaner in the community.

1251
01:56:14,078 --> 01:56:21,644
Many, some of our textiles will require very specialized handling and cleaning at places like the Smithsonian, etc.

1252
01:56:22,184 --> 01:56:29,890
We are not, have not included the cost for such within this grant, but we have chosen a 35 that we feel that we can have cleaned.

1253
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:53,883
that we can buy archival boxes for and archival tissue so that once they are cleaned, hopefully in a building that is dust, mildew-free and without oil and other chemical pollutants, which is very damaging to textiles, that we will be able to then store them

1254
01:56:54,983 --> 01:56:55,883
And yes, show them.

1255
01:56:56,163 --> 01:57:02,986
But right now, for example, I can show you everything that we have because I photographed everything and it's on a computer.

1256
01:57:03,686 --> 01:57:08,028
From that, people can then tell us what they would like to either research or look at.

1257
01:57:08,088 --> 01:57:14,870
Now remember, when you're looking at old textiles, too, you want to do this very carefully with gloves and under supervision and careful handling.

1258
01:57:15,613 --> 01:57:29,613
We have already had, since we started this project and just finished it, we've already had two very successful textile exhibits, one on samplers and another on wedding gowns, which we purposely chose not only because they were some of the

1259
01:57:30,563 --> 01:57:32,065
I'm sorry, what?

1260
01:57:33,366 --> 01:57:34,607
Oh, and we also had three, I'm sorry.

1261
01:57:34,647 --> 01:57:36,029
We also had a World War I exhibit.

1262
01:57:36,569 --> 01:57:50,063
We had two exhibits primarily looking at household and women's items, because those are frequently overlooked, and we also had military uniforms and a few male items, but we had plenty of other war

1263
01:57:50,972 --> 01:57:58,399
implements and material to do many more war-related exhibits and deal with men.

1264
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:02,282
So basically what we want is to clean 35 of these things.

1265
01:58:02,743 --> 01:58:08,408
Because of best skills, many of the repairs we'll be able to do ourselves, so another in-kind service.

1266
01:58:09,188 --> 01:58:32,071
Also, many of the items that we have that we can do ourselves with hand-washing, with very specific materials that we can buy, we can do through volunteers, with volunteers, et cetera, under best supervision, which would be another in-kind aspect of what our continued volunteer time will hopefully offset costs.

1267
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:42,506
The archival boxes, I know it looks ridiculous when you look at paying this amount of money, $25 to $40 to $50 for a box, but that's what they cost.

1268
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:52,611
They're made of materials that do not give off pollutants or gases and are specifically made and designed for storing antique textiles.

1269
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:58,355
We brought a couple of things tonight just to give you an idea of the kinds of things we have.

1270
01:58:58,855 --> 01:59:01,737
And Beth can speak better than anyone.

1271
01:59:02,278 --> 01:59:05,740
We're about to open an exhibit on Lydia Marie Child for a year.

1272
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,382
Lydia Marie Child was one of the most famous abolitionists.

1273
01:59:08,422 --> 01:59:10,063
She was born here in Medford.

1274
01:59:11,344 --> 01:59:20,751
And we just happen to have a dress which she made by hand, which is approximately 200 years old, which will go, hopefully, into our exhibition.

1275
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:23,553
We'd just like to show it to you up close.

1276
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:28,337
Yeah, I want you to look at it closely to see what damage can be done when it's not properly

1277
01:59:31,493 --> 01:59:31,993
I'm sorry.

1278
01:59:32,954 --> 01:59:33,715
And it's so dirty.

1279
01:59:33,915 --> 01:59:42,482
I cannot possibly wash this because it is clearly falling apart.

1280
01:59:42,602 --> 01:59:47,266
It is so worn from being left out wherever it should be kept.

1281
01:59:47,386 --> 01:59:51,209
I researched this category.

1282
01:59:51,269 --> 01:59:56,333
There's one like it in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

1283
01:59:57,691 --> 02:00:01,374
This, and it's dated in the Victorian alphabet to 1810.

1284
02:00:01,434 --> 02:00:04,116
This one's dated to 1821.

1285
02:00:05,777 --> 02:00:10,821
The fabric is called broadleaf inlays, and it's very rare.

1286
02:00:13,097 --> 02:00:15,158
And you can see, like, how rough and old it is.

1287
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:16,899
You can see where it gets worn through.

1288
02:00:16,939 --> 02:00:18,539
You can read through it.

1289
02:00:18,619 --> 02:00:19,140
Especially that key.

1290
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,921
You can see why it can't be washed.

1291
02:00:20,941 --> 02:00:22,421
You can't freshen it.

1292
02:00:22,441 --> 02:00:23,862
You have to put it in the new exhibit.

1293
02:00:23,982 --> 02:00:27,663
They wouldn't put it in just the way it is, unfortunately.

1294
02:00:27,924 --> 02:00:28,964
There was no need for this.

1295
02:00:29,244 --> 02:00:33,686
Had this been preserved correctly, it would not look like this.

1296
02:00:34,567 --> 02:00:42,290
Because I've seen enough of it to know that it would be not pristine, but it certainly wouldn't have holes in it and be this color.

1297
02:00:50,552 --> 02:00:53,653
This is not the color it's supposed to be, but it's still fun.

1298
02:00:54,253 --> 02:00:58,114
But it's a fun piece from the 1920s.

1299
02:00:58,234 --> 02:01:02,195
Which we can't watch, but it's a soapy one.

1300
02:01:02,876 --> 02:01:05,456
And it is a valuable piece, one of the target pieces made.

1301
02:01:07,988 --> 02:01:09,669
Somebody had a great time wearing it.

1302
02:01:09,709 --> 02:01:12,291
You can pull it off, Hendo, I know you can.

1303
02:01:12,351 --> 02:01:14,172
I don't think I'm tall enough to.

1304
02:01:14,292 --> 02:01:18,135
And we're lucky someone kept it and didn't just, you know, give it to the public.

1305
02:01:18,195 --> 02:01:19,356
And this is 100 years old.

1306
02:01:19,436 --> 02:01:19,616
Yeah.

1307
02:01:19,896 --> 02:01:22,097
Now, the classical lounge thing feel the weight of it.

1308
02:01:22,157 --> 02:01:22,618
Yeah.

1309
02:01:22,778 --> 02:01:26,320
It's an incredibly interesting, I mean, it's not like the stuff we've either done.

1310
02:01:27,801 --> 02:01:29,142
These are the things we have.

1311
02:01:29,562 --> 02:01:30,063
Shimmy, though.

1312
02:01:30,183 --> 02:01:31,824
And many more than that.

1313
02:01:31,984 --> 02:01:34,886
We've got a wonderful coat on the mantle lock from

1314
02:01:35,487 --> 02:01:38,488
1800, all hand-woven, hand-quilted.

1315
02:01:39,549 --> 02:01:47,532
We have some beautiful pieces, unusual when you get into our collection, and it would really be a shame if we couldn't preserve them.

1316
02:01:47,932 --> 02:01:54,034
And to be able to show them to you, I mean, we're putting them together as fast as we can.

1317
02:01:54,875 --> 02:01:56,115
We've shown 16 bridal gowns.

1318
02:01:57,175 --> 02:01:57,676
We've shown 18

1319
02:01:58,809 --> 02:02:00,649
pieces of uniforms of different types.

1320
02:02:01,069 --> 02:02:11,472
And believe it or not, half of them were women's uniforms from World War I. We have 17 samplers made in the schools in Bedford in the early 1800s.

1321
02:02:12,572 --> 02:02:18,033
And we have so many pieces that it's really a marvel.

1322
02:02:18,333 --> 02:02:20,814
And they've been kept, especially the way they were kept.

1323
02:02:20,894 --> 02:02:23,634
So we want to fix that.

1324
02:02:23,994 --> 02:02:25,055
Stop the bleeding.

1325
02:02:25,155 --> 02:02:25,935
Stop the bleeding.

1326
02:02:26,055 --> 02:02:27,235
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1327
02:02:27,665 --> 02:02:31,527
so that the next generation will be able to go use them.

1328
02:02:31,567 --> 02:02:36,809
We're now fixing our cases so that we can put these in, and everybody can come and see them.

1329
02:02:37,229 --> 02:02:38,490
So really, that can help.

1330
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:54,137
And basically, unless the stucco was fixed, which has just been finished, unless the French drains go in to change the water flow, thanks to the house that was built next door, which has now changed the flow.

1331
02:02:54,857 --> 02:02:57,278
You're smiling, Doug, so I know that you understand that.

1332
02:02:58,563 --> 02:03:19,047
And thanks to, for example, we've done things like eliminated and opened up space and cleaned spaces and plastered walls and tried to create as much, I laughed when, I didn't mean to, but when we're talking about would someone share with us the amount of space that's required.

1333
02:03:19,067 --> 02:03:26,909
If you start putting, for example, 35 of these in their individual archival boxes, all of a sudden our stacking storage space needs to double.

1334
02:03:28,452 --> 02:03:31,174
That's actually a question that I was about to ask you.

1335
02:03:31,494 --> 02:03:34,156
Yes.

1336
02:03:35,077 --> 02:03:43,503
I've heard stories about the storage conditions of the materials that you have in the historical society.

1337
02:03:44,164 --> 02:03:52,030
And were you to begin to take care of them and to store them in the way that they should be stored, do you have the space to accommodate that?

1338
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:56,013
And have you addressed a need for more storage space?

1339
02:03:57,022 --> 02:04:03,627
You are looking at two members of what we call the Tuesday team, which is a very aggressive group of five people who go in every Tuesday.

1340
02:04:03,667 --> 02:04:08,711
And our goal has been for the last year and a half to increase and improve all space.

1341
02:04:09,531 --> 02:04:13,354
We have done so significantly, including our collection area.

1342
02:04:13,995 --> 02:04:14,635
So yes.

1343
02:04:17,206 --> 02:04:23,479
I believe that, I can only speak to the area that I work in, which is the collection rooms downstairs.

1344
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:26,486
We now have two small work rooms, which we never had before.

1345
02:04:28,654 --> 02:04:34,277
Mostly because of my husband's individual volunteer labor in building, painting, and plastering.

1346
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:41,901
We do have, he just finished a build out for all of our framed items, which has gotten them off the floor.

1347
02:04:41,961 --> 02:04:49,105
It's allowed us to put in large flat file storage, which I don't know if you know what that is, but it's for oversized paper items, et cetera.

1348
02:04:50,377 --> 02:04:56,422
We have deaccessioned a lot of use items that were not needed in the facility.

1349
02:04:56,442 --> 02:05:06,129
We have changed out a water heater from a giant water heater to service a family of 10 to a small water heater, which is all that we need, which we were able to then open up.

1350
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:14,936
It sounds crazy, but we were able to open up a space that is now an alcove that is now usable for displays.

1351
02:05:15,497 --> 02:05:19,120
We also have been able to do things like we removed a sink.

1352
02:05:20,843 --> 02:05:31,311
which occupied approximately the area, this kind of an area, which has given us all of a sudden a large amount of space again for display area.

1353
02:05:31,932 --> 02:05:37,616
In the basement, we are currently going through not only inventorying

1354
02:05:38,249 --> 02:05:46,554
what I call sub-collections, you know, like housewares, or like military, or like framed artwork, or maps, or whatever the case may be.

1355
02:05:47,114 --> 02:06:01,563
But as we go through that, we are consolidating it, we are looking at copies and things that we have, so we are creating space by doing the inventorying that should have been done over the last 25 or 30 years, and really assessing each collection

1356
02:06:02,349 --> 02:06:06,711
determining what needs to be restored, determining what needs to be archivally cared for.

1357
02:06:06,971 --> 02:06:09,593
We also have another group coming in to advise us on that this summer.

1358
02:06:09,613 --> 02:06:11,554
And paper goods will be back on paper, I'm sure.

1359
02:06:12,615 --> 02:06:15,796
And deaccessioning where appropriate.

1360
02:06:16,236 --> 02:06:22,340
And with that, we have created space, at least in our collection area, for what we have.

1361
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:29,343
Now if suddenly we get an influx of all kinds of donations, then of course, we would have to look again at what we're doing.

1362
02:06:29,383 --> 02:06:32,105
But we're trying to be very specific, stick to our criteria,

1363
02:06:33,165 --> 02:06:34,646
related to items in Medford.

1364
02:06:34,686 --> 02:06:36,126
We don't just accept anything.

1365
02:06:36,486 --> 02:06:44,049
We no longer accept things in just any condition, which is not apparently the way things were done in the past.

1366
02:06:44,069 --> 02:06:45,509
I want to add one thing to it.

1367
02:06:45,569 --> 02:06:52,152
As we have in the collection different things that other museums could use, such as the GAR Museum.

1368
02:06:52,452 --> 02:06:56,813
We've called, we've asked that they want it, and if they want it, we deliver it to the museum.

1369
02:06:57,634 --> 02:06:59,935
We've done them on permanent loans and that sort of thing.

1370
02:07:00,015 --> 02:07:00,795
And we have some affidavits.

1371
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:11,919
Things that we can't use that don't pertain to NEDFED, certainly somebody else would like to be using, and we're happy to put them on public homes and let them also free up some more space for us.

1372
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:12,899
Thank you.

1373
02:07:13,399 --> 02:07:13,760
Thank you.

1374
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:15,840
Any other questions?

1375
02:07:16,621 --> 02:07:17,861
Other questions from the board?

1376
02:07:19,082 --> 02:07:26,846
It's kind of difficult coming after you're hearing about people who are $16,000 and under and trying to struggle to heat their homes that we're bringing in.

1377
02:07:27,186 --> 02:07:29,787
But this, literally, we are the only place

1378
02:07:30,875 --> 02:07:34,219
but as any collective history of med for itself.

1379
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,701
Thank you.

1380
02:07:36,061 --> 02:07:38,584
I'm going to let you do that one.

1381
02:07:40,287 --> 02:07:42,930
Any more questions for the committee?

1382
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:45,393
This concludes all of our presentations.

1383
02:07:45,513 --> 02:07:45,693
No?

1384
02:07:45,853 --> 02:07:46,274
I'm sorry.

1385
02:07:47,922 --> 02:07:52,686
So this concludes all of our presentations for the projects for the first funding round.

1386
02:07:53,187 --> 02:07:56,770
Amazingly, we finished our second evening also on time.

1387
02:08:01,855 --> 02:08:06,839
So the next steps are that next week we're going to be meeting to deliver

1388
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:13,124
deliberate about what our funding recommendations will be for this round.

1389
02:08:13,905 --> 02:08:22,352
And should that not be sufficient time, we have reserved the following week as well if we need to continue to deliberate.

1390
02:08:23,192 --> 02:08:25,614
And we will also be meeting

1391
02:08:26,815 --> 02:08:36,519
in a few weeks to talk about the eligibility forms which have already been received for the round two applications for this year.

1392
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:43,402
So with that, I believe that we have concluded our meeting for the evening.

1393
02:08:45,943 --> 02:08:47,044
All in favor of adjourning?

1394
02:08:47,804 --> 02:08:48,024
Right.

1395
02:08:49,125 --> 02:08:49,745
Thank you very much.
