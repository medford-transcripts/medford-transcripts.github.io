[SPEAKER_43]: Let's see.

35
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:09,952
[SPEAKER_43]: So the first item tonight, we will be reviewing 401 Boston Ave site plan review for Dover amendment use.

36
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:15,074
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a continued public hearing where the applicant will present any new information.

37
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:20,216
[SPEAKER_43]: The public will have an opportunity to provide comments on the new information later in the public hearing.

38
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:23,978
[SPEAKER_43]: The applicant is Tufts, the trustees of Tufts College.

39
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,520
[SPEAKER_43]: Rocco, are you here?

40
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,412
[SPEAKER_43]: There you are, Mr. DeRico.

41
00:02:31,432 --> 00:02:35,000
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. DeRico, would you please present any new information?

42
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,246
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, can someone please unmute?

43
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:43,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

44
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:49,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair Rocco DiRico, 14 Capen Street.

45
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:52,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Madam Chairwoman and members of the board.

46
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,652
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Rocco DiRico and I'm the Executive Director of Government and Community Relations.

47
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:04,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to ask Ross to share our PowerPoint presentation.

48
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:07,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see if I can.

49
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,954
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, is that Michael Ross or Ross Cameron?

50
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:16,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Ross Cameron, if you can raise your hand and I can unmute you.

51
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you, Alicia.

52
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

53
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:32,710
[SPEAKER_13]: And Ross, in the interest of time and wanting to share new information, if you can go to slide three.

54
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:42,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I just wanted to present this, because this does have.

55
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:51,993
[SPEAKER_13]: New information about the additional meetings that we have done, but I do want to point out that this has been a robust site plan review.

56
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:58,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Process and we have met with many people and submitted every report to the city that has been requested.

57
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:12,972
[SPEAKER_13]: There is broad consensus among Tufts and city officials and neighbors that it's critically important to house a greater percentage of Tufts undergraduates on campus and to get those undergraduates out of the neighborhood.

58
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:25,183
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, when Tufts was contemplating a 400-bed project on the same site two years ago, the feedback from several officials, including some members of the city council, were to add more beds to the project.

59
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:47,222
[SPEAKER_13]: With that guiding principle, Tufts and Capstone, our development partners, have put forth this project before the Community Development Board, and we view this as the best opportunity to increase the percentage of students who are housed on campus, and in doing so, enrich their educational experience, which is directly tied to our mission.

60
00:04:48,633 --> 00:05:08,881
[SPEAKER_13]: To accomplish these goals, we've brought on Capstone, which is a best-in-class developer of student housing nationwide, and a dream team of consultants to design a thoughtful and sustainable project that will help to link significantly underutilized stretch of Boston Avenue between the Tufts Green Line stop

61
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:13,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford Tufts Greenline stop and all the businesses located further down the road.

62
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:25,289
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also a passive house designed project and the project will be fossil fuel free and utilize cutting edge building materials to minimize energy consumption.

63
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, the shared goal of Medford and Tufts University.

64
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Ross, if you can skip ahead to slide five.

65
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Next slide Ross, thank you.

66
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:48,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And we acknowledge that there is a trade off of maximizing the number of beds in the project and that there are impacts to residents in the area immediately surrounding the neighborhoods.

67
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,962
[SPEAKER_13]: In particular, from the shadows resulted from this project.

68
00:05:52,222 --> 00:06:01,945
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we're going to continue to work with the neighbors to address their concerns during construction and after the project is done and when it's occupied.

69
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:09,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And to specifically address these concerns, Tufts has put together a $500,000 neighborhood improvement fund.

70
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said, we've collected a lot of input from our neighbors and city officials and elected officials and will continue to receive that input from our neighborhoods and find out how to best allocate these funds.

71
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:42,495
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to acknowledge that there have been limited changes to the proposal since it was originally filed with the Community Development Board, and that's a reflection of the building being designed below what's allowable height limits in this area of Boston Ave.

72
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:48,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And after having put in a great deal of consideration and thought into the project prior to filing our approval,

73
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,237
[SPEAKER_13]: filing for site plan approval.

74
00:06:51,958 --> 00:07:00,180
[SPEAKER_13]: We met extensively with city staff before and after our filing, and this has been a very thorough site plan review process.

75
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,282
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the best way we feel we can work towards our goal, which is housing 75% of undergraduates on campus.

76
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:12,623
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition to the $500,000 community fund that we'll be creating,

77
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:30,261
[SPEAKER_13]: And based on our conversations with the mayor and the city, we have also agreed to a one-time payment of $500,000 towards the city's affordable housing trust fund and to establish shuttle service between the Medford campus and Medford Square.

78
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:41,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Furthermore, this project is expected to bring in about $2 million in permitting fees and also money for infrastructure projects as part of the I&I required work.

79
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:50,305
[SPEAKER_13]: The project's retail space on Boston Avenue will also bring in additional tax revenue for the city every year.

80
00:07:51,406 --> 00:08:00,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Taken together, we are trying to make the maximum financial commitment to the city that we can while still being able to proceed with the project.

81
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:09,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd now like to pass it over to David Manfredi, who is our architect on the project and will present the information that this board has requested.

82
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:28,345
[SPEAKER_52]: Good evening, everyone.

83
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:31,468
[SPEAKER_52]: I needed to be officially unmuted.

84
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:41,417
[SPEAKER_52]: I will be very brief and take you through several items that I know are of particular interest.

85
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:50,224
[SPEAKER_52]: I think you all know the site, you all know the configuration of the site, and you all know the current condition of the site.

86
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:51,485
[SPEAKER_52]: Surface parking lots,

87
00:08:52,987 --> 00:09:08,055
[SPEAKER_52]: on along Boston Avenue, the opportunity to build student housing here in a significant way that will reduce the impact of students living in the neighborhood.

88
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,156
[SPEAKER_52]: It's connected to

89
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:21,342
[SPEAKER_52]: vehicular pathways, pedestrian pathways, and sits at the bottom at the elevation of Boston Avenue.

90
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:31,150
[SPEAKER_52]: But as someone pointed out the last time I was with you is the Boston Avenue elevation is, in fact, not the bottom of the hill.

91
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:34,794
[SPEAKER_52]: It is simply the bottom of the hill of the Tufts campus.

92
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,095
[SPEAKER_52]: If you go to the next.

93
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:44,730
[SPEAKER_52]: We wanted to again show you the view from Brookings.

94
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:59,396
[SPEAKER_52]: The trees at the end you're looking at the upper left is the existing condition, the proposed condition, and then below the September 2014 condition.

95
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:05,098
[SPEAKER_52]: And really the point I want to make tonight is simply that

96
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:24,010
[SPEAKER_52]: The university's interests and the neighborhood's interests, in fact, are quite similar here in that the trees that were lost to the Green Line were a really significant loss to both parties, to the university as well as to the neighborhood.

97
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:54,337
[SPEAKER_52]: And there is the opportunity here with the cooperation of the utility as well as the MBTA to return to a significant amount of street trees to better that condition and create the kind of visual buffer that is a benefit both to the neighborhood as well as to the city and to the university.

98
00:10:55,258 --> 00:11:00,422
[SPEAKER_52]: If you go to the next, so you can see, you know, the proposal.

99
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:12,891
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, you know, the configuration of the buildings, the improvements to streetscape, the addition of dedicated short term parking spaces for the Uber and Lyft.

100
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:35,352
[SPEAKER_52]: automobiles, but the most important part here is the opportunity to create new street trees on the south side of Boston Avenue with the relocation of the utility poles and the opportunity on the north side at a different scale and

101
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:44,160
[SPEAKER_52]: beneath the utility poles on that side as well.

102
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:58,243
[SPEAKER_52]: And to create this kind of double layer of street trees, that's a benefit to the neighborhood, but also a great improvement to the public realm and an improvement for the university.

103
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:08,895
[SPEAKER_52]: We're making a better place by adding trees and benefits everybody who's part of this neighborhood.

104
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,077
[SPEAKER_52]: Let's go to the next.

105
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,114
[SPEAKER_52]: We've showed you this section before.

106
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:16,736
[SPEAKER_52]: You can see the existing section.

107
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,878
[SPEAKER_52]: You see at the very top is the plan.

108
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,721
[SPEAKER_52]: And then just below the plan is a section.

109
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,123
[SPEAKER_52]: You see the AA designation.

110
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:36,453
[SPEAKER_52]: That's a section through Boston Ave at the location of the East building as it exists today with the parking elevated above the street.

111
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:53,813
[SPEAKER_52]: And below that is a section with the proposed buildings in place with the parking gone the building basically at grade and this double layer of trees, taller street trees on the.

112
00:12:54,574 --> 00:13:11,011
[SPEAKER_52]: on the south side, lower street trees on the north side, creating a double layer, not just to provide buffer, but also to make a better street, to make better public realm for everybody.

113
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:12,512
[SPEAKER_52]: Go to the next.

114
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:37,063
[SPEAKER_52]: And so you've seen this section several times, and you can see the relationship to the proposed building relative to the South and the University and the hill that leads up to Bendison Hall at elevation 140, the height of this building at

115
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:45,772
[SPEAKER_52]: 107 feet and 10 stories below the 125 foot maximum allowable.

116
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:53,020
[SPEAKER_52]: You see in a relationship to the Green Line, to Cummings Center, and then to the neighborhood beyond.

117
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,324
[SPEAKER_52]: And we've tried to draw those several houses as carefully as we could.

118
00:13:58,626 --> 00:13:59,427
[SPEAKER_52]: If you go to the next.

119
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:27,421
[SPEAKER_52]: And what that condition would look like on the new resident side, that would be what we call complete streets, meaning there's a landscape zone that is wide enough that would allow those streets to grow to their full height, also allowing a walking zone

120
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:37,790
[SPEAKER_52]: as well as a zone up against the building that if there is restaurants, there is retail, I can spill out and activate that edge.

121
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:55,064
[SPEAKER_52]: But again, the point is, the benefit is to beautify the streetscape and the additional benefits of screening the neighborhood from the university housing.

122
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:56,305
[SPEAKER_52]: We'll go to the next.

123
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:00,302
[SPEAKER_52]: So we've talked a lot about shadow studies.

124
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:08,687
[SPEAKER_52]: The shadows don't change, but we wanted to demonstrate the delta.

125
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:17,512
[SPEAKER_52]: And what I mean by that is, as you're looking in, I'll go, you know the existing condition in the upper left, and we're looking at March 21st.

126
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,033
[SPEAKER_52]: And in the upper left, we're looking at 9 AM.

127
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:21,379
[SPEAKER_52]: daylight savings time.

128
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,642
[SPEAKER_52]: And to the right is the proposed.

129
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:28,964
[SPEAKER_52]: And let me explain the colors.

130
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:32,227
[SPEAKER_52]: The buildings, the two buildings proposed are in yellow.

131
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:41,133
[SPEAKER_52]: An eight-story scenario would have a net new shadow that you see in the kind of salmon color.

132
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:47,918
[SPEAKER_52]: And a 10-story building as proposed would be the additional net new shadow.

133
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:48,818
[SPEAKER_52]: So at 9 a.m.,

134
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,670
[SPEAKER_52]: What's the sun in the east?

135
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:56,495
[SPEAKER_52]: You can see those three little dots of blue.

136
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,537
[SPEAKER_52]: That is the difference.

137
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:02,661
[SPEAKER_52]: That's the delta between 10 stories and 8 stories.

138
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,603
[SPEAKER_52]: If I go down and look at 12 o'clock,

139
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:16,490
[SPEAKER_52]: tiny, tiny little sliver of blue on the sidewalk that you see just on the edge of the salmon color.

140
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:20,533
[SPEAKER_52]: Again, that's the delta between eight stories and ten stories.

141
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,094
[SPEAKER_52]: If you go to the next

142
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,684
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm still on March 21st.

143
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:31,747
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm looking on the right-hand side, and I'm looking at 3 p.m.

144
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,988
[SPEAKER_52]: The blue represents the Delta.

145
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:37,389
[SPEAKER_52]: The Delta is in Boston Avenue.

146
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:46,534
[SPEAKER_52]: And then at 4, the Delta is the blue.

147
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:49,415
[SPEAKER_52]: The Delta is in the street.

148
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,882
[SPEAKER_52]: approaching the other side of the north curb of the street.

149
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:57,991
[SPEAKER_52]: Go to the next.

150
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,751
[SPEAKER_52]: And so now, again, we're on March 21.

151
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:08,272
[SPEAKER_52]: We're looking at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

152
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,253
[SPEAKER_52]: And you can see the blue in the neighborhood.

153
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:23,176
[SPEAKER_52]: I'll also point out the shadows created by existing buildings on the south side of the street and the shadows created by the homes on the north side of the street.

154
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:27,077
[SPEAKER_52]: And you can see that by 6 PM, basically,

155
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:49,482
[SPEAKER_52]: There's some net new shadow that between eight stories and 10 stories that is approaching the real estate over at, there's a couple of houses affected and the Delta approaches, covers some of the Tufts real estate at the athletic fields.

156
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,242
[SPEAKER_52]: Next.

157
00:17:52,841 --> 00:18:02,988
[SPEAKER_52]: So now we're on June 21st and of course June 21st is the longest day of the year and it is the highest sun angle from sunrise to sunset.

158
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:12,314
[SPEAKER_52]: By the way in the upper left you'll see for each day when the sun rises and when the sun sets on June 21st and so you can see we have

159
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,835
[SPEAKER_52]: we are the beneficiaries of very long days.

160
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:30,622
[SPEAKER_52]: Again, the existing condition is always on the left, the proposed condition is on the right, the building is yellow, the eight-story shadow is the salmon color, and you can see there is at 9 a.m.

161
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:31,703
[SPEAKER_52]: and at 12 p.m.

162
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,123
[SPEAKER_52]: at noon,

163
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,165
[SPEAKER_52]: There is no difference between eight stories and ten stories.

164
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:39,725
[SPEAKER_52]: The Shadowcats, I take it back.

165
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:40,786
[SPEAKER_52]: At 9 a.m.

166
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:46,267
[SPEAKER_52]: I see a tiny little sliver of blue, but it's negligible.

167
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:51,908
[SPEAKER_52]: Go to the next and you'll see that now I'm at 3 p.m.

168
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,949
[SPEAKER_52]: in the afternoon in the upper right.

169
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,851
[SPEAKER_52]: and I'm at 6 p.m.

170
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:57,932
[SPEAKER_52]: in the afternoon.

171
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:19,011
[SPEAKER_52]: Remember, sun doesn't set till 825, and there's a little sliver of blue that has now crossed Boston Avenue, but it hasn't affected anybody, anybody's yards, in terms of the Delta between 8 and 10, or in fact, any shadow off these proposed buildings.

172
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:20,292
[SPEAKER_52]: Go to the next.

173
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:31,264
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm still on June 21st, and now upper right, I am at 7 p.m., and then lower right, I'm at 8 p.m.

174
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,546
[SPEAKER_52]: You can see there is new blue that appears.

175
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:44,970
[SPEAKER_52]: You can also see the existing houses casting shadows in their yards and in neighbors' yards.

176
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,771
[SPEAKER_52]: Buildings cast shadows.

177
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,253
[SPEAKER_52]: If you look at it at 8 p.m., the lower right,

178
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:58,580
[SPEAKER_52]: see that's actually a shadow that's all the way out onto the rail.

179
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:00,701
[SPEAKER_52]: Go to the next.

180
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:04,143
[SPEAKER_52]: So I'll go to September 21st.

181
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,903
[SPEAKER_52]: We can do this one relatively quickly.

182
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:09,825
[SPEAKER_52]: It's not exactly the same as March 21st, but it's very, very close.

183
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,365
[SPEAKER_52]: Sun rises at 6.30, sun sets at 6.40.

184
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,146
[SPEAKER_52]: We got about 12 hours of sunlight.

185
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:25,644
[SPEAKER_52]: And you can see upper right, 9 a.m., tiny little dots of blue, or maybe one tiny little dot of blue.

186
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:30,286
[SPEAKER_52]: Again, that's the delta between eight stories and 10 stories.

187
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:36,968
[SPEAKER_52]: That's the additional net new shadow of a 10-story building as opposed to an eight-story building.

188
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:44,131
[SPEAKER_52]: And at noontime, there's a tiny little sliver of blue on the street side.

189
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:48,737
[SPEAKER_52]: Go to the next, and we're at 3 p.m.

190
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:52,200
[SPEAKER_52]: upper right, and we're at 4 p.m.

191
00:20:52,700 --> 00:21:06,131
[SPEAKER_52]: lower right, and again, you can see there's at three, new shadow, additional shadow in the street, and just crossing the street at four in the afternoon.

192
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:17,128
[SPEAKER_52]: and one more, and now we're basically at sunset at five, and then at six, upper right and lower right.

193
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:23,549
[SPEAKER_52]: And again, you can see how much shadow is being cast by existing conditions.

194
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:28,390
[SPEAKER_52]: And the net new shadow of a 10-story building at 6 p.m.

195
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:36,571
[SPEAKER_52]: is basically on the fields and on the roofs of the Tufts Athletic Buildings.

196
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,961
[SPEAKER_52]: Let's go to the next.

197
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,966
[SPEAKER_52]: So December 21st, of course, the shortest day of the year.

198
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,248
[SPEAKER_52]: Sunrise is at 710.

199
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,091
[SPEAKER_52]: This will be Friday, by the way.

200
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:49,133
[SPEAKER_52]: Friday?

201
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:49,533
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

202
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:51,235
[SPEAKER_52]: Or Saturday.

203
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:52,476
[SPEAKER_52]: Sunset is at 415.

204
00:21:54,959 --> 00:22:00,864
[SPEAKER_52]: Upper right, 9 a.m., basically the 8-story and 10-story is the same.

205
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:11,393
[SPEAKER_52]: At 12 noon, there's a little sliver again on the public way, not on any private property of Delta in shadow.

206
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:18,479
[SPEAKER_52]: And the next, now at 1 in the afternoon and then at

207
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:26,990
[SPEAKER_52]: 2 in the afternoon, you can see net new shadows 2 in the afternoon on September 21st.

208
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:40,215
[SPEAKER_52]: And if you go to the next, sun sets at 4.15, so our last chance to look is at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, you can see the net new shadows in blue.

209
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:50,851
[SPEAKER_52]: And then by four o'clock, the entire neighborhood, basically everything but the very top of the hill is covered in shadow.

210
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:56,076
[SPEAKER_52]: Next.

211
00:22:56,733 --> 00:23:04,760
[SPEAKER_52]: You've seen this many times, I will just and you've, we've talked about all of these public realm improvements.

212
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:15,629
[SPEAKER_52]: And I'll simply again point out the number 1, which I know you've heard just the moment ago, but the opportunity to provide on campus housing.

213
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:26,863
[SPEAKER_52]: for approximately 677 juniors and seniors who would otherwise be living off campus in apartments in the surrounding neighborhood.

214
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,985
[SPEAKER_52]: With that, Rocco, I'll return to you.

215
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:34,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, David.

216
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:40,328
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, in closing, I just want to take a moment to thank the board.

217
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:43,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we've had a lot of conversations about this project.

218
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:52,638
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to thank Alicia Hunt and Danielle Evans and Sal DiStefano and all the other city officials that we've worked on in this project.

219
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:59,183
[SPEAKER_13]: And I certainly want to thank our neighbors who have given us a lot of feedback on this project, and we have tried to incorporate

220
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:04,886
[SPEAKER_13]: as much of that feedback into this project as we as we possibly can.

221
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:09,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I started at Tufts University about eight years ago.

222
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:17,473
[SPEAKER_13]: And my first meeting was at the Danish pastry house with the city Councilor who didn't agree with Tufts on every issue.

223
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:25,936
[SPEAKER_13]: But he had a lot of suggestions as to what Tufts could do to improve the neighborhood.

224
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:36,160
[SPEAKER_13]: And those things included adding more housing on campus, making the campus more sustainable, and revitalizing Boston Avenue.

225
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,247
[SPEAKER_13]: And we keep a database in our office.

226
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:48,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And over the years, we've met with over 1,000 neighbors and government officials and elected officials.

227
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,597
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've all told me the same thing.

228
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:56,181
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this project is a generational opportunity.

229
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,783
[SPEAKER_13]: for the city and for Tufts University to accomplish those goals.

230
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:08,686
[SPEAKER_13]: It adds more housing, it improves accessibility and sustainability, and it revitalizes Boston Avenue.

231
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:13,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And we hope that you'll vote to approve this project.

232
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:14,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

233
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:17,750
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. DeRico.

234
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,933
[SPEAKER_43]: Before I open it up to the public for public

235
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,502
[SPEAKER_43]: questions or comments, I'm going to open it up to the board.

236
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:33,224
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter Cowles.

237
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:35,926
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

238
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:49,555
[SPEAKER_46]: As I have previously for this project, I will be refusing myself from debate and voting on this project as I work for Niche Engineering, who did the traffic and civil engineering for this project.

239
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:55,459
[SPEAKER_46]: I'd like to thank you all for your efforts, and I will be back for the next agenda items.

240
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,653
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Peter.

241
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:06,580
[SPEAKER_43]: Any questions or comments from the board before opening up to public comment?

242
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,625
[SPEAKER_35]: I have my hand raised.

243
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,467
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if you can see it.

244
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:22,168
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, hi, Vice Chair.

245
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:22,969
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi.

246
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,050
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

247
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:37,983
[SPEAKER_35]: I wanted to thank the applicant for their detailed shadow analysis, also differentiating the colors on those diagrams, I think was very helpful to show the existing conditions and then the two

248
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,667
[SPEAKER_35]: a 10 story condition.

249
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:48,077
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm very curious to hear new feedback that the public has about that information.

250
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,141
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

251
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:52,743
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

252
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:09,779
[SPEAKER_43]: Any other board comments or?

253
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:14,003
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, I just put my hand up.

254
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:19,287
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Madam Chair and to the applicant.

255
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:26,233
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a question about the community or neighborhood support fund.

256
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:31,718
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that we heard about it for the first time in the last meeting and there were some questions about

257
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,332
[SPEAKER_29]: how it would be implemented.

258
00:27:34,412 --> 00:27:51,026
[SPEAKER_29]: Obviously, we don't know 100% of the details right now, but one of the concerns raised by Director Hunt was that if it goes to the city, that it can not go to any individual households, and that one of the things we were discussing is that one of the uses could be

259
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:59,714
[SPEAKER_29]: direct compensation or support to households who were facing increased costs or lack of solar.

260
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:05,544
[SPEAKER_29]: Has there been any additional detail on how that sort of fund would work in very broad strokes?

261
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:06,426
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

262
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:20,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Ari thank you for that question and yeah we actually had our last community meeting we put it out to the to the public, and we asked our neighbors how you would like to see that money spent.

263
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:26,415
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it, we, and we leave it to the neighbors and to the city to decide.

264
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:35,884
[SPEAKER_13]: to your specific question, Ari, if that's what the neighbors in the city decide is the best way to do the money or to utilize that money.

265
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:41,169
[SPEAKER_13]: While the city can't distribute it in direct payments, the university can.

266
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,975
[SPEAKER_13]: And we would be happy to if that's what the city and the neighbors decide to do with the money.

267
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,758
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

268
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,650
[SPEAKER_43]: Any other board questions?

269
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:07,352
[SPEAKER_43]: Sorry, I am trying to fit through over a hundred little Zoom squares, so please let me know if there's any other board questions.

270
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:14,234
[SPEAKER_43]: Seeing or hearing none, I'm going to open it up for public comment.

271
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:23,076
[SPEAKER_43]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

272
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:25,937
[SPEAKER_43]: You can also send an email to OCD at MedRateMA.

273
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:29,243
[SPEAKER_43]: method-ma.gov.

274
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,865
[SPEAKER_43]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

275
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:43,530
[SPEAKER_43]: A reminder that to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it is not part of the legal record.

276
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,093
[SPEAKER_43]: the legal public record.

277
00:29:46,593 --> 00:29:53,255
[SPEAKER_43]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message staff for assistance, or you can message myself.

278
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:57,776
[SPEAKER_43]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak, no more than two minutes.

279
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:14,260
[SPEAKER_43]: Also, comments should definitely be about new information provided, and only regarding the issues that the City Board can take into consideration as part of the site plan review, and that's relative to height, bulk, parking, setbacks, and design.

280
00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:20,698
[SPEAKER_43]: Alicia or Danielle, if you can please manage the public comment queue.

281
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:29,081
[SPEAKER_43]: And I do know that starting number one was El Rocco, and then the second was Harley Racer as a public comment.

282
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,521
[SPEAKER_43]: And then if you can take it from there.

283
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:36,383
[SPEAKER_39]: Great, thank you, Madam Chair.

284
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,704
[SPEAKER_39]: El Rocco, I'll ask you to unmute.

285
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,025
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, can you hear me?

286
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:43,784
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, we can.

287
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:48,830
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, Linda Rocco, 15-17 University Ave.

288
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,333
[SPEAKER_36]: Today, I took a little ride on my way home.

289
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:59,302
[SPEAKER_36]: I drove down Winthrop Street, and when you cross Winthrop Street and Boston Ave, you go up a hill and down a hill.

290
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:08,689
[SPEAKER_36]: On the left-hand side of that hill is a massive parking lot and a big plot of land.

291
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,071
[SPEAKER_36]: It looks like some type of a baseball field.

292
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:18,097
[SPEAKER_36]: That area is literally seven times the size of that little land in Boston at.

293
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:26,924
[SPEAKER_36]: So my question is, to the Board of Tufts, why isn't that building being built on the Tufts campus?

294
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:29,726
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, no one's given us any answers.

295
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:31,967
[SPEAKER_36]: I want an answer.

296
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:45,429
[SPEAKER_36]: And if the board of Tufts who's handling this project can't help me, I will contact the president of Tufts myself and ask him that question, because I think it's time he gets involved in the project.

297
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,970
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you very much.

298
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:55,451
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Ms.

299
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:55,851
[SPEAKER_43]: Frankel.

300
00:31:57,592 --> 00:32:00,112
[SPEAKER_39]: The next hand raised is Harley Racer.

301
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:03,473
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, Ms.

302
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:05,013
[SPEAKER_48]: Hunt, and thank you, Madam Chair.

303
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,254
[SPEAKER_48]: My name is Harley Racer.

304
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:11,377
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm an attorney at Richmay PC Law Firm in Boston at 176 Federal Street.

305
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:17,100
[SPEAKER_48]: I represent some residents of Medford, including abutters to this project and this property.

306
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,661
[SPEAKER_48]: And I submitted a letter today.

307
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:28,566
[SPEAKER_48]: I've come onto this recently, so I sent a letter today, and I don't presume that the members of the board have read it all or digested it, but I'll quickly summarize.

308
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:29,407
[SPEAKER_48]: I know time is short.

309
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:34,672
[SPEAKER_48]: We ask for the board to continue this hearing for 3 reasons.

310
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,656
[SPEAKER_48]: 1st of all, the mayor has written a letter.

311
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:46,966
[SPEAKER_48]: The city council has passed a unanimous resolution and yesterday state representatives submitted a letter to the board requesting that this process.

312
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:51,810
[SPEAKER_48]: Slow down a little so that we can take a look at the specifically the height.

313
00:32:52,090 --> 00:33:03,198
[SPEAKER_48]: There's been a lot of issues and a lot of concerns, but they spoke with the unified unified voice that this board should consider the reasonable regulations concerning height, bulk and setback.

314
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:07,022
[SPEAKER_48]: Amplifying the, the voices of the neighborhood.

315
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:10,585
[SPEAKER_48]: Secondly, I laid this out in my letter.

316
00:33:10,665 --> 00:33:17,293
[SPEAKER_48]: There are some issues that I've identified in the submission that the board should take a look at 1st of all.

317
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:25,444
[SPEAKER_48]: The Tufts does not have as a right to build 10 stories or more than 10 stories as they claim.

318
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:28,027
[SPEAKER_48]: This building is not a dormitory.

319
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:37,396
[SPEAKER_48]: Under the zoning ordinances, a dormitory cannot include business uses, and this includes one and a half floors of business uses.

320
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:45,282
[SPEAKER_48]: This falls under the definition of a multi-unit dwelling, which does allow for non-resident uses, which is what we have in these buildings.

321
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,144
[SPEAKER_48]: So these are not dormitories.

322
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:59,715
[SPEAKER_48]: As a multi-unit dwelling, under the table of dimensional regulations, the maximum height for the first two is three floors, and the maximum height for subsequent buildings is six floors.

323
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:13,029
[SPEAKER_48]: And I would ask the board to request us to provide more information concerning the multi unit dwelling dimensions and what relief they would need under that, because that is where it falls.

324
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:19,395
[SPEAKER_48]: Thirdly, they treat the the property as a single lot.

325
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:26,901
[SPEAKER_48]: and they refer to the case that went up to the appeals court in 1993, Trustees of Tufts versus Medford.

326
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:37,546
[SPEAKER_48]: And in that case, the appeals court said it was okay in that instance for the city to do what it did, which was concede that it would be treated as a single lot for the parking purposes.

327
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,747
[SPEAKER_48]: But that's not required now.

328
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:46,370
[SPEAKER_48]: And this is actually three lots, and Tufts says in their application that by utilizing the single,

329
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,415
[SPEAKER_48]: single zoning lot that they do not have to seek other relief from this board.

330
00:34:52,597 --> 00:35:03,750
[SPEAKER_48]: The board should request Tufts to go back and submit a site plan using the three lots that are actually in existence and identify what relief they would need under that.

331
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:12,713
[SPEAKER_48]: These issues that I'm raising are necessary for the board to make an informed decision and understand your authority that you have.

332
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:28,797
[SPEAKER_48]: Notwithstanding the Dover Amendment, you can still enact and subject this property to reasonable regulations, including meeting those concerns of the neighborhood that have been identified by the mayor, the city council, and the state representatives and have a reduced height.

333
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:30,678
[SPEAKER_48]: And if the board's not prepared,

334
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:37,219
[SPEAKER_48]: to request that information, the board should deny the application for failure to provide that information.

335
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,400
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm happy to answer any questions, but I know a lot of people are in line and want to talk.

336
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:42,561
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you for your time.

337
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:47,062
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

338
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,343
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Jacob Fridman.

339
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

340
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:56,568
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Jacob Friedman.

341
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a senior at Tufts living at 119 Burgett Avenue.

342
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:07,511
[SPEAKER_11]: My fellow Jumbos and I have routinely struggled to find affordable off-campus housing, and this project will be a major help.

343
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:16,974
[SPEAKER_11]: The university has clearly taken great steps to incorporate the feedback and guidance from the city and my fellow residents, and thus I urge the board to move this project forward.

344
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:17,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

345
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:24,478
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

346
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:27,781
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Laura Jasinski.

347
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:30,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

348
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:31,485
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Laura Jasinski.

349
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:33,767
[SPEAKER_26]: I live at 65 Burgett Ave.

350
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:34,448
[SPEAKER_26]: This is Remy.

351
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:35,249
[SPEAKER_26]: She also lives here.

352
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:44,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I am also a Tufts alum, twice bachelor's in 07 and master's of urban planning and policy in 14.

353
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,562
[SPEAKER_26]: And we'll keep my comments really simple.

354
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:57,033
[SPEAKER_26]: I think you heard tonight that Tufts has claimed to do a lot of public outreach, and yet they actually claim themselves that they haven't changed the building or made any changes.

355
00:36:57,473 --> 00:37:00,076
[SPEAKER_26]: Those to me are directly in contradiction.

356
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:03,139
[SPEAKER_26]: And what we want is a better project.

357
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,482
[SPEAKER_26]: And this board has an opportunity to help us do that.

358
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:06,603
[SPEAKER_26]: We've provided.

359
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:21,491
[SPEAKER_26]: both the advocacy, community engagement ourselves as a neighborhood, as well as the legal path and political backing to allow this board to make the decision that they should make tonight, which is ask for a continuance or deny based on insufficient information.

360
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,952
[SPEAKER_26]: I also just wanted to end by thanking the board.

361
00:37:23,972 --> 00:37:24,973
[SPEAKER_26]: I know this is a lot.

362
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:35,458
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a lot of late meetings as well as the staff at Medford and appreciate the attention that you've given to this project and this really important matter which will impact lots of us and multiple generations

363
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:39,119
[SPEAKER_26]: for the life of this project and for the rest of our lives.

364
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:39,699
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

365
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:46,281
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

366
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,082
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Alex and Carrie Nicole.

367
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:55,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the opportunity to comment this evening.

368
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:59,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you board for your thoughtful consideration of this critical issue.

369
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:02,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex Hackman, Carrie Nicole Dillman,

370
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,191
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at 71 Hume Avenue.

371
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:06,951
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also both class 94.

372
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Tufts.

373
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:10,893
[SPEAKER_07]: We love living nearby Tufts.

374
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,873
[SPEAKER_07]: We totally support higher density housing.

375
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:19,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will see this huge building as a wall outside of our multiple windows in our house.

376
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:20,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll block our solar.

377
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,756
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's nothing like it's going to do to our neighbors.

378
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:27,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I would say, we want to say a couple of things here.

379
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:30,099
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, the focus on trees is not an issue.

380
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:30,739
[SPEAKER_07]: It's irrelevant.

381
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:31,579
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't talk about that.

382
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:32,900
[SPEAKER_07]: The issue is the height and mass.

383
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:36,679
[SPEAKER_07]: The shading is being downplayed by Mr. Manfredi.

384
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,119
[SPEAKER_07]: He showed September and spring.

385
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are both extremely bright.

386
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter time is dark.

387
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:45,964
[SPEAKER_07]: We have about four and a half months of full shadows on my roof.

388
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:49,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are end of day key solar generation times.

389
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: We just spent a lot of money on solar.

390
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:54,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's deceptive and I don't appreciate that.

391
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's a lot of darkness being cast in the neighborhood.

392
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The way you're depicting those dates you chose are not exactly helpful.

393
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:05,504
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer here is make the building smaller.

394
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:10,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to invite people to think creatively about where do you see the next 10-story building?

395
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:15,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Take in your mind the green line or the red line downtown.

396
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:18,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you see the next 10-story building?

397
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:22,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't exist until you get to Lechmere or maybe Kendall or Park Street.

398
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:28,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are downtown cities, not a vibrant residential

399
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,371
[SPEAKER_07]: a commercial corridor that we're trying to create on Boston Avenue.

400
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:45,754
[SPEAKER_07]: City board members, we're imploring you, think about how embarrassing this building is going to be as this gigantic thing in the midst of a corridor you're trying to create that's inviting a centerpiece of Medford.

401
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:50,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So make it five to seven stories plus mitigation.

402
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:55,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And realistic mitigation here is going to be loss of property value,

403
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:10,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Loss of solar power, which means pay for batteries, offset solar installation costs, install level 2 chargers, and then offset the aesthetics and the light impacts, which is give me a private fund so my neighbors can plant trees in their backyard.

404
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:12,902
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not complicated to come up with how to use that money.

405
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:13,963
[SPEAKER_07]: We can come up with that.

406
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,243
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really smart in this neighborhood.

407
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:18,245
[SPEAKER_07]: For all these reasons, board,

408
00:40:19,072 --> 00:40:22,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We implore you to continue this meeting for more meaningful discussion.

409
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:31,136
[SPEAKER_07]: As Rocco said, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to potentially ruin our neighborhood and also the potential future redevelopment of Boston Avenue.

410
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:32,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

411
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:36,617
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

412
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,618
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Lori Krieger.

413
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,879
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, everyone.

414
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:42,979
[SPEAKER_45]: Nice to see you again.

415
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,000
[SPEAKER_45]: We've had a nice month or two together.

416
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:53,500
[SPEAKER_45]: I want to say please pay a lot of attention to what Mr. Racer has shared with you and look at it very deeply.

417
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,025
[SPEAKER_45]: And what Carrie and Alex just said is super important.

418
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:03,288
[SPEAKER_45]: It's also about our loss of sanity in terms of the shadows, right?

419
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:09,933
[SPEAKER_45]: With seasonal affective disorder, with disruption to sleep, with our circadian rhythms, with the lights on at night.

420
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,222
[SPEAKER_45]: But what I'm really concerned about, and I sent a letter earlier today and I'd like you to please read my letter.

421
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:21,424
[SPEAKER_45]: It has a photograph in it again showing how much lower the end of Brookings is to Boston Ave.

422
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:24,305
[SPEAKER_45]: It has a bus going across so you can see the height differential.

423
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:32,548
[SPEAKER_45]: And this is relating to canyoning and that whole concept that this is going to appear bigger than it might look on their drawings and renderings.

424
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:37,170
[SPEAKER_45]: But also in what they presented, they presented the same thing each time.

425
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:39,647
[SPEAKER_45]: They have not changed anything.

426
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:49,030
[SPEAKER_45]: This time, because the board made the request, we got to see the shadows in the peach color and the blue color.

427
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:57,713
[SPEAKER_45]: But even just now, Mr. Manfredi said, was calling the blue color the net new color versus the peach color.

428
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:01,194
[SPEAKER_45]: No, it would all be new, peach and blue.

429
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:04,475
[SPEAKER_45]: And they're not showing us any options that show

430
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:07,745
[SPEAKER_45]: no shadowing, right?

431
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:09,927
[SPEAKER_45]: They're not showing us what seven stories look like.

432
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,488
[SPEAKER_45]: They're not showing us what six stories look like.

433
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:16,250
[SPEAKER_45]: So they need to be a little bit more even-handed or more helpful.

434
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:22,854
[SPEAKER_45]: If they're not, then we need to find another source for information so we can see what the comparison is, right?

435
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:26,856
[SPEAKER_45]: It seems like we should have that information presented to us.

436
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:29,638
[SPEAKER_45]: The other thing

437
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:37,267
[SPEAKER_45]: was that in their earlier slide, the existing condition that they said with the tree there, that's not the existing condition.

438
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:40,550
[SPEAKER_45]: That tree went down a year and a half ago or something like that.

439
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:49,897
[SPEAKER_45]: So again, I'm asking you to please verify what they're sending to you and look at it closely because it's not current, it's not realistic, and it's not helpful.

440
00:42:50,398 --> 00:42:50,738
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

441
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:55,490
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

442
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:58,733
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is James Ancalada.

443
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,054
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, I'm sure I pronounced that wrong.

444
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's okay.

445
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:03,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me okay?

446
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:04,657
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

447
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:05,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

448
00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:06,578
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

449
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:12,863
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to echo what Alex and Carrie and Lori said.

450
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:17,106
[SPEAKER_19]: This building is not gonna be a benefit to the neighborhood.

451
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:18,727
[SPEAKER_19]: It's gonna take from the neighborhood.

452
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:32,171
[SPEAKER_19]: For the rest of my life, I'm going to have sunset arrive at my home an hour to three hours early every day for the rest of my life if this building is built to the height that it's being proposed at right now.

453
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:37,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I feel like all of us who live on Charnwood.

454
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:44,373
[SPEAKER_19]: the end of Brookings and Burgett Ave, we're going to have our privacy invaded upon.

455
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:55,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Every day we go into our backyards, we'll be able to look up and have 600 students staring down into our property every day for the rest of our lives.

456
00:43:57,198 --> 00:44:04,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Like we said before, this is a once in a lifetime thing and it's gonna have a lifetime effect on the neighborhood.

457
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:08,663
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this project needs more planning.

458
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:10,724
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it needs more discussion.

459
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:23,069
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the height of the building definitely needs to be reduced and we need to see what other options are available so that Tufts can meet its goals and the neighborhood can be satisfied with what Tufts is doing.

460
00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:24,090
[SPEAKER_19]: This building,

461
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:25,551
[SPEAKER_19]: is ugly.

462
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:27,773
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't fit the neighborhood.

463
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:35,220
[SPEAKER_19]: This building belongs in Kendall Square in Cambridge or Assembly Road, not in the hillside.

464
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:39,224
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't fit any buildings on Tufts or in the neighborhood.

465
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:44,849
[SPEAKER_19]: It's ugly and we don't want to have to literally live in the shadow of it for the rest of our lives.

466
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:45,570
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

467
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:49,096
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

468
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:53,120
[SPEAKER_39]: And my apologies, I just realized that I had been forgetting to use the timer.

469
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,842
[SPEAKER_39]: That's no offense to anybody.

470
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:57,243
[SPEAKER_39]: I've just remembered it.

471
00:44:58,264 --> 00:45:02,567
[SPEAKER_39]: Our next speaker is user JMN.

472
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:15,298
[SPEAKER_39]: Is user JMN there?

473
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,899
[SPEAKER_39]: We are not hearing you.

474
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:21,373
[SPEAKER_39]: But you're unmuted.

475
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:22,773
[SPEAKER_39]: Let me unmute you again.

476
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:32,696
[SPEAKER_39]: If we're not hearing you, you may chat me directly and I'll read that out or I'll come back to you.

477
00:45:37,598 --> 00:45:39,199
[SPEAKER_39]: Send me a direct chat and we'll figure it out.

478
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,279
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Ren.

479
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:45,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, thank you.

480
00:45:46,794 --> 00:46:00,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 37 Woodrow Avenue, not exactly near the site, so I'll keep my comments limited to the things that I think would affect all the residents of Medford, which would be traffic on Boston Avenue, which would be affecting anyone that commutes near that area.

481
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,362
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that I don't think I've seen touched on in the comment letters or the public hearing comments was

482
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:26,508
[SPEAKER_06]: their trash plan for the east building is curbside and in the in the materials it looked like they were also planning on putting up a like metal bollard type barriers all along that sidewalk so i'm having trouble envisioning how they would do curbside pickup also for the number of residents in that building that would be a lot trashed

483
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:34,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just thinking on Thursdays, which is the day that street is scheduled for pickup, you'd have a trash truck sitting there picking up I don't know how many receptacles.

484
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be quite a lot.

485
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:40,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I would strongly suggest a different trash plan than curbside for that number of residents.

486
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:50,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, whether it ends up being six, eight, or 10 stories, even at the smallest, that's a lot of occupants to do curbside trash on a busy road with one lane.

487
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:55,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would create a lot of congestion on a weekday commute time.

488
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:11,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the site plan also carved out two spots for, you know, PNC, like Lyft, Uber, and, you know, Uber Eats food drop-off.

489
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:12,996
[SPEAKER_06]: That does not seem sufficient.

490
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:18,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're going to end up with a lot of vehicles, you know, parking in the bike lane or just parking in the middle of the road to do

491
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:36,191
[SPEAKER_06]: quick drop-offs and pickups, but as we all know, what the driver thinks is going to be quick is going to hold up traffic and just sort of be a nightmare unless they do that a little more thoughtfully and maybe direct pickups to an alternate space than those just two spots right along Boston Ave.

492
00:47:36,211 --> 00:47:36,972
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you very much.

493
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:39,714
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

494
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:42,496
[SPEAKER_39]: We're going to go to user JMN again.

495
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:43,497
[SPEAKER_39]: We're just going to try again.

496
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:57,600
[SPEAKER_39]: I can see that you're unmuted, but we're not hearing you.

497
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:07,210
[SPEAKER_39]: We're still not hearing you.

498
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:11,455
[SPEAKER_39]: I did see another person had put their hand down.

499
00:48:13,297 --> 00:48:14,959
[SPEAKER_39]: So the next speaker is JFD8.

500
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:27,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my name is John Dillon.

501
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:29,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 11 Nolwood Road.

502
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:44,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to maybe thank Tufts for letting me know with this new shadow study that the springtime sunset is going to affect my house.

503
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:53,088
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am not certain as to how accurate that is because I can, it looks as if

504
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:59,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever developed the study has not visited Stearns Field.

505
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:10,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It is much shadier at 3 PM, even before December 21, than it is depicted.

506
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:23,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I would like to chime in on the woman from University App, because she was asking, do you have anything planned for

507
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:28,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't you build on the other side in those fields?

508
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:37,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I was speaking to some electricians who were doing a lot of work on Boston Ave over the summer and asked, why are you here so long?

509
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:37,771
[SPEAKER_02]: What's taking?

510
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:46,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were saying that Tufts has some plans to build over there and that the plans include a dorm.

511
00:49:46,593 --> 00:49:53,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand they are not official sources, but I would like to ask Tufts,

512
00:49:55,093 --> 00:50:08,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any plans over in that corner behind the fields, behind say, you know, Ongian field?

513
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:09,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm mispronouncing that.

514
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm butchering it.

515
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:15,563
[SPEAKER_02]: What if any plans are in the process and have been

516
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:19,205
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps prepared for according to electricians?

517
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:26,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, is this a twice in a lifetime opportunity, not a once in a lifetime opportunity?

518
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:28,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

519
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,020
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

520
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,643
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Adrienne Landau.

521
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:39,789
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, Director Hunt, we have Adrienne Landau.

522
00:50:40,189 --> 00:50:46,995
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to say, I cannot see what your sign says, but I want to make sure that to keep the quorum, you have the freedom of speech.

523
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:54,181
[SPEAKER_43]: However, I want to make sure that we're not disrupting the meeting if it is offensive, because I cannot, from here, make out what your sign says.

524
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:00,287
[SPEAKER_31]: My sign says we are the hillside.

525
00:51:00,955 --> 00:51:03,196
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I cannot read it.

526
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:06,918
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, you you are, you definitely have freedom of speech.

527
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:10,139
[SPEAKER_43]: I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't offensive or foul language or anything like that.

528
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:12,040
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm a visual learner.

529
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,081
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think a lot of people are too.

530
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:29,988
[SPEAKER_31]: And and recognize that the people that are here, not have all these concerns, especially about nothing has really changed except a couple of more bucks being thrown towards the city and or

531
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:37,610
[SPEAKER_31]: the community in the hillside, mostly the hillside on both sides of the rail line.

532
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:57,595
[SPEAKER_31]: But I wanted to add, again, when you're standing in our neighborhood, which is Brookings towards our end, which we're very close to the end of Brookings, when you're standing on most parts of Burgett, especially on the down low part,

533
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,922
[SPEAKER_31]: probably on Hume as well, even Sunset.

534
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:08,688
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not straight across.

535
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:17,795
[SPEAKER_31]: I think Laurie sent a picture today to some of you that shows the difference between

536
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:29,709
[SPEAKER_31]: standing on the street and what the height is up to the sidewalk that is where this building would go.

537
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,092
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's quite a distance.

538
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:43,921
[SPEAKER_31]: It is much, much greater than what is pictured on the extended rendering that finally includes

539
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:48,373
[SPEAKER_31]: all the way across to the neighborhood.

540
00:52:48,893 --> 00:52:54,154
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a much more dramatic look up above 10 stories.

541
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:59,715
[SPEAKER_31]: So again, we've said it many times now.

542
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:02,495
[SPEAKER_31]: It looks like a giant hotel.

543
00:53:02,535 --> 00:53:05,136
[SPEAKER_31]: It looks like a giant monolith.

544
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:08,557
[SPEAKER_31]: Today, I decided it's the White Cliffs of Dover.

545
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:20,082
[SPEAKER_31]: It was so many things that I want to call it, other than a great new opportunity to have many more students on campus.

546
00:53:20,162 --> 00:53:28,424
[SPEAKER_31]: I agree with that young man who spoke, the student, yes, it would be great for them to be together in the campus.

547
00:53:28,444 --> 00:53:34,346
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, I did not know that.

548
00:53:34,706 --> 00:53:35,486
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, I'm done.

549
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:36,927
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm sorry about that.

550
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,247
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm gonna change that setting.

551
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:41,193
[SPEAKER_39]: I did not mean to be so rude.

552
00:53:41,253 --> 00:53:42,214
[SPEAKER_39]: I apologize.

553
00:53:42,234 --> 00:53:43,615
[SPEAKER_39]: It's OK.

554
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:45,796
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm good.

555
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:49,099
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Jeremy Martin.

556
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everyone.

557
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,621
[SPEAKER_23]: Jeremy Martin, 65, Burgadave.

558
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:11,703
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll start tonight by just asking you again, you've heard a lot from our neighbors and abutters about the impacts of this project, the real tangible impacts and frustration with the process about how we've gotten to this point.

559
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:17,384
[SPEAKER_23]: And so to just ask again, please don't buy the narrative that this has been an engaging process.

560
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:20,605
[SPEAKER_23]: We were presented a building plan that has been fully baked.

561
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,045
[SPEAKER_23]: It hasn't changed.

562
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:25,066
[SPEAKER_23]: We were presented a site plan that was incomplete.

563
00:54:25,726 --> 00:54:33,509
[SPEAKER_23]: And all that's really happened is that now the work has been done to build or design an appropriate streetscape for a project like this.

564
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:39,171
[SPEAKER_23]: So, there hasn't really been any movement in anything related to what the community just talked about.

565
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:40,852
[SPEAKER_23]: So, please keep that in mind.

566
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:51,006
[SPEAKER_23]: You heard tonight some really important questions about the zoning and about Tufts proposal and how it's being presented to you.

567
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:53,229
[SPEAKER_23]: I think you should take a really hard look at those.

568
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:57,255
[SPEAKER_23]: Dover amendment does not give

569
00:54:57,956 --> 00:55:07,440
[SPEAKER_23]: Institutions free reign as, as you might be led to believe it actually gives you the tools along with the city ordinances to reasonably regulate projects like this.

570
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,601
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's reasonable.

571
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:13,423
[SPEAKER_23]: In exchange for all of the other relief.

572
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:24,892
[SPEAKER_23]: that the Tufts is asking for, setbacks, lots, all of those things, to enforce the height requirements associated with a building like this, a multiple use dwelling.

573
00:55:25,913 --> 00:55:32,118
[SPEAKER_23]: It's reasonable for you to really question the amount of information that has been provided, how it's been provided.

574
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:33,719
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have complete site plans?

575
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,282
[SPEAKER_23]: Do they represent what's being sold to you in these meetings?

576
00:55:38,243 --> 00:55:43,488
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's make sure that what we're being pitched is actually what's going to be built if we're at that point.

577
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:50,734
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unreasonable to be asked to push this project through so quickly on such a short timeline.

578
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:58,521
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unreasonable for the way that this has been presented to you from a standpoint of community engagement.

579
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:02,525
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, please consider those questions carefully.

580
00:56:03,585 --> 00:56:07,726
[SPEAKER_23]: not just this evening, but going forward, help this community.

581
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:11,767
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the goal of the Community Development Board is to really protect the community.

582
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:19,649
[SPEAKER_23]: We need your help to make sure that this is a fair process and an equitable outcome for both Tufts and the community.

583
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:26,271
[SPEAKER_23]: Right now, it's entirely one-sided, and that's your opportunity to make that right.

584
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:26,631
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

585
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:30,590
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

586
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,305
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Christopher Nielsen.

587
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:35,601
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

588
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:38,023
[SPEAKER_34]: My name is Christopher Nielsen.

589
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:40,125
[SPEAKER_34]: I live at 39 Charter Road.

590
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:50,934
[SPEAKER_34]: I hope the CDB has heard the unanimous feedback that the citizens of Medford have shared both in these meetings and in the very recent public meetings.

591
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:56,678
[SPEAKER_34]: I think there's actually little disagreement that this site is wildly appropriate for development.

592
00:56:57,379 --> 00:57:00,701
[SPEAKER_34]: I very much want for a better urban design for Boston Ave.

593
00:57:00,942 --> 00:57:04,344
[SPEAKER_34]: And we very much support the housing of all Tufts undergraduates.

594
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:11,397
[SPEAKER_34]: But this project is a fairly straightforward oversimplification of just that last item.

595
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:17,360
[SPEAKER_34]: It certainly houses hundreds of students, but it does so creating a wall to the campus.

596
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,441
[SPEAKER_34]: This design doesn't really support a thriving Boston Ave.

597
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,862
[SPEAKER_34]: We should consider what that streetscape is.

598
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:28,625
[SPEAKER_34]: It starts with a power plant, no public realm, moves on to a parking garage,

599
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,972
[SPEAKER_34]: And then it proposes a 530 foot wall.

600
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:42,304
[SPEAKER_34]: There's about 100 feet of retail space, followed by 400 ish feet of blank wall that dies into amount.

601
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:50,451
[SPEAKER_34]: Tufts has made the case that this is the only opportunity for development, and I think we all know that that's not true.

602
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:53,672
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a hillside hardware site that remains vacant.

603
00:57:53,732 --> 00:57:59,076
[SPEAKER_34]: They've built almost a small town on the Curtis Street parking lot that's come up a number of times.

604
00:58:00,216 --> 00:58:02,718
[SPEAKER_34]: Frankly, the proposal is kind of strange.

605
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:07,879
[SPEAKER_34]: It does not seem to support the city's recently published vision.

606
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:16,742
[SPEAKER_34]: And as admitted by Tufts just right now, it doesn't seem to incorporate any of the feedback that they've heard at any of these public meetings.

607
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:22,544
[SPEAKER_34]: I think the neighborhood has made it clear that they would be super disappointed in the current proposal.

608
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:28,386
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think we all kind of have a sense that Tufts might also feel disappointed if this were to move forward.

609
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,347
[SPEAKER_34]: I thank you for your comments.

610
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,067
[SPEAKER_34]: I hope they have an impact.

611
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:35,569
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's important for this public forum to take place.

612
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,891
[SPEAKER_34]: And I hope that we can continue to work together.

613
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:39,531
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

614
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:42,632
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

615
00:58:42,813 --> 00:58:45,434
[SPEAKER_39]: The next, we're going to go to user JMN.

616
00:58:47,035 --> 00:58:47,735
[SPEAKER_40]: Can you hear me now?

617
00:58:48,681 --> 00:58:49,141
[SPEAKER_40]: You can.

618
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:50,182
[SPEAKER_40]: Oh, beautiful.

619
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:50,622
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

620
00:58:51,102 --> 00:58:51,602
[SPEAKER_40]: I apologize.

621
00:58:51,622 --> 00:58:54,884
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm going to keep my camera off just because I have bandwidth issues.

622
00:58:54,924 --> 00:58:55,764
[SPEAKER_40]: My name is Jean Nuzzo.

623
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:58,025
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm a Medford resident on Parris Street.

624
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:06,268
[SPEAKER_40]: I just want to point out that between 2019 and 2024, Tufts Center graduate enrollment rose by 25% or 1,300 students.

625
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:17,933
[SPEAKER_40]: Over the next few years and into 2026, Tufts anticipates an additional 600 students per year, which would bring them to 6,600 or more, depending upon their enrollment trajectory.

626
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:22,501
[SPEAKER_40]: So to say that this will offset housing by 660 units is inexact and disingenuous.

627
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:41,364
[SPEAKER_40]: I'd also further like to point out that we're in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime rezoning effort, and many areas within our city, specifically Mystic Ave and Salem Street, are being rezoned specifically for dorms, frats, and sororities by right.

628
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:52,266
[SPEAKER_40]: And so Tufts University has a choice here to be a good neighbor throughout its city or to encroach upon the quiet enjoyment of its residents.

629
00:59:52,786 --> 00:59:54,687
[SPEAKER_40]: The last points I'd like to make is that

630
00:59:56,347 --> 01:00:05,229
[SPEAKER_40]: In Cambridge, Councilor Sullivan drafted a bill for the state legislator repealing Harvard's exemption from Dover.

631
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:13,912
[SPEAKER_40]: And the bill was passed in 1981 and signed into law on July 5th by Governor Edward J. King.

632
01:00:14,312 --> 01:00:23,474
[SPEAKER_40]: And it essentially says that when a university is one of the largest landowners and is behaving like a developer, Dover

633
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:29,860
[SPEAKER_40]: does not protect, but they need to be treated like a landowner.

634
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:40,069
[SPEAKER_40]: And I would urge Tufts, as it has these opportunities that will come forward, to be a good neighbor to the people who reside here well beyond four years.

635
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,411
[SPEAKER_40]: I thank you for the time.

636
01:00:44,093 --> 01:00:44,554
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

637
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:47,537
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is user EB.

638
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:03,415
[SPEAKER_39]: Elizabeth Bale?

639
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:07,218
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, did user EB disappear or rename?

640
01:01:07,338 --> 01:01:09,279
[SPEAKER_39]: It updated to Elizabeth Bale.

641
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:10,980
[SPEAKER_39]: Did it?

642
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:11,361
[SPEAKER_39]: OK.

643
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:14,283
[SPEAKER_39]: Click the unmute again.

644
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:20,088
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you hear me now?

645
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:22,389
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, I couldn't get it to unmute.

646
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:23,710
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry about that.

647
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:26,453
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Elizabeth Bale.

648
01:01:26,493 --> 01:01:27,353
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm at 34 Emory Street.

649
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:54,441
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to read the section of a regulation that I've read about Dover that allows regulations such land or structures may be subject to reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures and determining yard sizes, lot area, setbacks, open space, parking and building coverage requirements.

650
01:01:55,121 --> 01:02:04,908
[SPEAKER_28]: And I've just been incredibly puzzled all along at why this board doesn't seem to want to use its power to regulate those things.

651
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:06,609
[SPEAKER_28]: This is unacceptable.

652
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:08,050
[SPEAKER_28]: It's huge.

653
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,571
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so out of scale.

654
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:18,396
[SPEAKER_28]: If you go down Boston Ave and look at the sphere towards Ball Square, it's five stories, and it's already very large.

655
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:39,267
[SPEAKER_28]: If you just try to visualize twice that height, and it's probably twice that width at least, it's just so out of scale for the area and it's going to permanently damage the fabric of our neighborhood, the use of our neighborhood, our quality of life here.

656
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:49,260
[SPEAKER_28]: I just really ask you to use your power to regulate those things that are explicitly granted to you to regulate.

657
01:02:50,622 --> 01:02:58,092
[SPEAKER_28]: I just also want to point out that the rendering stuff has shown about what this will look like.

658
01:02:59,954 --> 01:03:01,255
[SPEAKER_28]: are really misleading.

659
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:10,964
[SPEAKER_28]: As Lori Krieger has pointed out and shown in photographs, they're using a wide angle that flattens everything, so it makes the building look a lot smaller.

660
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:18,451
[SPEAKER_28]: And John Elliott made specific renderings that are more accurate to what it will actually look like.

661
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,334
[SPEAKER_28]: And I would urge you to pay attention to those.

662
01:03:23,155 --> 01:03:31,785
[SPEAKER_28]: so that you can have a better idea of what this will really do to the neighborhood and also to examine where else is there a building like this in Medford.

663
01:03:32,285 --> 01:03:33,106
[SPEAKER_28]: It doesn't fit.

664
01:03:33,286 --> 01:03:35,509
[SPEAKER_28]: It's wrong.

665
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:36,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

666
01:03:38,678 --> 01:03:39,658
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you very much, Ms.

667
01:03:39,698 --> 01:03:39,898
[SPEAKER_43]: Bale.

668
01:03:39,998 --> 01:03:57,482
[SPEAKER_43]: One of the things that I want to make clear to the public as well as the board, while I have this chance, before we go to the next, I do hear that, you know, the public is saying that the board has powers to use for the regulation of height, right?

669
01:03:57,502 --> 01:04:01,783
[SPEAKER_43]: 10 stories is well within height requirements of this proposed site, well within.

670
01:04:02,383 --> 01:04:13,414
[SPEAKER_43]: Therefore, we have been advised by legal that if any regulations are imposed to deal with shade and creative development, specifically the loss of light, that could be deemed unreasonable.

671
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,015
[SPEAKER_43]: So that's what we're dealing with here.

672
01:04:15,236 --> 01:04:19,220
[SPEAKER_43]: It's a very complex situation in which we're trying to get through.

673
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:26,647
[SPEAKER_43]: But I need, I would like for the public to actually have that information that was shared with us from legal itself.

674
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:34,493
[SPEAKER_43]: So the next speaker, please.

675
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:40,476
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, the next speaker is about to call on and her hand went down.

676
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:44,679
[SPEAKER_39]: There we go.

677
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:48,902
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Janie Tallarita.

678
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:56,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.

679
01:04:59,255 --> 01:05:03,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've thought, I've thought quite a bit about what I wanted to say.

680
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:09,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to first thank you, the board for listening to us yet again.

681
01:05:09,378 --> 01:05:25,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And also want to express that I, you know, so very much appreciate the mayor and the city council and representatives Jalen and Barbara for their careful review of this and their support of our concerns.

682
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:25,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And

683
01:05:30,751 --> 01:05:57,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know we just heard from Chair McPherson your concerns about your power, the limits of that power in Dover, but I really, this building does not fit the character of our neighborhood, the height, the bulk.

684
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:07,335
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not it's legitimately within the zoning and that's questionable and several people have raised that already.

685
01:06:07,356 --> 01:06:11,140
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't fit.

686
01:06:14,147 --> 01:06:27,569
[SPEAKER_01]: The original intent of Dover was to prevent discrimination of educational and religious institutions by zoning laws while balancing legitimate zoning concerns.

687
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:33,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do have the power to impose reasonable regulations on height and bulk.

688
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:42,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel that two 10-story buildings that take up an entire block is reasonable.

689
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for us, not for our neighborhood.

690
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:51,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jim said that it belongs in Kendall Square.

691
01:06:53,356 --> 01:07:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Architecturally, it's an ugly wall, and we're stuck with it forever.

692
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:05,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just doesn't fit, and it just doesn't work.

693
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:16,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that you will consider all of our concerns and do the right thing.

694
01:07:16,547 --> 01:07:16,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

695
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:20,891
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

696
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:23,995
[SPEAKER_39]: There is one more hand.

697
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:25,696
[SPEAKER_39]: The next hand is Lisa D.

698
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:37,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening, my name is Lisa DiMatteo and I reside at 138 Brookings Street.

699
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:50,930
[SPEAKER_25]: I am probably one of the most impacted households on this call in that I live at the very end of the dead end that faces the proposed site.

700
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,653
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanna say I agree with everything that my neighbors have said.

701
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:08,101
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the third night in a row that we've spent together trying to fight for our neighborhood.

702
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:12,383
[SPEAKER_25]: There's people that I've never met that I feel like I know.

703
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:23,987
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know the fine line that you all have to walk as a board.

704
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:55,117
[SPEAKER_25]: But along with the rest of everybody who spoke tonight, who have written letters, along with our senators who have also written a letter, which has also suggested a condition in which Tufts share their master plan, along with the city council who voted unanimously last night

705
01:08:58,969 --> 01:08:59,770
[SPEAKER_25]: to continue this.

706
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:07,636
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm sure there are others that I'm leaving out.

707
01:09:08,517 --> 01:09:12,060
[SPEAKER_25]: There's just a lot of people who are who are concerned about this.

708
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,462
[SPEAKER_25]: And each time we end up in one of these calls.

709
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:17,764
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it's tiring for everybody.

710
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:18,765
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm seeing new people.

711
01:09:20,346 --> 01:09:23,369
[SPEAKER_25]: Which means that there are a lot of people who are just finding out about it.

712
01:09:26,941 --> 01:09:27,962
[SPEAKER_25]: This is too fast.

713
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:45,511
[SPEAKER_25]: And I guess the ask is simply that however you interpret your powers here, that you travel to the outer edge of them for the city and for this neighborhood.

714
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:45,871
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

715
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:59,138
[SPEAKER_43]: And before we get to the next Director Hunt, I do have a question that came into the chat, just to repeat, because it's a public, we need a public record.

716
01:09:59,838 --> 01:10:12,925
[SPEAKER_43]: I have, unless it wants to be anonymous, I'll backtrack, but we have members that are on now, and one of the questions was asked, is the application of a zone and height standard on the edge of a zone the same as in the center?

717
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:16,745
[SPEAKER_43]: We think the proposed building is on the edge of a zone.

718
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:27,012
[SPEAKER_43]: That question is for the city, and I will leave it up to the person that sent the question to state name and address.

719
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:34,737
[SPEAKER_43]: Looks like they're trying to speak, so I will identify them as Alex and Carrie Nicole.

720
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,240
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

721
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:47,180
[SPEAKER_41]: Do you speak, we're not hearing you.

722
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:52,213
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, there.

723
01:10:54,357 --> 01:10:54,857
[SPEAKER_35]: They need to be.

724
01:10:55,137 --> 01:10:58,678
[SPEAKER_35]: I think Danielle's raising her hand to respond to the question.

725
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:00,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

726
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Alex and Kerry, 71 Humana Avenue.

727
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I put that question in the chat.

728
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair.

729
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,161
[SPEAKER_35]: We just didn't want to interrupt.

730
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,321
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I didn't want to interrupt you.

731
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:07,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

732
01:11:07,801 --> 01:11:12,503
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to say, please, please, please do not message board members.

733
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:15,204
[SPEAKER_44]: That's ex parte communication.

734
01:11:15,224 --> 01:11:18,125
[SPEAKER_44]: It could be an open meeting law violation.

735
01:11:18,585 --> 01:11:19,245
[SPEAKER_44]: Please don't.

736
01:11:19,966 --> 01:11:21,806
[SPEAKER_44]: We don't want any procedural defects.

737
01:11:22,706 --> 01:11:23,107
[SPEAKER_47]: OK, sorry.

738
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:23,567
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

739
01:11:28,174 --> 01:11:32,738
[SPEAKER_39]: So this is a question that Danielle, unless you wanted to add on to that question.

740
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:39,765
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, the space where your mute button would be is blocked on my screen unfortunately so I can't tell if you are muted.

741
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:48,933
[SPEAKER_39]: Danielle and I looked at this and one of the things is that it is from the border of, from the building to the border of the zone.

742
01:11:49,693 --> 01:12:03,778
[SPEAKER_39]: and we asked our lawyer how you would consider the border of the zone, then the adopted map that we are using, we adopted last spring, does not include the road and the railroad tracks as part of the zone.

743
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:17,342
[SPEAKER_39]: So the edge of the building to the start of the single-family zone is more than 100 feet per the measurements when the start of the zone is the border of the parcel with the single-family houses.

744
01:12:18,322 --> 01:12:26,852
[SPEAKER_39]: So that was something that we had looked at several weeks ago and asked our lawyer how we would measure what the edge of the single family zone would be.

745
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:31,677
[SPEAKER_39]: So it was a question that came up and we did consult our legal about it.

746
01:12:33,743 --> 01:12:48,213
[SPEAKER_39]: And I just, Chair McPherson answered this, but I did just wanna, it's the fact that the other permitted principal structures in this area, the maximum height allowed is 15 stories.

747
01:12:48,694 --> 01:12:56,880
[SPEAKER_39]: And so a reasonable massing, even though people may not agree that that is reasonable, it is what's in zoning.

748
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,562
[SPEAKER_39]: And so if you were to say in any situation that

749
01:13:01,884 --> 01:13:04,407
[SPEAKER_39]: reasonable is less than what is allowed by right.

750
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:12,079
[SPEAKER_39]: Any judge would not agree with that because that is another thing that we asked about was sort of the massing of that.

751
01:13:12,099 --> 01:13:12,940
[SPEAKER_39]: The

752
01:13:14,685 --> 01:13:21,466
[SPEAKER_39]: Medford versus Tufts case that is cited frequently from 1993 is actually about the garage next door.

753
01:13:22,206 --> 01:13:31,168
[SPEAKER_39]: And Medford attempted to impose it setback rules, zoning on that garage, which would have made it impossible to build the garage.

754
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:33,368
[SPEAKER_39]: And the judge found that that was illegal.

755
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:38,929
[SPEAKER_39]: And that was actually specifically that case was about the garage next door.

756
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:44,030
[SPEAKER_39]: So I just wanted to share that these are things that we have Danielle and I have discussed

757
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:49,832
[SPEAKER_39]: many of these items with our legal counsel to make sure that we're very clear on them.

758
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:54,974
[SPEAKER_39]: The other is the question as to whether this is a dormitory versus an apartment building.

759
01:13:55,394 --> 01:14:06,177
[SPEAKER_39]: It is extremely common these days that dormitories have actual like what looks like apartments with kitchens and private bathrooms in them.

760
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:09,999
[SPEAKER_39]: My son lives in one in Worcester, it's all over the place.

761
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,400
[SPEAKER_39]: The fact that it is on Tufts property,

762
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,901
[SPEAKER_39]: And the building will be owned by Tufts when the project is done.

763
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:23,642
[SPEAKER_39]: And it will house Tufts students is what makes it definitively covered by Dover per our legal team.

764
01:14:24,703 --> 01:14:31,985
[SPEAKER_39]: And that it is a dormitory because it will be housing students owned by a university, which is why it is not an apartment building.

765
01:14:32,705 --> 01:14:35,165
[SPEAKER_39]: So these were all questions that we've explored with legal.

766
01:14:35,285 --> 01:14:40,507
[SPEAKER_39]: And I just wanted to share that in bulk with the public.

767
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:50,251
[SPEAKER_39]: Chair McPherson, the hands that are raised now are repeats and they're not a lot, but I did want to know if you wanted to entertain them throughout.

768
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:54,452
[SPEAKER_39]: We've had many people speak, but only ever had two or three hands raised at one time.

769
01:14:58,214 --> 01:15:06,037
[SPEAKER_43]: I think because due to the nature of tonight's meeting, I think we're going to, did you have anything that came in, any new comments to summarize for us, Director Hunt?

770
01:15:07,363 --> 01:15:14,069
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, there were a large, large volume of comments that came in over the past week.

771
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:22,055
[SPEAKER_39]: We can check our email just in case there was anybody who was unable to raise their hand this evening.

772
01:15:23,196 --> 01:15:26,799
[SPEAKER_39]: There are no new comments since this meeting has started this evening.

773
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:32,204
[SPEAKER_39]: A lot of people have sent letters.

774
01:15:35,078 --> 01:15:51,804
[SPEAKER_39]: I do not believe other than that there are visuals in the letters, they're all available in your packets or on the website because they weren't ready for your Friday packets, that none of the points were significantly different from the points that have been raised this evening.

775
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:59,128
[SPEAKER_39]: There was one quick question that maybe Tufts would be able to answer, but I just felt was a clarity was about garbage pickup.

776
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:07,533
[SPEAKER_39]: Just at any time that a building of this scale would exist, we would never have toters on the streets, that kind of curbside.

777
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:11,555
[SPEAKER_39]: They've already talked about that they would have an interior room.

778
01:16:12,315 --> 01:16:14,636
[SPEAKER_39]: They would have a private pickup service.

779
01:16:14,676 --> 01:16:17,698
[SPEAKER_39]: It would not be the curbside that all of our houses have.

780
01:16:18,378 --> 01:16:21,800
[SPEAKER_39]: I just felt that was a new question that I had not heard previously.

781
01:16:26,863 --> 01:16:29,646
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. Racer, do you have a new question?

782
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:33,650
[SPEAKER_43]: Anything from new material that you've heard?

783
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:37,214
[SPEAKER_43]: Or is it going back to something that we've already covered?

784
01:16:38,315 --> 01:16:40,797
[SPEAKER_43]: Please, at this point, it's okay.

785
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:41,678
[SPEAKER_43]: It's only one or two.

786
01:16:41,758 --> 01:16:43,220
[SPEAKER_43]: You can unmute, Mr. Racer.

787
01:16:43,997 --> 01:16:44,738
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, madam chair.

788
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:50,461
[SPEAKER_48]: I just wanted to respond very briefly to 1 point about the definition of a dormitory.

789
01:16:51,302 --> 01:16:59,988
[SPEAKER_48]: The point I made in my letter, which I'm not sure has been fully understood is that the reason it's not a dormitory is not because there's kitchens in it.

790
01:17:00,268 --> 01:17:05,892
[SPEAKER_48]: The reason it's not a dormitory is because it has a retail component on the 1st, floor and a half.

791
01:17:06,392 --> 01:17:15,995
[SPEAKER_48]: and that moves it out of the definition of dormitory and into a multi-unit dwelling, which has a different height limit than the principal use catch-all.

792
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:19,596
[SPEAKER_48]: That's my point.

793
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:24,938
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't know if legal counsel has been asked that question or is aware of that issue that I've raised.

794
01:17:25,538 --> 01:17:27,959
[SPEAKER_48]: I would like to hear their response to that.

795
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:35,781
[SPEAKER_48]: But that's just one point of clarification I wanted to make about the building height and it not being a dormitory.

796
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:38,617
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much.

797
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:41,599
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

798
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:49,204
[SPEAKER_43]: I was just about to say that senior planner Daniel Evans has some information for you in regards to that question.

799
01:17:52,046 --> 01:17:55,488
[SPEAKER_44]: So, when I was reviewing this, I actually had.

800
01:17:56,856 --> 01:18:05,625
[SPEAKER_44]: pretty long back and forth with their attorney about what this use qualified as and ultimately landed on that.

801
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:17,338
[SPEAKER_44]: It's actually the Dover use, the use of land or structures for educational purposes on land owned or leased by the Commonwealth or any of its agencies, subdivisions, or bodies, politic or by a religious sector.

802
01:18:19,846 --> 01:18:22,487
[SPEAKER_44]: or denomination or by a nonprofit educational corporation.

803
01:18:23,007 --> 01:18:26,569
[SPEAKER_44]: So it falls under that educational use.

804
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:31,011
[SPEAKER_44]: So it doesn't have to meet the strict definition of a dorm.

805
01:18:32,512 --> 01:18:38,254
[SPEAKER_44]: And then that is what falls under other permanent structures, which are allowed up to 15 feet.

806
01:18:40,155 --> 01:18:48,279
[SPEAKER_44]: To be frank, I don't think it was ever contemplated that any by right or just subject to site plan review would ever be

807
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:52,260
[SPEAKER_44]: Subject to the 15 stories, it's never come up.

808
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,341
[SPEAKER_44]: The fact that when we saw it, we're like, huh?

809
01:18:55,802 --> 01:18:56,782
[SPEAKER_44]: Is that typo?

810
01:18:56,802 --> 01:18:57,703
[SPEAKER_44]: How is that in there?

811
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:04,546
[SPEAKER_44]: Most of the other uses are special permit that would fall under there.

812
01:19:04,987 --> 01:19:08,208
[SPEAKER_44]: And with special permits, we usually have some discretion.

813
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:14,752
[SPEAKER_44]: There's a max height, but you don't always get it if there's impacts.

814
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:21,716
[SPEAKER_44]: But again, if it's appealed, it's up for the judge who is a person and what they determine.

815
01:19:22,517 --> 01:19:37,329
[SPEAKER_44]: But generally, in my several decade career as planner, the maxes for projects that are not by right don't get the max height.

816
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:41,713
[SPEAKER_44]: It's more subjective, but I feel like with this Dover use,

817
01:19:43,828 --> 01:19:57,451
[SPEAKER_44]: We're pinned in a bit more, but as how we're getting advised by legal counsel, they've said that we can't require them to go under what they're allowed.

818
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:03,452
[SPEAKER_44]: That's what we've been advised.

819
01:20:03,572 --> 01:20:04,913
[SPEAKER_48]: I appreciate that, but I just,

820
01:20:06,908 --> 01:20:08,548
[SPEAKER_48]: I want to say one more thing.

821
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:11,369
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm not saying it's not a Dover amendment use.

822
01:20:11,509 --> 01:20:17,950
[SPEAKER_48]: I agree that it is, but they're still saying it's a dormitory, but it's not a dormitory.

823
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:28,713
[SPEAKER_48]: It's a Dover use as a multi-unit dwelling because it has the business and non-residential component, which moves it to a different part of the dimensional table.

824
01:20:29,793 --> 01:20:41,020
[SPEAKER_48]: If it were a dormitory from a private party, if it weren't a Dover use, if it was a dormitory by a purely private entity, it would require a special permit from the city council.

825
01:20:41,621 --> 01:20:56,750
[SPEAKER_48]: The city council could then regulate the height, but I think that you have the authority to do it now because of the definition of multi-use dwelling and it fits there, and even as a Dover use, you can still regulate the height.

826
01:20:58,451 --> 01:20:58,791
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

827
01:21:01,735 --> 01:21:02,636
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. Racer.

828
01:21:02,716 --> 01:21:08,303
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm actually, I don't see any other comments, so I am going to close the public comment period.

829
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:20,656
[SPEAKER_43]: for this meeting, and I'm going to open it up to the board for additional questions or to provide any kind of request from the proponent.

830
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:29,084
[SPEAKER_43]: One of the things to keep in mind is the reminder of the two questions before the board, which is, does this qualify as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

831
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:31,607
[SPEAKER_43]: We've been legally advised that, yes, it does.

832
01:21:32,227 --> 01:21:35,450
[SPEAKER_43]: Two, what are reasonable regulations that should apply to this project?

833
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:41,139
[SPEAKER_43]: Should the requested relief from park requirements and commission of standards such as setbacks be granted?

834
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:45,485
[SPEAKER_43]: What conditions of approval are needed to mitigate any adverse effects?

835
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:47,689
[SPEAKER_43]: That is what is before the board today.

836
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:51,455
[SPEAKER_43]: And I will tell you before opening up to the board for your comments, I have.

837
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:54,740
[SPEAKER_43]: a few of my own, and then we can go from there.

838
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:06,988
[SPEAKER_43]: For one, legal counsel has confirmed that reasonable means we can't require less than what zoning allows, and that this is definitely covered by Dover because it's to house tough students on tough land.

839
01:22:08,369 --> 01:22:12,172
[SPEAKER_43]: I want to be clear in my overall support for the concerns raised by the abutment residents.

840
01:22:12,672 --> 01:22:16,735
[SPEAKER_43]: I want to also emphasize the need for more on-campus housing for tough students.

841
01:22:16,895 --> 01:22:19,297
[SPEAKER_43]: My hope is that there will be a reasonable balance as we deliberate.

842
01:22:20,075 --> 01:22:28,941
[SPEAKER_43]: It is my opinion that due to the complexities of the law, the board should be legally advised as we sift through mitigation that addresses any adverse effects of this development.

843
01:22:29,501 --> 01:22:42,530
[SPEAKER_43]: And my concern is not so much just the possibility of litigation with missteps, although that is a very real possibility, but expert advice, legal advice, is necessary to navigate this case that deals with contentious community issues.

844
01:22:43,363 --> 01:22:50,609
[SPEAKER_43]: To further complicate matters, there has been conflicting information on what constitutes a reasonable regulation to mitigate concerns raised by our butters.

845
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:56,814
[SPEAKER_43]: In addition, the applicant sent in information well after the deadline, and which much of the board has not had a chance to digest.

846
01:22:57,495 --> 01:23:09,845
[SPEAKER_43]: Therefore, I am asking for a motion to one, continue to meet until a date certain, and two, another motion from the board to request legal guidance from any decisions on 401 Boston Avenue case before us.

847
01:23:12,435 --> 01:23:19,038
[SPEAKER_43]: That is my stance on this, and if the board has any other questions or suggestions, please state them now.

848
01:23:19,218 --> 01:23:21,419
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman.

849
01:23:21,559 --> 01:23:37,045
[SPEAKER_35]: I could not be more enthusiastic in my support of both of those suggestions to both continue to a date certain, and then also to have more robust kind of legal counsel ideally present on these calls

850
01:23:38,205 --> 01:23:46,052
[SPEAKER_35]: so that we can make a decision that is right for the applicant, is right for Medford, and is within the powers of this board.

851
01:23:47,293 --> 01:23:50,776
[SPEAKER_35]: So I completely support that, Chair McPherson, and thank you for your leadership.

852
01:23:52,477 --> 01:23:54,838
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Chair McPherson.

853
01:23:54,858 --> 01:24:02,443
[SPEAKER_43]: And I do want Tufts to also know that I am also in support of the on-campus housing for its students.

854
01:24:03,584 --> 01:24:15,231
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'm hoping for a compromise where you, as the proponent, are amenable to making the approvals to the project and in which the public is acquiescent without feeling duly aggrieved by the project.

855
01:24:15,351 --> 01:24:17,312
[SPEAKER_43]: But we're just not going to get there tonight.

856
01:24:17,392 --> 01:24:20,534
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's something that is a well-known fact.

857
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:28,056
[SPEAKER_43]: So that motion for the first item, but there is no other, um, board comments.

858
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:30,617
[SPEAKER_43]: I had a comment chair McPherson.

859
01:24:31,057 --> 01:24:31,317
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

860
01:24:31,897 --> 01:24:32,557
[SPEAKER_43]: Ari Fishman.

861
01:24:33,497 --> 01:24:34,897
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

862
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:48,120
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I do agree with, um, both chair McPherson and vice chair Hedeman, um, that we should certainly are not ready to vote today and we certainly need much more thorough legal advice.

863
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,360
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I,

864
01:24:51,504 --> 01:25:02,352
[SPEAKER_29]: Wanted to also take the opportunity as a member of the board to thank all the community members for speaking up and to ask Tufts.

865
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:06,995
[SPEAKER_29]: I am also a proponent of high density housing.

866
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:09,177
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that students should live on campus.

867
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:11,739
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to see more dorms and I even want to see

868
01:25:12,227 --> 01:25:18,209
[SPEAKER_29]: a dorm built in this location, I think it has the potential to be a wonderful benefit.

869
01:25:18,769 --> 01:25:28,132
[SPEAKER_29]: But what we're seeing through this process is, as you told us, you haven't changed the design much or at all in response to community feedback.

870
01:25:28,152 --> 01:25:33,654
[SPEAKER_29]: And I want us to be able to have a community process, which means that

871
01:25:35,087 --> 01:25:36,028
[SPEAKER_29]: things have to change.

872
01:25:36,348 --> 01:25:48,613
[SPEAKER_29]: And it might not be your ideal version, but it will, I think we can get somewhere that will benefit Tufts and its students and benefit the community or at the very least not make people even more seasonally depressed.

873
01:25:48,633 --> 01:25:52,915
[SPEAKER_29]: I kind of can't imagine losing that much sunlight as an individual.

874
01:25:54,195 --> 01:26:00,998
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I really urge Tufts to enter this negotiation in good faith and negotiate and be open.

875
01:26:01,658 --> 01:26:02,379
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that

876
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:10,575
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. DeRocco in his presentation often talked about this being a thorough site review process.

877
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:15,018
[SPEAKER_29]: But what we're being told is that as a board, we don't have the power to do a site review.

878
01:26:15,418 --> 01:26:23,044
[SPEAKER_29]: That's something that we do for private projects all the time where we have a lot of authority to say, no, this negatively impacts the community, go back.

879
01:26:23,704 --> 01:26:31,950
[SPEAKER_29]: What Dover Amendment is telling us and the way it's being interpreted is that we can only determine the two questions that

880
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:43,814
[SPEAKER_29]: the chair just described, and I both want to have more power in that situation and would love for Tufts not to be more flexible, even if that is true.

881
01:26:43,854 --> 01:26:46,915
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm not fully convinced that it is true that we have no power.

882
01:26:50,255 --> 01:26:56,497
[SPEAKER_29]: And to conclude, yes, I think those two motions are a very reasonable place to move at the end of this meeting.

883
01:26:57,537 --> 01:26:58,777
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Ari Fisher.

884
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:01,332
[SPEAKER_43]: Any other board?

885
01:27:01,732 --> 01:27:03,095
[SPEAKER_43]: So the motion.

886
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:04,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi Jackie.

887
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:06,682
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi Adam.

888
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:07,363
[SPEAKER_43]: Go ahead.

889
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:11,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm supportive of the two motions.

890
01:27:12,886 --> 01:27:32,810
[SPEAKER_18]: There was one other matter that we didn't really get to talk about today, which I would like to see addressed in the next meeting, which was just the nature of a 600-person building and Lyfts and Ubers into and out of the area, especially for food delivery.

891
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,910
[SPEAKER_18]: I think one of the neighbors had talked about that.

892
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:46,438
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not super concerned around the parking issues, but I do want to be forward thinking about just the nature of activity in and out.

893
01:27:47,238 --> 01:27:54,023
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to see thought put into exactly what that's going to look like so that we don't approve something and then on the back end,

894
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:06,240
[SPEAKER_18]: end up with a bunch of issues on that corridor.

895
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:25,191
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the second thing that would be helpful, in addition to what I think the other members of the board have said, I struggle a little bit with this particular corner with the new Greenland extension.

896
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:37,889
[SPEAKER_18]: And so where I would like to see a higher density, especially around these transit stations.

897
01:28:38,089 --> 01:28:40,670
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I do like that aspect of the dorm.

898
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:56,373
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know if it's from the board's perspective or from the city's perspective, but just a little bit, maybe we could just include that in some of these conversations for context of what exactly is the plan for this corridor and this corner.

899
01:28:57,934 --> 01:29:04,256
[SPEAKER_18]: And so where I, as kind of a board member, struggle is I definitely hear a lot of the concerns from the existing neighborhood.

900
01:29:04,316 --> 01:29:13,340
[SPEAKER_18]: But the broader plan is that this single family zoning area is really going to be developed, or we're going to try to get higher density.

901
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:20,363
[SPEAKER_18]: I could see a little bit more balance with maybe how we think about it as a board.

902
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:25,125
[SPEAKER_18]: But on the surface of it right now, yes, it does seem quite

903
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:36,571
[SPEAKER_18]: out of place with the character today, but I have a hard time envisioning sort of, is that really gonna be true over the next 10 years?

904
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:40,473
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are my comments.

905
01:29:43,775 --> 01:29:52,020
[SPEAKER_29]: If I may add one more thing, Adam reminded me, I don't know if we have any authority, but I would love to co-sign

906
01:29:53,094 --> 01:29:57,937
[SPEAKER_29]: our state senators request for a Tufts master plan.

907
01:29:57,957 --> 01:30:00,839
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know if we can enforce that, but I would love to see it.

908
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:03,981
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I'm saying that that is a thing I would love to see.

909
01:30:06,611 --> 01:30:07,912
[SPEAKER_35]: Not a motion, I'll second it.

910
01:30:08,693 --> 01:30:23,904
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's part of the motion to actually be guided with legal counsel because that will help us to sift through some of the real things that even our state legislative leaders as well as municipal leaders have been advocating for the communities for.

911
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:27,247
[SPEAKER_43]: It's just so complex that we don't know what that

912
01:30:28,302 --> 01:30:30,083
[SPEAKER_43]: what mitigation we're allowed to do.

913
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:40,270
[SPEAKER_43]: The first motion, again, is a motion to continue 401 Boston Ave site plan review for Dover amendment to February 5th at 6.30 PM.

914
01:30:41,651 --> 01:30:42,412
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll make the motion.

915
01:30:42,432 --> 01:30:46,415
[SPEAKER_43]: Second motion.

916
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:55,198
[SPEAKER_29]: I do just want to flag that there is a Pat Gallagher, um, whose profile sounds like he might be from a law office with his hand raised.

917
01:30:55,258 --> 01:30:58,139
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know if it's appropriate to call on him, but want to make sure.

918
01:30:58,259 --> 01:31:00,160
[SPEAKER_43]: Second motion.

919
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,161
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second that Jackie.

920
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:04,241
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice chair.

921
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:07,323
[SPEAKER_43]: And we had him in Peter cows.

922
01:31:09,944 --> 01:31:11,324
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, Ari Fishman.

923
01:31:12,505 --> 01:31:12,765
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

924
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:14,485
[SPEAKER_43]: Andy string.

925
01:31:15,806 --> 01:31:16,006
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi.

926
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:17,858
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrens.

927
01:31:18,519 --> 01:31:18,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

928
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,080
[SPEAKER_43]: Bill O'Connell.

929
01:31:22,081 --> 01:31:22,221
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

930
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:23,721
[SPEAKER_43]: Bill O'Reilly.

931
01:31:24,782 --> 01:31:24,942
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

932
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:27,003
[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

933
01:31:27,203 --> 01:31:27,523
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

934
01:31:27,603 --> 01:31:29,264
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Mr. DeRico.

935
01:31:29,464 --> 01:31:34,267
[SPEAKER_43]: And to all for your time tonight, we will see you on February 5th.

936
01:31:34,387 --> 01:31:38,029
[SPEAKER_43]: And although we did continue, we can hear Mr. Gallagher's question now.

937
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:42,099
[SPEAKER_35]: Did you have a second motion, Jackie, that we wanted to do?

938
01:31:42,619 --> 01:31:43,300
[SPEAKER_35]: Or does that come up?

939
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,783
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, I didn't catch when you continued it to Pat Gallagher is the applicant's attorney.

940
01:31:48,444 --> 01:31:53,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that our question is to the to the date, I believe.

941
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:55,489
[SPEAKER_13]: So if Pat Gallagher could be allowed to ask that question.

942
01:31:56,089 --> 01:31:56,770
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

943
01:31:58,251 --> 01:31:59,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

944
01:31:59,912 --> 01:32:04,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I was hoping to, I guess, have a moment to respond to some of the comments and questions.

945
01:32:05,317 --> 01:32:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: that were raised by the board, I understand that you have now voted on the motion.

946
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:32,595
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll defer to you on if you believe that's appropriate, but I think it would be helpful for the applicant if I could ask a couple of questions and just respond at a high level, and also to address Rocco's question of getting clarity on when the continuance has been voted for.

947
01:32:33,937 --> 01:32:42,882
[SPEAKER_43]: I think because we still have a public, we still have a quorum of the board and the public is still here and they're very aware of you being on the agenda this evening.

948
01:32:44,463 --> 01:32:51,948
[SPEAKER_43]: Director Hunt, correct me if I'm wrong, Attorney Gallant can still address those questions and we'll just do the motion to continue again.

949
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:56,711
[SPEAKER_43]: Absolutely, I think that he can address the questions.

950
01:32:57,711 --> 01:33:00,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you, Madam Chair and thank you, Director Hunt.

951
01:33:01,866 --> 01:33:21,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to first say we appreciate the board's time and the questions that have come up at tonight's meeting and are fully supportive of a continuance, although we would request a continuance to the next possible hearing date because we are eager to resolve

952
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:27,168
[SPEAKER_09]: and to move to a final vote on this application.

953
01:33:28,209 --> 01:33:34,215
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important to the project team and to this project to reach finality on that point.

954
01:33:35,837 --> 01:33:43,125
[SPEAKER_09]: My question for you, Madam Chair, and for the board is if there, and I know that Member Barron's raised a question,

955
01:33:43,897 --> 01:33:48,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Around wanting to see lifts and and things of that nature.

956
01:33:48,259 --> 01:33:53,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Addressed and we can certainly do so in between now and the next hearing.

957
01:33:54,482 --> 01:33:59,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Wanted to see if there are any other particular questions that the board would like us to address.

958
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:17,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I ask is because from what I've heard this evening and I think over the past several hearings, the concern and the predominant issue that we have talked a lot about is the height of the building.

959
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand the concerns, I really do.

960
01:34:24,802 --> 01:34:26,642
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to make sure that

961
01:34:29,713 --> 01:34:37,201
[SPEAKER_09]: we are proceeding in a way that respects what the zoning ordinance tells us and what the Dover Amendment tells us.

962
01:34:38,783 --> 01:34:45,930
[SPEAKER_09]: That this is unquestionably a dormitory, that this is below the maximum height that is allowed.

963
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:49,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even talking about a Dover use,

964
01:34:51,654 --> 01:35:13,010
[SPEAKER_09]: that we are below the maximum height limit and that I think this has been an extremely thorough site plan process where we've engaged and tried to work in good faith with the board and with the city in vetting the project and providing supplemental information and clarifications where those have been requested.

965
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:14,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I just do want to emphasize that

966
01:35:15,952 --> 01:35:44,546
[SPEAKER_09]: To the extent that the only outstanding issue is height, and it appears that the board has obtained legal counsel on that question, I want to emphasize that while we are more than happy to answer any questions that come up, and we'll continue to work with city staff on addressing any questions that they may have, we are eager to move this to a point where the board can vote on this project.

967
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:46,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

968
01:35:47,878 --> 01:35:49,079
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Attorney Gallagher.

969
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:58,767
[SPEAKER_43]: I think one of, for myself anyways, there's also the question of relief from, and what is a reasonable front setback?

970
01:35:59,147 --> 01:36:01,249
[SPEAKER_43]: What can we not allow in this case?

971
01:36:01,329 --> 01:36:11,276
[SPEAKER_43]: So there's a lot of things that are, you know, how do we analyze the reasonableness of your application as far as the minimum requirement for a setback in this particular case?

972
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:14,679
[SPEAKER_43]: That's one of the looming questions for us.

973
01:36:14,939 --> 01:36:21,485
[SPEAKER_43]: We just, I don't have that information and the city was not able to hone in on that information without a direct response from legal.

974
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:30,574
[SPEAKER_43]: So, I just, I don't know how to move the board forward on making a decision as a result as it involves.

975
01:36:32,927 --> 01:36:36,749
[SPEAKER_43]: what mitigation we can actually impose on this project.

976
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:43,373
[SPEAKER_43]: There's just so much conflicting information that I think we just need to legally make sure that we're in a better standing with that.

977
01:36:44,474 --> 01:36:50,837
[SPEAKER_43]: And to your question about the next date, I think I skipped a date and I apologize because of the holidays.

978
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:52,298
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm already in February.

979
01:36:52,378 --> 01:36:55,120
[SPEAKER_43]: It's January 15th, is the next date certain?

980
01:36:57,601 --> 01:37:00,583
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think I would need to do another vote

981
01:37:02,877 --> 01:37:07,139
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'll wait to see if there's any other questions or anything that you wanna add.

982
01:37:07,259 --> 01:37:09,440
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may just make one more note, Madam Chair.

983
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:31,710
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the items that we had provided just this morning and fully agree that that is outside of the time during which the board would be expected to review is a memorandum summarizing specific commitments that Tufts University and Capstone are willing to make in connection with this project.

984
01:37:33,533 --> 01:37:44,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would put that forward as the applicants suggested mitigation that we would agree to implement in connection with this project.

985
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:48,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you're reviewing, would ask if you could review it in that light.

986
01:37:49,181 --> 01:37:49,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

987
01:37:50,762 --> 01:37:52,163
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much attorney Gallagher.

988
01:37:52,183 --> 01:37:54,145
[SPEAKER_43]: And I, and I do, we'll take note of that.

989
01:37:54,205 --> 01:37:58,869
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, myself included, I don't believe that most of the board had time to digest that.

990
01:37:58,929 --> 01:38:03,934
[SPEAKER_43]: I've been on the road for most of the day, so I have not had a chance to read any additional materials.

991
01:38:04,154 --> 01:38:07,837
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, so again, that's one of the reasons why I was asking for the motion.

992
01:38:07,857 --> 01:38:08,638
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

993
01:38:11,985 --> 01:38:16,007
[SPEAKER_43]: And in saying that, the date would be January 15th at 6.30.

994
01:38:16,107 --> 01:38:20,290
[SPEAKER_43]: A motion to continue 401-Blasting Out for site plan review, Dover amendment?

995
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:21,651
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll make the motion.

996
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:23,552
[SPEAKER_43]: And a second?

997
01:38:24,472 --> 01:38:25,113
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll second.

998
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:27,554
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Vice Chair.

999
01:38:27,594 --> 01:38:28,174
[SPEAKER_43]: Emily Hederman?

1000
01:38:28,855 --> 01:38:28,975
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

1001
01:38:29,895 --> 01:38:30,576

[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

1003
01:38:32,677 --> 01:38:33,237
[SPEAKER_43]: Annie String?

[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

1005
01:38:35,559 --> 01:38:36,199
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrens?

1006
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:37,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1007
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:38,681
[SPEAKER_43]: Sabrina Alpino?

1008
01:38:39,321 --> 01:38:39,441
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

1009
01:38:40,301 --> 01:38:40,922
[SPEAKER_43]: Ben Levalli?

1010
01:38:42,892 --> 01:38:56,438
[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an I. And then we would need a motion to request legal counsel for guidance on mitigation for 401 Boston Avenue.

1011
01:38:59,059 --> 01:38:59,939
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll make the motion.

1012
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:02,720
[SPEAKER_43]: And a second.

1013
01:39:06,042 --> 01:39:07,242
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll second the motion.

1014
01:39:07,923 --> 01:39:08,663
[SPEAKER_29]: Amy can have it.

1015
01:39:11,158 --> 01:39:12,359
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

1016
01:39:12,939 --> 01:39:13,079
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

1017
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:15,340

[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

1019
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:17,742
[SPEAKER_43]: Annie String.

1020
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:18,702
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

[SPEAKER_43]: I've been aye.

1029
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:36,473
[SPEAKER_43]: Again, thank you so much, Mrs. Arrico, Mr. Gallagher.

1030
01:39:36,673 --> 01:39:38,314
[SPEAKER_43]: We will see you on January 15th.

1031
01:39:39,993 --> 01:39:42,094
[SPEAKER_09]: the board will see more of you.

1032
01:39:42,114 --> 01:39:42,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1033
01:39:42,914 --> 01:39:43,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy holidays.

1034
01:39:44,075 --> 01:39:50,238
[SPEAKER_43]: Happy holidays and thank you to all the residents and public and everyone else that has joined the meeting this evening.

1035
01:39:59,462 --> 01:40:06,465
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, while people are logging out, may I respectfully suggest a five minute break between the cases since we've been here almost two hours?

1036
01:40:09,158 --> 01:40:11,840
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, please, if we could take a five-minute break.

1037
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,341
[SPEAKER_43]: It is now 8.19.

1038
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:16,604
[SPEAKER_43]: We will re-adjourn at 8.25.

1039
01:40:17,184 --> 01:40:17,985
[SPEAKER_43]: Just to round it out.

1040
01:40:18,005 --> 01:40:21,207
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Chair.

1041
01:40:22,368 --> 01:40:23,129
[SPEAKER_43]: We are back.

1042
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:24,049
[SPEAKER_43]: I apologize.

1043
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:26,551
[SPEAKER_43]: I was here and didn't turn on my video.

1044
01:40:26,571 --> 01:40:31,495
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, so the second item on our

1045
01:40:32,957 --> 01:40:34,718
[SPEAKER_43]: agenda this evening is 21 St.

1046
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:38,201
[SPEAKER_43]: Clair Road site plan review for Dover amendment.

1047
01:40:38,902 --> 01:40:50,931
[SPEAKER_43]: I want to say that I was not able our Vice Chair, Hederman has led this case previously in my absence and I have since watched the video.

1048
01:40:51,992 --> 01:40:55,835
[SPEAKER_43]: So I wanted to make sure that you all knew that I'm totally caught up on the issue.

1049
01:40:56,376 --> 01:40:58,137
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you to Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

1050
01:41:00,062 --> 01:41:04,066
[SPEAKER_43]: And with that, I will let you know that this is a continued public hearing.

1051
01:41:06,689 --> 01:41:13,175
[SPEAKER_43]: To cure any potential public notice defect, the public hearing was re-advertised in the paper and a body of mail was re-sent.

1052
01:41:13,656 --> 01:41:15,117
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to read the new notice.

1053
01:41:16,559 --> 01:41:19,081
[SPEAKER_43]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing

1054
01:41:21,003 --> 01:41:24,325
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, December 18th, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.

1055
01:41:24,365 --> 01:41:36,150
[SPEAKER_43]: via Zoom, remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review for Dover Amendment uses City of Medford zoning ordinance section 94-11.8 submitted by a C.C.

1056
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:40,432
[SPEAKER_43]: Holden's LLC to renovate an existing four-story, 12,930 square foot building at 21 St.

1057
01:41:40,472 --> 01:41:41,053
[SPEAKER_43]: Clair Road, Medford Mass 02155.

1058
01:41:46,653 --> 01:41:55,638
[SPEAKER_43]: This is listed in the docket as parcel 1-11-21, associated with proposed 40-room domestic violence housing for women and children.

1059
01:41:57,620 --> 01:42:03,323
[SPEAKER_43]: I am going to ask the applicant or a representative of the applicant to please present any new information on this.

1060
01:42:05,224 --> 01:42:07,145
[SPEAKER_43]: And that is Mr. Michael Ross.

1061
01:42:07,506 --> 01:42:11,108
[SPEAKER_43]: If someone can please give Mr. Ross... Oh, there you go.

1062
01:42:11,872 --> 01:42:13,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here, Madam Chair, thank you.

1063
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:15,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Members of the board, my name is Mike Ross.

1064
01:42:15,694 --> 01:42:18,856
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm an attorney at the law firm of Prince Lobel.

1065
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:34,865
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here with my client, Andrew Litchfield, who's there, I see him, and Taisha Gashard, and then my colleague, Maggie Roberts, who works with me at Prince Lobel.

1066
01:42:35,605 --> 01:42:38,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be all right if I shared a presentation, Madam Chair?

1067
01:42:39,078 --> 01:42:39,658
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, please.

1068
01:42:39,698 --> 01:42:42,200
[SPEAKER_43]: If you could please give Mr. Ross sharing screen abilities.

1069
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:43,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it.

1070
01:42:43,641 --> 01:42:45,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you see that.

1071
01:42:47,543 --> 01:42:54,608
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, and we will make you a co host so that you can pass it on to your colleagues as necessary.

1072
01:42:54,628 --> 01:42:56,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, appreciate that.

1073
01:42:56,489 --> 01:42:56,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1074
01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:00,611
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as you mentioned, matches a continuation.

1075
01:43:00,651 --> 01:43:02,312
[SPEAKER_16]: We were here before the board on November 6.

1076
01:43:04,038 --> 01:43:10,741
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we have here, what I'm going to just kind of high level walk you through, even though I'm glad that you saw the video.

1077
01:43:10,761 --> 01:43:12,301
[SPEAKER_16]: So even though you weren't here, you saw the video.

1078
01:43:12,321 --> 01:43:12,902
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's terrific.

1079
01:43:13,722 --> 01:43:18,784
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to hit on the really the changes, the key changes from the last time we were here.

1080
01:43:18,804 --> 01:43:28,128
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there was a letter from the abutters, attorney for the abutters, almost criticizing that this plan has evolved or changed throughout the process.

1081
01:43:28,168 --> 01:43:32,810
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, my understanding of the community process and this process before the Community Development Board,

1082
01:43:33,918 --> 01:43:38,881
[SPEAKER_16]: is that the plan should change and that it should reflect the comments that are being made in these forums.

1083
01:43:39,641 --> 01:43:45,184
[SPEAKER_16]: And the comments are being made with yourself and elected officials and others who we've been meeting with throughout this process.

1084
01:43:46,164 --> 01:43:51,007
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in that spirit that these changes have evolved since our last meeting, November 6th.

1085
01:43:51,787 --> 01:43:53,588
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll walk you through what those changes are.

1086
01:43:55,588 --> 01:44:07,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Our project team is the same and the people are the same, but we did change the name of the entity that will be leasing this facility, Halo House.

1087
01:44:09,143 --> 01:44:20,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Hale House was formerly, was the former tenant who was to be using this facility, represented by Taisha Gishard.

1088
01:44:21,048 --> 01:44:28,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And Taisha also has a team that she works with and partners with, and I believe both Leslie and Ruth were at that last meeting in November.

1089
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:31,372
[SPEAKER_16]: But Taisha is sort of our quarterback and is

1090
01:44:33,272 --> 01:44:39,616
[SPEAKER_16]: is the head of the Halo House Inc., which is a nonprofit that's being established for this very purpose.

1091
01:44:40,716 --> 01:44:43,378
[SPEAKER_16]: And yes, this Halo House Inc.

1092
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:48,020
[SPEAKER_16]: is being created in anticipation of the property here at 21 St.

1093
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:48,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Clair Road.

1094
01:44:50,253 --> 01:44:54,095
[SPEAKER_16]: which will be owned by Andrew Litchfield and his partner, Steven Swedum.

1095
01:44:54,896 --> 01:45:01,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew Litchfield is manager of Assisi Holdings LLC, and he'll be the landlord of this facility.

1096
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:07,562
[SPEAKER_16]: And at some point, I'd love to have Andrew talk a little bit about why he decided to get into domestic violent housing.

1097
01:45:08,343 --> 01:45:15,667
[SPEAKER_16]: And given that he is someone who owns real estate holdings, but has a couple of properties now,

1098
01:45:16,507 --> 01:45:19,449
[SPEAKER_16]: in this space or proximate to this space.

1099
01:45:19,469 --> 01:45:24,012
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would be very helpful to just hear a little bit from Andrew too, why he's in there.

1100
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:31,677
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it would be helpful to hear from Taisha as well, because after all, Taisha will be running the programming that takes place in this facility.

1101
01:45:33,007 --> 01:45:45,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so this proposed, uh, our project proposal is, um, is similar, uh, but we wanted to sharpen our language and we wanted to include that this is a domestic violent shelter.

1102
01:45:45,374 --> 01:45:50,157
[SPEAKER_16]: And previously we used language, um, that was a homeless shelter for women and children.

1103
01:45:51,375 --> 01:45:59,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And while that's technically true, we didn't explicitly say that this was a domestic shelter, domestic violence shelter for women and children.

1104
01:45:59,841 --> 01:46:01,121
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is what this is.

1105
01:46:02,162 --> 01:46:10,067
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's interesting is that many of the clients who will be in this home actually have a home.

1106
01:46:10,407 --> 01:46:11,228
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not that they're

1107
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:18,274
[SPEAKER_16]: under house necessarily, it's that they can't be at their home, be for fear of violence within their home.

1108
01:46:18,855 --> 01:46:24,359
[SPEAKER_16]: And the whole point of this program is to educate these women to break that cycle of violence.

1109
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:34,127
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's done through, yes, routine curriculum that we've provided, and I'll walk you through in a second, but it's also done through something which goes to the heart of what is trying to be done here.

1110
01:46:34,148 --> 01:46:40,673
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is to break the cycle of violence through the intervention of the Halo House team as led by Taisha.

1111
01:46:43,512 --> 01:46:45,273
[SPEAKER_16]: The site is at 21 St Clair Road.

1112
01:46:46,074 --> 01:46:52,519
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a site that's been in the same configuration for almost 100 years.

1113
01:46:54,861 --> 01:46:57,723
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're not adding one square inch to the

1114
01:46:59,034 --> 01:47:11,187
[SPEAKER_16]: envelope of this building, unlike the previous proposal that was before you, we're taking the building that's existing and we're using within the confines of this existing building.

1115
01:47:11,668 --> 01:47:16,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the people who've used this building previously, we are taking the building as it is.

1116
01:47:17,514 --> 01:47:19,837
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we've inherited this building with

1117
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:27,713
[SPEAKER_16]: all the great things about it, but also all the challenges with that building, like the fact that there is no parking associated with this building.

1118
01:47:28,353 --> 01:47:29,173
[SPEAKER_16]: There never has been.

1119
01:47:30,154 --> 01:47:37,017
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're taking over in this facility, just like our predecessors did.

1120
01:47:40,178 --> 01:47:43,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Just pointing out here, the same configuration of this lot from 1924.

1121
01:47:45,364 --> 01:47:48,127
[SPEAKER_16]: I previously walked you through the existing conditions.

1122
01:47:48,968 --> 01:47:51,071
[SPEAKER_16]: We are keeping those existing conditions.

1123
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:58,419
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll remove some of the religious artifacts that are on the side of the building, but other than that,

1124
01:48:00,042 --> 01:48:27,215
[SPEAKER_16]: uh yeah we updated this site plan for you uh this site plan now shows the ramp along the side entrance of the building that provides access a second means of access to the building accessible access not just a second means of access but a second means of accessible access to the building will be that ramp along the side of the building and also um it shows the lift at the front of the building those are the only changes to the

1125
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:32,938
[SPEAKER_16]: The only key changes to the exterior, we're doing some landscaping and some other things that I'll walk you through in a moment.

1126
01:48:33,458 --> 01:48:39,181
[SPEAKER_16]: We updated our plans and our plans have bubbles where the updates are.

1127
01:48:39,741 --> 01:48:50,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the most key and important thing here is that we're reducing from 37 rooms and just for your recollection, we had 40 rooms as the chair mentioned.

1128
01:48:51,167 --> 01:48:53,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Three of those rooms were flex rooms.

1129
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:54,888
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll show you on the plans.

1130
01:48:55,388 --> 01:49:05,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Three of those rooms were rooms that could be used in a pinch if necessary for housing, but are on each of the floors that are meant to be used for additional administrative space.

1131
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:10,031
[SPEAKER_16]: So for that reason, we have 37 rooms plus these three additional flex rooms.

1132
01:49:10,451 --> 01:49:17,432
[SPEAKER_16]: What we are now proposing is reducing the room count further from some of the feedback we received.

1133
01:49:18,438 --> 01:49:28,080
[SPEAKER_16]: but also to make sure that we have ample space for non-living programming, for educational programming, and for space for children.

1134
01:49:29,001 --> 01:49:32,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Those, we're now at 34 rooms.

1135
01:49:35,422 --> 01:49:37,983
[SPEAKER_16]: And the way that changed, I'm gonna show you a before and after.

1136
01:49:38,003 --> 01:49:40,123
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is what we previously proposed.

1137
01:49:40,183 --> 01:49:42,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Floor is one through three, one, two, three.

1138
01:49:42,804 --> 01:49:46,165
[SPEAKER_16]: One is on the right, two is in the middle, three is on the left.

1139
01:49:49,182 --> 01:49:54,266
[SPEAKER_16]: What we did there, so on the first floor, stay on the right there.

1140
01:49:54,707 --> 01:50:02,773
[SPEAKER_16]: On the first floor, we moved rooms one and two to the middle of the first floor.

1141
01:50:02,793 --> 01:50:12,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And we did that because we want to keep accessible rooms on the first floor, rooms one and two that are accessible for handicap access.

1142
01:50:13,133 --> 01:50:15,234
[SPEAKER_16]: But we wanted to also increase the playroom.

1143
01:50:15,615 --> 01:50:17,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was no net increase or decrease.

1144
01:50:18,456 --> 01:50:19,237
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just what we did.

1145
01:50:19,517 --> 01:50:24,520
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in the middle, the second floor, we did reduce the rooms from 12 to 1.

1146
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,722
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we did there, 12 to 11.

1147
01:50:27,282 --> 01:50:38,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we did there is, if you look at the top portion of the second floor, the middle floor plan, you'll see that we took one of the rooms, room 8, and made it into a bath area instead.

1148
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:46,958
[SPEAKER_16]: And then if you look at the 3rd floor on the left, again, the before shows a room where roommate 9 are.

1149
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:51,663
[SPEAKER_16]: And now you have roommate being replaced with additional facilities.

1150
01:50:52,744 --> 01:50:57,329
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we looked at the 4th floor, which is the last floor on this in this building.

1151
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:01,011
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the before, and then there's the after.

1152
01:51:01,111 --> 01:51:08,395
[SPEAKER_16]: What we did again is we took room 33 and increased that bathroom facility size there.

1153
01:51:08,475 --> 01:51:09,495
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's more room there.

1154
01:51:10,416 --> 01:51:16,839
[SPEAKER_16]: And then those flex rooms I mentioned, they're on the corner, on the lower right corner of floors 4, 3, 2.

1155
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:18,080
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I went back to

1156
01:51:22,687 --> 01:51:26,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Floors 3, 2, not 1, but 2, 3, and 4.

1157
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:31,793
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all in the same location, room 13, room 25, and room 37.

1158
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:40,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Same elevations.

1159
01:51:40,478 --> 01:51:45,481
[SPEAKER_16]: We were moving a door on the first floor where there's now no need for that door to be.

1160
01:51:45,501 --> 01:51:47,903
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there was a kitchen there and I think now it's living space.

1161
01:51:48,263 --> 01:51:51,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew can confirm some of these things if he needs to.

1162
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:53,444
[SPEAKER_16]: And those are the plans.

1163
01:51:53,685 --> 01:51:57,166
[SPEAKER_16]: The landscape area, again, we heard and listened to some of the comments.

1164
01:51:58,007 --> 01:52:08,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And before that was just a general kind of seating area for residents, for clients, for guests in the rear of the building.

1165
01:52:09,433 --> 01:52:12,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we did here instead is we turned it into a play area.

1166
01:52:12,914 --> 01:52:15,496
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a small play area.

1167
01:52:15,856 --> 01:52:16,976
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not intended to be

1168
01:52:18,377 --> 01:52:20,458
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the consummate playground or anything like that.

1169
01:52:20,478 --> 01:52:30,740
[SPEAKER_16]: But it is intended to be a place where one could gather with their kids if they needed to and just have some real passive kind of play area, sandbox, a little rocker and that kind of thing.

1170
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:39,382
[SPEAKER_16]: And then throughout that landscape plan, as we showed you before, there's all sorts of landscaping along the front of the building, which none exists today.

1171
01:52:39,402 --> 01:52:46,624
[SPEAKER_16]: A tree, some more mature type of bushes and landscaping, and then some smaller bushes that hug the

1172
01:52:47,664 --> 01:52:48,184
[SPEAKER_16]: facility.

1173
01:52:48,225 --> 01:53:03,136
[SPEAKER_16]: We also I think made a small edit on the landscape area where there was a comment where I think the swing of a fence might have gone into the neighbor's property and we removed that issue that should never have been there in the first place so that we could fix that as well.

1174
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:24,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So getting into really the Dover piece here, pointing out those two-point tests that you referenced earlier, Madam Chair, I updated my letter, I updated my narrative substantially to include all the things I just mentioned to you, but also to talk a little bit more about

1175
01:53:25,653 --> 01:53:33,561
[SPEAKER_16]: The Dover amendment and, you know, what I would point out to you here, and even my brother who wrote a letter to your board.

1176
01:53:34,822 --> 01:53:45,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Acknowledge the same that the Dover amendment allows a building on our landlord, like Andrew and Stephen to lease a Dover compliant.

1177
01:53:47,414 --> 01:53:56,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Facility to a Dover qualified, a nonprofit entity that sold to its purposes education.

1178
01:53:57,418 --> 01:53:59,298
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is exactly what we're doing here.

1179
01:53:59,318 --> 01:54:08,061
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the fact that we're probably 6 months to a year from opening our facility that we are very much in the preliminary stages.

1180
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:19,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Of such a facility might be exactly why certain things like articles of incorporation and the lease itself and other.

1181
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:30,435
[SPEAKER_16]: other business documents of that type are still in the nascent stages.

1182
01:54:30,515 --> 01:54:35,618
[SPEAKER_16]: We are building something here that involves, you know, we haven't hired employees.

1183
01:54:35,638 --> 01:54:36,479
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of things.

1184
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:39,140
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't selected the general contractor.

1185
01:54:39,441 --> 01:54:47,366
[SPEAKER_16]: All those things that one does typically starts once you've been approved by the local community in which we are seeking the approval in front of your board.

1186
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:56,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Getting our building permit, making sure we've worked through the entire sets of questions from the building department, the fire department, the water department, et cetera, et cetera.

1187
01:54:56,790 --> 01:55:00,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are all the things that happen and occur when any project is front.

1188
01:55:00,792 --> 01:55:07,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, as a result, we're still building some of the key building blocks of this project.

1189
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:15,508
[SPEAKER_16]: We updated the Hale House's articles and corporations to be very specific to talk about the domestic violence.

1190
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:17,411
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did that, I think, for a couple reasons.

1191
01:55:17,551 --> 01:55:24,459
[SPEAKER_16]: One, we heard from the public and from the board and from elected officials that the use of domestic violence to be specific

1192
01:55:25,861 --> 01:55:32,087
[SPEAKER_16]: It needs to be there or should be there, and we agree, but it also protects this very use.

1193
01:55:32,667 --> 01:55:36,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a more specific use is better than a broad use.

1194
01:55:36,751 --> 01:55:38,553
[SPEAKER_16]: A broad use can mean a lot of different things.

1195
01:55:38,733 --> 01:55:42,577
[SPEAKER_16]: People might not know exactly what's happening in the facility here.

1196
01:55:43,117 --> 01:55:45,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Here, this use is domestic violence use.

1197
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:49,224
[SPEAKER_16]: We wanted to find another use, we would have to come back to this board to seek that use.

1198
01:55:50,345 --> 01:55:55,231
[SPEAKER_16]: In being specific, I think that's being reflective of some of the comments that we heard.

1199
01:55:55,411 --> 01:56:01,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Being general, I think it's what maybe earned a couple of the comments that we heard in the previous meetings.

1200
01:56:04,117 --> 01:56:11,359
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need to go too into case law, but I mean, I think I just pulled a couple of quotes.

1201
01:56:11,419 --> 01:56:12,500
[SPEAKER_16]: I think are very important.

1202
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:20,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I said earlier that what you should her team are trying to do is they're trying to break the very cycle of domestic violence for this woman and.

1203
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:28,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Generations after this woman, and what she's essentially trying to do is to help someone function in society.

1204
01:56:29,738 --> 01:56:34,122
[SPEAKER_16]: And the case law for the Dover Amendment says that right here,

1205
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:52,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Reason that in inculcating a basic understanding of how to cope with everyday problems, everyday problems, and to maintain oneself in society is incontestably an educational process.

1206
01:56:52,897 --> 01:56:53,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Doberman is very

1207
01:56:55,355 --> 01:57:04,658
[SPEAKER_16]: robust with case law of saying that the typical education setting is not what Doberman is limited to.

1208
01:57:04,678 --> 01:57:12,020
[SPEAKER_16]: It allows for that broader interpretation, even the broadness of this definition right here, using the Fitchburg housing case.

1209
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:14,240
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Fitchburg housing because I think it's relevant here.

1210
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,961
[SPEAKER_16]: There's another quote in Fitchburg that says,

1211
01:57:18,026 --> 01:57:29,689
[SPEAKER_16]: What they were doing at this Fishburg Housing Authority was training and skills for independent living, self-care, cooking, job-seeking, budgeting, making use of community resources.

1212
01:57:29,869 --> 01:57:35,151
[SPEAKER_16]: That is education, as according to our Supreme Court, as according to the Dover Amendment.

1213
01:57:35,291 --> 01:57:37,672
[SPEAKER_16]: That is Dover compliant.

1214
01:57:37,792 --> 01:57:38,972
[SPEAKER_16]: That is education.

1215
01:57:43,614 --> 01:57:47,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Earlier I said, just a couple slides ago, I said, we're still working this all out.

1216
01:57:47,597 --> 01:57:48,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's interesting.

1217
01:57:48,778 --> 01:58:00,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Regis College v. Town of Weston, a case that was quoted by the attorney who represents these abutters a couple of times in his brief, has a great quote in it.

1218
01:58:00,888 --> 01:58:07,453
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, the novelty of the Regis East project, that was the project that they were seeking for elderly living,

1219
01:58:08,705 --> 01:58:20,916
[SPEAKER_16]: requires that many of its details will necessarily be worked out by experienced educators through day-to-day operation, will necessarily be worked out, meaning that some of this still is a work in progress.

1220
01:58:21,156 --> 01:58:23,779
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's relevant to what we're doing here.

1221
01:58:26,121 --> 01:58:33,548
[SPEAKER_16]: The Halo House provided an updated curriculum, and I'm not going to go through all this, but I want to fast forward to their curriculum.

1222
01:58:35,283 --> 01:58:43,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to point out that it is a requirement for residents to attend and complete mandatory educational course programs and educational workshop.

1223
01:58:43,306 --> 01:58:44,286
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a requirement.

1224
01:58:44,647 --> 01:58:50,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone in the program must go through the curriculum, must go through some of the workshops.

1225
01:58:50,409 --> 01:58:51,789
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to show you in a 2nd here.

1226
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:58,892
[SPEAKER_16]: These are some of the other partners that her team have worked with and have partnered with.

1227
01:59:04,443 --> 01:59:06,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Talked about 24-hour security.

1228
01:59:12,632 --> 01:59:13,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's the curriculum.

1229
01:59:13,373 --> 01:59:17,398
[SPEAKER_16]: So we broke it into these tracks, 15 tracks, and broke it into hours.

1230
01:59:20,822 --> 01:59:31,127
[SPEAKER_16]: you wound up having 120 hours of these basic kind of, look at these courses, Introduction to Computers, Operating System Basics, File Management, Troubleshooting, Review and Practice, Internet Basics, Using Web Browsers.

1231
01:59:31,548 --> 01:59:39,572
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the types of courses that everyone's going to have to go through, writing a cover letter, mock interviews, all those things.

1232
01:59:40,552 --> 01:59:47,636
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think here it gets into what's really the phase two, but I would argue maybe is the real core and the real reason why

1233
01:59:50,029 --> 01:59:58,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Women are going to thrive at halo house and that's these workshops and these workshops are getting into the really the guts of.

1234
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:16,723
[SPEAKER_16]: how domestic violence can repeat itself, how behavior can continue to repeat itself, how there are these red flags to avoid abusive behavior, getting into therapy, getting into group settings, getting into really the meat of it.

1235
02:00:17,023 --> 02:00:22,084
[SPEAKER_16]: That's separate from those 15 other cohorts that I just showed you.

1236
02:00:22,124 --> 02:00:28,945
[SPEAKER_16]: This is after there's kind of a base established for the women

1237
02:00:29,783 --> 02:00:37,489
[SPEAKER_16]: around some of these more, I guess, educationally type services and job training.

1238
02:00:37,589 --> 02:00:41,392
[SPEAKER_16]: And this then gets into really the meat of it.

1239
02:00:41,452 --> 02:00:46,896
[SPEAKER_16]: I think some hard conversations, and those are also required and mandatory.

1240
02:00:47,397 --> 02:00:55,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's really where the Halo House is going to prepare women to reenter society, like that Fitchburg case referenced.

1241
02:00:59,653 --> 02:01:01,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we've talked about upstream parking.

1242
02:01:01,535 --> 02:01:02,256
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked about that.

1243
02:01:02,276 --> 02:01:04,419
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be a shuttle with making 3 trips.

1244
02:01:04,459 --> 02:01:10,626
[SPEAKER_16]: A day for staff and guests to go back and forth from.

1245
02:01:11,427 --> 02:01:16,213
[SPEAKER_16]: The, but also other locations, supermarkets, that's that type of thing.

1246
02:01:16,814 --> 02:01:18,916
[SPEAKER_16]: That is going to be a part of the.

1247
02:01:21,296 --> 02:01:38,376
[SPEAKER_16]: The program, but we also have identified 2 parking spaces, extremely close to this building that we believe we will be able to lease, which we're very happy about just having a couple extra parking spaces could make all the difference for.

1248
02:01:39,797 --> 02:01:42,458
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, just convenience, and it's something that we've been asked to do.

1249
02:01:42,918 --> 02:01:47,221
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have loved to appear here and showing you that lease in hand.

1250
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:50,882
[SPEAKER_16]: We're still, we're still working out the fine details.

1251
02:01:51,643 --> 02:01:56,705
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did, but I did were close enough that I did want to mention it to the board.

1252
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:05,736
[SPEAKER_16]: In any case, this is an accessible location, very accessible through Route 100 bus.

1253
02:02:06,236 --> 02:02:10,460
[SPEAKER_16]: We did a traffic study by the engineering firm Fuss & O'Neill.

1254
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I already shared this with the board.

1255
02:02:13,643 --> 02:02:21,690
[SPEAKER_16]: The Fuss & O'Neill engineers concluded that based on the foregoing assessment, it's the professional opinion of Fuss & O'Neill that the proposed development at 21 St.

1256
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:25,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Clair Road will have negligible impacts on traffic operations within the study area.

1257
02:02:26,727 --> 02:02:27,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

1258
02:02:27,588 --> 02:02:27,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1259
02:02:28,148 --> 02:02:34,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, first of all, the people who live, who will be living there temporarily at the facility will not have a car.

1260
02:02:35,795 --> 02:02:41,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And that the previous use was also filled with people who mostly didn't have cars.

1261
02:02:42,441 --> 02:02:47,725
[SPEAKER_16]: And while the staff may have cars, the staff are not allowed to bring their cars because they have nowhere to put their car.

1262
02:02:48,106 --> 02:02:52,269
[SPEAKER_16]: They would have to put it at the MBTA location and they would have to take a shuttle using that.

1263
02:02:53,030 --> 02:03:00,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Bus O'Neill concluded that this use, however, will not impact the number of car trips than what was previously there.

1264
02:03:01,715 --> 02:03:04,417
[SPEAKER_16]: And then finally, we had a number of comments directly from staff.

1265
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:07,219
[SPEAKER_16]: We sat and met with the mayor of Medford.

1266
02:03:07,239 --> 02:03:12,902
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been working through Danielle and Alicia and appreciate their time and assistance.

1267
02:03:13,603 --> 02:03:22,328
[SPEAKER_16]: And since our last meeting, we sat down or there was a conversation or sit down with Andrew and

1268
02:03:22,848 --> 02:03:23,689
[SPEAKER_16]: building commissioner.

1269
02:03:24,429 --> 02:03:28,393
[SPEAKER_16]: At some point there was a comment wondering why there's not an elevator in this building.

1270
02:03:28,433 --> 02:03:39,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I just inserted the MAS code 8.5.2 that explains why this building does not require to have an elevator because we fall just below the requirement there.

1271
02:03:39,962 --> 02:03:51,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we also provided to the board the letter of intent that is between the tenant, the proposed tenant, and the landlord.

1272
02:03:52,772 --> 02:03:58,217
[SPEAKER_16]: um, which will ultimately turn into a lease and we're prepared to provide that lease to the board.

1273
02:03:58,557 --> 02:04:07,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, you know, if the board, you know, there was a comment, really spent a lot of time in my brother's letter that talked about how it's not a lease.

1274
02:04:08,565 --> 02:04:14,931
[SPEAKER_16]: We're very happy to have you condition this approval based on having a lease in hand because there has to be a lease because we will have a lease.

1275
02:04:15,601 --> 02:04:28,745
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, I will say that it's outside staff comments, but it is officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that you should have been contacted by the Attorney General's office, who leaned into this on their own.

1276
02:04:29,825 --> 02:04:31,946
[SPEAKER_16]: And like they did in a case in Dennis,

1277
02:04:32,886 --> 02:04:44,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Massachusetts where there was a homeless shelter, not even a specific use such as domestic violence, but just a general homeless shelter where they weighed in for a very contentious process that occurred.

1278
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:49,853
[SPEAKER_16]: They weighed in here too and they asked you to look at the Dennis case and they asked you to

1279
02:04:51,774 --> 02:04:53,415
[SPEAKER_16]: to reach out to them with any questions.

1280
02:04:53,596 --> 02:05:09,187
[SPEAKER_16]: We were very happy to have the Attorney General reach out on this particular use, and we agree that this particular use, like the Dennis case, and like all the cases I just quoted to you, fits very comfortably within the Dover Amendment.

1281
02:05:09,767 --> 02:05:15,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And we look forward to having a real positive impact to the community.

1282
02:05:15,951 --> 02:05:24,217
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's all right, Madam Chair, I mean, or if I could do it later, I could pause here, but I think maybe it would be nice just to have a quick comment from Andrew and Taisha, if they have anything to add.

1283
02:05:24,297 --> 02:05:27,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, we can go straight to comments from the board.

1284
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:29,961
[SPEAKER_43]: No, please allow your team to continue.

1285
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:31,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

1286
02:05:31,022 --> 02:05:32,023
[SPEAKER_16]: They have nothing formal.

1287
02:05:32,123 --> 02:05:34,185
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they just a quick hello would be great.

1288
02:05:34,285 --> 02:05:35,707
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think they're prepared to answer.

1289
02:05:36,287 --> 02:05:41,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Question, so I don't know if Andrew if you could just even just introduce yourself.

1290
02:05:41,873 --> 02:05:42,954
[SPEAKER_16]: You have any comments, please.

1291
02:05:43,614 --> 02:05:44,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, go ahead.

1292
02:05:45,696 --> 02:05:46,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Michael.

1293
02:05:47,738 --> 02:05:47,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1294
02:05:47,999 --> 02:05:49,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam chair members of the board.

1295
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate the opportunity to.

1296
02:05:52,112 --> 02:05:53,932
[SPEAKER_00]: stand before you again tonight.

1297
02:05:54,052 --> 02:05:55,213
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Andrew Litchfield.

1298
02:05:55,873 --> 02:05:57,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the owner of the building.

1299
02:05:58,013 --> 02:05:59,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a real estate developer.

1300
02:05:59,954 --> 02:06:02,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was brought up in the previous meeting.

1301
02:06:02,975 --> 02:06:05,915
[SPEAKER_00]: A for-profit developer, why would he buy this building?

1302
02:06:07,356 --> 02:06:21,039
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to working with Taisha over many years and owning multiple buildings where we have nonprofits occupy our space, it's something near and dear to my heart.

1303
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:27,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only personally, but I am a huge proponent on giving back.

1304
02:06:28,204 --> 02:06:36,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a part of multiple nonprofit organizations, Silverlining Mentoring, a youth foster care nonprofit in Boston.

1305
02:06:37,491 --> 02:06:41,272
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as Roka, which is in Chelsea.

1306
02:06:42,052 --> 02:06:53,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to share that with you, that in addition to owning the real estate that I do, I do also own multiple buildings with nonprofits that are occupying them.

1307
02:06:53,575 --> 02:07:01,457
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I couldn't be more excited about providing for the residents and to be working with Taisha.

1308
02:07:03,037 --> 02:07:03,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1309
02:07:03,797 --> 02:07:04,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Andrew.

1310
02:07:04,698 --> 02:07:06,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Taisha, did you have anything you wanted to add at this point?

1311
02:07:10,418 --> 02:07:11,038
[SPEAKER_15]: She's on YouTube.

1312
02:07:11,299 --> 02:07:14,920
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think you were saying you're just going to answer any questions.

1313
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:15,301
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1314
02:07:16,381 --> 02:07:17,622
[SPEAKER_30]: OK, can you hear me?

1315
02:07:17,642 --> 02:07:18,883
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, I can.

1316
02:07:19,063 --> 02:07:20,323
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, my name is Taisha.

1317
02:07:20,343 --> 02:07:22,685
[SPEAKER_30]: I am the founder of the Halo House.

1318
02:07:22,705 --> 02:07:27,607
[SPEAKER_30]: And just briefly, this is a labor of love.

1319
02:07:29,728 --> 02:07:33,930
[SPEAKER_30]: I was brought up in a home of domestic violence.

1320
02:07:35,932 --> 02:07:38,313
[SPEAKER_30]: I have friends that came out of domestic violence.

1321
02:07:39,398 --> 02:07:42,680
[SPEAKER_30]: I know that we spoke a lot about the educational components.

1322
02:07:43,821 --> 02:08:02,972
[SPEAKER_30]: I can truly speak how the curriculum works, how it is very important to address the educational, the mandatory domestic violence prevention and workshops.

1323
02:08:03,833 --> 02:08:07,175
[SPEAKER_30]: If not, it is truly a cycle that will be repeated.

1324
02:08:08,432 --> 02:08:09,493
[SPEAKER_30]: for generations.

1325
02:08:11,393 --> 02:08:20,838
[SPEAKER_30]: And the things that you witness as a child, even as a victim of domestic violence, will stay with you forever.

1326
02:08:22,042 --> 02:08:27,007
[SPEAKER_30]: So the residents by this time, when they get to us, they are survivors.

1327
02:08:27,387 --> 02:08:45,685
[SPEAKER_30]: So I am there to support and guide and give them a second chance by holding their hand, being their friend, sharing my experiences and reintroducing them to a life that is free,

1328
02:08:46,665 --> 02:08:59,468
[SPEAKER_30]: of looking over your shoulder, having no control over your finances, walking on eggshells, kids hiding.

1329
02:08:59,488 --> 02:09:03,269
[SPEAKER_30]: This is why I believe in the halo house.

1330
02:09:03,289 --> 02:09:11,351
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm getting a little emotional because it really is.

1331
02:09:11,791 --> 02:09:14,312
[SPEAKER_30]: It's going to be a safe place.

1332
02:09:17,965 --> 02:09:20,307
[SPEAKER_30]: And I ask you to approve it.

1333
02:09:23,869 --> 02:09:25,490
[SPEAKER_30]: This truly is a labor of love.

1334
02:09:26,511 --> 02:09:30,073
[SPEAKER_30]: I will be there daily for hours.

1335
02:09:30,674 --> 02:09:31,574
[SPEAKER_30]: You will see me.

1336
02:09:31,994 --> 02:09:35,337
[SPEAKER_30]: You're welcome to come in and meet me, talk to me.

1337
02:09:35,357 --> 02:09:38,519
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to partner with you guys.

1338
02:09:38,539 --> 02:09:43,342
[SPEAKER_30]: And I believe this will be an asset.

1339
02:09:43,422 --> 02:09:45,043
[SPEAKER_30]: So I thank you for your time.

1340
02:09:47,213 --> 02:09:48,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Taisha.

1341
02:09:49,234 --> 02:09:50,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair, it's hard to follow that.

1342
02:09:50,855 --> 02:10:02,121
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's also hard not to hear that, and at the same time, being accused that what we're trying to do here is not what we're saying.

1343
02:10:02,721 --> 02:10:08,484
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great effort that we're all proud of, and we hope that the board will support this effort tonight.

1344
02:10:08,724 --> 02:10:09,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1345
02:10:09,044 --> 02:10:09,624
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll pause there.

1346
02:10:09,644 --> 02:10:12,226
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much.

1347
02:10:15,575 --> 02:10:18,057
[SPEAKER_43]: make sure that the screen sharing is down.

1348
02:10:18,297 --> 02:10:18,617
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

1349
02:10:20,458 --> 02:10:24,060
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you all for your presentation and for your updated information.

1350
02:10:25,821 --> 02:10:34,707
[SPEAKER_43]: Before I open it up to the public, I just wanted to make sure that I, we understand before the public starts to ask the question.

1351
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:39,530
[SPEAKER_43]: So the Hale House will be joining in the application of this, correct?

1352
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:42,591
[SPEAKER_43]: You will be a joint applicant?

1353
02:10:43,152 --> 02:10:43,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

1354
02:10:44,306 --> 02:10:46,888
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, I just wanted to make sure we cleared that.

1355
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:54,813
[SPEAKER_43]: Does the board have any questions or concerns before opening up to the public?

1356
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,920
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

1357
02:11:06,321 --> 02:11:07,222
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

1358
02:11:08,872 --> 02:11:13,416
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to thank the applicant for their vulnerability and sharing their story with us today.

1359
02:11:13,436 --> 02:11:16,798
[SPEAKER_35]: It takes a lot to do that in front of a group of strangers.

1360
02:11:16,858 --> 02:11:17,759
[SPEAKER_35]: I really appreciate that.

1361
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:23,343
[SPEAKER_35]: But then on to the practical matters of, you know, what we can actually decide on as a board.

1362
02:11:27,024 --> 02:11:40,830
[SPEAKER_35]: I feel like this this this fix this works, and I also want to come in the applicant for their detailed response to to community concerns beyond what this board has has control over.

1363
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:44,412
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, thinking specifically about, you know, the gate that swung in the wrong direction.

1364
02:11:45,412 --> 02:11:53,477
[SPEAKER_35]: I think that that starts to show the detail and care that the applicant has taken to respond to community comments.

1365
02:11:54,438 --> 02:11:58,240
[SPEAKER_35]: Interested in hearing new community comments tonight about new information that's been presented.

1366
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,682
[SPEAKER_35]: But overall, I thank the applicant for their work thus far.

1367
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:04,824
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1368
02:12:07,065 --> 02:12:08,266
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Vice Chair.

1369
02:12:08,886 --> 02:12:10,627
[SPEAKER_43]: I just, again, Ms.

1370
02:12:10,647 --> 02:12:22,633
[SPEAKER_43]: Couchat, I was going to say it later, but the fact that you gave a very real scene and that your support in helping this initiative move forward, to me, that's big, right?

1371
02:12:22,773 --> 02:12:34,620
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, we have to be practical about what we can do and not just based on stories, but your story is really useful here because it actually shows what an end result can come about.

1372
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:45,851
[SPEAKER_43]: So in saying that, I want to open it up to the public so that we can see if there's any other questions that the public has at this point, any new questions at this point.

1373
02:12:46,532 --> 02:12:48,875
[SPEAKER_43]: And then we'll bring it back for board deliberation.

1374
02:12:51,973 --> 02:12:53,934
[SPEAKER_43]: I will now open up the public comment period.

1375
02:12:53,994 --> 02:13:00,316
[SPEAKER_43]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you are having technical difficulties.

1376
02:13:00,796 --> 02:13:04,698
[SPEAKER_43]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

1377
02:13:04,838 --> 02:13:08,399
[SPEAKER_43]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1378
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:15,002
[SPEAKER_43]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff.

1379
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:20,762
[SPEAKER_43]: board members, or myself, as it is not part of the public record.

1380
02:13:21,342 --> 02:13:27,284
[SPEAKER_43]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message staff for assistance.

1381
02:13:27,724 --> 02:13:30,065
[SPEAKER_43]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak.

1382
02:13:33,966 --> 02:13:37,747
[SPEAKER_43]: And Alicia or Danielle, can you please?

1383
02:13:40,348 --> 02:13:43,589
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, I'll manage the public comment queue.

1384
02:13:44,511 --> 02:13:57,278
[SPEAKER_43]: I know that there was many comments that came in, so I know that you're probably not able to read them all out, but if you wanted to just give a high level of issues and themes that you've read also.

1385
02:13:58,178 --> 02:14:01,360
[SPEAKER_39]: Can we take the, do you mind if we take the verbal comments?

1386
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:01,820
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure, no.

1387
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,401
[SPEAKER_39]: That's fine.

1388
02:14:05,222 --> 02:14:06,043
[SPEAKER_39]: Great, thank you.

1389
02:14:07,343 --> 02:14:10,425
[SPEAKER_39]: So the first speaker is Harley Racer.

1390
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,241
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, Miss Hunt.

1391
02:14:14,281 --> 02:14:15,201
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1392
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:16,622
[SPEAKER_48]: I appreciate the time.

1393
02:14:16,642 --> 02:14:19,964
[SPEAKER_48]: My name is Harley Racer, attorney at Richmay, the downtown Boston law firm.

1394
02:14:20,464 --> 02:14:26,988
[SPEAKER_48]: I represent some residents, a different group of residents than when I was here a moment ago, including a Butters.

1395
02:14:27,588 --> 02:14:32,972
[SPEAKER_48]: And, you know, we we do not denigrate this the effort here or or

1396
02:14:33,992 --> 02:14:35,393
[SPEAKER_48]: deny that there is a need for it.

1397
02:14:35,753 --> 02:14:46,399
[SPEAKER_48]: But the question before this board is very narrow, and it is whether this is a qualifying Dover Amendment applicant and a qualifying Dover Amendment use.

1398
02:14:47,319 --> 02:14:58,125
[SPEAKER_48]: If the board were to allow this as a Dover Amendment use, it would be an unprecedented expansion of the Dover Amendment, both as to the entity and to the use.

1399
02:14:58,965 --> 02:15:01,707
[SPEAKER_48]: The entity here is a for-profit developer.

1400
02:15:02,407 --> 02:15:17,958
[SPEAKER_48]: And this is I've seen no case law and I haven't seen the applicant site anywhere a for profit corporation can apply for and obtain the benefits of the Dover Amendment protections as a business venture.

1401
02:15:18,478 --> 02:15:22,321
[SPEAKER_48]: And they're here asking the board to join them in this effort of.

1402
02:15:23,501 --> 02:15:27,983
[SPEAKER_48]: helping them facilitate their business effort through the Dover Amendment.

1403
02:15:28,003 --> 02:15:32,946
[SPEAKER_48]: And that's just not what the intent of the Dover Amendment is, and that's not the purpose of the Dover Amendment.

1404
02:15:33,846 --> 02:15:39,469
[SPEAKER_48]: And it does not cure it to say that one day maybe they'll have a lease or that they have a letter of intent.

1405
02:15:40,310 --> 02:15:46,393
[SPEAKER_48]: And I think this is a real flaw here that would be susceptible to reversal on appeal.

1406
02:15:48,013 --> 02:15:59,200
[SPEAKER_48]: Now, even if the Halo House were the applicant, which they're not, and I'm not sure that they could be a joint applicant, they haven't entered a lease.

1407
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:11,847
[SPEAKER_48]: But even if they were, what we've seen is that the educational uses here are really window dressing, and it's what the SJC has cautioned against, allowing the tail wag the dog, essentially.

1408
02:16:12,747 --> 02:16:21,594
[SPEAKER_48]: This is the primary use is to provide the emergency shelter, and they've added some discussion of educational uses.

1409
02:16:21,614 --> 02:16:30,120
[SPEAKER_48]: They've added a curriculum, but if you look at it, the curriculum amounts to, you know, two to four hours a week over the course of a six month to one year stay.

1410
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:33,783
[SPEAKER_48]: This really falls short of what other

1411
02:16:34,543 --> 02:16:46,715
[SPEAKER_48]: cases of what has been found to be an actual, a significant educational goal, and it's certainly not a primary or dominant use that is being proposed here.

1412
02:16:47,095 --> 02:16:57,706
[SPEAKER_48]: I would like to see a lot more on the curriculum, a lot more detail, the types of detail that are in the case law that finds that, you know, not traditional educational uses still qualify for Dover.

1413
02:16:58,006 --> 02:16:58,947
[SPEAKER_48]: We just don't see that here.

1414
02:16:59,107 --> 02:17:02,312
[SPEAKER_48]: We don't know what the hours of the classes are.

1415
02:17:02,372 --> 02:17:03,654
[SPEAKER_48]: We don't know what the classes are.

1416
02:17:03,694 --> 02:17:08,421
[SPEAKER_48]: We don't know whether they say it's mandatory, but we don't know what is mandatory.

1417
02:17:08,461 --> 02:17:12,988
[SPEAKER_48]: We don't know whether the participants would be required to do each of the 12 tracks.

1418
02:17:13,028 --> 02:17:14,510
[SPEAKER_48]: There's just a real lack of detail here.

1419
02:17:15,411 --> 02:17:32,038
[SPEAKER_48]: So I would urge the board to deny the Dover Amendment application because this is brought by a for-profit entity for a business development purpose and because the educational use is not significant and it's not primary or dominant.

1420
02:17:32,758 --> 02:17:33,099
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

1421
02:17:37,741 --> 02:17:38,261
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1422
02:17:38,501 --> 02:17:40,982
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Cheryl R.

1423
02:17:43,265 --> 02:17:47,311
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, so I'm pretty close to this location.

1424
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:50,716
[SPEAKER_41]: I was on the last meeting and this plan is the same.

1425
02:17:51,416 --> 02:17:52,578
[SPEAKER_41]: This is still a shelter.

1426
02:17:53,059 --> 02:17:54,761
[SPEAKER_41]: It's not an educational institute.

1427
02:17:55,863 --> 02:17:58,586
[SPEAKER_41]: They were supposed to come back with a proposal that

1428
02:17:59,633 --> 02:18:06,079
[SPEAKER_41]: right sizes this project and does not attempt to exploit the area by trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole.

1429
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:09,181
[SPEAKER_41]: This project does not qualify for the Dover Amendment.

1430
02:18:09,662 --> 02:18:12,184
[SPEAKER_41]: This building formerly housed less than 10 nuns.

1431
02:18:12,524 --> 02:18:16,388
[SPEAKER_41]: It is not large enough to house 34 or 37 families.

1432
02:18:16,948 --> 02:18:23,074
[SPEAKER_41]: It is also insulting that you're assuming that grown women need quote classes on how to use the internet.

1433
02:18:23,754 --> 02:18:28,976
[SPEAKER_41]: This is very insulting to victims of domestic violence to speak of them in such an infantized way.

1434
02:18:29,656 --> 02:18:39,439
[SPEAKER_41]: In one case, you say they aren't homeless and they have housing, but your quote, educational track teaches them how to get housing and how to run a household.

1435
02:18:40,019 --> 02:18:41,840
[SPEAKER_41]: These are things they would already know.

1436
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:46,843
[SPEAKER_41]: Your quote, education component is just an attempt to circumvent zoning.

1437
02:18:47,223 --> 02:18:47,843
[SPEAKER_41]: Nothing more.

1438
02:18:48,184 --> 02:18:49,344
[SPEAKER_41]: You do not qualify.

1439
02:18:49,704 --> 02:18:51,145
[SPEAKER_41]: Do not take advantage of us.

1440
02:18:51,586 --> 02:19:01,011
[SPEAKER_41]: This sounds like since you have spoken to the state attorney general, that you are working with the governor and her desire to remove homeless people from costly motels and hotels.

1441
02:19:01,332 --> 02:19:06,775
[SPEAKER_41]: But we ask you not to take advantage of us and overfill this very small area.

1442
02:19:07,295 --> 02:19:07,656
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1443
02:19:08,909 --> 02:19:13,511
[SPEAKER_43]: One of the things I want to make sure that we're clear with this controversial, untrue statements going forward.

1444
02:19:13,771 --> 02:19:18,072
[SPEAKER_43]: And so the letter from the AG is quoted by a case law from the SJC.

1445
02:19:18,933 --> 02:19:27,495
[SPEAKER_43]: And I want to make sure that, and I'm going to quote, a Dover determination cannot be based on the population that may be served by a non-traditional education program.

1446
02:19:28,116 --> 02:19:34,518
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's from the Supreme Judicial Court, which has warned explicitly that the type of student who is participating in the program

1447
02:19:35,278 --> 02:19:41,699
[SPEAKER_43]: And then you can continue to read it based on the law, McLean Hospital Corporation versus Town of Lincoln.

1448
02:19:42,139 --> 02:19:48,961
[SPEAKER_43]: So I wanted to make sure that we're clear on what we're putting before the public here, as far as knowledge.

1449
02:19:50,441 --> 02:19:51,361
[SPEAKER_43]: Next comment, please.

1450
02:19:52,901 --> 02:19:55,262
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Mike O'Brien.

1451
02:19:55,282 --> 02:20:00,623
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, hello.

1452
02:20:02,859 --> 02:20:04,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Three, I guess, two quick questions.

1453
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:23,668
[SPEAKER_22]: One, is it possible to, I guess, public record or what direction might you point in for the other developments or buildings or, I guess, efforts prior to this for Andrew Litchfield and his holding companies?

1454
02:20:25,568 --> 02:20:31,371
[SPEAKER_22]: And then lastly, I guess, second question is, the updated PowerPoint presentation,

1455
02:20:32,797 --> 02:20:43,559
[SPEAKER_22]: I know I was uploaded to this, I guess, Medford Google Drive earlier this month, but I know many members of the public probably seeing it for the first time tonight.

1456
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:52,901
[SPEAKER_22]: Will we have the opportunity to kind of go through it and raise objections before a vote here at the end of this meeting?

1457
02:20:52,921 --> 02:20:55,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1458
02:20:57,348 --> 02:20:59,309
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sorry, what is it that you wanted to go through?

1459
02:20:59,329 --> 02:21:05,831
[SPEAKER_22]: The updated PowerPoint presentation and materials presented by the applicant.

1460
02:21:08,272 --> 02:21:11,894
[SPEAKER_43]: Has the city provided updated information to the public?

1461
02:21:12,854 --> 02:21:13,535
[SPEAKER_43]: I believe so.

1462
02:21:14,935 --> 02:21:19,377
[SPEAKER_22]: The updated PowerPoint, I know many of us are seeing it for the first time this evening.

1463
02:21:20,025 --> 02:21:28,007
[SPEAKER_39]: The material sent to the board on Friday, those materials don't usually include the PowerPoint that they share tonight.

1464
02:21:28,067 --> 02:21:33,129
[SPEAKER_39]: We usually request that during the meeting so that we can add that to the files.

1465
02:21:33,849 --> 02:21:34,369
[SPEAKER_22]: Gotcha.

1466
02:21:34,389 --> 02:21:42,972
[SPEAKER_22]: So will we as the public have an opportunity to consider these materials before a vote at the end of this meeting or no?

1467
02:21:46,384 --> 02:21:49,768
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll just, we usually don't answer the questions as a back and forth.

1468
02:21:49,908 --> 02:21:57,337
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll let you know that whether or not the board votes tonight is a decision that will be up to the board this evening.

1469
02:21:57,777 --> 02:21:58,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, understood.

1470
02:21:58,418 --> 02:21:58,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1471
02:22:01,482 --> 02:22:03,905
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Will Navare.

1472
02:22:06,311 --> 02:22:07,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, hi there.

1473
02:22:07,532 --> 02:22:09,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, thank you for recognizing me.

1474
02:22:10,094 --> 02:22:11,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I support this project.

1475
02:22:11,795 --> 02:22:20,282
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody thinks it's a loophole when it comes to applying Dover to a homeless shelter, albeit with an educational component, I guess that's fair enough.

1476
02:22:20,322 --> 02:22:21,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's a loophole.

1477
02:22:22,003 --> 02:22:28,026
[SPEAKER_08]: But the abutters and their attorney are trying to use the law to deny what they refer to as an emergency shelter.

1478
02:22:28,606 --> 02:22:32,107
[SPEAKER_08]: That's disgusting and not consistent with Medford's values.

1479
02:22:32,948 --> 02:22:39,331
[SPEAKER_08]: The abutters and their attorney have a right to cause problems and hurt people by trying to slow this worthy project down.

1480
02:22:40,271 --> 02:22:51,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like our Attorney General, whom I deeply respect, has weighed in on behalf of the shelter from a legal perspective, and the abutters' intervention will ultimately be unsuccessful, except as a tactic to delay.

1481
02:22:52,080 --> 02:23:02,207
[SPEAKER_08]: They have every right to try to put a wrench in the works and slow this project down as much as they want, but this board does not have any obligation to play along and assist them in that endeavor.

1482
02:23:02,748 --> 02:23:09,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope that the board approves this, uh, you know, relatively quickly.

1483
02:23:09,393 --> 02:23:09,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1484
02:23:13,115 --> 02:23:16,399
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker this evening is Abida Banu.

1485
02:23:20,282 --> 02:23:23,225
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Abida Banu.

1486
02:23:25,687 --> 02:23:30,652
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like this whole thing, I feel like it's a discrimination against me.

1487
02:23:31,753 --> 02:23:36,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you know, by the name and my background, English is my second language.

1488
02:23:38,362 --> 02:23:44,403
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also, I'm a widow, and been a resident since 2006.

1489
02:23:45,644 --> 02:23:48,824
[SPEAKER_12]: I never ever anybody talk about this project.

1490
02:23:48,904 --> 02:23:49,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I was shocked.

1491
02:23:50,565 --> 02:23:56,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm direct butter, you know, and my privacy will invade.

1492
02:23:57,206 --> 02:24:02,487
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the visual, if you put the picture of the 21 St.

1493
02:24:02,527 --> 02:24:06,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Clair, there's the three houses, you know, next to each other.

1494
02:24:07,496 --> 02:24:14,280
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that it will invade my privacy and the parking will be big, big, big, big issue.

1495
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:16,821
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's no parking.

1496
02:24:17,341 --> 02:24:29,528
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you can look at the fire lane and there's a fire lane and no sidewalk, you know, please have this meeting in person so you can come and see it.

1497
02:24:30,658 --> 02:24:31,258
[SPEAKER_12]: other people.

1498
02:24:31,799 --> 02:24:35,921
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you decide that what you're going to say, I think I'm against this.

1499
02:24:36,562 --> 02:24:43,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there's 37 people who look over my house is like my privacy issue.

1500
02:24:43,866 --> 02:24:45,587
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for listening.

1501
02:24:45,647 --> 02:24:45,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1502
02:24:47,388 --> 02:24:49,729
[SPEAKER_39]: Please your name, your address for the record.

1503
02:24:49,809 --> 02:24:51,691
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think we have an 11 St.

1504
02:24:51,731 --> 02:24:52,191
[SPEAKER_39]: Clair Road.

1505
02:24:52,684 --> 02:24:53,084
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1506
02:24:53,484 --> 02:24:56,765
[SPEAKER_39]: I think we forgot to get that from some of the previous speakers.

1507
02:24:56,845 --> 02:25:00,826
[SPEAKER_39]: If you want to just message them to me directly, they're for the record.

1508
02:25:02,826 --> 02:25:05,627
[SPEAKER_39]: All speakers are requested to provide name and address for the record.

1509
02:25:05,687 --> 02:25:10,088
[SPEAKER_39]: If at any point you don't want to provide that publicly, you can provide it to us for the record.

1510
02:25:11,188 --> 02:25:13,768
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Leo Lafarge.

1511
02:25:18,624 --> 02:25:19,645
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, everyone.

1512
02:25:21,046 --> 02:25:22,807
[SPEAKER_42]: I am Anna Butter as well.

1513
02:25:23,707 --> 02:25:26,889
[SPEAKER_42]: And I have a couple of questions about the project.

1514
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:34,114
[SPEAKER_42]: I, again, also saw the new amendments or whatever, the updates on the site tonight.

1515
02:25:34,254 --> 02:25:36,215
[SPEAKER_42]: We had no idea that things had gone out again.

1516
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:41,999
[SPEAKER_42]: But I did have a couple of questions about what Abida said.

1517
02:25:48,997 --> 02:25:53,981
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, her property is directly next to St.

1518
02:25:54,001 --> 02:26:05,550
[SPEAKER_42]: Clair, and they have talked about, and I'm sure you have hopefully fixed it by now, about how when people have to exit during emergencies, they had it said that it was going to go out on her property.

1519
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:08,031
[SPEAKER_42]: And you said that you have fixed that allegedly.

1520
02:26:08,192 --> 02:26:09,733
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it all right to ask questions about this?

1521
02:26:12,852 --> 02:26:13,893
[SPEAKER_43]: You can continue.

1522
02:26:13,953 --> 02:26:19,316
[SPEAKER_43]: We're going to collectively answer them at the end of the public comment, but you can definitely get your questions out now.

1523
02:26:19,876 --> 02:26:21,417
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, great.

1524
02:26:21,597 --> 02:26:25,159
[SPEAKER_42]: I also had a couple of questions about the programming itself.

1525
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:37,166
[SPEAKER_42]: So it had gone from before you were going to do CDL licenses and solar panels, and then it looks like you've tried to update those to more educational programs.

1526
02:26:37,927 --> 02:26:39,748
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, like it is a little bit

1527
02:26:43,147 --> 02:26:47,730
[SPEAKER_42]: offensive, I think, to say that they are teaching women how to use the Internet as well.

1528
02:26:48,350 --> 02:27:06,200
[SPEAKER_42]: And if this facility is supposed to be used for six to 12 months, it doesn't really seem that it's going to be an educational because it looks like it's only about, I don't know how many hours, but it can't be that many hours to be educational throughout the whole six to 12 months.

1529
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:08,841
[SPEAKER_42]: It's basically looks like it's going to be

1530
02:27:10,382 --> 02:27:11,143
[SPEAKER_42]: at just a shelter.

1531
02:27:11,564 --> 02:27:12,905
[SPEAKER_42]: And also, I had another thing.

1532
02:27:14,427 --> 02:27:26,179
[SPEAKER_42]: There is something in Boston called ABCD Boston, which I know is really the only thing that I have been able to find online that looks like it's trying to be similar to what's being offered.

1533
02:27:26,659 --> 02:27:29,382
[SPEAKER_42]: And I was wondering if they're going to offer the same things like

1534
02:27:30,123 --> 02:27:42,469
[SPEAKER_42]: they talked about, you know, elder care or, you know, kindness to the elders or financial stability is one and also health equity for women, if these are also going to be programs that are going to be talked about.

1535
02:27:42,489 --> 02:27:48,932
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1536
02:27:50,192 --> 02:27:51,613
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Ren.

1537
02:27:56,186 --> 02:27:56,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hi.

1538
02:27:57,967 --> 02:28:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to speak in support of this.

1539
02:28:00,528 --> 02:28:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the board approves it.

1540
02:28:01,808 --> 02:28:05,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 37 Woodrow Avenue, about half a mile from the location.

1541
02:28:06,310 --> 02:28:08,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this would be an excellent use for the building.

1542
02:28:10,171 --> 02:28:16,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I noted in their application materials that they intend to give preference to Medford residents.

1543
02:28:16,794 --> 02:28:24,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for a city of 60,000 people to not have a domestic violence shelter, to my knowledge, within city limits,

1544
02:28:25,545 --> 02:28:26,306
[SPEAKER_06]: is really a tragedy.

1545
02:28:26,746 --> 02:28:34,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the Medford PD has a link to the portal for hope, which offers one to three days of emergency shelter for survivors of domestic violence.

1546
02:28:34,972 --> 02:28:38,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And Medford is just really not meeting a very dire need here.

1547
02:28:38,635 --> 02:28:41,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And this project seems like it

1548
02:28:42,298 --> 02:28:46,823
[SPEAKER_06]: would really provide an essential service to the city of Medford.

1549
02:28:47,684 --> 02:28:58,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree with the applicant that based on my experience, you know, working with this population in past roles that I would not expect there to be a significant traffic impact.

1550
02:29:01,058 --> 02:29:12,066
[SPEAKER_06]: and their intention to provide shuttle transportation for groceries and MBTA and even for their staff to park off site seems like, you know, thoughtful.

1551
02:29:12,646 --> 02:29:17,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't think this population is going to be troublesome to the neighborhood.

1552
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:23,153
[SPEAKER_06]: In the previous hearing, I heard some what I consider bad faith arguments about

1553
02:29:24,553 --> 02:29:26,014
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, adding children to the schools.

1554
02:29:26,174 --> 02:29:31,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I just like to rebut that by saying they're giving preference to Medford residents.

1555
02:29:31,418 --> 02:29:33,059
[SPEAKER_06]: These children are already in the schools.

1556
02:29:33,579 --> 02:29:36,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would welcome these folks into my neighborhood.

1557
02:29:37,181 --> 02:29:41,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this this project should be approved.

1558
02:29:41,044 --> 02:29:47,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the technicalities of the Dover amendment aside, I don't think they should need that to have this project approved.

1559
02:29:47,068 --> 02:29:48,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a great use for the building.

1560
02:29:49,049 --> 02:29:50,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to have it on my streets.

1561
02:29:51,791 --> 02:29:53,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's for this project.

1562
02:29:53,172 --> 02:29:53,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1563
02:29:56,704 --> 02:29:57,165
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1564
02:29:57,405 --> 02:30:00,150
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is labeled as WE.

1565
02:30:00,250 --> 02:30:03,015
[SPEAKER_39]: Please give your name and address for the record.

1566
02:30:03,035 --> 02:30:08,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey there.

1567
02:30:08,284 --> 02:30:09,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me OK?

1568
02:30:10,322 --> 02:30:10,782
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, we can.

1569
02:30:10,802 --> 02:30:13,404
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, you know, rush on one Sinclair.

1570
02:30:14,104 --> 02:30:17,006
[SPEAKER_10]: So, believe in sharing members of the board, thanks for the opportunity.

1571
02:30:17,046 --> 02:30:20,748
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I do think I just want to echo some of the previous sentiments.

1572
02:30:20,848 --> 02:30:24,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a continuance is needed for a variety of reasons.

1573
02:30:24,590 --> 02:30:29,192
[SPEAKER_10]: 1, the originally that was shown by attorney Ross on screen.

1574
02:30:29,212 --> 02:30:30,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think has been provided to.

1575
02:30:31,033 --> 02:30:32,314
[SPEAKER_10]: anyone in advance of the meeting.

1576
02:30:32,594 --> 02:30:51,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, I know there's been a quote-unquote updated plan that's been uploaded, but upon pretty thorough review as far as the education piece is concerned, there's barely been any traction or really updates on that PPT as far as what's being provided from an education perspective.

1577
02:30:52,071 --> 02:30:56,695
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing there that says clear commitment of required hours, structured schedules, measurable outcomes.

1578
02:30:57,235 --> 02:30:59,135
[SPEAKER_10]: et cetera, not even a concrete timeline.

1579
02:31:00,176 --> 02:31:04,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Just pretty much it says that those in the halo house can provide and participate in those classes.

1580
02:31:05,577 --> 02:31:13,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Another one I just want to make sure is just this facility's primary and dominant mission is to provide residential housing first and foremost.

1581
02:31:13,379 --> 02:31:18,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Mr. or Attorney Racer said earlier, just it's unseen that

1582
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:27,953
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a for profit entity, attempting to profit off of a domestic violence shelter while simultaneously trying to use a loophole of a Dover amendment.

1583
02:31:28,814 --> 02:31:34,422
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, so I do, I do urge the board to listen to its residents and see through this.

1584
02:31:35,083 --> 02:31:39,408
[SPEAKER_10]: pretty clear attempt to circumvent the city's zoning laws via the Dover Amendment.

1585
02:31:39,849 --> 02:31:55,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I think even with the additional information provided here there's still a lot more questions and answers and Attorney Ross said himself there's still a lot of building blocks and things to figure out with the plan and hearing the the Tufts proposal earlier that got a continuance there's about

1586
02:31:55,747 --> 02:32:09,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I think 100 miles between how far along that plan is and this one is this one still feels like it's barely been thought through so I can't help but to see this is pretty obvious effort by private real estate and owner for 21 St.

1587
02:32:09,207 --> 02:32:09,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Clair to

1588
02:32:10,689 --> 02:32:29,078
[SPEAKER_10]: recoup on investment after the last owner who coincidentally was also represented by attorney Ross trying to stand up luxury condos and failed at doing that because he could not get private parking spaces which I know is a obviously sore subject as well for this particular project.

1589
02:32:29,118 --> 02:32:35,081
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just would suggest a continuance to allow us to digest some more information and get more info about the plan.

1590
02:32:35,341 --> 02:32:35,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1591
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:40,465
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Barry Ingber.

1592
02:32:44,192 --> 02:32:44,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1593
02:32:44,792 --> 02:32:48,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Barry Ingbern, 9 Draper Street in North Medford.

1594
02:32:48,273 --> 02:32:52,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a direct abutter, but I am very certainly in the neighborhood.

1595
02:32:53,034 --> 02:33:02,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to echo what Wren and William said and express my complete support for this project.

1596
02:33:03,856 --> 02:33:13,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to say, listening to the neighbors means not just listening to the neighbors who are opposed, that we clearly are mixed on this.

1597
02:33:15,459 --> 02:33:21,683
[SPEAKER_04]: This type of shelter, this type of situation is sorely needed.

1598
02:33:22,604 --> 02:33:28,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't even imagine a better kind of building for it than this one.

1599
02:33:29,648 --> 02:33:32,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a perfectly fine neighborhood for it.

1600
02:33:32,590 --> 02:33:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who are opposed to this project, I want you to look inside and ask, since the project is not going to itself change the neighborhood,

1601
02:33:43,972 --> 02:33:46,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you opposed to the building?

1602
02:33:47,435 --> 02:33:49,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you opposed to the people?

1603
02:33:50,277 --> 02:33:54,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you are opposed to the people, you have some soul searching to do.

1604
02:33:55,221 --> 02:33:57,963
[SPEAKER_04]: These are victims of domestic violence.

1605
02:33:58,303 --> 02:34:00,805
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not perpetrators of violence.

1606
02:34:01,506 --> 02:34:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: These are victims.

1607
02:34:02,547 --> 02:34:03,628
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our neighbors.

1608
02:34:03,908 --> 02:34:05,129
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our community.

1609
02:34:05,589 --> 02:34:08,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need a place to be safe.

1610
02:34:09,252 --> 02:34:11,153
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be in our neighborhood.

1611
02:34:11,354 --> 02:34:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1612
02:34:15,266 --> 02:34:15,747
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1613
02:34:16,008 --> 02:34:17,390
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is JR.

1614
02:34:23,119 --> 02:34:24,420
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, my name is Kathleen.

1615
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:29,966
[SPEAKER_20]: I live on Fulton Street, probably close to being a direct abutter.

1616
02:34:31,288 --> 02:34:35,372
[SPEAKER_20]: Just want to echo a few things that were said.

1617
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:43,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I think first and foremost, obviously, there are concerns about the applicant being in commercial real estate.

1618
02:34:44,301 --> 02:34:45,442
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that

1619
02:34:47,115 --> 02:34:59,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Having Halo House join as a co-applicant is interesting, but I think residents, myself included, would feel more comfortable if they were the sole applicant.

1620
02:35:01,015 --> 02:35:01,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Additionally, just to

1621
02:35:02,717 --> 02:35:04,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Few follow-up questions.

1622
02:35:04,359 --> 02:35:15,268
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I appreciate that the applicant has provided updated information, seemingly in good faith, but regarding the parking, I know a lot of people bring it up.

1623
02:35:15,368 --> 02:35:19,952
[SPEAKER_20]: It's definitely contentious around here because there is none.

1624
02:35:20,973 --> 02:35:27,258
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that folks said that employees would not be able to bring their own vehicles.

1625
02:35:27,778 --> 02:35:28,939
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not clear to me

1626
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:32,221
[SPEAKER_20]: how that would be enforced.

1627
02:35:32,762 --> 02:35:51,172
[SPEAKER_20]: It also looks like the traffic survey that was completed is assuming that the residents would not have their own vehicles, but I'm not sure what underpins that assumption since we're clearly saying that these folks are not unhoused.

1628
02:35:51,212 --> 02:35:54,614
[SPEAKER_20]: They just unfortunately do not have a safe place to live.

1629
02:35:55,054 --> 02:35:58,676
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm not sure how that means that they would not have

1630
02:35:59,336 --> 02:35:59,876
[SPEAKER_20]: a vehicle.

1631
02:35:59,896 --> 02:36:20,110
[SPEAKER_20]: And then finally just echoing again some of the concerns about the for-profit entity and we're being asked to change the zoning with pretty limited

1632
02:36:20,589 --> 02:36:21,209
[SPEAKER_20]: information.

1633
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:26,853
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the applicant has admitted that they're in the early stages of this project.

1634
02:36:26,973 --> 02:36:34,838
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that residents should be forced to make a decision without all of the t's crossed and i's dotted.

1635
02:36:35,239 --> 02:36:35,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1636
02:36:39,241 --> 02:36:41,603
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Marge.

1637
02:36:43,244 --> 02:36:44,965
[SPEAKER_39]: Oops, sorry, I'm having trouble clicking.

1638
02:36:45,025 --> 02:36:45,405
[SPEAKER_39]: There we go.

1639
02:36:48,127 --> 02:36:48,207
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh,

1640
02:36:50,337 --> 02:36:52,558
[SPEAKER_39]: My apologies if I got the speakers out of order.

1641
02:37:03,243 --> 02:37:04,043
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you hear me?

1642
02:37:04,984 --> 02:37:05,664
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, we can.

1643
02:37:06,084 --> 02:37:07,025
[SPEAKER_27]: OK, thank you.

1644
02:37:08,032 --> 02:37:09,873
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Marge Kirchmeier.

1645
02:37:09,993 --> 02:37:12,514
[SPEAKER_27]: I live here at 25 St.

1646
02:37:12,554 --> 02:37:13,374
[SPEAKER_27]: Francis Street.

1647
02:37:13,394 --> 02:37:15,035
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a direct abutter.

1648
02:37:16,035 --> 02:37:26,459
[SPEAKER_27]: And I have to say, I kind of resent people trying to shame the neighborhood into accepting that the shelter, that's just not fair.

1649
02:37:27,279 --> 02:37:33,461
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, because a project of this kind is going to affect the whole neighborhood.

1650
02:37:34,201 --> 02:37:40,463
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think we all deserve, you know, you know, to know what's going on.

1651
02:37:40,483 --> 02:37:47,646
[SPEAKER_27]: The first thing, the first time I heard about the project was about a week or so before the election.

1652
02:37:48,380 --> 02:37:56,485
[SPEAKER_27]: But apparently, the building was sold in March.

1653
02:37:57,225 --> 02:38:00,747
[SPEAKER_27]: So the whole process has been going on since March.

1654
02:38:01,228 --> 02:38:04,730
[SPEAKER_27]: So my question is, why hasn't the neighborhood

1655
02:38:06,146 --> 02:38:24,448
[SPEAKER_27]: been invited in because this is a very, I can't think of the right word to describe it, but nobody has anything against any person who is in a terrible situation, as some of these people are.

1656
02:38:25,369 --> 02:38:32,152
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, but we deserve the benefit of the doubt, we deserve to be invited in, in the process.

1657
02:38:33,273 --> 02:38:45,379
[SPEAKER_27]: And I really think that a continuance would be the best thing at this point to further go over, you know, what the ideas are, and so forth.

1658
02:38:46,179 --> 02:38:47,480
[SPEAKER_27]: So that is my comment.

1659
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:48,060
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1660
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:52,290
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1661
02:38:52,531 --> 02:38:55,433
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is JMN.

1662
02:38:59,015 --> 02:39:00,196
[SPEAKER_40]: How are we doing this time?

1663
02:39:01,257 --> 02:39:01,938
[SPEAKER_32]: We can hear you.

1664
02:39:02,358 --> 02:39:02,838
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, great.

1665
02:39:02,958 --> 02:39:03,419
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll be quick.

1666
02:39:03,639 --> 02:39:04,039
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1667
02:39:04,399 --> 02:39:05,900
[SPEAKER_40]: Jean Izzo, Parris Street, Medford.

1668
02:39:06,521 --> 02:39:07,622
[SPEAKER_40]: This is in my neighborhood.

1669
02:39:08,262 --> 02:39:08,803
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll be quick.

1670
02:39:09,343 --> 02:39:13,986
[SPEAKER_40]: A thoughtful approach to this application review is not stalling.

1671
02:39:14,667 --> 02:39:19,691
[SPEAKER_40]: It assures that we are acting purposefully and we are acting thoughtfully.

1672
02:39:20,713 --> 02:39:23,015
[SPEAKER_40]: and it avoids repentance at leisure.

1673
02:39:23,796 --> 02:39:38,388
[SPEAKER_40]: Historically in Medford, when we take things at face value swiftly, we are left in a position often where we are then having our enforcement team who are understaffed trying to go out and deal with issues.

1674
02:39:38,888 --> 02:39:45,814
[SPEAKER_40]: So please let us not mistake a thorough review of the applicant and its business proposition for

1675
02:39:47,075 --> 02:39:49,476
[SPEAKER_40]: putting individuals under a microscope.

1676
02:39:49,756 --> 02:39:51,617
[SPEAKER_40]: That is not what is happening here.

1677
02:39:51,877 --> 02:39:52,597
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you very much.

1678
02:39:55,038 --> 02:39:55,498
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1679
02:39:55,859 --> 02:39:58,260
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Jen Proctor.

1680
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:01,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, I'm Jen Proctor.

1681
02:40:01,581 --> 02:40:02,661
[SPEAKER_21]: I live at 36 St.

1682
02:40:02,701 --> 02:40:03,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Francis Street.

1683
02:40:03,482 --> 02:40:11,885
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just like to echo some things that some of my neighbors have already said and mentioned and

1684
02:40:12,727 --> 02:40:15,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it was great to see the traffic report this time.

1685
02:40:16,248 --> 02:40:33,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, one thing that it doesn't take into consideration is that, uh, people may be ordering things, guests, visitors, um, and things like that, like Uber Eats, Ubers, um, where would that would increase traffic in the area as well?

1686
02:40:33,511 --> 02:40:37,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, that would be considerable with a 34 to 37, uh, family unit as well.

1687
02:40:42,302 --> 02:40:47,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, so that's one thing to, to just take into consideration around the traffic.

1688
02:40:48,125 --> 02:41:03,872
[SPEAKER_21]: And while there's some additional information this time regarding the education, there still isn't, um, like a definitive number of hours that set for what is mandatory, um, that I'd just like to see more detail on that.

1689
02:41:10,885 --> 02:41:11,306
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1690
02:41:11,686 --> 02:41:14,550
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Lisa Simonetti.

1691
02:41:19,335 --> 02:41:20,516
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, good evening, everybody.

1692
02:41:20,596 --> 02:41:23,237
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much for recognizing me.

1693
02:41:25,238 --> 02:41:31,462
[SPEAKER_32]: In full disclosure, I will say that after the last meeting, I did send a letter and I received some responses from Ms.

1694
02:41:31,502 --> 02:41:34,404
[SPEAKER_32]: Roberts, which I appreciate.

1695
02:41:34,444 --> 02:41:35,284
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

1696
02:41:35,984 --> 02:41:39,907
[SPEAKER_32]: I still have a lot of questions about the funding of this domestic violence shelter.

1697
02:41:42,503 --> 02:41:45,305
[SPEAKER_32]: This is not, to my understanding, based on Ms.

1698
02:41:45,365 --> 02:41:50,248
[SPEAKER_32]: Roberts' letter, this is not a state contract.

1699
02:41:50,729 --> 02:42:05,719
[SPEAKER_32]: This is something that is going to be a process of securing both public and private funding, including state and federal grants, individual donations, sponsorships, fundraising, and cooperative agreements.

1700
02:42:06,459 --> 02:42:12,662
[SPEAKER_32]: That seems very unstable funding for 36, 35 to 37 people.

1701
02:42:13,262 --> 02:42:15,223
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'd like to know if there's any update to that.

1702
02:42:15,783 --> 02:42:28,088
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just wanna make a comment to the people who have really been a little bullying tonight about how we in the Fulton Heights area, or by the way, I'm at 85 Fulton Spring Road.

1703
02:42:30,289 --> 02:42:31,730
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to accept this.

1704
02:42:32,370 --> 02:42:33,431
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, we do.

1705
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:35,263
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, we do.

1706
02:42:35,283 --> 02:42:38,435
[SPEAKER_32]: A domestic violence shelter is incredibly important.

1707
02:42:39,637 --> 02:42:50,700
[SPEAKER_32]: But unfortunately, the city of Medford has turned Fulton Heights into a rooming house and boarding house facility in the middle of residential neighborhoods.

1708
02:42:51,380 --> 02:43:07,165
[SPEAKER_32]: And for those of you who don't live right here, parking and traffic is horrific, and there is no way, and everybody on this call knows this, there is no way you're gonna stop employees from driving to work, like on an,

1709
02:43:08,005 --> 02:43:10,087
[SPEAKER_32]: tonight, for instance, when it's pouring rain.

1710
02:43:11,568 --> 02:43:13,749
[SPEAKER_32]: So please don't sell people's intelligence.

1711
02:43:14,089 --> 02:43:20,794
[SPEAKER_32]: And more importantly, please do not bully people by saying we have to look inward.

1712
02:43:22,055 --> 02:43:26,779
[SPEAKER_32]: I will challenge you and what I do and looking inward any day of the week.

1713
02:43:27,879 --> 02:43:31,042
[SPEAKER_32]: So good evening, and I wish everybody a very happy holiday season.

1714
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:39,802
[SPEAKER_39]: The next speaker is Patricia Schiappelli.

1715
02:43:56,691 --> 02:44:00,574
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, I'm at 53 Garfield Avenue in Medford.

1716
02:44:01,375 --> 02:44:12,165
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just want to say that, you know, if you do your research on the owners of the building, and some of the president of the yellow house, you will find some questionable dealings listed.

1717
02:44:13,319 --> 02:44:20,245
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that as the Community Development Board and the city, you owe it to us residents to do your due diligence.

1718
02:44:21,166 --> 02:44:27,132
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we're tired of being told what we're going to live with when we're the taxpayers and homeowners in this area.

1719
02:44:27,712 --> 02:44:28,833
[SPEAKER_33]: We have voting rights.

1720
02:44:29,154 --> 02:44:32,297
[SPEAKER_33]: We have the ability to live in an environment that we wish.

1721
02:44:33,422 --> 02:44:46,947
[SPEAKER_33]: And as someone that grew up in a home with domestic violence, to say that you're gonna take someone that is a domestic violent person and leave them in the same city where their abuser is, is absolutely crazy.

1722
02:44:46,987 --> 02:44:49,428
[SPEAKER_33]: That means you know nothing about the industry at all.

1723
02:44:49,908 --> 02:44:56,891
[SPEAKER_33]: And if that is the case, then they will be sought after because the abusers do not walk away without coming after what they want.

1724
02:44:57,791 --> 02:45:11,879
[SPEAKER_33]: So I suggest you rethink and you reconsider before you approve this, because this is not the place to have the violence in this neighborhood with the taxpayers and the homeowners trying to raise their own children.

1725
02:45:12,559 --> 02:45:13,260
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you so much.

1726
02:45:22,247 --> 02:45:25,008
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, I don't see anybody else with their hand raised.

1727
02:45:25,708 --> 02:45:27,509
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm double checking.

1728
02:45:27,609 --> 02:45:34,151
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe that everybody who sent a letter has also spoken.

1729
02:45:34,171 --> 02:45:42,194
[SPEAKER_39]: I did note that there were a couple of very specific questions around

1730
02:45:43,499 --> 02:45:50,442
[SPEAKER_39]: what would be the maximum capacity of the shelter, not the number of beds, but the capacity.

1731
02:45:51,662 --> 02:46:01,706
[SPEAKER_39]: There were some concerns about the trash and deliveries and the volume and how that would be handled and whether the traffic assessment included buses for students.

1732
02:46:03,406 --> 02:46:09,849
[SPEAKER_39]: And then in general, the comments were like what you have already heard this evening about traffic and parking and Dover amendment uses.

1733
02:46:11,418 --> 02:46:13,420
[SPEAKER_39]: There's one more hand that just raised their hand.

1734
02:46:15,041 --> 02:46:17,723
[SPEAKER_39]: You don't mind, I'll go to the iPad KR.

1735
02:46:25,570 --> 02:46:27,572
[SPEAKER_50]: Hi, this is Kelly Rasso, 35 St.

1736
02:46:27,612 --> 02:46:28,893
[SPEAKER_50]: Francis Street.

1737
02:46:31,715 --> 02:46:38,441
[SPEAKER_50]: I am a director, but I would like the record to note that I was still not notified of the meeting tonight.

1738
02:46:39,355 --> 02:46:46,458
[SPEAKER_50]: I've been to City Hall several times to inquire about the abutters list, et cetera.

1739
02:46:46,658 --> 02:46:49,520
[SPEAKER_50]: It's really become an issue.

1740
02:46:51,421 --> 02:46:58,064
[SPEAKER_50]: But I wanted to address, and I wanted to make sure I properly identified the residents of this building.

1741
02:46:58,084 --> 02:47:06,808
[SPEAKER_50]: Can the applicant clarify what is the proper nomenclature for the people staying at the facility?

1742
02:47:07,803 --> 02:47:12,746
[SPEAKER_50]: Where does the funding come from from each guest, as said by the attorney?

1743
02:47:13,706 --> 02:47:18,269
[SPEAKER_50]: The applicant states the facility is specifically geared towards women and children.

1744
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:23,912
[SPEAKER_50]: What is the capacity the building was the maximum capacity?

1745
02:47:24,492 --> 02:47:27,134
[SPEAKER_50]: What is the age limit for children at the facility?

1746
02:47:27,854 --> 02:47:29,415
[SPEAKER_50]: Specifically male children.

1747
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:33,321
[SPEAKER_50]: How will the facility define women?

1748
02:47:33,781 --> 02:47:39,983
[SPEAKER_50]: Will transgender and biological men and who identify as women be welcome into this facility?

1749
02:47:41,063 --> 02:47:53,687
[SPEAKER_50]: As the facility is specifically geared towards biological women, will the facility have any educational or women's health services available through service providers like Planned Parenthood?

1750
02:47:55,442 --> 02:47:58,964
[SPEAKER_50]: Will the facility allow for sex offenders to reside at the facility?

1751
02:47:59,484 --> 02:48:05,267
[SPEAKER_50]: How will the facility notify the neighbors and the community if a sex offender obtains residence in the building?

1752
02:48:05,287 --> 02:48:16,152
[SPEAKER_50]: Has anyone looked into the sex offender registry and how close there are registered sex offenders to this building currently?

1753
02:48:17,413 --> 02:48:24,096
[SPEAKER_50]: Are there children required to attend any educational programs specifically provided by the Halo House?

1754
02:48:26,653 --> 02:48:37,898
[SPEAKER_50]: Speaking of the ramp that is going to be added, it's four feet, six inches where they propose to put the ramp.

1755
02:48:37,959 --> 02:48:42,841
[SPEAKER_50]: What's the width and the slope of the ramp to the side of the building?

1756
02:48:44,339 --> 02:48:51,283
[SPEAKER_50]: Does this facility have any intention of meeting 521 CMR 5.00 standards, specifically those necessary for public use?

1757
02:48:59,682 --> 02:49:03,883
[SPEAKER_50]: This facility meets the Commonwealth's definitions of transient lodging.

1758
02:49:04,283 --> 02:49:08,304
[SPEAKER_50]: At a minimum, it should be designed to meet those building standards.

1759
02:49:09,085 --> 02:49:12,505
[SPEAKER_50]: This application is an abuse of the Dover Amendment.

1760
02:49:13,226 --> 02:49:28,530
[SPEAKER_50]: This board should have the courage to oust this charlatan or the city of Medford will become a target for more of these types of developments by profiteers abusing laws to protect society's most vulnerable.

1761
02:49:29,765 --> 02:49:37,671
[SPEAKER_43]: I urge you to deny this application if the applicant... This is a ridiculous process.

1762
02:49:40,413 --> 02:49:42,374
[SPEAKER_43]: Is there any other commenters?

1763
02:49:49,499 --> 02:49:54,903
[SPEAKER_43]: And just for the public to know, we allowed the last speaker to go 30 seconds over time.

1764
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:06,285
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, there's one more hand up, Linda McKay, Mackie.

1765
02:50:06,985 --> 02:50:07,586
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1766
02:50:09,348 --> 02:50:16,094
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, I was hoping that I could yield my time back to Kelly, the person that was speaking before, if that's possible.

1767
02:50:23,300 --> 02:50:25,763
[SPEAKER_43]: If it's a new comment, a new comment, yes.

1768
02:50:27,835 --> 02:50:28,636
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, she wasn't done.

1769
02:50:28,696 --> 02:50:31,637
[SPEAKER_42]: So if that's possible, I would love for her to be able to speak.

1770
02:50:33,979 --> 02:50:35,239
[SPEAKER_43]: Two minutes per person.

1771
02:50:35,360 --> 02:50:36,880
[SPEAKER_43]: If you want to speak for her, yes.

1772
02:50:40,122 --> 02:50:49,688
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, I wasn't sure what she was going to finish saying, but you may you may continue her comment if you like, but to be fair, I don't know what she was going to say.

1773
02:50:49,768 --> 02:50:56,712
[SPEAKER_42]: But she is a director butter and I feel that she would should be able to speak as long as she wants.

1774
02:50:58,152 --> 02:50:59,953
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's not the rules of the board tonight.

1775
02:51:00,073 --> 02:51:06,256
[SPEAKER_43]: So I apologize if you're not able to follow that because we would have to allow everyone else that same accommodation.

1776
02:51:07,777 --> 02:51:08,638
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, thank you.

1777
02:51:09,158 --> 02:51:10,539
[SPEAKER_42]: And I do have one thing.

1778
02:51:10,899 --> 02:51:18,223
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm hoping that the board treats the residents surrounding 21 St.

1779
02:51:18,303 --> 02:51:22,605
[SPEAKER_42]: Clair the same as they're treating the residents around the Tufts proposal.

1780
02:51:23,185 --> 02:51:25,427
[SPEAKER_42]: I have totally felt a difference

1781
02:51:26,327 --> 02:51:32,709
[SPEAKER_42]: in the way that you all are speaking to us, as opposed to the people that live in the Tufts area.

1782
02:51:33,089 --> 02:51:44,372
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think it's because this isn't surrounding the idea of a domestic violence shelter and that we should all be gung ho about this in our neighborhood.

1783
02:51:44,972 --> 02:51:45,372
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1784
02:51:46,412 --> 02:51:46,852
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1785
02:51:51,313 --> 02:51:53,274
[SPEAKER_39]: The next hand is Ella Razo.

1786
02:51:56,346 --> 02:51:57,547
[SPEAKER_53]: Hello, Rosso, 35 St.

1787
02:51:57,587 --> 02:51:58,687
[SPEAKER_53]: Francis Street.

1788
02:52:00,648 --> 02:52:02,569
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm going based off of what Kelly said.

1789
02:52:03,249 --> 02:52:07,792
[SPEAKER_53]: I'd like to finish kind of what she was trying to get at.

1790
02:52:09,313 --> 02:52:16,796
[SPEAKER_53]: I have no doubt the court will review this record and come to the same conclusions the residents of this neighborhood have, which is fraud.

1791
02:52:19,137 --> 02:52:20,278
[SPEAKER_53]: I wish the applicant well.

1792
02:52:20,478 --> 02:52:30,182
[SPEAKER_53]: I hope they are successful in future ventures, but I suggest they are more thoughtful with their approach and develop facilities within their own neighborhoods.

1793
02:52:32,503 --> 02:52:40,067
[SPEAKER_53]: The size of the facilities to protect the occupants and emergency personnel, staff and neighbors safely should be the goal.

1794
02:52:44,770 --> 02:52:49,512
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, there's one person who messaged me that they were having trouble raising their hand.

1795
02:52:49,992 --> 02:52:52,033
[SPEAKER_39]: If you don't mind, I'm gonna call on.

1796
02:52:52,934 --> 02:52:53,274
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure.

1797
02:52:53,474 --> 02:53:00,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Your A. Yes, hello, thank you.

1798
02:53:01,057 --> 02:53:02,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Arthur Martin, Fulton Street.

1799
02:53:03,599 --> 02:53:06,340
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard Attorney Ross mention, you can hear me okay?

1800
02:53:07,233 --> 02:53:07,413
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1801
02:53:07,894 --> 02:53:08,094
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1802
02:53:08,894 --> 02:53:16,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard Attorney Ross mentioned earlier they were named guests when he gave his presentation.

1803
02:53:17,341 --> 02:53:18,643
[SPEAKER_17]: We've heard them called residents.

1804
02:53:19,203 --> 02:53:20,464
[SPEAKER_17]: We've heard them called guests.

1805
02:53:21,085 --> 02:53:26,209
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate that he's being open and honest that they are guests.

1806
02:53:26,289 --> 02:53:27,130
[SPEAKER_17]: They are residents.

1807
02:53:27,790 --> 02:53:29,892
[SPEAKER_17]: They've never once been called students.

1808
02:53:31,493 --> 02:53:33,054
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the major difference here.

1809
02:53:34,163 --> 02:53:36,866
[SPEAKER_17]: They have never been called students.

1810
02:53:38,868 --> 02:53:41,650
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a reason, because they're residents.

1811
02:53:42,071 --> 02:53:43,952
[SPEAKER_17]: This is transient lodging.

1812
02:53:45,614 --> 02:53:46,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1813
02:53:47,176 --> 02:53:56,705
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate everybody's volunteer time on this, but this is not the ownership that should be representing this facility.

1814
02:53:58,418 --> 02:53:59,838
[SPEAKER_17]: As we point to Ms.

1815
02:54:00,038 --> 02:54:04,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Guichard, she has some history that's found in the court system.

1816
02:54:05,620 --> 02:54:08,821
[SPEAKER_17]: As in 2022, fraud.

1817
02:54:10,521 --> 02:54:11,601
[SPEAKER_39]: This is inappropriate.

1818
02:54:11,941 --> 02:54:13,442
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not inappropriate.

1819
02:54:13,982 --> 02:54:15,362
[SPEAKER_43]: No unfounded accusations.

1820
02:54:15,642 --> 02:54:17,323
[SPEAKER_43]: The public does not have access.

1821
02:54:17,363 --> 02:54:19,883
[SPEAKER_43]: The board does not have access to the same information that you had.

1822
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:27,205
[SPEAKER_43]: We will not be hearing anything that has been brought in outside of the proponent other than your personal experience with the project.

1823
02:54:28,055 --> 02:54:30,917
[SPEAKER_43]: Your personal experience with the project and not the project proponents.

1824
02:54:39,082 --> 02:54:42,305
[SPEAKER_43]: Would you like to continue with your personal experience with the project?

1825
02:54:45,907 --> 02:54:47,868
[SPEAKER_39]: I'll have to ask him to unmute so he can respond.

1826
02:54:55,574 --> 02:54:55,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1827
02:54:56,014 --> 02:54:56,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

1828
02:54:57,235 --> 02:54:57,495
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

1829
02:54:58,786 --> 02:55:00,468
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I don't want to step out of the bounds.

1830
02:55:01,229 --> 02:55:14,160
[SPEAKER_17]: It was my understanding that we heard from her story and we're supposed to rely on the applicant for their personal know-how to run the facility and operate it correctly, and we're supposed to trust them with it.

1831
02:55:14,700 --> 02:55:19,464
[SPEAKER_17]: I assumed that their personal history is up for grabs for discussion at that point.

1832
02:55:19,825 --> 02:55:21,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize if I stepped out of line with it.

1833
02:55:23,888 --> 02:55:24,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that acceptable?

1834
02:55:26,406 --> 02:55:30,928
[SPEAKER_17]: But should we not be reviewing stuff of this nature as we present?

1835
02:55:30,988 --> 02:55:33,149
[SPEAKER_43]: It's out of the board's purview.

1836
02:55:33,169 --> 02:55:44,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but we assume certain things about people who are operating certain facilities.

1837
02:55:44,700 --> 02:55:45,220
[SPEAKER_43]: No, sir.

1838
02:55:45,441 --> 02:55:46,781
[SPEAKER_43]: And that would be discriminatory.

1839
02:55:47,082 --> 02:55:57,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that you're bringing that's not part of the project is not discriminatory would be if I if I worried about ethnicities, colors, ages, things of that nature.

1840
02:55:58,089 --> 02:56:05,214
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're talking about somebody's personal record with a criminal history of fraud, I think that's a different thing.

1841
02:56:05,254 --> 02:56:06,014
[SPEAKER_17]: That's important.

1842
02:56:06,715 --> 02:56:09,617
[SPEAKER_43]: It may be important before another board, but not this board.

1843
02:56:09,957 --> 02:56:10,978
[SPEAKER_43]: It's out of our purview.

1844
02:56:12,682 --> 02:56:17,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Your so, but your purview is to worry about who's operating these facilities, correct?

1845
02:56:17,626 --> 02:56:24,591
[SPEAKER_43]: We're relying on our, our, our, our purview is to follow the lay of the law, the ordinance for the city.

1846
02:56:24,911 --> 02:56:26,392
[SPEAKER_43]: I just wanted to make sure that that's clear.

1847
02:56:26,832 --> 02:56:33,137
[SPEAKER_43]: And before the board this evening is to vote according to how we were counseled with legal.

1848
02:56:33,577 --> 02:56:37,420
[SPEAKER_43]: Is this a Dover amendment and what we can do within that confinement?

1849
02:56:42,018 --> 02:56:51,285
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, Vice Chair Hedeman has raised her hand and there's one resident or one member of the public who has not spoken, who's raised their hand.

1850
02:56:51,305 --> 02:56:56,369
[SPEAKER_43]: At this time, I want to make sure we continue with public comments going forward and then we'll circle back to the board.

1851
02:56:56,389 --> 02:56:59,231
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

1852
02:56:59,471 --> 02:57:00,832
[SPEAKER_39]: Maria Palmarino.

1853
02:57:00,852 --> 02:57:04,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1854
02:57:04,935 --> 02:57:05,996
[SPEAKER_39]: Go ahead.

1855
02:57:06,796 --> 02:57:08,719
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Matilde Sesta.

1856
02:57:09,620 --> 02:57:16,031
[SPEAKER_24]: I live directly behind the convent and I'm with my friend here because I don't do computers.

1857
02:57:16,612 --> 02:57:19,757
[SPEAKER_24]: But I have to say this, talking is easy.

1858
02:57:20,739 --> 02:57:23,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody says their own version.

1859
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:35,984
[SPEAKER_24]: I second my next, my neighbor, Kelly Razo, because we go through a terrible time for the parking, for the traffic, and everything else.

1860
02:57:36,425 --> 02:57:43,047
[SPEAKER_24]: And the city should know that because I've been there complaining most, a lot of times.

1861
02:57:43,607 --> 02:57:45,528
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't even get out of my driveway.

1862
02:57:46,328 --> 02:57:53,296
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're gonna, you're gonna make sure that we won't be worse off because that's the only thing I want.

1863
02:57:54,057 --> 02:58:03,747
[SPEAKER_24]: And keep the property clean because when there was the charter school, I always pick up rubbish in my yard.

1864
02:58:04,543 --> 02:58:04,963
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay?

1865
02:58:05,644 --> 02:58:07,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, I spoke plain English.

1866
02:58:08,226 --> 02:58:10,068
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't discriminate anybody.

1867
02:58:10,628 --> 02:58:14,932
[SPEAKER_24]: But please, leave me be on my comfort zone.

1868
02:58:15,632 --> 02:58:15,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay?

1869
02:58:16,673 --> 02:58:17,094
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all.

1870
02:58:17,294 --> 02:58:20,517
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll be knocking on the door of everybody of you.

1871
02:58:21,377 --> 02:58:22,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Rich or not rich.

1872
02:58:22,899 --> 02:58:24,240
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm rich on myself.

1873
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:27,082
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's all I want to keep until I die.

1874
02:58:27,663 --> 02:58:31,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I pay for my comfort zone.

1875
02:58:32,142 --> 02:58:32,542
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all.

1876
02:58:32,703 --> 02:58:33,083
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1877
02:58:33,103 --> 02:58:34,104
[SPEAKER_24]: Have a good night.

1878
02:58:35,144 --> 02:58:38,727
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, could I just ask you to state your name and address slowly?

1879
02:58:38,767 --> 02:58:40,128
[SPEAKER_39]: We don't quite understand.

1880
02:58:40,549 --> 02:58:43,031
[SPEAKER_24]: Mathilde Sesta.

1881
02:58:43,551 --> 02:58:44,832
[SPEAKER_24]: I live on 39 St.

1882
02:58:45,253 --> 02:58:48,075
[SPEAKER_24]: Francis Street, right behind the convent.

1883
02:58:48,475 --> 02:58:52,819
[SPEAKER_24]: My fence is behind the convent fence.

1884
02:58:53,059 --> 02:58:53,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1885
02:58:55,081 --> 02:58:55,301
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1886
02:58:55,381 --> 02:58:55,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1887
02:58:56,362 --> 02:58:56,762
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1888
02:59:03,724 --> 02:59:11,486
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to close the public comment period, and I am going to circle back to Vice Chair Emily Hedeman to start us off with board comments.

1889
02:59:12,846 --> 02:59:18,407
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, thank you so much, Chair McPherson, and I really appreciate your leadership, you know, throughout this public hearing.

1890
02:59:18,427 --> 02:59:31,730
[SPEAKER_35]: I think, you know, the overall intent of public hearings is to hear from the public, and then, you know, I think another kind of maybe unsaid part of it is to, you know,

1891
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:37,492
[SPEAKER_35]: kind of build trust and respect between the board, the applicant and the neighborhood.

1892
02:59:37,512 --> 02:59:41,973
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm starting to feel that erode a little bit in multiple directions.

1893
02:59:43,114 --> 02:59:50,216
[SPEAKER_35]: It sounds like we have a lot of, a lot of people that are potentially presenting themselves as authorities on all sides.

1894
02:59:50,536 --> 02:59:55,518
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'm wondering if, you know, the the board had a little bit more

1895
03:00:00,705 --> 03:00:01,805
[SPEAKER_35]: Authority is not the right word.

1896
03:00:01,885 --> 03:00:06,867
[SPEAKER_35]: But if the board, because we've referenced our legal counsel's decision.

1897
03:00:06,887 --> 03:00:14,450
[SPEAKER_35]: And I hope that the public would trust that that decision is valid.

1898
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:28,535
[SPEAKER_35]: But I'm wondering if having them, legal counsel, just like for Tufts, if having them present for this discussion, because it is so contested, would help

1899
03:00:30,161 --> 03:00:36,325
[SPEAKER_35]: with the trust between the public, the neighbors, the board, the applicant, and so on.

1900
03:00:36,345 --> 03:00:42,549
[SPEAKER_35]: Because I said this at the last hearing, I think the applicant could be a good neighbor.

1901
03:00:42,569 --> 03:00:50,595
[SPEAKER_35]: I know everybody who's speaking in the public hearing is a good neighbor in their own way.

1902
03:00:50,855 --> 03:00:55,158
[SPEAKER_35]: But I want to make sure that we don't erode this relationship so

1903
03:00:56,800 --> 03:01:03,155
[SPEAKER_35]: negatively that whatever we decide it's, you know, it's bad for everybody.

1904
03:01:03,175 --> 03:01:06,542
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if other board members have any thoughts on that.

1905
03:01:07,678 --> 03:01:10,400
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate that, Vice Chair Herrmann, especially where it can go either way.

1906
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:19,147
[SPEAKER_43]: For one, I believe that the proponent has enough information that's sufficient enough for the educational use to qualify for the bill of amendment.

1907
03:01:19,207 --> 03:01:24,151
[SPEAKER_43]: However, I also believe that it is true that the abutters have enough information to sue that.

1908
03:01:24,531 --> 03:01:27,093
[SPEAKER_43]: And in this point, I don't know how to move forward from there.

1909
03:01:27,554 --> 03:01:29,795
[SPEAKER_43]: The information from the Attorney General's

1910
03:01:31,936 --> 03:01:39,699
[SPEAKER_43]: just put us back in circles and spin it on case law, which I totally understand, but it was a little bit more clear-cut for that case law.

1911
03:01:39,799 --> 03:01:41,819
[SPEAKER_43]: It's not clear-cut for the situation.

1912
03:01:41,879 --> 03:01:46,140
[SPEAKER_43]: So I want to be very transparent ahead of time for the proponent.

1913
03:01:46,741 --> 03:01:53,383
[SPEAKER_43]: I am not prepared to vote on this going forward this evening, but in saying that, I am very for this project.

1914
03:01:53,423 --> 03:01:56,183
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to make sure that this project is airtight.

1915
03:01:56,984 --> 03:01:58,124
[SPEAKER_43]: I want it to be airtight.

1916
03:01:58,784 --> 03:02:12,567
[SPEAKER_43]: So that there's not future information where it can be litigated or so that, you know, we just want to I just want to make sure that whatever we decide on tonight and whatever conditions that we put on to you this evening is airtight from the abutters and that.

1917
03:02:13,815 --> 03:02:19,898
[SPEAKER_43]: It actually, we're able to move forward just like we were able to move forward previously with maybe some other improvements.

1918
03:02:19,918 --> 03:02:24,280
[SPEAKER_43]: There's things that just we're not going to land on for the abutters, unfortunately.

1919
03:02:24,340 --> 03:02:33,404
[SPEAKER_43]: But at least one of the things that we can give the community is sound reasoning, making sure that you do qualify under the Dover Amendment.

1920
03:02:33,924 --> 03:02:40,947
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think having legal advise us on that going forward in the community hearing that would put many people at ease.

1921
03:02:43,778 --> 03:02:44,358
[SPEAKER_43]: Ari Fishman.

1922
03:02:45,739 --> 03:02:46,699
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1923
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:52,141
[SPEAKER_29]: I agree that I don't feel confident to vote on this today.

1924
03:02:52,202 --> 03:03:09,929
[SPEAKER_29]: I would like to continue it to a date certain and request that city legal counsel be present in a synchronous way and be able to advise on the Dover Amendment use specifically in this case, which from the reading and what they sent us earlier,

1925
03:03:11,010 --> 03:03:15,192
[SPEAKER_29]: And the AG, I think I was persuaded on, but I think it would be good to discuss.

1926
03:03:15,353 --> 03:03:23,378
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would also be interested in hearing from the city legal team specifically about this private developer issue.

1927
03:03:23,838 --> 03:03:27,941
[SPEAKER_29]: And if there are any concerns on the legal side about kind of how it's presented.

1928
03:03:28,822 --> 03:03:34,326
[SPEAKER_29]: I do hear the concerns about parking and in this,

1929
03:03:38,544 --> 03:03:47,274
[SPEAKER_29]: And also, Dover is clear that we can't discriminate on the purpose and occupants of it.

1930
03:03:47,714 --> 03:03:53,241
[SPEAKER_29]: And I do agree with the applicant that this is a much needed service for our own community.

1931
03:03:55,390 --> 03:04:01,291
[SPEAKER_43]: Without having a legal background, I'm almost willing to bet that this is definitely an educational use under Dover.

1932
03:04:01,812 --> 03:04:10,914
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to make sure that any information that we use going forward, again, I do know that the abutters have a strong case against.

1933
03:04:11,454 --> 03:04:21,296
[SPEAKER_43]: And the Attorney General's information is just not enough for me to be OK with making a decision this evening.

1934
03:04:22,096 --> 03:04:22,596
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter Cowles?

1935
03:04:25,433 --> 03:04:33,959
[SPEAKER_46]: I'd like to kind of echo what other members of the board have said and just bring up something that was mentioned last time.

1936
03:04:34,019 --> 03:04:42,464
[SPEAKER_46]: And I don't know if it was a small technical thing that I think should be resolved by now.

1937
03:04:45,406 --> 03:04:50,009
[SPEAKER_46]: I also am in favor of having further legal counsel.

1938
03:04:50,069 --> 03:04:53,651
[SPEAKER_46]: I think while I think this project likely does apply under Dover,

1939
03:04:55,123 --> 03:04:58,206
[SPEAKER_46]: and is a much needed use for the community.

1940
03:04:58,426 --> 03:05:07,313
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't want to set anything up for this project team.

1941
03:05:08,394 --> 03:05:10,295
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't want to set them up for uncertainty down the line.

1942
03:05:10,315 --> 03:05:16,801
[SPEAKER_46]: I want to give them as straight a runway as possible to get this done and get this done right.

1943
03:05:16,901 --> 03:05:21,905
[SPEAKER_46]: So I don't feel comfortable approving them now only to have them

1944
03:05:22,947 --> 03:05:24,827
[SPEAKER_46]: tied up legally after the fact.

1945
03:05:25,428 --> 03:05:41,571
[SPEAKER_46]: I'd much prefer get the legal counsel involved, get everything airtight immediately so that once this is approved, we don't have to, nobody has to worry about it and we can all move along with getting this project together.

1946
03:05:43,432 --> 03:05:49,373
[SPEAKER_46]: Although there is one thing that I noted from the city's proposed draft conditions that is something that came up

1947
03:05:50,523 --> 03:05:55,667
[SPEAKER_46]: during the last hearing, and that is the status of St.

1948
03:05:55,728 --> 03:05:56,548
[SPEAKER_46]: Clair Road.

1949
03:05:56,568 --> 03:06:09,439
[SPEAKER_46]: It was noted that the plan provided by the applicant called that a public way, and the city does not have any record of public acceptance of St.

1950
03:06:09,459 --> 03:06:09,980
[SPEAKER_46]: Clair Road.

1951
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:13,683
[SPEAKER_46]: That's from a purely technical perspective.

1952
03:06:13,723 --> 03:06:18,087
[SPEAKER_46]: My question is if that has been resolved.

1953
03:06:22,980 --> 03:06:23,641
[SPEAKER_44]: Madam chair.

1954
03:06:24,621 --> 03:06:25,462
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, we.

1955
03:06:27,123 --> 03:06:29,065
[SPEAKER_44]: So, I believe that the applicant had.

1956
03:06:30,265 --> 03:06:37,651
[SPEAKER_44]: Provided a deed or something that said that it was a public road, but I. I don't think that that's sufficient evidence to.

1957
03:06:39,852 --> 03:06:41,813
[SPEAKER_44]: Demonstrate that that was ever accepted.

1958
03:06:43,415 --> 03:06:46,817
[SPEAKER_44]: The working theory was that this was a long time ago and.

1959
03:06:49,135 --> 03:06:54,277
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, it was just like a favorite of the church, well-maintained road kind of thing.

1960
03:06:54,878 --> 03:07:02,601
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't think it was, there's no record that it was ever accepted and it doesn't meet city standards.

1961
03:07:03,221 --> 03:07:07,023
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's unfathomable that it would have been accepted.

1962
03:07:07,703 --> 03:07:10,124
[SPEAKER_44]: So I think it's a private way.

1963
03:07:12,985 --> 03:07:18,688
[SPEAKER_46]: So, Danielle, just to clarify that there was an intent for it to become public, but it never got all the way there.

1964
03:07:19,810 --> 03:07:25,531
[SPEAKER_44]: Because they never brought it up to the standards for it to be accepted.

1965
03:07:26,512 --> 03:07:26,672
[SPEAKER_46]: OK.

1966
03:07:26,692 --> 03:07:28,212
[SPEAKER_46]: No problem.

1967
03:07:28,832 --> 03:07:36,774
[SPEAKER_46]: I know that was one of our big sticking points last time, was trying to figure that out just for frontage purposes.

1968
03:07:37,074 --> 03:07:40,815
[SPEAKER_46]: And I just wanted to see if that was something that could have been resolved.

1969
03:07:42,855 --> 03:07:45,576
[SPEAKER_44]: Unless the applicant has additional information.

1970
03:07:45,596 --> 03:07:49,317
[SPEAKER_44]: Because I also would like to know what's the status of

1971
03:07:50,442 --> 03:08:00,147
[SPEAKER_44]: The improvements to the, to the pedestrian experience in the front and because we have a condition.

1972
03:08:01,483 --> 03:08:05,666
[SPEAKER_44]: Um, that's why I dropped it, um, draft conditions for the first time.

1973
03:08:05,686 --> 03:08:06,627
[SPEAKER_44]: This was before you.

1974
03:08:07,087 --> 03:08:20,517
[SPEAKER_44]: And one of them was, um, that they provide some kind of, um, safe pedestrian walkway, knowing that, um, residents are coming from the bus stop that they need to be coming from the bus stop.

1975
03:08:20,577 --> 03:08:23,939
[SPEAKER_46]: I have the document is, was that, was that what it was?

1976
03:08:23,999 --> 03:08:28,563
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't remember last time there was something that we had drafted that was.

1977
03:08:30,502 --> 03:08:35,524
[SPEAKER_46]: We can condition this if it's a public way, but not if it's a private way or the other way around.

1978
03:08:38,645 --> 03:08:45,868
[SPEAKER_46]: I remember last time there was some condition, I believe, relating to pedestrian access that was, we can include this as a condition if St.

1979
03:08:45,908 --> 03:08:49,129
[SPEAKER_46]: Clair Road is either public or private.

1980
03:08:49,987 --> 03:08:58,509
[SPEAKER_39]: If it's a public way, the city has control over the street, and if it's a private way, they only own in front of their homes.

1981
03:08:58,689 --> 03:09:08,111
[SPEAKER_39]: We could request it on their property in front of their building, but we couldn't require them to take it all the way to the corner because that would be in front of someone else's property.

1982
03:09:09,191 --> 03:09:09,391
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

1983
03:09:09,571 --> 03:09:09,931
[SPEAKER_46]: Got you.

1984
03:09:10,951 --> 03:09:17,253
[SPEAKER_39]: But I would like to respectfully remind the board that there were a number of questions asked and the applicant could- I do.

1985
03:09:17,353 --> 03:09:17,813
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm there.

1986
03:09:18,093 --> 03:09:18,613
[SPEAKER_43]: I have that.

1987
03:09:19,193 --> 03:09:21,115
[SPEAKER_43]: Director Hunt, thank you.

1988
03:09:22,315 --> 03:09:35,946
[SPEAKER_43]: I just wanted to get the temperature of the board a little bit, but I do want to go back to the proponent, the applicant, and provide you a chance to respond to the questions that you have heard this evening.

1989
03:09:36,487 --> 03:09:38,348
[SPEAKER_43]: You are not required to answer all of them.

1990
03:09:38,388 --> 03:09:43,312
[SPEAKER_43]: Please answer the ones that you feel are necessary for this hearing this evening.

1991
03:09:44,202 --> 03:09:45,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1992
03:09:45,062 --> 03:09:46,142
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there was a lot covered.

1993
03:09:46,162 --> 03:09:50,303
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, just quickly on that public-private road piece.

1994
03:09:52,124 --> 03:09:57,385
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, there was a complaint by some of the abutters about a fire lane.

1995
03:09:58,045 --> 03:10:04,846
[SPEAKER_16]: We essentially removed, and if it's a condition, we're happy to put it back, but we essentially removed anything in the front of the building.

1996
03:10:04,866 --> 03:10:08,947
[SPEAKER_16]: It became a source of contention when we proposed to put a sidewalk there.

1997
03:10:09,287 --> 03:10:12,448
[SPEAKER_16]: It created more acrimony than

1998
03:10:13,832 --> 03:10:14,452
[SPEAKER_16]: than happiness.

1999
03:10:15,233 --> 03:10:22,237
[SPEAKER_16]: And so on this set of plans, on the site plan, there is no site, there is no sidewalk shown on the front.

2000
03:10:23,197 --> 03:10:25,999
[SPEAKER_16]: If it became a conditional license, of course, we would do it.

2001
03:10:26,559 --> 03:10:29,361
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think conditions are a good place to start here.

2002
03:10:29,381 --> 03:10:33,023
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of the comments, look, there were many comments tonight.

2003
03:10:33,503 --> 03:10:36,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Some were comments opposed, some were comments in favor.

2004
03:10:37,445 --> 03:10:40,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Some were just out and out, inappropriate comments.

2005
03:10:41,050 --> 03:10:50,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would just urge the board to recognize that the further this goes, it may not necessarily get better and it may not necessarily get easier.

2006
03:10:51,317 --> 03:10:59,402
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been working with the staff and staff has been consulting your attorney on this matter.

2007
03:10:59,522 --> 03:11:03,405
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have been in regular communication through staff about comments from the attorney.

2008
03:11:03,933 --> 03:11:06,094
[SPEAKER_16]: And those comments have flowed in two directions.

2009
03:11:06,634 --> 03:11:12,478
[SPEAKER_16]: And when there was a comment relating to something, we provided the information that was requested by staff.

2010
03:11:13,078 --> 03:11:22,003
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, to physically place the attorney in this hearing is, of course, your choice as a board.

2011
03:11:22,783 --> 03:11:46,304
[SPEAKER_16]: um and and and and you know that's what you're going to do that's what you're going to do but um you know we would we have now this is our second time in front of the board we've re-noticed this community twice including miss raso's residence and um we um uh you know respectfully request that we would we would like a decision to be made tonight the um

2012
03:11:47,905 --> 03:11:54,150
[SPEAKER_16]: the care of trying to prevent us from being sued down the line is just outside and exceeds the scope of this board.

2013
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:57,032
[SPEAKER_16]: If we get sued down the road, then so be it.

2014
03:11:57,072 --> 03:11:58,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the risks.

2015
03:11:58,252 --> 03:12:03,256
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll deal with it as any property owner would.

2016
03:12:03,296 --> 03:12:09,380
[SPEAKER_16]: There's nothing that you can do in this room that's going to prevent us from getting sued or not sued from the other side.

2017
03:12:10,161 --> 03:12:12,902
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of animosity towards this particular proposal.

2018
03:12:13,503 --> 03:12:16,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of it, there's some great comments I want to hit really quickly.

2019
03:12:16,932 --> 03:12:22,496
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's a tone, which I think has been used that was not appreciated.

2020
03:12:23,137 --> 03:12:31,103
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think to give into that tone tonight, because there's pressure, is going to punish the applicant.

2021
03:12:31,243 --> 03:12:36,667
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to cost the applicant more money and more time as they carry this parcel, as they carry this

2022
03:12:37,568 --> 03:12:51,836
[SPEAKER_16]: the cost of keeping this parcel alive, this property alive, while they wait another month, pay me, pay their mortgage payment, pay their staff, their team.

2023
03:12:51,856 --> 03:12:53,697
[SPEAKER_16]: It's extremely expensive.

2024
03:12:54,398 --> 03:12:54,818
[SPEAKER_16]: For what?

2025
03:12:55,298 --> 03:13:00,001
[SPEAKER_16]: To get you out of an uncomfortable position that is only going to get more uncomfortable at the next meeting.

2026
03:13:00,521 --> 03:13:01,982
[SPEAKER_16]: What's at odds here isn't

2027
03:13:03,803 --> 03:13:18,875
[SPEAKER_16]: some magic words that I can provide you or any kind of information that's going to somehow cure the concerns, but there's a fundamental animosity for this proposal from certain members of this community and it's unfortunate.

2028
03:13:19,355 --> 03:13:29,804
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have sat in your shoes before a long time ago in another body and it's just, you know, sometimes you have to make the call.

2029
03:13:30,847 --> 03:13:33,109
[SPEAKER_16]: but it's not my decision to do so, that's your decision.

2030
03:13:33,129 --> 03:13:35,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I gave you my opinion there.

2031
03:13:35,432 --> 03:13:43,640
[SPEAKER_16]: I do believe you can condition this license with certain requirements that will protect those concerns.

2032
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:49,085
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the number one concern I heard from people, legitimate concern, was the question about the lease.

2033
03:13:49,806 --> 03:13:58,812
[SPEAKER_16]: you can absolutely condition that before a certificate of occupancy is rendered by the City of Medford, that a lease is presented to the City of Medford.

2034
03:13:58,832 --> 03:14:01,614
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a very simple and easy thing for you to do.

2035
03:14:02,514 --> 03:14:03,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, no CFO.

2036
03:14:05,056 --> 03:14:09,339
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a comment made that I represented the previous applicant before Medford.

2037
03:14:09,379 --> 03:14:09,879
[SPEAKER_16]: I did not.

2038
03:14:10,240 --> 03:14:12,081
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a misstatement to this board.

2039
03:14:12,941 --> 03:14:14,943
[SPEAKER_16]: With regard to the PowerPoint, the PowerPoint is my

2040
03:14:15,723 --> 03:14:17,144
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like my pad of paper here.

2041
03:14:17,464 --> 03:14:20,205
[SPEAKER_16]: I could send in the pad of paper that I'm reading from right now.

2042
03:14:20,625 --> 03:14:21,625
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the equivalent of that.

2043
03:14:21,985 --> 03:14:22,605
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tool.

2044
03:14:22,645 --> 03:14:24,586
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tool that I can use to communicate with.

2045
03:14:25,606 --> 03:14:33,329
[SPEAKER_16]: No board requires that that has to be put in as a part of the record.

2046
03:14:33,649 --> 03:14:35,950
[SPEAKER_16]: I, in any case, have sent it to Alicia and Daniel.

2047
03:14:36,270 --> 03:14:37,511
[SPEAKER_16]: They now have it in their inbox.

2048
03:14:37,651 --> 03:14:38,311
[SPEAKER_16]: They can upload it.

2049
03:14:39,471 --> 03:14:51,999
[SPEAKER_16]: They have my PowerPoint, but the PowerPoint is pulled from the materials I've already submitted, and it's just blown up in size so that I can talk about some key points so that we don't have to sit there for hours.

2050
03:14:52,439 --> 03:14:56,601
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just an opportunity for me to convey a message to you.

2051
03:14:56,901 --> 03:15:06,027
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, about the educational use, there was a lot of comments made about the educational use, that this is a homeless shelter, and therefore this is not.

2052
03:15:06,747 --> 03:15:07,588
[SPEAKER_16]: and educational use.

2053
03:15:07,688 --> 03:15:15,035
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, the case that was sent to us by the Attorney General came from Dennis, which was a homeless shelter.

2054
03:15:15,435 --> 03:15:15,856
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

2055
03:15:16,296 --> 03:15:18,518
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a homeless shelter of 79 beds.

2056
03:15:19,039 --> 03:15:28,448
[SPEAKER_16]: And the case in Dennis said that that homeless shelter is teaching people to live in society and to be housed and to mean what it means, learn what it means to be housed again.

2057
03:15:28,928 --> 03:15:29,929
[SPEAKER_16]: That would have been enough.

2058
03:15:31,450 --> 03:15:33,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not even proposing a housing.

2059
03:15:33,391 --> 03:15:36,373
[SPEAKER_16]: We're taking it a step further, something that's more educational.

2060
03:15:36,734 --> 03:15:42,197
[SPEAKER_16]: We're targeting the domestic violence piece that I think Taisha very eloquently described.

2061
03:15:43,954 --> 03:15:45,294
[SPEAKER_16]: was all the more educational.

2062
03:15:45,635 --> 03:15:53,017
[SPEAKER_16]: But even if it was guests in a homeless shelter, which it's not, it's guests in a domestic violence facility.

2063
03:15:53,497 --> 03:15:58,819
[SPEAKER_16]: But even if it was, that has long tread, that's long asked and answered, done.

2064
03:15:59,059 --> 03:16:02,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Every case we provided you has said that that would be allowed.

2065
03:16:04,601 --> 03:16:07,241
[SPEAKER_16]: The other developments, I'd love to have Andrew talk about it.

2066
03:16:07,342 --> 03:16:11,423
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things we talked about at the last meeting that you weren't at, but you saw, Madam Chair, is

2067
03:16:15,115 --> 03:16:19,177
[SPEAKER_16]: 99% success rate, almost zero recidivism at the Dorchester properties.

2068
03:16:19,217 --> 03:16:23,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Dorchester properties are affiliated with Taisha's work that she's doing.

2069
03:16:25,220 --> 03:16:28,682
[SPEAKER_16]: They can talk about the properties that they work on collectively.

2070
03:16:28,862 --> 03:16:30,242
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there are two in Dorchester.

2071
03:16:30,582 --> 03:16:31,503
[SPEAKER_16]: They have no complaints.

2072
03:16:31,543 --> 03:16:32,423
[SPEAKER_16]: We had skeptical.

2073
03:16:34,403 --> 03:16:37,527
[SPEAKER_16]: People when we first started now, we have amazing relationships.

2074
03:16:37,567 --> 03:16:47,738
[SPEAKER_16]: We wanted to actually video some of the neighbors talking about that very phenomenon that when they 1st, we 1st arrived, they were a little bit concerned like people like.

2075
03:16:49,843 --> 03:16:53,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Mrs. Matilda Sesta, who I thought, you know, made a great comment.

2076
03:16:53,105 --> 03:16:53,825
[SPEAKER_16]: She lives behind us.

2077
03:16:53,845 --> 03:16:58,027
[SPEAKER_16]: She just wants us to keep a nice, clean yard.

2078
03:16:58,487 --> 03:16:59,968
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, people like that were living next to us.

2079
03:16:59,988 --> 03:17:00,889
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't know what it was.

2080
03:17:01,089 --> 03:17:04,130
[SPEAKER_16]: And then a year, two, three, four years later, they like us.

2081
03:17:04,330 --> 03:17:05,551
[SPEAKER_16]: They like having us as a neighbor.

2082
03:17:06,071 --> 03:17:06,892
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we're proud of that.

2083
03:17:06,952 --> 03:17:12,194
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there is a good news story out there, but we're not going to get that here until we're up and running.

2084
03:17:12,675 --> 03:17:17,037
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to get any further down the road here until we actually

2085
03:17:17,477 --> 03:17:19,537
[SPEAKER_16]: are allowed to put construction level drawings.

2086
03:17:19,637 --> 03:17:21,598
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the questions was about capacity.

2087
03:17:21,618 --> 03:17:29,059
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to have a capacity number for you until the building department signs off on our final sets of plans.

2088
03:17:29,519 --> 03:17:36,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's an iterative process that our architect goes with when they submit their construction level drawings to your building department.

2089
03:17:37,201 --> 03:17:43,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we're given some number at the end that the fire department stamps, building department stamps, and it's the total number allowed in the facility.

2090
03:17:44,642 --> 03:17:48,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're not going to get to that point until we actually create construction level drawings.

2091
03:17:48,285 --> 03:17:56,552
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to get to that point until we're approved by this board, because until we are approved by this board, we won't get the funding that we need from the bank to do what we need to do.

2092
03:17:56,592 --> 03:17:57,914
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just a fundamental.

2093
03:18:00,823 --> 03:18:03,765
[SPEAKER_16]: symptom of development everywhere, really, in the world.

2094
03:18:03,965 --> 03:18:06,666
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we need to be approved in order to proceed.

2095
03:18:07,207 --> 03:18:08,547
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of a catch-22.

2096
03:18:08,647 --> 03:18:20,254
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know how baked the cake needs to be before we can get to a place where, I mean, it would be one thing if we showed up here without a cogent proposal, without information.

2097
03:18:20,294 --> 03:18:25,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the information we provide is over and beyond of what we're even asked to provide.

2098
03:18:25,777 --> 03:18:27,978
[SPEAKER_16]: We provided, for example, a traffic study.

2099
03:18:28,498 --> 03:18:33,620
[SPEAKER_16]: That traffic study did not contemplate that people didn't have cars available to them.

2100
03:18:33,820 --> 03:18:40,943
[SPEAKER_16]: That traffic study contemplated that people do use cars and even still didn't see an increase in the activity of the automobile.

2101
03:18:43,084 --> 03:18:44,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Job training, job readiness.

2102
03:18:44,844 --> 03:18:49,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're not going to be doing solar and commercial driver's license at this facility.

2103
03:18:49,528 --> 03:18:54,271
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have a facility in Dorchester where they are doing that and they are sending people and we have relationships.

2104
03:18:54,671 --> 03:19:02,615
[SPEAKER_16]: If we had a resident that wanted to learn about solar and commercial driving licenses, we would have a place to send them because there's a network.

2105
03:19:02,895 --> 03:19:07,238
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a system of people who we work with and have relationships with.

2106
03:19:10,159 --> 03:19:13,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Trash will be handled and will be managed professionally on site.

2107
03:19:14,782 --> 03:19:16,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew could talk more about that.

2108
03:19:18,806 --> 03:19:19,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll stop there.

2109
03:19:19,807 --> 03:19:30,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry if you got a little bit more than you asked for here, but it's frustrating to watch some of those comments be made, and then the conclusion of those comments be that there's ambiguity and we need to wait another month.

2110
03:19:30,929 --> 03:19:35,630
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be extremely expensive, and I can tell you right now, this project cannot do this forever.

2111
03:19:36,130 --> 03:19:43,392
[SPEAKER_16]: It will run out of money, it will be in peril, and it will not open if we continue to limp along at this pace.

2112
03:19:44,342 --> 03:19:45,765
[SPEAKER_16]: We are not Tufts University.

2113
03:19:46,166 --> 03:19:47,910
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not have the same resources.

2114
03:19:48,632 --> 03:19:51,459
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a different set of circumstances in place here.

2115
03:19:55,088 --> 03:19:56,008
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. Ross.

2116
03:19:56,469 --> 03:19:58,489
[SPEAKER_43]: With all due respect, you've never sat in my body.

2117
03:19:58,509 --> 03:20:01,830
[SPEAKER_43]: I just wanted to let you, I just wanted to respond to that, nor in my shoes.

2118
03:20:01,990 --> 03:20:08,453
[SPEAKER_43]: And while I'm neither continuing due to public pressure, nor will I urge the board to vote for pressure from you or your partners.

2119
03:20:08,993 --> 03:20:15,635
[SPEAKER_43]: We have bravely sat in the same seat, in the same spot with this stance in other instances, and we'll do so this evening.

2120
03:20:16,236 --> 03:20:19,297
[SPEAKER_43]: If the Hale House was the owner of the property or had the lease,

2121
03:20:20,237 --> 03:20:22,440
[SPEAKER_43]: or was doing a renovation, there would be no question.

2122
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:36,334
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a true weakness here, and given it the Dover Amendment, and we have not, the board, spoken directly to legal counsel, and that is my concern, my only concern, because there's two things before the board tonight.

2123
03:20:37,055 --> 03:20:40,336
[SPEAKER_43]: Does this qualify as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

2124
03:20:40,416 --> 03:20:41,536
[SPEAKER_43]: I can't say yes or no.

2125
03:20:41,616 --> 03:20:42,857
[SPEAKER_43]: The city has said yes or no.

2126
03:20:43,317 --> 03:20:48,118
[SPEAKER_43]: No one else has said yes or no or has advised the board legally on yes or no.

2127
03:20:48,658 --> 03:20:52,099
[SPEAKER_43]: And then what conditions of approval are needed to mitigate any adverse impacts?

2128
03:20:52,199 --> 03:20:57,801
[SPEAKER_43]: We wouldn't know because until we're sure that you qualify under the Dover Amendment, we can't move forward.

2129
03:20:58,201 --> 03:21:01,622
[SPEAKER_43]: And in that saying, I would like a motion from the board to continue

2130
03:21:03,165 --> 03:21:16,837
[SPEAKER_43]: 21 Claire Road site plan review for Dover amendment to a date certain which would be January 15th and also a motion to make sure that we have legal counsel to make to advise us on whether or not this is a Dover amendment.

2131
03:21:18,859 --> 03:21:23,103
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll make the motion to continue to a date certain which is January 15th.

2132
03:21:24,244 --> 03:21:24,804
[SPEAKER_35]: I second.

2133
03:21:27,146 --> 03:21:27,927
[SPEAKER_43]: I can second that.

2134
03:21:29,459 --> 03:21:30,079
[SPEAKER_43]: Roll call.

2135
03:21:30,239 --> 03:21:31,500
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

2136
03:21:32,020 --> 03:21:32,140
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2137
03:21:33,021 --> 03:21:33,701
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter Cowes?

2138
03:21:35,362 --> 03:21:35,462
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2139
03:21:36,442 --> 03:21:37,123
[SPEAKER_43]: Ari Fishman?

2140
03:21:37,943 --> 03:21:38,083
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2141
03:21:38,844 --> 03:21:39,924
[SPEAKER_43]: Annie String?

2142
03:21:40,965 --> 03:21:41,105
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2143
03:21:42,445 --> 03:21:43,126
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrens?

2144
03:21:46,928 --> 03:21:47,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Nay.

2145
03:21:47,208 --> 03:21:50,049
[SPEAKER_43]: Sabrina Alpino?

2146
03:21:50,069 --> 03:21:51,450
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2147
03:21:52,610 --> 03:21:53,491
[SPEAKER_43]: Ben Lovalli?

2148
03:21:54,792 --> 03:21:54,932
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2149
03:21:55,912 --> 03:21:57,653
[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

2150
03:22:01,657 --> 03:22:14,256
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm an I. Of eight board members, there's one dissension, four yeses, four yeses, I'm sorry, seven yeses, one no.

2151
03:22:15,338 --> 03:22:17,181
[SPEAKER_43]: So the vote carries.

2152
03:22:22,430 --> 03:22:23,831
[SPEAKER_43]: And that was for date starting.

2153
03:22:24,171 --> 03:22:34,960
[SPEAKER_43]: The second motion I'm looking for is to have legal advise us on whether or not this is a covered, this project is covered under the Dover amendment.

2154
03:22:34,980 --> 03:22:47,911
[SPEAKER_35]: I'd like to make a motion to have legal advise us and be present at the next hearing, January 15th, to provide advisement to the board.

2155
03:22:50,393 --> 03:22:50,833
[SPEAKER_43]: A second.

2156
03:22:54,003 --> 03:22:55,324
[SPEAKER_43]: I second that motion.

2157
03:22:57,405 --> 03:22:58,046
[SPEAKER_43]: Roll call.

2158
03:22:58,486 --> 03:22:59,647
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

2159
03:23:00,367 --> 03:23:00,487
[SPEAKER_35]: Aye.

2160
03:23:01,668 --> 03:23:02,368
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter Cowles.

2161
03:23:04,250 --> 03:23:04,350
[SPEAKER_35]: Aye.

2162
03:23:05,791 --> 03:23:06,471
[SPEAKER_43]: Ari Fishman.

2163
03:23:07,271 --> 03:23:07,412
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2164
03:23:08,492 --> 03:23:09,093
[SPEAKER_43]: Andy String.

2165
03:23:10,013 --> 03:23:10,153
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2166
03:23:11,214 --> 03:23:11,894
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrens.

2167
03:23:12,795 --> 03:23:12,915
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2168
03:23:14,396 --> 03:23:15,317
[SPEAKER_43]: Sabrina Alpino.

2169
03:23:16,317 --> 03:23:16,437
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2170
03:23:17,358 --> 03:23:18,078
[SPEAKER_43]: Ben Lavalle.

2171
03:23:19,639 --> 03:23:19,759
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2172
03:23:20,600 --> 03:23:22,041
[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

2173
03:23:22,821 --> 03:23:23,622
[SPEAKER_43]: The motion carries.

2174
03:23:25,114 --> 03:23:26,395
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. Ross.

2175
03:23:26,495 --> 03:23:27,876
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. Detroit.

2176
03:23:27,936 --> 03:23:30,838
[SPEAKER_43]: We will see you on, the board will see you on January 15th.

2177
03:23:34,341 --> 03:23:41,106
[SPEAKER_43]: The third item on our meeting this evening is new, thank you to everyone that has come to hear about 21 St.

2178
03:23:41,126 --> 03:23:41,627
[SPEAKER_43]: Clair Road.

2179
03:23:43,328 --> 03:23:53,296
[SPEAKER_43]: And the third item on our agenda this evening is new public hearing, which is a definitive subdivision plan for bridal path definitive subdivision.

2180
03:23:54,753 --> 03:23:56,975
[SPEAKER_43]: And this is a new public hearing.

2181
03:23:57,715 --> 03:23:59,556
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'm going to read the public hearing notice.

2182
03:24:00,417 --> 03:24:07,242
[SPEAKER_43]: Assessor's map, G-05, parcel three, Franklin Avenue, North Shore Residential Development Incorporated.

2183
03:24:07,562 --> 03:24:13,766
[SPEAKER_43]: The Macford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on December 18th, 2024, after 6.30 p.m.

2184
03:24:13,826 --> 03:24:21,911
[SPEAKER_43]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for approval of a definitive subdivision plan, bridal path definitive subdivision.

2185
03:24:22,792 --> 03:24:27,535
[SPEAKER_43]: filed by North Shore Residential Development Incorporated on October 7, 2024.

2186
03:24:27,975 --> 03:24:34,659
[SPEAKER_43]: This notice is published in accordance with the provisions of Subdivision Control Law, MGL Chapter 41, Section 81-T.

2187
03:24:37,760 --> 03:24:42,443
[SPEAKER_43]: The record owner of land is Conners Realty Trust, 41 Franklin Avenue, Medford, Mass.

2188
03:24:42,463 --> 03:24:42,443
02155.

2189
03:24:42,543 --> 03:24:42,983
[SPEAKER_43]: And we have

2190
03:24:47,082 --> 03:24:54,606
[SPEAKER_43]: The description of the property consists of two combined parcels of vacant land, consisting of approximately 85,407 square feet of land.

2191
03:24:54,987 --> 03:24:59,349
[SPEAKER_43]: The plan seeks to divide the parcels into eight single family house lots.

2192
03:25:00,750 --> 03:25:05,172
[SPEAKER_43]: If I could please have the city staff begin with opening remarks.

2193
03:25:08,254 --> 03:25:10,615
[SPEAKER_44]: Good evening, Daniel Evans, senior planner.

2194
03:25:14,538 --> 03:25:16,039
[SPEAKER_44]: I believe tonight that the,

2195
03:25:18,902 --> 03:25:24,425
[SPEAKER_44]: There were some outstanding issues that we needed updated for the city engineer.

2196
03:25:24,445 --> 03:25:31,830
[SPEAKER_44]: I believe the applicant has gotten the information to the city engineer.

2197
03:25:33,571 --> 03:25:38,714
[SPEAKER_44]: However, I don't believe we've gotten his updated comments or.

2198
03:25:40,843 --> 03:25:44,426
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't believe there's been any written comments because he was waiting for the changes.

2199
03:25:45,006 --> 03:26:03,581
[SPEAKER_44]: So I would recommend that we have the applicant present the proposal and then ask any questions, any concerns, and then we have this ready for the next meeting.

2200
03:26:05,227 --> 03:26:10,870
[SPEAKER_44]: with buttoned up conditions and all the comments from the relevant departments.

2201
03:26:18,775 --> 03:26:19,696
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you very much.

2202
03:26:19,896 --> 03:26:26,240
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'm going to have the applicant team present the application.

2203
03:26:26,720 --> 03:26:31,803
[SPEAKER_43]: I believe it's Attorney Kathy Desmond on for the applicant.

2204
03:26:32,564 --> 03:26:34,345
[SPEAKER_43]: If you can please give Attorney Desmond

2205
03:26:36,990 --> 03:26:38,511
[SPEAKER_43]: screen sharing abilities.

2206
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:52,441
[SPEAKER_39]: She can.

2207
03:26:52,461 --> 03:26:56,844
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, I did, I made her a co-host so she can unmute herself and.

2208
03:26:57,404 --> 03:26:58,165
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh, there you are.

2209
03:26:58,885 --> 03:26:59,065
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah.

2210
03:26:59,145 --> 03:27:00,126
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, thank you.

2211
03:27:01,427 --> 03:27:02,848
[SPEAKER_38]: Good evening chairperson

2212
03:27:03,581 --> 03:27:11,668
[SPEAKER_38]: McPherson and board members, by way of introduction, I'm Kathleen Desmond of Reading, attorney for the applicant, North Shore Residential Development, Inc.

2213
03:27:12,288 --> 03:27:29,583
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm joined this evening by its principal, Ronna Lopez, together with the project engineer, Jack Sullivan of Sullivan Engineering Group, LLC, and our project traffic engineer, Jeffrey Dirk of Van Ness & Associates, is on a separate Zoom call.

2214
03:27:30,023 --> 03:27:30,904
[SPEAKER_38]: Jack, I, and

2215
03:27:32,245 --> 03:27:36,790
[SPEAKER_38]: The principal Ron Lopez are in the same setting just so you're all aware.

2216
03:27:37,731 --> 03:27:45,478
[SPEAKER_38]: The application before you requests approval of a proposed residential definitive subdivision consisting of eight single-family lots.

2217
03:27:45,938 --> 03:27:49,742
[SPEAKER_38]: The subdivision is to be situated on an approximately 85,407 square foot parcel of land.

2218
03:27:53,045 --> 03:27:55,326
[SPEAKER_38]: on the southeasterly side of Franklin Avenue.

2219
03:27:55,346 --> 03:28:02,829
[SPEAKER_38]: The proposed lots conform to both use requirements and also dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance.

2220
03:28:03,689 --> 03:28:07,391
[SPEAKER_38]: Currently, the property is owned by the Connors Realty Trust.

2221
03:28:07,861 --> 03:28:10,043
[SPEAKER_38]: and I do believe that they are on the call this evening.

2222
03:28:10,764 --> 03:28:19,912
[SPEAKER_38]: The Connors have resided in the neighborhood for over 60 years and the parcel itself was once operated as a writing stable, a Connors writing stable.

2223
03:28:20,773 --> 03:28:29,581
[SPEAKER_38]: The Connors have requested, just so the board knows where the name came from, they had specifically requested that the name of the subdivision

2224
03:28:30,081 --> 03:28:34,162
[SPEAKER_38]: be something that tied to the historical use of the property.

2225
03:28:34,842 --> 03:28:39,343
[SPEAKER_38]: And as such, we have named the subdivision Bridal Path.

2226
03:28:40,344 --> 03:28:48,726
[SPEAKER_38]: With that, in the interest of brevity, I will pass it off to Mr. Sullivan, our project civil engineer, and he can run through the plan for you.

2227
03:28:50,106 --> 03:28:50,946
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you, Kathleen.

2228
03:28:51,266 --> 03:28:52,987
[SPEAKER_49]: For the record, my name's Jack Sullivan.

2229
03:28:53,007 --> 03:28:58,108
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm the design engineer and professional engineer within the state of Massachusetts.

2230
03:29:00,249 --> 03:29:04,080
[SPEAKER_49]: In front of you, you see the cover sheet for this project bridal path.

2231
03:29:04,524 --> 03:29:14,747
[SPEAKER_49]: We're in the SF1 zoning district, and this is basically a by right subdivision accepting one design waiver that we'd be requesting from the board.

2232
03:29:15,367 --> 03:29:19,788
[SPEAKER_49]: That one waiver is on the easterly street corner of the proposed subdivision.

2233
03:29:19,808 --> 03:29:28,810
[SPEAKER_49]: We're unable to meet the minimum 25 foot radius requirement, but that is the only design waiver that would be requested as part of this project.

2234
03:29:28,831 --> 03:29:30,431
[SPEAKER_49]: Go to the next sheet.

2235
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:33,522
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, this is sheet number 2.

2236
03:29:33,622 --> 03:29:36,045
[SPEAKER_49]: This is our existing site conditions.

2237
03:29:36,526 --> 03:29:38,629
[SPEAKER_49]: It's an undeveloped piece of property.

2238
03:29:38,689 --> 03:29:41,693
[SPEAKER_49]: There's 2 sheds that sit on the property.

2239
03:29:41,713 --> 03:29:48,141
[SPEAKER_49]: As attorney Desmond stated, it's basically a 2 acre parcel of land.

2240
03:29:49,566 --> 03:30:00,377
[SPEAKER_49]: It's relatively flat in the main body of the site, and then as we move off towards the bottom of the screen, there's some sloping topography.

2241
03:30:01,818 --> 03:30:09,065
[SPEAKER_49]: As part of this project, we did 10 soil test holes randomly throughout the development.

2242
03:30:09,105 --> 03:30:12,128
[SPEAKER_49]: They were witnessed by the Medford Engineering Department.

2243
03:30:12,796 --> 03:30:22,806
[SPEAKER_49]: I did want to point out to the board that the majority of the holes we didn't encounter any ledge at all down to a depth of 10 to 12 feet on most of the test holes.

2244
03:30:23,786 --> 03:30:35,978
[SPEAKER_49]: There was one test hole we found refusal at 36 inches, but I did want to point that out because it is a development that's still under construction below us that did have extensive ledge.

2245
03:30:36,078 --> 03:30:37,920
[SPEAKER_49]: We didn't have any any real ledge.

2246
03:30:38,632 --> 03:30:43,495
[SPEAKER_49]: On this site, so I think that's a big difference between the 2 to developments.

2247
03:30:45,016 --> 03:30:53,881
[SPEAKER_49]: I should note that there is an existing gravel access roadway that services 2 of the homes.

2248
03:30:54,562 --> 03:31:01,226
[SPEAKER_49]: Abutting this property, and we're looking to maintain that access when I get into the development plans.

2249
03:31:02,206 --> 03:31:03,267
[SPEAKER_49]: We can go to the next page.

2250
03:31:06,966 --> 03:31:08,806
[SPEAKER_49]: This next sheet is sheet three.

2251
03:31:08,866 --> 03:31:10,367
[SPEAKER_49]: This is our lot layout plan.

2252
03:31:10,427 --> 03:31:17,448
[SPEAKER_49]: So we're showing a 50 foot wide proposed right away with a full cul-de-sac.

2253
03:31:18,689 --> 03:31:36,113
[SPEAKER_49]: We'll have eight conforming single family lots, no dimensional, they meet all the dimensional design requirements as far as lot frontage, lot width, lot area, conforming in all aspects.

2254
03:31:37,688 --> 03:31:38,789
[SPEAKER_49]: I'll go to the next slide.

2255
03:31:38,809 --> 03:31:45,114
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, this is our proposed site plan.

2256
03:31:45,975 --> 03:31:53,301
[SPEAKER_49]: So what we tried to do is we tried to show the footprint of the eight single-family homes that would be constructed.

2257
03:31:54,262 --> 03:31:58,266
[SPEAKER_49]: Each of the homes will have a paved driveway with a two-car garage.

2258
03:31:59,507 --> 03:32:03,690
[SPEAKER_49]: The reason we wanted to show the board how these footprints would go

2259
03:32:05,154 --> 03:32:07,756
[SPEAKER_49]: was really also to help us with the drainage design.

2260
03:32:07,796 --> 03:32:18,542
[SPEAKER_49]: We wanted to show basically how the as-built condition would look with the building structures, decks, driveways.

2261
03:32:20,063 --> 03:32:25,167
[SPEAKER_49]: On the subdivision itself, we're going to have a 30-foot wide paved travelway.

2262
03:32:26,267 --> 03:32:31,731
[SPEAKER_49]: We'd have a 5-foot wide concrete sidewalk on both sides of the roadway.

2263
03:32:34,208 --> 03:32:41,178
[SPEAKER_49]: We have street trees planted within the tree lawn area and we're showing a landscaped island.

2264
03:32:42,032 --> 03:32:43,494
[SPEAKER_49]: in the center of the cul-de-sac.

2265
03:32:44,334 --> 03:32:55,085
[SPEAKER_49]: We have provided, and later I'll have the traffic engineer talk on this, but we did provide how your largest fire truck could move through this development.

2266
03:32:55,645 --> 03:33:02,152
[SPEAKER_49]: In saying that, the landscape island, we did receive a memo from the fire chief.

2267
03:33:02,612 --> 03:33:03,373
[SPEAKER_49]: We were showing a 25-foot

2268
03:33:04,734 --> 03:33:07,255
[SPEAKER_49]: paved travelway around the island.

2269
03:33:07,895 --> 03:33:14,757
[SPEAKER_49]: He would rather see it consistent with the main body of the subdivision being a 30-foot paved travelway.

2270
03:33:15,357 --> 03:33:26,480
[SPEAKER_49]: So we will be making a reduction in the landscaped island going from a 30-foot diameter landscaped island down to a 20-foot diameter island to accommodate that request.

2271
03:33:27,920 --> 03:33:33,842
[SPEAKER_49]: Also, between lots 5 and 6, I had talked about in my opening,

2272
03:33:35,185 --> 03:33:44,012
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah, yeah, that we'd be maintaining the 12 foot right away that provides access to the 2 homes off of Winthrop Street.

2273
03:33:45,254 --> 03:33:47,235
[SPEAKER_49]: Presently, that right away is a gravel.

2274
03:33:47,936 --> 03:33:55,422
[SPEAKER_49]: Right away, the developers proposing to pave that and has been in discussions with those butters on that.

2275
03:33:55,963 --> 03:33:58,585
[SPEAKER_49]: Additionally, I'll talk more about it later, but.

2276
03:33:59,165 --> 03:34:10,355
[SPEAKER_49]: We have a construction plan that I'll be showing a little bit later, showing how we'll maintain access for those homeowners throughout construction of this development.

2277
03:34:11,896 --> 03:34:16,760
[SPEAKER_49]: Also, with this site plan, I should note there'd be vertical granite curbing throughout.

2278
03:34:19,243 --> 03:34:20,584
[SPEAKER_49]: And I can go to the next slide.

2279
03:34:23,806 --> 03:34:24,487
[SPEAKER_49]: And we can skip.

2280
03:34:24,907 --> 03:34:26,409
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, I can talk about this.

2281
03:34:27,336 --> 03:34:29,640
[SPEAKER_49]: This is the street plan and profile.

2282
03:34:31,764 --> 03:34:37,849
[SPEAKER_49]: This plan in the upper section basically shows how I'm laying out some of the street drainage.

2283
03:34:38,690 --> 03:34:43,774
[SPEAKER_49]: And I tried to have a creative design with the drainage.

2284
03:34:43,854 --> 03:34:47,537
[SPEAKER_49]: Typically, we look to put everything at a low point on the property.

2285
03:34:47,757 --> 03:34:51,800
[SPEAKER_49]: In doing that on this site, it would put water towards some of the abutters.

2286
03:34:51,901 --> 03:34:59,847
[SPEAKER_49]: So what I try to do is basically locate all my site drainage within the landscaped island and also

2287
03:35:01,325 --> 03:35:11,171
[SPEAKER_49]: as you come in the subdivision on the right-hand side, basically these would be underground precast concrete drainage units with crushed stone surrounding.

2288
03:35:11,771 --> 03:35:17,374
[SPEAKER_49]: I'd have a series of catch basins to capture stormwater runoff within the roadway.

2289
03:35:17,394 --> 03:35:26,820
[SPEAKER_49]: They'd have deep sumps, catch basins, they'd go to a storm scepter for treatment, and then they'd go to these precast concrete

2290
03:35:27,512 --> 03:35:31,917
[SPEAKER_49]: Structures for storage and then ultimately infiltration back into the ground.

2291
03:35:31,937 --> 03:35:34,620
[SPEAKER_49]: I can go to the next slide.

2292
03:35:37,243 --> 03:35:42,630
[SPEAKER_49]: So, this is more of an overall view of the site with that's okay.

2293
03:35:45,555 --> 03:35:58,943
[SPEAKER_49]: So, with each of the single family homes, the roof areas of each home would have stormwater collected and put into an individual subsurface drywall system on the lot.

2294
03:35:59,044 --> 03:36:04,027
[SPEAKER_49]: By doing that, we're able to reduce the size of the drainage requirements within the roadway.

2295
03:36:05,147 --> 03:36:10,754
[SPEAKER_49]: Um, I did have a good conversation and meeting with the city engineer on this.

2296
03:36:10,895 --> 03:36:14,759
[SPEAKER_49]: I submitted a 200 plus page drainage report.

2297
03:36:15,801 --> 03:36:18,885
[SPEAKER_49]: Um, I basically looked, you're basically looking at, like, a 9 inch.

2298
03:36:20,080 --> 03:36:29,962
[SPEAKER_49]: rainfall event for a 100 year storm and I'm tasked with balancing the pre-development stormwater runoff versus the post development stormwater runoff.

2299
03:36:31,143 --> 03:36:36,184
[SPEAKER_49]: In that report, I won't get into it tonight, but I did a very detailed analysis.

2300
03:36:36,364 --> 03:36:40,985
[SPEAKER_49]: Owen did do a review of it, the city engineer, and he felt it was very thorough and he

2301
03:36:41,565 --> 03:36:42,926
[SPEAKER_49]: he basically supported it.

2302
03:36:43,926 --> 03:36:52,109
[SPEAKER_49]: I didn't, as the planner stated, we didn't receive Wren comments stating that, but I did receive that verbally from him upon the review.

2303
03:36:52,129 --> 03:37:03,413
[SPEAKER_49]: There were two things he wanted changed and we'll get into that more, but we had showed a crosswalk from our subdivision across Franklin Avenue in a location

2304
03:37:05,327 --> 03:37:17,438
[SPEAKER_49]: Westerly on the down gradient side of our subdivision, there was comments that that should be relocated further to the east and we'll be making that change.

2305
03:37:18,199 --> 03:37:27,007
[SPEAKER_49]: And the city engineer also wanted to make sure that the water circulation within our subdivision, that the water wouldn't go stagnant.

2306
03:37:27,627 --> 03:37:34,189
[SPEAKER_49]: that there'd be enough use of this 8-inch water main that water would remain fresh and recirculate.

2307
03:37:34,709 --> 03:37:37,510
[SPEAKER_49]: I did provide those calculations to Owen today.

2308
03:37:38,671 --> 03:37:42,612
[SPEAKER_49]: He wanted to make sure water would at least circulate every 72 hours.

2309
03:37:43,032 --> 03:37:49,595
[SPEAKER_49]: It's going to circulate every 3 to 4 hours on the site, so there's no issue of water becoming stagnant.

2310
03:37:51,135 --> 03:37:56,097
[SPEAKER_49]: In a case with a dead-end road, sometimes there's a question about looping a water main to maintain

2311
03:37:56,757 --> 03:38:05,441
[SPEAKER_49]: that water circulation pattern, but in this case, a dead-end water main will work since we're less than 72 hours circulation.

2312
03:38:07,042 --> 03:38:08,362
[SPEAKER_49]: I'll go to the next page.

2313
03:38:08,923 --> 03:38:09,183
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay.

2314
03:38:10,512 --> 03:38:14,075
[SPEAKER_49]: This is our erosion and sediment control plan.

2315
03:38:14,596 --> 03:38:30,851
[SPEAKER_49]: Basically, this shows what we're going to put a stone construction entrance so that when dump trucks and machinery comes in, there'll be a stone area so that when their tires come in, no mud would then move back out to Franklin Avenue.

2316
03:38:31,271 --> 03:38:34,354
[SPEAKER_49]: We also show a 12 foot temporary

2317
03:38:35,635 --> 03:38:45,464
[SPEAKER_49]: gravel and crushed stone driveway that I talked about in my opening statements so that we continuously provide access to those two homes to the rear.

2318
03:38:45,484 --> 03:38:58,816
[SPEAKER_49]: We'll put up, not only construct the gravel driveway, but we'll have fencing to protect that driveway in the event of winter conditions.

2319
03:38:58,936 --> 03:39:00,957
[SPEAKER_49]: Snow would be removed from that driveway.

2320
03:39:01,730 --> 03:39:05,392
[SPEAKER_49]: those residents would always maintain access to those homes.

2321
03:39:05,412 --> 03:39:09,695
[SPEAKER_49]: There'd be no interruption to service even during construction of the subdivision.

2322
03:39:09,715 --> 03:39:16,060
[SPEAKER_49]: I think at this time, I'll turn things over to our traffic engineer.

2323
03:39:16,080 --> 03:39:26,727
[SPEAKER_49]: I know he has a brief presentation to present and then we'll turn it back over to the board and I'll gladly take any additional questions you might have tonight.

2324
03:39:27,607 --> 03:39:31,430
[SPEAKER_49]: At this time, I'll turn it over to Jeff from our traffic consultant.

2325
03:39:44,024 --> 03:39:47,527
[SPEAKER_38]: Is Jeff Dirk able to go back to the gallery?

2326
03:39:53,631 --> 03:39:54,472
[SPEAKER_39]: I've unmuted him.

2327
03:39:55,833 --> 03:39:56,914
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, thank you, Alicia.

2328
03:39:58,755 --> 03:40:01,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and good evening, Madam Chairman, members of the board.

2329
03:40:02,278 --> 03:40:06,481
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, Jeffrey Dirk with Van Nessen Associates, we're the transportation consultants on the project.

2330
03:40:07,302 --> 03:40:08,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think as you heard our

2331
03:40:09,678 --> 03:40:20,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Attorney mentioned we did prepare a transportation impact assessment for the project, which I can run through very quickly a high level summary of the findings of the assessment.

2332
03:40:21,928 --> 03:40:23,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathleen, you can go to the next slide please.

2333
03:40:25,551 --> 03:40:26,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just by way of our

2334
03:40:28,707 --> 03:40:34,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Findings as it relates to the study itself, we did conduct the analysis and consultation with the city.

2335
03:40:34,569 --> 03:40:45,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So we worked closely with Todd Blake, the city traffic engineer, as well as with the city engineer in particular relating to some comments that you heard Jack mentioning as they relate to the site plan and I'll speak.

2336
03:40:46,172 --> 03:40:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll spend a minute talking about how we've addressed each of those comments.

2337
03:40:50,694 --> 03:41:01,778
[SPEAKER_03]: But as it relates to the impact of the project with the eight single family homes that are proposed for this site, the project is going to produce less than 10 vehicle trips during the peak hours.

2338
03:41:02,378 --> 03:41:05,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's fewer than one additional vehicle every six minutes.

2339
03:41:05,322 --> 03:41:19,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we looked at the impact of that additional traffic on Franklin Street, on Winthrop Avenue, what we found was that the project didn't result in changes and delays to the extent that it would be noticeable to a motorist.

2340
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:31,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So, really what you'll see out there before and after the project, there will be additional traffic, but as you experience that traffic in terms of increased delays, you're not going to see a significant change.

2341
03:41:31,690 --> 03:41:38,596
[SPEAKER_03]: So, really, it's not impactful from the standpoint of additional traffic on the roadway network itself.

2342
03:41:39,316 --> 03:41:49,319
[SPEAKER_03]: We also did review motor vehicle crash history in the area in terms of looking at the number of crashes that are happening at any of the intersections in and around where the project site is located.

2343
03:41:49,800 --> 03:42:00,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did not find that there were any high crash locations, meaning that the number of crashes that were occurring was in relation to the volume of traffic going through the intersection.

2344
03:42:00,163 --> 03:42:05,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't disproportionate or unexpected based on the volume of traffic that goes through the intersections.

2345
03:42:06,305 --> 03:42:16,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, as it relates to the subdivision itself, we did look at lines of sight at the intersection of Bridle Path with Franklin and found that those sight lines are adequate.

2346
03:42:17,230 --> 03:42:23,053
[SPEAKER_03]: As you look at where the subdivision roadway comes out, you can see it's really right at kind of the apex of that curve.

2347
03:42:23,493 --> 03:42:28,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can clearly see in either direction as you're exiting the subdivision.

2348
03:42:28,396 --> 03:42:30,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We did make recommendations to

2349
03:42:31,658 --> 03:42:46,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Selectively trim and maintain vegetation in the site triangle areas just to make sure that I think as Jack is describing some plantings that will be associated with the project just to make sure that those plantings are appropriately located so that they don't inhibit site lines.

2350
03:42:46,936 --> 03:42:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide Kathleen please.

2351
03:42:51,602 --> 03:42:56,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So this slide just shows the location of the project site in relation to the roadway network.

2352
03:42:57,005 --> 03:43:01,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You can obviously see Medford High School to the right of where the subdivision is located.

2353
03:43:02,329 --> 03:43:07,932
[SPEAKER_03]: As Jack was mentioning, some of the construction that's occurring to the south of the site that shows up here as well.

2354
03:43:07,952 --> 03:43:15,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can see Winthrop Avenue basically traversing from northwest to southeast direction on the slide as well.

2355
03:43:15,657 --> 03:43:16,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, Kathleen.

2356
03:43:17,498 --> 03:43:17,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2357
03:43:18,578 --> 03:43:23,780
[SPEAKER_03]: This slide shows the existing roadway network and its context as it relates to the site.

2358
03:43:24,040 --> 03:43:28,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I really wanted to point out on this is the location of where sidewalks are.

2359
03:43:28,702 --> 03:43:32,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are where you see the orange dashed lines.

2360
03:43:32,903 --> 03:43:40,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you can see as it relates to the subdivision is that the sidewalk is continuous along the north side of Franklin Avenue.

2361
03:43:41,466 --> 03:43:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Jack was mentioning, some of the comments that we received from the city and the city traffic engineers about how to effectively provide a sidewalk to get from the bridal path subdivision over to the sidewalk along Franklin Avenue.

2362
03:43:56,678 --> 03:44:01,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So that connectivity, and I have a slide in a minute that will show what the resolution of that is.

2363
03:44:02,142 --> 03:44:07,346
[SPEAKER_03]: What you'll also see on this slide is that along Winthrop Street, there are marked bomb

2364
03:44:07,986 --> 03:44:09,807
[SPEAKER_03]: bike lanes in both directions.

2365
03:44:10,427 --> 03:44:11,607
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a bus route.

2366
03:44:11,647 --> 03:44:16,429
[SPEAKER_03]: The MBTA provides bus service along Winthrop Street.

2367
03:44:17,049 --> 03:44:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are really amenities as it relates to the residents of the project as we're looking at trying to encourage alternative modes of transportation.

2368
03:44:23,832 --> 03:44:25,872
[SPEAKER_03]: We have bus service within walking distance.

2369
03:44:25,912 --> 03:44:27,733
[SPEAKER_03]: We have sidewalks and we have bicycle lanes.

2370
03:44:27,753 --> 03:44:32,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are all good things in terms of looking at reducing traffic associated with the project.

2371
03:44:32,955 --> 03:44:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide please.

2372
03:44:35,163 --> 03:44:38,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So this slide shows the amount of traffic that we expect the project is going to produce.

2373
03:44:39,484 --> 03:44:43,245
[SPEAKER_03]: The large number that you see at the top, that's the 24-hour number.

2374
03:44:43,305 --> 03:44:51,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you stood at the end of Bridal Path and counted every vehicle that goes in and out, the project would produce about 100 vehicle trips, half in, half out.

2375
03:44:51,767 --> 03:44:52,567
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everything.

2376
03:44:52,647 --> 03:44:57,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It's FedEx, UPS, Amazon delivery trucks, as well as the residents.

2377
03:44:57,288 --> 03:44:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all built into that number.

2378
03:44:59,809 --> 03:45:05,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The next two numbers as you're looking at the total column, the seven and the nine, those are the peak hour numbers.

2379
03:45:05,672 --> 03:45:14,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So one hour in the morning when traffic levels are at their highest level, the project will produce about seven additional vehicles on the roadway network.

2380
03:45:15,558 --> 03:45:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next number, the nine, is the amount of traffic that we produce during the evening peak hour.

2381
03:45:20,681 --> 03:45:21,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's nine.

2382
03:45:21,401 --> 03:45:22,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I was saying

2383
03:45:22,962 --> 03:45:32,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fewer than 10 added vehicle trips over the course of an hour, so that level of impact is not considered significant in terms of increasing delays at intersections.

2384
03:45:32,581 --> 03:45:33,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.

2385
03:45:35,038 --> 03:45:37,379
[SPEAKER_03]: This slide just shows the dispersal of that traffic.

2386
03:45:37,399 --> 03:45:41,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So, once it leaves the subdivision, how does it relate itself onto the roadway network?

2387
03:45:42,241 --> 03:45:47,984
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see here really is the bulk of the traffic is oriented to and from the South along Winthrop Avenue.

2388
03:45:48,024 --> 03:45:48,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 75%.

2389
03:45:49,145 --> 03:45:54,687
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the traffic is distributed between Osborne and Winthrop to and from the North.

2390
03:45:55,327 --> 03:45:56,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, Kathleen.

2391
03:45:58,121 --> 03:46:01,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we have a series of recommendations as they relate to the transportation assessment.

2392
03:46:02,484 --> 03:46:05,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack has incorporated these all into the site plans themselves.

2393
03:46:06,066 --> 03:46:14,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as it relates to access and circulation, what was mentioned is we have a 30 foot wide paved traveled way, which is more than sufficient for two way travel.

2394
03:46:15,993 --> 03:46:23,718
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll speak to a minute as to why that width is important as it relates to the subdivision layout and does have to do with the fire truck circulation itself.

2395
03:46:25,279 --> 03:46:36,366
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the recommendation deal with signs and markings within the development, which you would expect stop sign coming out of the development, making sure everything's compliant with both state and federal requirements.

2396
03:46:37,146 --> 03:46:47,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last 2 recommendations deal with just making sure that the site lines that are provided at the Braille path Franklin intersection are adequate for the safe operation of the intersection.

2397
03:46:47,819 --> 03:46:48,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide Kathleen.

2398
03:46:50,535 --> 03:46:52,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're looking at kind of the recommendations.

2399
03:46:52,617 --> 03:46:59,182
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that we submitted today in response to comments from the city engineer and the city traffic engineer.

2400
03:46:59,622 --> 03:47:19,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Jack was talking about the crosswalk locations, if you look at this slide and then just kind of compare it to what you saw in the subdivision plans, what was requested is that the crosswalk to get across from Bridal Path to the sidewalk along Franklin Avenue, that that crossing occurred basically at the Franklin Bridal Path

2401
03:47:19,917 --> 03:47:28,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Headland way location so you can see the crossing there diagonally going across the intersection that's where the city traffic engineer would like it to be.

2402
03:47:28,747 --> 03:47:36,056
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 of the changes that he requested is that we do the ladder type or continental type of crosswalk marking.

2403
03:47:36,076 --> 03:47:37,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically the lines.

2404
03:47:38,498 --> 03:47:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than two parallel lines, you have the longitudinal lines in the crosswalk.

2405
03:47:42,521 --> 03:47:45,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that will be a change that we'll be making as well.

2406
03:47:45,922 --> 03:47:57,049
[SPEAKER_03]: You also see a crossing across bridle path to get from one side of the sidewalk on one side to the sidewalk on the other side, which would then get you to that crossing over to Franklin Avenue.

2407
03:47:58,629 --> 03:47:59,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide Kathleen.

2408
03:48:02,439 --> 03:48:14,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the next slides, we can go through them very quickly, but in working with the fire department, we have performed a turning analysis for the 2 largest fire trucks that are typically used in the city.

2409
03:48:15,422 --> 03:48:22,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is the ladder truck, which is non-articulated, showing that it can circulate within the development itself.

2410
03:48:22,884 --> 03:48:29,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why this 30 foot roadway width is important because given the short length of the cul-de-sac or the short length of bridle path,

2411
03:48:30,426 --> 03:48:33,707
[SPEAKER_03]: we need the full width of that dimension there for that truck to circulate.

2412
03:48:34,107 --> 03:48:39,868
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that it also maneuvers within the cul-de-sac area and that it stays within the paved travel way.

2413
03:48:40,108 --> 03:48:46,890
[SPEAKER_03]: The fire department has reviewed this and confirmed that the fire truck or this truck can actually make all of the maneuvers within the site.

2414
03:48:47,830 --> 03:48:54,391
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also run the fire truck going down to those two abutting properties or the two properties that have access by way of bridle path.

2415
03:48:54,791 --> 03:48:55,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 55 and 53 Winthrop.

2416
03:48:58,092 --> 03:49:05,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We have also run the fire truck to make sure it can get from bridle path down that easement and over to those two homes as well.

2417
03:49:05,537 --> 03:49:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide Kathleen, please.

2418
03:49:08,758 --> 03:49:10,779
[SPEAKER_03]: This slide shows that connection.

2419
03:49:10,819 --> 03:49:14,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the ladder truck using that access easement to get to those two properties.

2420
03:49:16,423 --> 03:49:17,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.

2421
03:49:18,866 --> 03:49:22,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last two slides are the largest fire truck that the city has.

2422
03:49:22,367 --> 03:49:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the articulated trucker, what's known as a hook and ladder.

2423
03:49:26,108 --> 03:49:28,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So this truck pivots and has a driver at the backside.

2424
03:49:29,149 --> 03:49:30,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be the largest vehicle.

2425
03:49:30,969 --> 03:49:39,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it's the largest vehicle, it's also generally more maneuverable because of the fact that the wheels on the rear turn independent of the wheels on the front.

2426
03:49:39,271 --> 03:49:40,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why you have the driver in the back.

2427
03:49:41,272 --> 03:49:45,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can actually make a tighter turn than, in some instances, the ladder truck.

2428
03:49:46,553 --> 03:49:49,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've run that vehicle as well, and you can see the same situation.

2429
03:49:49,796 --> 03:49:56,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It can maneuver through the subdivision around the cul-de-sac without traversing or going over any of the curb lines.

2430
03:49:56,983 --> 03:49:59,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide.

2431
03:49:59,906 --> 03:50:06,912
[SPEAKER_03]: This slide shows the same vehicle using the path to get to those other two properties off of Winthrop Avenue.

2432
03:50:07,213 --> 03:50:09,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, Kathleen, that may be the last slide I have.

2433
03:50:12,130 --> 03:50:15,113
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, I think that's the revision that we made.

2434
03:50:15,193 --> 03:50:16,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I appreciate you doing that.

2435
03:50:16,895 --> 03:50:20,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you, Madam Chair, and certainly available to answer any questions the board may have.

2436
03:50:23,534 --> 03:50:25,815
[SPEAKER_38]: So, in addition, oh, thank you.

2437
03:50:26,095 --> 03:50:34,240
[SPEAKER_38]: So, in addition to that, we also wanted to show the board so they could get a sense as to what the types of houses would be that would be located on the site.

2438
03:50:34,280 --> 03:50:43,525
[SPEAKER_38]: And essentially, we have 3 models here, the colonial style that would show what's anticipated to be placed on those lots.

2439
03:50:43,945 --> 03:50:56,467
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, all of the homes will have a two-car garage, which will meet the requirement of two parking spaces for each single-family dwelling.

2440
03:50:56,607 --> 03:51:02,088
[SPEAKER_38]: There won't be a need for exterior parking, so the parking will be tucked within the garages.

2441
03:51:04,109 --> 03:51:10,970
[SPEAKER_38]: And that concludes our presentation, and we're available to take questions from you on this.

2442
03:51:13,582 --> 03:51:23,790
[SPEAKER_43]: just going to, if you can actually stop sharing your screen.

2443
03:51:23,870 --> 03:51:24,831
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2444
03:51:34,294 --> 03:51:47,199
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to open it up to the board for questions, but a couple of questions that I have first and foremost is to the city and just where we're at with other department comments.

2445
03:51:47,559 --> 03:51:58,803
[SPEAKER_43]: I know we're opening up for public hearing to stop the public hearing process, but also just if we can circle back and get some more information from the city on where you stand with

2446
03:51:59,617 --> 03:52:08,739
[SPEAKER_43]: there's discussions of easement, there's discussion of the waivers, and just there's so much information here that we don't have.

2447
03:52:10,819 --> 03:52:14,540
[SPEAKER_43]: So that's just, I think that will cut down on some of the questions going forward.

2448
03:52:18,841 --> 03:52:28,423
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, Madam Chair, basically the question about the stagnant water and whether they needed the,

2449
03:52:29,972 --> 03:52:36,735
[SPEAKER_44]: the water loop, the issues with the crosswalk location, the sidewalks.

2450
03:52:37,096 --> 03:52:39,217
[SPEAKER_44]: So those all need to be updated.

2451
03:52:39,897 --> 03:52:51,843
[SPEAKER_44]: And the plans, there was one lot that I had identified as potentially not meeting lot depth.

2452
03:52:53,704 --> 03:52:57,246
[SPEAKER_44]: Attorney Desmond, did you look into that to determine whether it met it or not?

2453
03:52:57,266 --> 03:52:59,387
[SPEAKER_44]: Because I was just kind of scaling it off.

2454
03:53:00,269 --> 03:53:00,930
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, we did.

2455
03:53:01,010 --> 03:53:08,756
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if you want me to share my screen again to show the plan, and then Jack Sullivan can speak to that issue.

2456
03:53:08,776 --> 03:53:12,219
[SPEAKER_38]: Let me just get here.

2457
03:53:12,239 --> 03:53:18,305
[SPEAKER_38]: If I can go back up to plans.

2458
03:53:20,206 --> 03:53:21,487
[SPEAKER_38]: So where's the best place, Jack?

2459
03:53:22,868 --> 03:53:26,009
[SPEAKER_38]: I think this is probably the best plan to look at.

2460
03:53:26,209 --> 03:53:32,692
[SPEAKER_49]: I think the question was lot eight, which is when you come in the subdivision, it's the first lot on the right-hand side.

2461
03:53:33,992 --> 03:53:47,958
[SPEAKER_49]: The way we looked at the lot depth, we took the front setback requirement, which is 15 feet, and you need a depth of at least 55 feet, and we have well more than that along the bridal path.

2462
03:53:48,943 --> 03:53:49,343
[SPEAKER_49]: area.

2463
03:53:49,363 --> 03:53:57,725
[SPEAKER_49]: So we don't see that, we don't see an issue with the lot depth on that at all, if that's how it's calculated.

2464
03:53:58,045 --> 03:54:00,566
[SPEAKER_49]: And the building inspected in, bring it up in his review.

2465
03:54:02,086 --> 03:54:03,687
[SPEAKER_38]: What's the measurement?

2466
03:54:04,807 --> 03:54:15,570
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think, Danielle, the ordinance reads that for the span of the width, which the requirement in this instance is 50 feet, that you need to have 55

2467
03:54:18,276 --> 03:54:23,899
[SPEAKER_38]: need of depth and in that this portion of the lot clearly needs that.

2468
03:54:24,099 --> 03:54:28,642
[SPEAKER_38]: This is well over the 55 required for width on the lot.

2469
03:54:28,822 --> 03:54:29,903
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

2470
03:54:29,923 --> 03:54:35,566
[SPEAKER_38]: We can update on the plan for the next meeting so that we can show specifically what that is.

2471
03:54:35,586 --> 03:54:45,572
[SPEAKER_44]: I would like to see the specific number because when I was scaling it off, I remember whatever I was calculating, it was close.

2472
03:54:46,813 --> 03:54:47,073
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

2473
03:54:48,485 --> 03:54:49,966
[SPEAKER_38]: We can do that for the next meeting.

2474
03:54:52,666 --> 03:54:54,427
[SPEAKER_44]: And Madam Chair, I'll bring up one other issue there.

2475
03:54:54,467 --> 03:54:56,248
[SPEAKER_44]: So there's the easement.

2476
03:54:56,688 --> 03:55:03,530
[SPEAKER_44]: So there's the adjacent subdivision, Winford, I actually don't know what it's called.

2477
03:55:03,550 --> 03:55:05,911
[SPEAKER_44]: Is it Winford Way or something?

2478
03:55:07,531 --> 03:55:14,894
[SPEAKER_44]: There's an easement that was relocated that also provides access to those two homes that are not on,

2479
03:55:16,923 --> 03:55:20,444
[SPEAKER_44]: existing, like right or any type of private way.

2480
03:55:21,365 --> 03:55:36,050
[SPEAKER_44]: And there was concern from the building commissioner that it hasn't been, you know, open and clear for these folks to always be able to access.

2481
03:55:36,450 --> 03:55:41,592
[SPEAKER_44]: So he was concerned that if during construction, if the easement

2482
03:55:43,478 --> 03:55:48,979
[SPEAKER_44]: that would be relocated within bridal path to make sure that was always unobstructed.

2483
03:55:50,459 --> 03:56:05,703
[SPEAKER_44]: No staging of materials, no mounds of gravel, or those kind of things that would obstruct access in light of the problems with the other easement.

2484
03:56:08,703 --> 03:56:11,264
[SPEAKER_38]: And Danielle, we did, when we went through the,

2485
03:56:12,934 --> 03:56:14,775
[SPEAKER_38]: the slides show.

2486
03:56:15,215 --> 03:56:15,976
[SPEAKER_38]: Am I too far?

2487
03:56:17,497 --> 03:56:17,677
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.

2488
03:56:18,037 --> 03:56:21,979
[SPEAKER_38]: So the current easement runs from here.

2489
03:56:22,019 --> 03:56:23,560
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the actual written easement.

2490
03:56:23,880 --> 03:56:29,043
[SPEAKER_38]: The actual path of the easement that's used is different than what is in the deed reference.

2491
03:56:29,543 --> 03:56:35,066
[SPEAKER_38]: But what's going to happen during construction is this portion will remain open.

2492
03:56:35,887 --> 03:56:37,628
[SPEAKER_38]: So there will be an easement out.

2493
03:56:37,948 --> 03:56:39,609
[SPEAKER_38]: And we understand and we recognize

2494
03:56:40,109 --> 03:56:50,535
[SPEAKER_38]: that there have been issues with the development down below and their access, but we do intend to, and we're willing to submit a construction plan to the board so that they are aware of it.

2495
03:56:50,575 --> 03:56:57,619
[SPEAKER_38]: But this will travel the length of the easement until Bridal Pathway is open.

2496
03:56:58,219 --> 03:57:09,503
[SPEAKER_38]: And then what we're seeking, and we had a preliminary discussion, we met with the abutters out at the site, we showed them the construction plan, and then we kind of showed them what the path would be.

2497
03:57:10,204 --> 03:57:12,945
[SPEAKER_38]: So once Bridal Path becomes

2498
03:57:14,042 --> 03:57:21,264
[SPEAKER_38]: a roadway, they then will share access along Bridal Path, which is certainly better for both emergency vehicles and also for them.

2499
03:57:21,284 --> 03:57:24,966
[SPEAKER_38]: So they'll have access to Bridal Path with the other homeowners.

2500
03:57:25,726 --> 03:57:37,310
[SPEAKER_38]: And then they will continue to have their easement, which starts here, the 12-foot right-of-way, which would sort of act as what a driveway would for the current owners.

2501
03:57:37,970 --> 03:57:40,971
[SPEAKER_38]: And we've agreed to pave that piece as well.

2502
03:57:41,671 --> 03:57:43,052
[SPEAKER_38]: So they would have a paved

2503
03:57:43,938 --> 03:57:51,466
[SPEAKER_38]: driveway, they would use Bridal Path Road to access their home, and then this would also be paved once the street is finished.

2504
03:57:52,146 --> 03:58:05,260
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition, just so that we're all on the same page, this home, which is 41 Franklin, will also have the ability to share in access to Bridal Path Road once it's constructed.

2505
03:58:11,522 --> 03:58:13,766
[SPEAKER_44]: So that's how the mechanics of that easement will work.

2506
03:58:14,547 --> 03:58:18,634
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so they'll need to be like a construction sequencing plan that would be approved.

2507
03:58:19,957 --> 03:58:22,221
[SPEAKER_44]: And then the other remaining item was.

2508
03:58:23,898 --> 03:58:32,042
[SPEAKER_44]: Chief Evans' comments about whether he could get the truck around the landscaped island if there were parked cars.

2509
03:58:32,582 --> 03:58:50,912
[SPEAKER_44]: So it looks like you were reducing it, but I might've missed it, but were you gonna have like no parking in the section of the cul-de-sac or are you pretty confident that whatever treatment you have at that landscaped island that the fire truck could clear?

2510
03:58:52,032 --> 03:59:04,759
[SPEAKER_38]: So I had an exchange of emails today with Chief Evans, and currently you'll see on the plan that the cul-de-sac is 25 feet around cul-de-sac diameter.

2511
03:59:05,840 --> 03:59:08,581
[SPEAKER_38]: In discussions, he would prefer that that remain at 30 feet.

2512
03:59:08,681 --> 03:59:10,642
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're going to reduce the island.

2513
03:59:11,303 --> 03:59:16,385
[SPEAKER_38]: So the island will be reduced to 20 feet in diameter, and that will give him 30 feet

2514
03:59:17,986 --> 03:59:20,447
[SPEAKER_38]: around the cul-de-sac.

2515
03:59:20,767 --> 03:59:26,208
[SPEAKER_38]: The parking issue, as you know, it's a private way, as is Franklin, as is Headway.

2516
03:59:26,928 --> 03:59:35,210
[SPEAKER_38]: So enforcement is difficult in terms of parking, to say the least, both for the city and also for homeowners.

2517
03:59:35,810 --> 03:59:41,632
[SPEAKER_38]: But he was comfortable with the 30-foot, and, you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I did have that exchange with him today.

2518
03:59:41,952 --> 03:59:45,733
[SPEAKER_38]: He's comfortable if we reduce that island to 20 feet diameter.

2519
03:59:46,253 --> 03:59:48,936
[SPEAKER_38]: so it gives him 30 feet all the way around the cul-de-sac.

2520
04:00:02,592 --> 04:00:03,693
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you Attorney Desmond.

2521
04:00:03,713 --> 04:00:04,334
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to

2522
04:00:06,231 --> 04:00:13,793
[SPEAKER_43]: actually open it up to board comments now before going to, actually this is, yeah, for board comments or questions.

2523
04:00:13,933 --> 04:00:23,995
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't have anything further because I'm not exactly sure what to ask at this point because there seems to be conversations between the city and the proponent that has not been shared with the board.

2524
04:00:24,055 --> 04:00:26,915
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm not sure what's before us here.

2525
04:00:27,855 --> 04:00:30,136
[SPEAKER_43]: Does any of the board have any questions?

2526
04:00:35,830 --> 04:00:36,870
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice-chair Emily Henneman?

2527
04:00:37,290 --> 04:00:38,431
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, we've got a question.

2528
04:00:40,051 --> 04:00:48,434
[SPEAKER_35]: Two questions, kind of zooming out in a larger context.

2529
04:00:49,074 --> 04:00:56,557
[SPEAKER_35]: We're mentioning another development that is adjacent to this, which obviously is a different developer, different landowner.

2530
04:00:58,517 --> 04:00:59,918
[SPEAKER_35]: They have no control over what you do.

2531
04:00:59,938 --> 04:01:01,278
[SPEAKER_35]: You have no control over what they do.

2532
04:01:01,378 --> 04:01:02,999
[SPEAKER_35]: But I'd be really interested in,

2533
04:01:04,184 --> 04:01:06,119
[SPEAKER_35]: Kind of seeing how these two

2534
04:01:08,622 --> 04:01:15,606
[SPEAKER_35]: uh, these two subdivisions kind of, like, interlock, um, just to investigate if there's any connections that can be drawn between the two.

2535
04:01:15,626 --> 04:01:34,317
[SPEAKER_35]: And then, uh, outside of that neighborhood, um, the Medford High School is right around the corner, and, um, you know, these are wonderful single-family homes, um, which, you know, may not be the highest and best use of land in Medford, but this is what the zoning allows, and there is a demand for single-family housing.

2536
04:01:34,337 --> 04:01:34,377
[SPEAKER_35]: So,

2537
04:01:36,168 --> 04:01:56,850
[SPEAKER_35]: you know, maybe families will live there, maybe teachers will live there, who knows, but it would be really great if there was a way for the residents of Bridal Path to easily access the high school, whether it's, you know, kind of like a little nature trail or, or like a little path, just something that kind of connects the two

2538
04:01:57,590 --> 04:02:05,352
[SPEAKER_35]: the two things together, this wonderful neighborhood and, you know, the educational institution that is Medford High School.

2539
04:02:05,672 --> 04:02:09,413
[SPEAKER_35]: So, I guess those are more comments than questions at this point.

2540
04:02:13,774 --> 04:02:19,116
[SPEAKER_38]: If you would like me to respond, um, with respect to- The chair is okay with that.

2541
04:02:19,136 --> 04:02:20,336
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, okay.

2542
04:02:20,376 --> 04:02:20,896
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, please.

2543
04:02:21,296 --> 04:02:22,637
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, this is for the board.

2544
04:02:24,994 --> 04:02:34,016
[SPEAKER_38]: We have had some discussions with regard to the two developments.

2545
04:02:34,656 --> 04:02:38,157
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't believe at this point that that easement is a throughway.

2546
04:02:38,738 --> 04:02:47,920
[SPEAKER_38]: And at that point, I think you'd be overburdening the easement to have the traffic coming from Winthrop Street out into this particular subdivision.

2547
04:02:49,020 --> 04:02:52,642
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm not sure that that could be integrated easily.

2548
04:02:53,582 --> 04:03:11,290
[SPEAKER_35]: Just to clarify, I don't mean like a road, just like any sort of connections, whether it's landscape or visual or because kids are kids, families are families, they're going to cut through people's yards no matter what.

2549
04:03:11,310 --> 04:03:16,633
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think that there should be roads connecting these two, but maybe just some

2550
04:03:20,304 --> 04:03:23,867
[SPEAKER_35]: just to help the board visualize how these two connect together.

2551
04:03:23,927 --> 04:03:26,068
[SPEAKER_35]: But totally get it.

2552
04:03:27,149 --> 04:03:28,250
[SPEAKER_35]: You can't control what they do.

2553
04:03:28,310 --> 04:03:29,611
[SPEAKER_35]: They don't control what you do.

2554
04:03:29,731 --> 04:03:33,614
[SPEAKER_35]: And that's how land works in the country.

2555
04:03:34,996 --> 04:03:35,316
[SPEAKER_38]: All right.

2556
04:03:35,336 --> 04:03:39,919
[SPEAKER_38]: And there's also the benefit that the two abutters, I don't know that they would

2557
04:03:42,170 --> 04:03:44,552
[SPEAKER_38]: want something like that that connectivity either.

2558
04:03:45,292 --> 04:04:05,046
[SPEAKER_38]: With respect to the the private way we have had with the path we have had discussions with city staff about that and there's quite honest well my client and I've conveyed this and also the owner of the property had submitted a letter to

2559
04:04:06,655 --> 04:04:10,396
[SPEAKER_38]: to staff about that particular situation.

2560
04:04:10,456 --> 04:04:26,182
[SPEAKER_38]: First, from my client's perspective, the rules and regulations don't provide anything that I can see that allows for that, and subdivisions are controlled by the rules and regulations.

2561
04:04:26,642 --> 04:04:35,025
[SPEAKER_38]: And also, if this were to be the case, it would be a public dedication and not

2562
04:04:35,607 --> 04:04:45,400
[SPEAKER_38]: a private dedication because any path that you created, you'd be putting the onus of it on one particular homeowner.

2563
04:04:46,601 --> 04:04:47,983
[SPEAKER_38]: And the statute's very clear.

2564
04:04:50,673 --> 04:05:01,040
[SPEAKER_38]: 81Q, that any public dedication of property requires just compensation to the owner for that dedication.

2565
04:05:01,600 --> 04:05:16,049
[SPEAKER_38]: The Conners have had some experience with that over the years and with first kids coming through to and from the high school, it devolved to motorcycles traveling the path.

2566
04:05:16,942 --> 04:05:26,286
[SPEAKER_38]: And there had been parties, because if you look at the back of that area, there's a large field area adjacent to this particular development.

2567
04:05:26,646 --> 04:05:31,028
[SPEAKER_38]: And it was, you know, a place where parties often occurred.

2568
04:05:31,048 --> 04:05:33,809
[SPEAKER_38]: There's also connections to the fells.

2569
04:05:34,590 --> 04:05:44,494
[SPEAKER_38]: And I questioned the city at the point as to whether that's something the school would even want to have, given the fact that, you know, trying to limit access

2570
04:05:45,196 --> 04:05:47,877
[SPEAKER_38]: to school property and hardening concerns.

2571
04:05:47,937 --> 04:05:54,641
[SPEAKER_38]: But I haven't had any conversations with anyone I haven't heard as to whether or not that's something that they would invite.

2572
04:05:55,041 --> 04:05:58,142
[SPEAKER_38]: But I think it would certainly be a concern.

2573
04:05:58,963 --> 04:06:05,166
[SPEAKER_38]: And then there's the liability issues in terms of because someone would have to maintain that pedestrian path.

2574
04:06:06,126 --> 04:06:07,407
[SPEAKER_38]: It would have to be insured.

2575
04:06:09,705 --> 04:06:21,510
[SPEAKER_38]: In theory, it sounds like a good idea, but when you kind of put together what can occur, who's going to be responsible for it, if it's a public dedication,

2576
04:06:22,078 --> 04:06:23,758
[SPEAKER_38]: Does the city take control of it?

2577
04:06:24,679 --> 04:06:26,359
[SPEAKER_38]: You also have two private ways.

2578
04:06:26,779 --> 04:06:35,682
[SPEAKER_38]: So there's a question as to whether the city could take that because it's off of Franklin, which is a private way and bridal path.

2579
04:06:36,142 --> 04:06:38,342
[SPEAKER_38]: So we have given it some thought.

2580
04:06:38,742 --> 04:06:42,363
[SPEAKER_38]: We have spoke with the current owners of the property who are against it.

2581
04:06:42,403 --> 04:06:46,865
[SPEAKER_38]: And that letter should be in the file based on their experience.

2582
04:06:48,445 --> 04:06:54,068
[SPEAKER_38]: I experienced and they have lived at the property for 60 years and operated the stable for a period of time.

2583
04:06:55,268 --> 04:06:55,548
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2584
04:06:55,568 --> 04:06:56,168
[SPEAKER_35]: I appreciate that.

2585
04:06:56,649 --> 04:06:56,789
[SPEAKER_38]: Chair.

2586
04:07:04,805 --> 04:07:08,928
[SPEAKER_29]: If I may say, I am not feeling well, and I'm having a hard time focusing.

2587
04:07:08,988 --> 04:07:12,231
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think at this point, I need to recuse myself and go to sleep.

2588
04:07:13,212 --> 04:07:16,014
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't feel that I can substantively vote on this.

2589
04:07:16,854 --> 04:07:21,078
[SPEAKER_29]: So I don't know if you want to do anything with that, or if I should just leave.

2590
04:07:21,338 --> 04:07:21,858
[SPEAKER_29]: Sorry, guys.

2591
04:07:22,338 --> 04:07:23,840
[SPEAKER_29]: I think there's still quorum without me.

2592
04:07:23,860 --> 04:07:26,602
[SPEAKER_43]: I think we do have quorum.

2593
04:07:27,502 --> 04:07:27,863
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2594
04:07:27,903 --> 04:07:30,084
[SPEAKER_43]: But I do have to open up to public comment.

2595
04:07:30,445 --> 04:07:31,706
[SPEAKER_43]: And we're not voting this evening.

2596
04:07:32,826 --> 04:07:33,427
[SPEAKER_43]: We will vote

2597
04:07:33,860 --> 04:07:42,063
[SPEAKER_43]: most likely to continue our, there's no vote being received tonight, but I hope you feel better.

2598
04:07:42,423 --> 04:07:47,245
[SPEAKER_43]: And we do have a we have a quorum to move it forward.

2599
04:07:48,545 --> 04:07:49,105
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks so much.

2600
04:07:49,205 --> 04:07:52,447
[SPEAKER_29]: And thank you, Madam Chair for your service on this committee.

2601
04:07:52,467 --> 04:07:53,087
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll miss you.

2602
04:07:53,787 --> 04:07:54,727
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much.

2603
04:07:55,027 --> 04:07:55,928
[SPEAKER_43]: Have a great evening.

2604
04:07:56,348 --> 04:07:57,228
[SPEAKER_43]: Director Hunt?

2605
04:08:04,583 --> 04:08:18,232
[SPEAKER_39]: Madam Chair, as you're moving to public comment, I actually have something that I was asked to convey for public comment and maybe I can go between the board and the public, if that's appropriate.

2606
04:08:23,515 --> 04:08:26,997
[SPEAKER_43]: Is it conveying from the city or from on behalf of the city or?

2607
04:08:27,738 --> 04:08:29,539
[SPEAKER_39]: Actually from a member of the school committee.

2608
04:08:31,703 --> 04:08:33,725
[SPEAKER_39]: Because this is an adjacent to the schools.

2609
04:08:34,285 --> 04:08:48,394
[SPEAKER_39]: I, they wanted to convey that make sure that the property owner is aware that the city and the schools together are undertaking a redevelopment of Medford high school that they expect has the potential to be fairly disruptive.

2610
04:08:49,154 --> 04:08:54,862
[SPEAKER_39]: and that that field next to them might become a significant part of a construction project.

2611
04:08:55,963 --> 04:09:02,071
[SPEAKER_39]: It's too early to know what piece, whether that's a lay down area or a place where construction actually occurs.

2612
04:09:02,812 --> 04:09:06,937
[SPEAKER_39]: But they wanted the applicants to know this early, and I actually did give them

2613
04:09:07,898 --> 04:09:13,221
[SPEAKER_39]: is Desmond's direct email address in case they decided to reach out directly about that.

2614
04:09:13,922 --> 04:09:20,446
[SPEAKER_39]: But I thought that it was appropriate to actually also share that information with the board in case any members of the board were not aware.

2615
04:09:21,306 --> 04:09:27,130
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm actively working with that committee, so I do have as much information as the public does right now.

2616
04:09:31,472 --> 04:09:32,393
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Director Holt.

2617
04:09:34,116 --> 04:09:38,440
[SPEAKER_43]: All right, I see some eager members of the public for it.

2618
04:09:38,480 --> 04:09:43,945
[SPEAKER_43]: Let me just read the notice, and then we will start calling on the public for public comments.

2619
04:09:45,227 --> 04:09:46,948
[SPEAKER_43]: I will now open a public comment period.

2620
04:09:46,988 --> 04:09:53,915
[SPEAKER_43]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you are having technical difficulties.

2621
04:09:53,935 --> 04:09:56,497
[SPEAKER_43]: You can also send an email to OCDEdMethod.

2622
04:09:59,322 --> 04:10:02,804
[SPEAKER_43]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

2623
04:10:02,924 --> 04:10:12,812
[SPEAKER_43]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as it is not part of the public record.

2624
04:10:13,113 --> 04:10:19,218
[SPEAKER_43]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message staff for assistance.

2625
04:10:19,438 --> 04:10:21,199
[SPEAKER_43]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak.

2626
04:10:25,082 --> 04:10:25,603
[SPEAKER_43]: Let's see.

2627
04:10:27,633 --> 04:10:29,494
[SPEAKER_43]: Alicia and Danielle, can you please manage?

2628
04:10:29,875 --> 04:10:31,296
[SPEAKER_43]: I can handle public comment for you.

2629
04:10:32,116 --> 04:10:41,623
[SPEAKER_43]: And I do know that Michael McCamey's hand was up first and then Maria Bruno-Ruiz.

2630
04:10:41,643 --> 04:10:43,645
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.

2631
04:10:44,185 --> 04:10:44,946
[SPEAKER_39]: Michael McCamey.

2632
04:10:51,628 --> 04:10:51,849
[SPEAKER_51]: Hello.

2633
04:10:52,149 --> 04:10:55,995
[SPEAKER_51]: Hi, I'm Shreya and Mike 555 Winthrop Street.

2634
04:10:56,015 --> 04:10:58,057
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the ones on the easement.

2635
04:10:58,799 --> 04:11:03,685
[SPEAKER_51]: The Director Butters and we're speaking on behalf of both 555 and 553 Winthrop Street, both the Butters.

2636
04:11:08,918 --> 04:11:15,280
[SPEAKER_51]: basically accessing from either Winthrop Street or Franklin has been a huge problem for both our houses.

2637
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:17,440
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm not talking Uber, DoorDash, FedEx.

2638
04:11:17,560 --> 04:11:19,220
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm talking emergency vehicles.

2639
04:11:19,280 --> 04:11:20,261
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm talking ambulance.

2640
04:11:20,681 --> 04:11:21,781
[SPEAKER_51]: Our neighbor was having a baby.

2641
04:11:21,801 --> 04:11:22,921
[SPEAKER_51]: She had a complication.

2642
04:11:22,941 --> 04:11:26,502
[SPEAKER_51]: Her husband was flagging down the ambulance on Winthrop Street.

2643
04:11:26,862 --> 04:11:36,024
[SPEAKER_51]: During this conversation, we've heard multiple times being mentioned the brittle path or bridal path is cul-de-sac, dead end, cul-de-sac.

2644
04:11:36,264 --> 04:11:38,545
[SPEAKER_51]: We are extremely concerned that

2645
04:11:39,305 --> 04:11:41,807
[SPEAKER_51]: emergency vehicles are not going to be able to find our house.

2646
04:11:42,707 --> 04:11:47,870
[SPEAKER_51]: We are extremely concerned that there are no signs that say this is connecting to Winthrop Street.

2647
04:11:48,270 --> 04:11:51,792
[SPEAKER_51]: We're repeatedly hearing dead end cul-de-sac.

2648
04:11:52,093 --> 04:11:56,615
[SPEAKER_51]: We've communicated this multiple times to the city, to Attorney Desmond.

2649
04:11:57,636 --> 04:11:59,497
[SPEAKER_51]: September 13th was when we sent an email.

2650
04:11:59,877 --> 04:12:03,079
[SPEAKER_51]: We haven't received any feedback or even an acknowledgement of this.

2651
04:12:03,819 --> 04:12:05,580
[SPEAKER_51]: And this has been very concerning for us.

2652
04:12:06,861 --> 04:12:14,285
[SPEAKER_51]: We're also concerned about the length of the access road being 12 feet does not seem like enough for an emergency vehicle.

2653
04:12:14,345 --> 04:12:20,629
[SPEAKER_51]: We were expecting 18 feet with a sidewalk because our children use that road.

2654
04:12:21,309 --> 04:12:22,650
[SPEAKER_51]: They'll be using it regularly.

2655
04:12:22,730 --> 04:12:26,392
[SPEAKER_51]: So for safety, we were expecting 18 feet with a sidewalk.

2656
04:12:27,813 --> 04:12:29,774
[SPEAKER_51]: And as far as access to the high school goes,

2657
04:12:31,892 --> 04:12:35,835
[SPEAKER_51]: Granted, people have lived here for 60 years, but our kids are the ones that are going to high school.

2658
04:12:35,975 --> 04:12:37,335
[SPEAKER_51]: They will be going to the high school.

2659
04:12:38,436 --> 04:12:39,497
[SPEAKER_51]: Kids need a place to go.

2660
04:12:39,537 --> 04:12:40,337
[SPEAKER_51]: They need a place to be.

2661
04:12:40,377 --> 04:12:42,158
[SPEAKER_51]: They need to be able to move around.

2662
04:12:42,719 --> 04:12:51,584
[SPEAKER_51]: And a lot of people feel that it may be somewhat of an access path between our neighborhood and the high school would be nice.

2663
04:12:51,604 --> 04:12:55,606
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2664
04:12:57,648 --> 04:13:01,130
[SPEAKER_39]: The next resident is Maria Bruno-Ruiz.

2665
04:13:04,446 --> 04:13:05,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Madam Chair and Board.

2666
04:13:06,006 --> 04:13:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for hearing me out.

2667
04:13:08,087 --> 04:13:13,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a homeowner on 11 Franklin Ave with my mother and my brother and I grew up on Franklin Ave.

2668
04:13:14,289 --> 04:13:21,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to speak about what will be, we believe, a damaging impact to an already worn out street.

2669
04:13:23,192 --> 04:13:27,413
[SPEAKER_05]: The construction vehicles, as Jeffrey Dirk had identified in his presentation,

2670
04:13:28,719 --> 04:13:34,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All access to Bridal Path is from Franklin Abb 100%, which was on his document.

2671
04:13:35,381 --> 04:13:37,081
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a privately owned street.

2672
04:13:37,501 --> 04:13:40,022
[SPEAKER_05]: There are seven abutters on that street.

2673
04:13:40,582 --> 04:13:46,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you add the construction trucks, the tonnage, the new residents, there'll be eight homes.

2674
04:13:46,904 --> 04:13:47,884
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are doubling.

2675
04:13:48,604 --> 04:13:53,447
[SPEAKER_05]: the amount of people coming in and out of that area, this will wear down Franklin Ave.

2676
04:13:53,927 --> 04:14:03,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We had brought this up with the developers at the first meeting they provided for us, and we asked if they would repave the street when all was said and done.

2677
04:14:03,712 --> 04:14:11,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Their answer to that was they would repave the top of the street only, and we don't actually agree with that.

2678
04:14:11,517 --> 04:14:13,818
[SPEAKER_05]: We think the entire street should be paved.

2679
04:14:14,418 --> 04:14:21,121
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also worried about sewage, I'm sorry, water running down the street from the construction.

2680
04:14:21,581 --> 04:14:35,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We know there'll be silt fences, but there will be a huge opening from Bridle Path to Franklin Ave and there will be debris and stuff will come down that street and that will also add to the wear and tear on the street.

2681
04:14:35,847 --> 04:14:37,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We are concerned about that.

2682
04:14:37,947 --> 04:14:43,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also concerned about what it would look like just to pave the top of Franklin Ave and not the bottom.

2683
04:14:44,109 --> 04:14:48,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're creating an interface between those two sections.

2684
04:14:49,570 --> 04:14:52,531
[SPEAKER_05]: The street had been paved once before by the residents.

2685
04:14:52,671 --> 04:14:56,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this would fall upon those eight homes to take care of this.

2686
04:14:56,111 --> 04:15:02,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And we think the developers should pave the entire Franklin Ave when they're finished with this project.

2687
04:15:05,898 --> 04:15:06,959
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Ms.

2688
04:15:06,999 --> 04:15:07,700
[SPEAKER_43]: Mora-Lewis.

2689
04:15:16,408 --> 04:15:18,150
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't see any other hands raised.

2690
04:15:19,571 --> 04:15:22,114
[SPEAKER_39]: I may have accidentally clicked on the Ask to Unmute button.

2691
04:15:22,394 --> 04:15:23,115
[SPEAKER_39]: My apologies.

2692
04:15:28,242 --> 04:15:29,683
[SPEAKER_43]: I see no other comments.

2693
04:15:29,723 --> 04:15:33,344
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

2694
04:15:34,004 --> 04:15:40,287
[SPEAKER_43]: Attorney Desmond, would you like to respond to any of the comments that we have heard from the public?

2695
04:15:40,307 --> 04:15:44,328
[SPEAKER_43]: You'll need to unmute.

2696
04:15:50,090 --> 04:15:56,033
[SPEAKER_38]: So we did originally meet with the abutters and we did receive their comments.

2697
04:15:57,612 --> 04:16:11,620
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, you know, in terms of increasing the easement area, they have an easement from a separate development that is not a portion of this land and so to increase that.

2698
04:16:13,024 --> 04:16:22,970
[SPEAKER_38]: that easement is not something that my client wants to undertake or sidewalks because we're not, this is a private way with a private development.

2699
04:16:23,110 --> 04:16:26,592
[SPEAKER_38]: It's an existing easement that exists on the property.

2700
04:16:27,332 --> 04:16:34,376
[SPEAKER_38]: We're willing to work with them in terms of an easement agreement that gives them access to Bridal Path Road.

2701
04:16:34,496 --> 04:16:41,160
[SPEAKER_38]: Right now, they have a gravel road which travels from Franklin Street

2702
04:16:41,735 --> 04:16:42,595
[SPEAKER_38]: to their property.

2703
04:16:43,456 --> 04:16:54,661
[SPEAKER_38]: So what would be happening in this instance is they would be getting access to a paved road, which meets the city's requirements for streets in Medford.

2704
04:16:55,341 --> 04:17:10,948
[SPEAKER_38]: And in addition to that, they would get a paved area, which is essentially, and I know it's longer than the average driveway, but it would essentially be a driveway from their existing property to Bridal Pathway.

2705
04:17:13,528 --> 04:17:21,260
[SPEAKER_38]: If at some point the city were to come in and do a taking and make it public, then that maybe is a different conversation.

2706
04:17:22,977 --> 04:17:34,080
[SPEAKER_38]: you know, we're not asking them to contribute and the developers not going to ask them to contribute to any of the costs that would be associated with bridal pathway and the maintenance of that way.

2707
04:17:35,060 --> 04:17:38,041
[SPEAKER_38]: It would only be that portion, which is their driveway.

2708
04:17:38,921 --> 04:17:44,142
[SPEAKER_38]: And we are improving that by virtue of paving it in the first instance.

2709
04:17:44,622 --> 04:17:46,644
[SPEAKER_38]: and we're not taking anything away from them.

2710
04:17:47,946 --> 04:17:55,654
[SPEAKER_38]: We're making it a better situation for emergency vehicles because emergency vehicles can now access Bridal Path Road.

2711
04:17:56,134 --> 04:18:02,841
[SPEAKER_38]: In addition to that, the hydrants, currently the hydrant is approximately, I think, 400 feet at least.

2712
04:18:02,861 --> 04:18:03,282
[SPEAKER_38]: It's 125 feet.

2713
04:18:07,085 --> 04:18:09,628
[SPEAKER_38]: from Franklin to their property.

2714
04:18:11,069 --> 04:18:26,201
[SPEAKER_38]: We are installing a hydrant which is roughly going to be 70 feet from their property which will greatly help with emergency situations and emergency apparatus assisting in case of a fire or anything like that.

2715
04:18:26,221 --> 04:18:27,362
[SPEAKER_38]: So there's a lot of benefits

2716
04:18:30,252 --> 04:18:37,441
[SPEAKER_38]: To this project for them and and, you know, we, we do want to work with them because we would like to do an easement agreement.

2717
04:18:38,482 --> 04:18:44,449
[SPEAKER_38]: Rather than then relocate it by order, because it's pretty clear based on the case law that.

2718
04:18:44,990 --> 04:18:48,893
[SPEAKER_38]: The easement, as long as it doesn't frustrate the purpose, can be relocated.

2719
04:18:49,654 --> 04:19:07,949
[SPEAKER_38]: And once we had this public comment meeting and we knew what all the issues were and what the departments had said, I do have a draft easement that we'll be ready to share with them at some point and have conversations so that we can come to some agreement.

2720
04:19:08,789 --> 04:19:17,518
[SPEAKER_38]: But in terms of that upper portion of the easement, other than paving, it isn't something that the developer wants to take on.

2721
04:19:19,921 --> 04:19:26,267
[SPEAKER_38]: And signage, we've agreed in their signage on the plan, so there will be a sign on the cul-de-sac

2722
04:19:27,433 --> 04:19:33,018
[SPEAKER_38]: which will give direction to those two houses and that's located right on the plan.

2723
04:19:33,038 --> 04:19:40,086
[SPEAKER_38]: So we did hear what they had said and we did make some offers to them to the signage and the paving.

2724
04:19:41,772 --> 04:19:49,677
[SPEAKER_38]: to benefit them, in addition to the roadway, which is going to benefit them, that they're not going to have any related expenses.

2725
04:19:51,379 --> 04:20:00,625
[SPEAKER_38]: With regard to paving of Franklin, I think that the speaker indicated that the residents did have to undertake that.

2726
04:20:01,445 --> 04:20:14,690
[SPEAKER_38]: At some point, and certainly it is a private way, and all the residents, including including this development on to the midway point of that road and have that responsibility and and.

2727
04:20:16,560 --> 04:20:31,087
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, certainly if there's damage, it's something that we can discuss, but and I'd like to talk further with my client about that, because I don't recall there may have been a specific request for paving the entire street, but I, you know.

2728
04:20:32,335 --> 04:20:34,437
[SPEAKER_38]: plan point, we haven't really gotten to that.

2729
04:20:34,557 --> 04:20:36,159
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'd like to talk to my client about that.

2730
04:20:36,199 --> 04:20:38,962
[SPEAKER_38]: And we're not asking the board to make a decision tonight.

2731
04:20:38,982 --> 04:20:42,505
[SPEAKER_38]: And I understand that the board doesn't have sufficient information to do so.

2732
04:20:43,626 --> 04:20:49,972
[SPEAKER_38]: So, you know, just just to talk further about what paving and what extent and, and what what that would involve.

2733
04:20:50,092 --> 04:20:55,498
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, typically, the engineering department has required that you you

2734
04:20:56,162 --> 04:21:03,626
[SPEAKER_38]: improve or restore your frontage, which is, I think, what we were looking at with from Franklin to the headland.

2735
04:21:03,646 --> 04:21:09,769
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Attorney.

2736
04:21:09,989 --> 04:21:18,373
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to bring it back to the board.

2737
04:21:18,473 --> 04:21:22,775
[SPEAKER_43]: Any other questions before asking for a motion to continue?

2738
04:21:25,097 --> 04:21:26,157
[SPEAKER_43]: to January 15th.

2739
04:21:29,639 --> 04:21:30,659
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

2740
04:21:31,380 --> 04:21:37,642
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I would just want to have the city provide us clarity in terms of what we can condition.

2741
04:21:37,862 --> 04:21:43,024
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, can we condition that they, that the applicant, you know, repave Franklin?

2742
04:21:43,124 --> 04:21:46,366
[SPEAKER_35]: Can we condition, you know, additional signage?

2743
04:21:46,446 --> 04:21:49,987
[SPEAKER_35]: Can we condition, you know, X, Y, Z as discussed this evening?

2744
04:21:50,007 --> 04:21:53,109
[SPEAKER_35]: Because I just, you know, I want to make sure that we're within our

2745
04:21:54,766 --> 04:22:04,397
[SPEAKER_35]: our jurisdiction as a board, and then also, you know, being responsive to public comments and, you know, respecting the applicants' rights in front of this board as well.

2746
04:22:06,840 --> 04:22:14,909
[SPEAKER_44]: Through the chair, we can have some draft conditions and we can run it by legal counsel.

2747
04:22:14,929 --> 04:22:15,930
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

2748
04:22:16,900 --> 04:22:18,941
[SPEAKER_44]: We don't do a lot of subdivisions, so.

2749
04:22:18,961 --> 04:22:20,981
[SPEAKER_44]: It's been a while.

2750
04:22:21,261 --> 04:22:21,581
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah.

2751
04:22:22,162 --> 04:22:28,964
[SPEAKER_44]: And a lot of the subdivision control law are just not even applicable to the city.

2752
04:22:31,224 --> 04:22:33,625
[SPEAKER_44]: They really are a creature of the verbs.

2753
04:22:34,205 --> 04:22:41,427
[SPEAKER_44]: So they're not as common here.

2754
04:22:42,028 --> 04:22:42,948
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm sorry.

2755
04:22:42,968 --> 04:22:43,608
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm really tired.

2756
04:22:44,668 --> 04:22:45,149
[SPEAKER_35]: Very good.

2757
04:22:45,329 --> 04:22:46,389
[SPEAKER_35]: But yeah, let's make sure we get it right.

2758
04:22:52,090 --> 04:22:58,671
[SPEAKER_43]: Motion to continue the subdivision definitive subdivision plan for bridal path.

2759
04:23:00,291 --> 04:23:03,672
[SPEAKER_43]: Definitive subdivision to January 15th at 630.

2760
04:23:04,572 --> 04:23:05,272
[SPEAKER_46]: So moved.

2761
04:23:06,332 --> 04:23:06,832
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll second.

2762
04:23:08,873 --> 04:23:09,933
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice chair Emily Hedeman.

2763
04:23:10,793 --> 04:23:10,913
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2764
04:23:11,573 --> 04:23:12,253
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter Kautz.

2765
04:23:13,374 --> 04:23:13,474
[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

2766
04:23:14,354 --> 04:23:15,014
[SPEAKER_43]: Annie Strang.

2767
04:23:16,054 --> 04:23:16,254
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2768
04:23:17,154 --> 04:23:17,854
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrends.

2769
04:23:18,674 --> 04:23:18,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2770
04:23:19,695 --> 04:23:20,595
[SPEAKER_43]: Sabrina Alpino.

2771
04:23:21,555 --> 04:23:21,655
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2772
04:23:22,579 --> 04:23:23,279
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi.

2773
04:23:25,680 --> 04:23:28,200
[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

2774
04:23:28,940 --> 04:23:35,761
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much, Attorney Desmond and to your client and to the public for being with us this evening.

2775
04:23:35,902 --> 04:23:38,142
[SPEAKER_43]: We will see you, the board will see you on January 15.

2776
04:23:38,402 --> 04:23:40,842
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

2777
04:23:42,363 --> 04:23:45,343
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you and happy holidays and it's been a pleasure working with you.

2778
04:23:45,383 --> 04:23:49,044
[SPEAKER_38]: I didn't realize that you were leaving at the next meeting, but it certainly has been a pleasure.

2779
04:23:49,698 --> 04:23:50,879
[SPEAKER_43]: And I really appreciate it.

2780
04:23:50,939 --> 04:23:51,540
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you so much.

2781
04:23:51,600 --> 04:23:56,984
[SPEAKER_43]: My term ends and I will not be looking to do it.

2782
04:23:57,905 --> 04:24:00,387
[SPEAKER_43]: I just, it's conflicting times, conflicting things.

2783
04:24:00,527 --> 04:24:09,895
[SPEAKER_43]: And it's very bittersweet because I love doing the work, but it's just, it's hard.

2784
04:24:09,955 --> 04:24:12,357
[SPEAKER_38]: You'll never look at a sidewalk the same way or a building.

2785
04:24:12,897 --> 04:24:13,317
Yeah.

2786
04:24:14,620 --> 04:24:15,020
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2787
04:24:15,140 --> 04:24:17,221
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm an actual planner at the state level.

2788
04:24:17,241 --> 04:24:19,862
[SPEAKER_43]: So yes, you have no idea.

2789
04:24:19,882 --> 04:24:20,602
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2790
04:24:21,543 --> 04:24:21,983
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2791
04:24:22,003 --> 04:24:23,183
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you very much.

2792
04:24:23,564 --> 04:24:23,984
[SPEAKER_38]: Bye bye.

2793
04:24:29,706 --> 04:24:40,070
[SPEAKER_43]: And our fourth item on the list this evening is their approval of acceptance and approval of the 11th 624 meeting minutes.

2794
04:24:40,810 --> 04:24:42,171
[SPEAKER_43]: I will need a roll call vote.

2795
04:24:43,287 --> 04:24:44,347
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll make a motion.

2796
04:24:44,927 --> 04:24:45,228
[SPEAKER_43]: Motion.

2797
04:24:45,308 --> 04:24:45,628
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

2798
04:24:45,688 --> 04:24:45,928
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2799
04:24:50,309 --> 04:24:52,550
[SPEAKER_43]: And so that's a motion and someone second?

2800
04:24:53,530 --> 04:24:55,030
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll second that motion.

2801
04:24:57,971 --> 04:24:59,051
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

2802
04:25:00,112 --> 04:25:00,252
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2803
04:25:01,032 --> 04:25:01,632
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter Cowles?

2804
04:25:02,652 --> 04:25:02,772
[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

2805
04:25:03,873 --> 04:25:04,433
[SPEAKER_43]: Annie Strang?

2806
04:25:05,113 --> 04:25:05,253
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2807
04:25:06,053 --> 04:25:06,714
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrens?

2808
04:25:07,514 --> 04:25:07,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2809
04:25:08,354 --> 04:25:09,274
[SPEAKER_43]: Sabrina Alpino?

2810
04:25:10,034 --> 04:25:10,195
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2811
04:25:10,915 --> 04:25:11,555
[SPEAKER_43]: Ben LaValle?

2812
04:25:13,891 --> 04:25:15,252
[SPEAKER_43]: and myself, Jackie McPherson.

2813
04:25:15,312 --> 04:25:20,974
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm an I. Our final before adjournment, actually, is zoning updates.

2814
04:25:21,274 --> 04:25:26,776
[SPEAKER_43]: Just wanted to quickly say that the city council approved the MACD zoning at their meeting last night.

2815
04:25:27,576 --> 04:25:37,420
[SPEAKER_43]: Normally, I would have asked the planning staff to provide a status update on the next amendment coming, especially since this is my last meeting with you guys, but I'm not sure that you would take in the information at this point.

2816
04:25:37,500 --> 04:25:40,761
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm going to ask to adjourn.

2817
04:25:42,100 --> 04:25:46,944
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm gonna ask for a motion to adjourn, unless the board wants to hear that update right now.

2818
04:25:47,805 --> 04:25:54,351
[SPEAKER_35]: If it means more time with you, yes, but I think we all have important horizontal business to get to.

2819
04:25:54,371 --> 04:25:57,014
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, I think so.

2820
04:25:57,454 --> 04:26:00,397
[SPEAKER_46]: Side note to recognize Jackie for her work as chair.

2821
04:26:01,928 --> 04:26:02,348
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2822
04:26:02,388 --> 04:26:03,529
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate you all.

2823
04:26:03,789 --> 04:26:05,749
[SPEAKER_43]: And I will I still will be watching.

2824
04:26:06,109 --> 04:26:14,492
[SPEAKER_43]: Because I still like, you know, I just like I watch all the other, not all of them, but many of the other commissions and boards.

2825
04:26:15,032 --> 04:26:16,313
[SPEAKER_43]: So I will be watching you guys.

2826
04:26:17,933 --> 04:26:20,414
[SPEAKER_43]: Continue.

2827
04:26:21,895 --> 04:26:22,515
[SPEAKER_18]: proud.

2828
04:26:22,535 --> 04:26:27,237
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what we're gonna do without you.

2829
04:26:27,257 --> 04:26:28,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

2830
04:26:28,422 --> 04:26:29,544
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2831
04:26:29,564 --> 04:26:31,569
[SPEAKER_43]: No, I really appreciate that.

2832
04:26:31,589 --> 04:26:35,256
[SPEAKER_43]: But I'm sure you'll do way better without me because... No such thing.

2833
04:26:39,768 --> 04:26:40,868
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you all so much.

2834
04:26:41,688 --> 04:26:46,689
[SPEAKER_43]: Again, it really, really is bittersweet because I kept saying, no, no, no, no, maybe I can, maybe I can.

2835
04:26:46,709 --> 04:26:48,770
[SPEAKER_43]: I was like, no, stop fooling yourself.

2836
04:26:48,850 --> 04:26:49,270
[SPEAKER_43]: You can't.

2837
04:26:49,570 --> 04:26:51,170
[SPEAKER_43]: So I want to leave gracefully.

2838
04:26:52,670 --> 04:26:54,851
[SPEAKER_43]: And I won't be able to join you guys on January 15th.

2839
04:26:54,931 --> 04:26:57,831
[SPEAKER_43]: That technically would have been my last meeting, but I will be abroad.

2840
04:27:00,212 --> 04:27:02,272
[SPEAKER_43]: So I won't be with you on January 15th.

2841
04:27:02,432 --> 04:27:04,532
[SPEAKER_43]: And then I am not available for the February meeting.

2842
04:27:04,572 --> 04:27:06,233
[SPEAKER_43]: So I might as well just end it now.

2843
04:27:06,393 --> 04:27:07,273
[SPEAKER_43]: So that's where that came from.

2844
04:27:09,893 --> 04:27:11,915
[SPEAKER_43]: And my term ends the end of January, so.

2845
04:27:14,196 --> 04:27:15,597
[SPEAKER_43]: Well, thank you all.

2846
04:27:16,338 --> 04:27:19,020
[SPEAKER_43]: And I guess I still need a motion to adjourn.

2847
04:27:20,321 --> 04:27:21,181
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Jackie.

2848
04:27:21,221 --> 04:27:24,844
[SPEAKER_39]: We appreciate your service and that we appreciate you stepping up.

2849
04:27:25,204 --> 04:27:31,629
[SPEAKER_39]: I feel like we had to twist your arm to be chair, and we really appreciate that you did.

2850
04:27:32,029 --> 04:27:35,852
[SPEAKER_43]: I think you're probably going to have to twist one other member now to be chair.

2851
04:27:36,933 --> 04:27:39,295
[SPEAKER_43]: January meeting, you need a new chair, start thinking.

2852
04:27:40,030 --> 04:27:42,331
[SPEAKER_44]: A chair and a vice chair.

2853
04:27:42,411 --> 04:27:47,174
[SPEAKER_44]: Chair and a vice chair.

2854
04:27:48,555 --> 04:27:51,517
[SPEAKER_43]: And it's not that I didn't want to, I just knew what it took.

2855
04:27:51,877 --> 04:27:55,939
[SPEAKER_43]: And I was fine being a vice chair and just doing my work and supporting the board.

2856
04:27:55,959 --> 04:28:00,642
[SPEAKER_43]: Then when I had to leave the board, I was like, wait, that's going to take more hours.

2857
04:28:00,742 --> 04:28:05,225
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, I'm always willing to serve, but it's kind of hard to serve

2858
04:28:06,329 --> 04:28:21,356
[SPEAKER_43]: Now I see why there's such a conflict, because actually, Medford can use me in a better spot, because being at the state level with so many things, once my term is complete, I can come and talk to you guys about all the great things that the state's giving money for.

2859
04:28:21,776 --> 04:28:22,917
[SPEAKER_43]: But I can't do that right now.

2860
04:28:22,937 --> 04:28:27,779
[SPEAKER_43]: But anyway, serving two governments is really difficult.

2861
04:28:28,960 --> 04:28:34,783
[SPEAKER_43]: Not that I served your government in the full scope that you have, Alicia and Danielle, but it is difficult.

2862
04:28:37,373 --> 04:28:39,114
[SPEAKER_46]: I, yeah, can understand.

2863
04:28:40,815 --> 04:28:41,835
[SPEAKER_43]: Don't be a stranger.

2864
04:28:42,815 --> 04:28:53,460
[SPEAKER_43]: I definitely, well, I can't, you may just see me pop into a meeting one day as a, as the public with some questions, but I would only, only, only do that.

2865
04:28:53,620 --> 04:28:54,601
[SPEAKER_43]: Not to throw you guys off.

2866
04:28:54,761 --> 04:28:58,442
[SPEAKER_43]: Only if it was like near my house, I don't own in my fridge, so you don't have to worry about that.

2867
04:28:58,602 --> 04:29:01,283
[SPEAKER_35]: So renters have opinions too.

2868
04:29:01,824 --> 04:29:02,164
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2869
04:29:02,664 --> 04:29:02,944
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

2870
04:29:03,965 --> 04:29:04,245
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

2871
04:29:05,625 --> 04:29:06,846
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, okay.

2872
04:29:06,886 --> 04:29:07,066
[SPEAKER_43]: Well,

2873
04:29:08,035 --> 04:29:08,835
[SPEAKER_43]: Again, thank you.

2874
04:29:09,016 --> 04:29:09,636
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you all.

2875
04:29:09,816 --> 04:29:10,676
[SPEAKER_43]: Happy holidays.

2876
04:29:11,217 --> 04:29:12,497
[SPEAKER_43]: Happy holidays.

2877
04:29:12,617 --> 04:29:13,978
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you so much.

2878
04:29:14,038 --> 04:29:20,061
[SPEAKER_43]: Motion to adjourn because I don't think we actually did.

2879
04:29:20,161 --> 04:29:24,003
[SPEAKER_43]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman or Chair Emily Hederman?

2880
04:29:24,043 --> 04:29:24,443

[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2884
04:29:35,342 --> 04:29:35,982
[SPEAKER_43]: Adam Behrens?

2885
04:29:36,563 --> 04:29:36,743
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2886
04:29:37,684 --> 04:29:38,385
[SPEAKER_43]: Ben LaValle?

2887
04:29:39,806 --> 04:29:39,966
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2888
04:29:40,487 --> 04:29:42,428
[SPEAKER_43]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

2889
04:29:43,369 --> 04:29:44,250
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, everyone.
