Present.

00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,494
Six members present, one absent.

13
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,096
Please rise to salute our flag.

14
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:22,723
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

15
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,424
Paper 14-692, City of Medford notice of a public hearing.

16
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:47,312
A public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Mass., on Tuesday evening, October 28, 2014, at 7 p.m., on a petition from Kohl's Department Stores, Inc.,

17
00:00:52,063 --> 00:01:10,077
for a special permit to amend its hours of operation in accordance with Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Section 94-145B, to operate extended hours at its business at the Middle Glen Mall, Locust Street, Medford, Mass., on said site being located in an industrial zoning district.

18
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,728

Petition and plan may be seen in the office of the city clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford Mass.

27
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,201
I will now open the part of the public hearing for people in favor of this petition.

28
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:57,881
In favor.

29
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,023
Name and address for the record, please.

30
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:02,044
Thank you, Mr. President.

31
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:04,045
Members of the Council, my name is Robert Abruzzi.

32
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:07,508
I'm an attorney with offices here in Medford at 92 High Street.

33
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:12,471
I'm here on behalf of the petitioner, Coles, in support of this petition.

34
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,514
With me also this evening is Ms.

35
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:21,717
Serena Bierce, who is the district manager for Coles, the district she

36
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:31,047
is in charge of, consists of a total of 12 stores, 11 of which are in Massachusetts, one in Southern New Hampshire.

37
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:34,288
Obviously, one of these stores is the Medford location.

38
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:47,952
So at Cole's other stores, they typically open for Black Friday and on several days, maybe as much as a week leading up to Christmas, up to and including Christmas Eve.

39
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,352
Here in the city of Medford.

40
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:50,213
You're in favor, sir?

41
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:50,773
Yes.

42
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:51,553
Thank you.

43
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:55,621
Just the public hearing, in favor and against at this point.

44
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,042
I've already indicated.

45
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:58,824
Do you want me to present the case at this point?

46
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,125
We're going to have the public hearing.

47
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:00,345
All right.

48
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:01,306
And then you can present your case.

49
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:02,507
All right?

50
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:03,708
Thank you.

51
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:04,729
Anyone else in favor?

52
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:12,556
Seeing and hearing none, I now open up this portion of the public hearing for those in opposition.

53
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,278
Opposition, seeing and hearing.

54
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,500
Name and address for the record.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,481
Hi, Bill Barabino.

56
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:24,313
3920 mystic valley parkway, suite 109.

57
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:31,376
So my concern is I didn't, I got a letter a couple of years ago that they were extending the hours, I think in the morning.

58
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,677
And I didn't come to the hearing, you know, but I knew that they, that's what they were doing.

59
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:43,140
And at night, early in the morning, I get woken up and both my, my wife too.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,561
And so when I saw this, I felt that my obligation to take my time out of the day to,

61
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,653
I appreciate Kohl's.

62
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:50,993
I mean, I like Kohl's.

63
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:54,174
I appreciate them trying to make a successful business.

64
00:03:54,214 --> 00:04:04,258
However, what you have is 109, which is right next to, essentially, the mall.

65
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,039
And so I live there.

66
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm an attorney.

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,401
I have an office there, the same office, 92 High Street.

68
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:16,383
We both, I know I own and pay those taxes timely.

69
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,827
That being said, my wife lives with me.

70
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:21,988
She's a dentist.

71
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,030
She has to drive from Medford to Lowell.

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,652
And she has to do that every day, six days a week.

73
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,254
Her parents live with us.

74
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:33,915
One's 83 years old.

75
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,176
He's in good health.

76
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:39,278
The other one is my mother-in-law.

77
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:41,219
She is 74.

78
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,840
She's got heart problems.

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,941
She doesn't sleep that well.

80
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,942
She's been taken to Mass General a number of times.

81
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:58,154
And we're fortunate where the fire department here is so quick to respond that we couldn't imagine going anywhere else when she has had to leave to go to Mass General, which has been several times over the last half decade.

82
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:06,577
But given that we've had an increase in traffic, I think the last time they increased it,

83
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:10,073
And it's cumbersome, not so much for me, but for my wife.

84
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:11,834
And she's got to get up.

85
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,254
She's doing surgery all day.

86
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,415
And it's a big problem.

87
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:23,758
And I just don't see how this is just going to disrupt our ability to have a nice sleep.

88
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:25,298
Thank you.

89
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,359
Anyone else in opposition?

90
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,580
Opposition?

91
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,801
Seeing and hearing none.

92
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:32,741
Attorney Abruzzese.

93
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:37,593
Thank you, Mr. President.

94
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:43,615
Uh, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman who just spoke.

95
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:53,338
However, I would ask the, uh, the council to take note of the fact that the, the, uh, condominium building he's talking about is to the rear of the property.

96
00:05:53,658 --> 00:06:00,320
And, um, the activity would primarily be in the parking lot in front of, uh, in front of calls.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,161
We're talking about a total of, uh, not more than 10 days per year.

98
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:11,262
Black Friday and perhaps five or six days leading up to Christmas.

99
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:13,742
I think it's appropriate.

100
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:21,904
Coles is indirectly a big taxpayer and everyone has a right.

101
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:34,326
Obviously, there should not be any disturbance to the neighbors, but I think that the impact would be minimal in terms of the building, which is behind the shopping center.

102
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:38,546
and not in the front parking lot.

103
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:52,968
I know that Councilor Knight has spoken to me about having a police officer on duty for the Black Friday holiday, and the petitioner is certainly willing to go along with that.

104
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,408
And I think it's appropriate.

105
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,049
I would ask the Council's indulgence.

106
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:03,750
And if there were to be any problems, we certainly could address them.

107
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:17,387
I think that, you know, we're in a position where we want to try to support business as much as we can, and this is also a service to the local shoppers as well.

108
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:26,430
Chair recognizes Vice President Carviello, and then Councilor DelaRusso, chairperson of licensing, for a recommendation.

109
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,831
Zoning, I apologize.

110
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,231
Councilor Knight.

111
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:30,852
Councilor Knight.

112
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,113
Zoning, and then Councilor DelaRusso.

113
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,336
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

114
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,998
I've reviewed the paperwork, and I find everything to be in order.

115
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:43,562
I've had conversations with Attorney Abruzzi and also with Ms.

116
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:48,866
Pierce relative to requiring a police detail, especially for the Black Friday night.

117
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:52,029
And they've been willing to accommodate that, Mr. President.

118
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:57,453
So I'd be willing to move for approval, provided that we amend the paper to require a police detail on Black Friday.

119
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:03,979
And I think that it might be a good idea to have a 90-day review, whereas this is an open-ended allowance.

120
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:08,054
On the motion of approval as amended, Councilor DelaRusso.

121
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:19,920
Mr. President, I want a second approval and with the amendment that this permission for hours be restricted to Coles and not to the location.

122
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:26,730
On the motion that this stays with that particular portion of the Meadow Glen Mall, known as Kohl's.

123
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,531
Kohl's.

124
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,952
Exactly, known as Kohl's.

125
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,895
So if it changes eventually, this no longer goes with a new business that may be there.

126
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:35,658
On the motion as amended, Counselor Lungo-Kern.

127
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,319
Thank you, President Camuso.

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,725
Mr. Bruce, Attorney Bruce, when you say 10 days, they specified which days?

129
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:46,027
They, well, it would be

130
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:52,820
The expectation is probably four or five days, actually, leading up to Christmas Eve.

131
00:08:54,841 --> 00:09:00,346
I've put a limit not to exceed 10 days, depending upon what day of the week Christmas falls on.

132
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:04,108
In some years, it may be, you know, maybe a full week prior to Christmas.

133
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:16,978
This particular year, Christmas, I believe this year is on a — I believe it's on a Thursday, so we're probably only talking four days this year.

134
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:33,365
And it would be appropriate, I think, for the council to require that when the particular days are determined that Coles notifies the city clerks so that you have a record of which particular days or notify the police department.

135
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,426
A condition like that might be appropriate.

136
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,068
Yeah, my concern would actually be with the police department.

137
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:40,888
We've met with the chief of police.

138
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:41,969
Oh, geez.

139
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,351
I believe that was the end of September.

140
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,155
Chief of Police was before the council.

141
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:58,219
I'm not sure exactly when he said it, but he said one of the biggest callers to the police department with regards to retail stores is Kohl's.

142
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:11,025
And I think that's good with the fact that Kohl's is proactive trying to catch, you know, shoplifters, but it also takes a lot of time from the police officer's daily business.

143
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,846
I would make that a requirement.

144
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,668
If you only need the five days, maybe you could just

145
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:20,618
I think 10 is a little excessive between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

146
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:37,841
But I think the chief of police definitely needs to be notified two weeks in advance of which days Kohl's is going to be open 24 hours so that he can prep the department and make sure there's enough officers.

147
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,081
I like the idea of a police detail, especially on Black Friday.

148
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:45,082
I don't know if that's something that the council believes maybe should be all four days.

149
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,964
But that's just my concern.

150
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:58,513
And you also have neighbors that are complaining about the possible noise, while crime is something that you definitely don't want to wake up to in the middle of the night.

151
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:08,801
So I would recommend that the chief of police have to be notified of the days, the possible days that the colds will be open for 24 hours.

152
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,624
On the motion as amended, Councilor Penta.

153
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:15,807
I'd like to ask the gentleman to come back up.

154
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:23,805
You indicated that there was — the noise was a disturbance?

155
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:35,075
Yeah, and I'm glad — thank you for letting me come back, because the noises wouldn't come from the — I don't think I'd have any problem with the people coming into the store, that area.

156
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:40,960
What happens is you have the — what I assume to be third-party contractor vendors delivering stuff.

157
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,048
So that's the concern.

158
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:54,614
So when they back in, first of all, they make the beeping sound, which just, and then there's a long corridor there in back of poles, and it just sort of echoes into the whole thing.

159
00:11:54,674 --> 00:12:01,578
So once you hear it, I mean, you know it's a truck and it's clear what it is, but it's only that's my concern.

160
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,880
So I don't know, was that your question?

161
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,723
My question, I guess it runs along that with Councilor Langel-Curran relative to it.

163
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:24,066
the 10 days being undetermined, but more importantly, um, this idea of being open from 11 at night to seven in the morning, which would allow them to have a 24 hour operation for up to 10 days.

164
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:24,706
Is that correct?

165
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:30,669
So could we put it also further stipulation that no deliveries take place during that period of time?

166
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,951
If this is just for shopping and shopping alone, then I'm okay.

167
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,912
But if deliveries are going to be an issue and if that's an issue,

168
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:40,436
If I'm understanding you.

169
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:47,201
If there was no deliveries, that would solve my concerns, probably in full.

170
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,183
Can you address the microphone, sir?

171
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:51,604
I just saw.

172
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:57,888
Are you saying that on occasion there have been deliveries prior to 7 in the morning?

173
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:00,389
I'm not saying it's calls.

174
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,911
I mean, there's a whole host of stores, so I don't want to put calls on them.

175
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:07,314
We don't have any problem stipulating that there'll be no deliveries before 7 a.m.

176
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,933
No, between the hours of 11 p.m.

177
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:11,654
and 7 a.m.

178
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:14,495
Right, prior to 7 a.m.

179
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,097
Not a problem.

180
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,258
On the motion as amended, Councilor Marks.

181
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:24,801
Thank you, Mr. President, and I agree with the restriction on delivery.

182
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,002
I think that's a wise move.

183
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:38,169
Also, where the gentleman stated, Mr. President, that he believes it's deliveries from other parts or other stores within the mall that we as a council through the city clerk

184
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:44,515
send a letter to Meadow Glen Mall to make sure that no deliveries are happening prior to 7 a.m.

185
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:44,995
in the morning.

186
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:49,157
I think that's only appropriate for the neighbors and abutters.

187
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:51,418
I agree with council at night.

188
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,159
I like the 90 day review.

189
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,781
And I also agree with councilor Longo Kern that 10 days to me sounds a little excessive.

190
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,762
I think we should probably put a cap on it, maybe at five days.

191
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:04,963
That would be something that,

192
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,288
I think would be amendable to me.

193
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:22,919
I don't know how my other colleagues feel, but, uh, I would vote in support of this with the restriction on the deliveries and also with the 90 day review and also with council Longo Kern brought up about limiting it to five days, uh, rather than 10 days.

194
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:26,301
And as, as was mentioned, uh, this is open ended.

195
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:29,183
So next year there's no need to come before the council.

196
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:31,645
This is going to be in perpetuity, right?

197
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:33,666
Uh, it, uh, yes.

198
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:34,607
Uh, um,

199
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,950
you know, provided there are no issues.

200
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:43,152
Obviously, the council always has an opportunity to bring the petitioner back in.

201
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,713
Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

202
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,893
This is amended with a 90-day review.

203
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:49,093
Right.

204
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:51,434
My issue is actually the number of days.

205
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,054
I think 10 is excessive.

206
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,335
The 90-day review was offered by council.

207
00:14:55,435 --> 00:15:03,077
I think I would like, you know, depending, again, depending upon what day of the week Christmas is, I'd like to have the opportunity to have at least a week during the Christmas season.

208
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:09,136
if you could agree that the Black Friday plus up to seven days during Christmas season for a total of eight.

209
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:23,898
But as I say, in most cases in this particular year, since Christmas is on a Thursday, I don't see this as being more than four or five days this year, but I would like the opportunity to have at least up to eight days.

210
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,500
I think it should be specific days.

211
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
So the police department,

212
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,532
knows when this is going to take place.

213
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:54,916
For example, every Black Friday, if we're going to do this, if this is going to be approved and approved from now until Kohl's is no longer there, I think the police department need to know that it's going to happen on Black Friday and it's going to happen three days before Christmas.

214
00:15:55,557 --> 00:16:01,538
You can't have, although, you know, it's an amendment right now to have the police notified within two weeks prior to,

215
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:09,127
You're going to have them every year wondering when the 24-hour market, you know, when Kohl's is going to be open for 24 hours.

216
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:20,090
I don't know if we've done this for any retail store, so I want to set good ground rules now in case there's other stores that want to follow the lead, whether that's in the Meadow Glen Mall or not.

217
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:29,093
We need to make sure that the store is safe and that the police department know that there is going to be an establishment where there's a

218
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:34,457
good amount of shoplifting like in any retail store, and they need to be aware of it.

219
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:45,602
You know, we know what happened to other Kohl's in the past, so I think we need more specifics on which actual days Kohl's is going to be open for 24 hours.

220
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,903
Point of information, Counselor DelaRusso.

221
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:57,166
Does the department store hire during the peak shopping periods internal store security?

222
00:16:58,527 --> 00:16:58,747
They do.

223
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:02,339
Thank you.

224
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:02,819
Thank you.

225
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:03,600
Councilor Penta.

226
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,082
Mr. President, I, I'm not satisfied over the fact that we're going to give this thing out in finitum because this is the first tryout.

227
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:24,448
Um, regardless whether it's cold or anyone else, if you give it to them, it's going to set a precedent for any other type of store within the city of Medford department store or what have you claiming that the Christmas season, you know, it's going to be helpful to their business.

228
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:31,371
I've got no problem and allowing it to go through for the first year and on an annual basis has just come back because if everything works out satisfactory,

229
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,565
there should be no problem.

230
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:48,077
But we're setting a precedent here to allow one department store, large as it might be, taxpayer as they might be, but there are a lot of small business folks here in the city of Medford, and they're taxpayers too, and they should be looked upon equally.

231
00:17:48,197 --> 00:18:01,048
And I just think we're setting a precedent here that we're not gonna be able to offset because if Coles gets it, three or four other people or five or six, no matter what part of the city they might be in, might be just coming down here.

232
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:02,422
That's number one.

233
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:03,522
You can go to Wellington Circle.

234
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,384
You can go to the new mall down there.

235
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:10,306
And I can see them wanting to operate and open during that period of time.

236
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:15,809
Restaurants to accommodate businesses that are going to be open during that period of time to satisfy people.

237
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,492
I've got no problem in having a designated amount of time.

238
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:21,193
I have no problem allowing it for this year.

239
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:23,314
I have no problem in giving the extended hours.

240
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:29,638
But I am not in favor of making this a rule in perpetuity, to be honest with you.

241
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,163
But I think one of the councilors has suggested a 90-day review.

242
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:45,311
So the council would have the opportunity to review in 90 days whether or not there are any problems during this season, and assuming there is not, not require coals to come back again next year.

243
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:49,114
If there are problems, then they could be addressed at the 90-day review time.

244
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:55,419
Well, whether it's 90 days, or one day, or a year from now, the management of coals could be entirely different.

245
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:59,482
Issues could take place after the 90 days that could present a problem.

246
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,890
I just — listen, I've got no problem with it, but I just can't — to me, 90 days means nothing.

247
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,792
I just think they should come in on an annual basis on a case-by-case.

248
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:15,299
Because if we grant it for one, it's going to be very hard for us to be argued of being arbitrary and capricious and not allowing it to go to somebody else.

249
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,225
The Press Thank you very much, Mr. President, and through you to the gentleman.

250
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:28,130
Would Kohl's be amenable to providing the dates that they would like to be open?

251
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:32,996
say maybe the day following Veterans Day to the Chief of Police, would that be enough time?

252
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:33,296
Sure.

253
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,816
I mean, I think we could specify now.

254
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:39,877
It wouldn't be anything earlier than seven days prior to Christmas.

255
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:55,140
So, I mean, if that's the kind of specificity that the council is looking for, you know, you know, between, between the dates of December 18th and December 25th, Black Friday plus, uh,

256
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,012
up to seven days between December 18 and December 25.

257
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:06,540
I mean, that's — those are specific dates, so — Mr. Rubinstein.

258
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,581
Counselor De La Russo.

259
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,963
Mr. President — December 24, obviously.

260
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:20,813
The sad reality of retail in America is that it's become, unfortunately, common practice for retail stores of this magnitude

261
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,208
to engage in these extended hours.

262
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:32,152
We can perhaps spend another evening talking about how this is a commentary on society.

263
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,432
I don't know.

264
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,074
But that's not our purpose here.

265
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,455
They've made a reasonable request of us.

266
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:49,940
It's a matter that allows such a retail establishment to compete with peer stores to remain competitive.

267
00:20:51,088 --> 00:21:00,754
Maybe none of us like that idea that people are out shopping at 3 in the morning, but, you know, this is America.

268
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:14,101
They've made a reasonable request, and also we've put very reasonable amendments to this request, one of them being a 90-day review.

269
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:19,565
And so with regards to precedent-setting, at that point of 90 days,

270
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:23,580
Well, it's all fresh in our minds, fresh after the holidays.

271
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,302
We'll have them in here and review it.

272
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:36,850
And if at that time that we want to limit it to four days, we can do that based on the experience of how this went during this holiday season.

273
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,192
If at that time we say, you know what?

274
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,374
This was nothing but a nightmare.

275
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:43,495
We're not going to let it happen anymore.

276
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:44,916
We're going to rescind this permission.

277
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:49,880
Or my suspicion is that we're going to get to nine days and say,

278
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:55,049
It went without any unexpected incident, and it may continue.

279
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:01,353
So I think, again, I'd like to move the question as amended.

280
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,514
Vice President Caravaglia.

281
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:04,594
Thank you, Mr. President.

282
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,616
I agree with my Councilor De La Rosa here.

283
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:12,619
You know, the holiday season is a very important time for these stores.

284
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:13,819
They've only got so many days.

285
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,662
And now they're facing more competition from the new assembly mall.

286
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,690
All the outlet stores over there.

287
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:24,672
And I'm sure they're going to be open in the same hours as they are.

288
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:30,654
And it's not fair to us to saddle these guys with these conditions.

289
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:35,196
They said there's going to be no deliveries after a certain hour.

290
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,276
They're going to have a policeman there.

291
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:37,697
They're going to specify the days.

292
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:47,080
And like I said, come 90 days, if it doesn't work out, then that'll be a story for next year.

293
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,233
I feel it's unfair to say no to these people, and all the other cities and towns are doing it.

294
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:56,536
And then we complain that all our people are going elsewhere.

295
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:57,657
So.

296
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,758
Councilor Langel-Kern.

297
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:12,827
Just last, if we can move that as an amendment, what Attorney Bruzee said for Black Friday and seven days between December 18th and December 24th.

298
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:15,786
Are you withdrawing your original motion?

299
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:18,527
No, as well as notifying the chief specifically.

300
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,669
Your original motion, councillor, was for five days.

301
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,550
I didn't move that as an amendment.

302
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,992
I just said I thought it was excessive.

303
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:27,012
It was an amendment, so.

304
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:29,374
Are you withdrawing that amendment for the new one?

305
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,435
Yes, I don't believe I made that as an amendment, but.

306
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,596
It was, the clerk has it written down as an amendment.

307
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:37,298
So on the... Councillor?

308
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,401
I think Attorney Bruese was amendable to eight days, which this covers.

309
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,943
So maybe we can make it eight days rather than five.

310
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:45,604
That's right.

311
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,824
Total of eight.

312
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,465
Total of eight.

313
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:49,186
Total of eight.

314
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:49,706
That's what I meant.

315
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:49,866
Yep.

316
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:54,428
Total of eight with the notification for the chief two weeks before.

317
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,230
Is that our veterans day?

318
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:00,071
Veterans day.

319
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:01,552
Sure.

320
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:02,112
Okay.

321
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,516
On the motion, as amended.

322
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:10,078
And a letter to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding deliveries that take place between 11 p.m.

323
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:10,698
and 7 a.m.

324
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,179
in the morning, other than Kohl's.

325
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,060
Yep.

326
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,122
I want to send a letter to Austin to refrain from truck deliveries between those hours.

327
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:19,582
We have that.

328
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:20,763
On behalf of the neighbors.

329
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:22,323
Councilor Penta.

330
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:29,346
Some of the amendments I'm okay with, but I'm still concerned over the fact that you're going to review it in 90 days.

331
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:44,035
I think if I was a proprietor in the Meadow Glen Mall right now, and I knew that they could be open during those particular hours, I think I'd be coming here next and just saying, well, I'd like to be open, because you just gave it to them.

332
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:54,322
And if I was a food establishment in the Meadow Glen Mall as they are, I think they're going to come in here, and they're going to want extended hours to accommodate the people who are going to be possibly shopping all night long.

333
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:59,425
And then if you go to Stations Landing, and if you want to go over there, and if those stores want to be open,

334
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,991
I've got no problem with it.

335
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:04,072
I don't understand why you just have to give it.

336
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:07,893
Why can't we just give it out for this first year and see where this goes?

337
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:12,975
See how many other people want to apply for this 24—I mean, they're trailblazing right now.

338
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:15,276
They're setting the trademark as to what they want to do.

339
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,076
And let's just see how many other people come in.

340
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:29,640
It'd be a shame to have somebody come in here and want to have the exact same thing, and they get shot down because, quote-unquote, either the neighbors or someone, you know, want to object to it because they don't want to be disturbed during those particular hours.

341
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,370
You can put all the amendments you want onto this thing.

342
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:34,892
That's the only thing that bothers me.

343
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:47,803
You know, I just don't think you should be able to give it out in perpetuity, because if you give it out in perpetuity, and if you bring it back in 90 days, and for whatever the problems, and even if there were problems, and you were going to address them, they still have the thing in perpetuity.

344
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:58,211
And to get rid of that, as both attorneys know, it's going to be pretty hard, because you haven't specifically laid down rules that could cancel out that rule of perpetuity while they're extended forever.

345
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:07,203
I've got no problem voting for it, but I want to amend it that it just become, on an annual basis, a first-time basis, and let's just see where we go with this.

346
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:08,584
It's as simple as that.

347
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:09,925
That is an amendment?

348
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:11,086
Yes.

349
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:18,932
The amendment is in direct contrast with the paper, so we're going to take a separate vote on Councilor Penta's amendment first, and then we'll take the paper as amended.

350
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:22,574
On Councilor Penta's amendment, all those in favor?

351
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:23,515
Aye.

352
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,596
All those opposed?

353
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:25,417
Roll call vote.

354
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:26,938
Roll call has been requested.

355
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:30,495
A yes vote is for Councilor Penta's amendment.

356
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:36,198
A no vote is to take a vote on the paper as amended prior to his proposal.

357
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,741
Annual rather than perpetuity.

358
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:44,862
Yes is to have it just this one year.

359
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:47,444
A no vote will be the original intent of the paper.

360
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:50,565
Councilor Marks.

361
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:54,247
I want to understand my Councilor colleague's comments.

362
00:26:55,393 --> 00:27:02,875
Why would you think it would be so difficult for us to rescind the perpetuity that allows them to do it every year automatically?

363
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,015
Why would that be so difficult by a vote of the kind?

364
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:07,156
Just say in a year, two years from now, we say, you know what?

365
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:10,376
Even after the 90-day review, we no longer like this.

366
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:11,296
What's the reason?

367
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:12,197
Point of information.

368
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,297
Point of information, Counselor De La Russo.

369
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:18,218
Is perpetuity the proper legal term to this?

370
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:19,878
Is this granted in perpetuity?

371
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:20,838
No, it's indefinite.

372
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,219
Or is it indefinite?

373
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:22,679
Indefinite.

374
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:23,399
Indefinitely.

375
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:25,847
Because there's a difference in the word.

376
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:29,109
Imperfectuity is... Forever.

377
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:32,451
Forever and ever, till the Lord walks on this earth again.

378
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:37,654
So I don't think that's in anything that we give.

379
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:40,416
Thank you for your clarification.

380
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:41,837
Councilor Marks.

381
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,739
My question was to my colleague.

382
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,639
Why you would think that?

383
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,821
Because this is the first time this is appearing before us.

384
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,663
And I think being for the first time, let's just see how it goes.

385
00:27:52,482 --> 00:28:07,352
I'm not about to give away the store on the very first time somebody comes here and then have another person come and get denied because maybe they just don't cut the same—it's not cut the same way, whether it's their neighbors, whether it's the neighborhood, whether it's the location or what have you.

386
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:15,597
I can just see other people wanting to have the same issue, have the same argument, and I've got no problem with that, and I think we should address them one at a time.

387
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,094
Give it to them for the first year, I've got no problem with that.

388
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:23,177
Even if you want to review it after 90 days, cut it to five, call the police chief, chief of police.

389
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:29,162
And if everything works out great, and the gentleman in the back there, they have no problems, they come back again next year, it shouldn't present a problem.

390
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:31,604
But what are we going to do in the meantime?

391
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:39,271
I ask all of you, if company X comes in now, and they want the same thing, what are we going to do?

392
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:43,875
Honestly, I think we have to base every request on its own merits.

393
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:56,071
And you're right, if it was a business that was nestled in a neighborhood that wanted to open 24 hours, I would look upon it differently than a business that's in a mall establishment.

394
00:28:56,511 --> 00:29:05,874
And even the abutter stated that the front entrance would really have no bearing, people coming through the front entrance, on their sleep and so forth in the buildings.

395
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:09,696
So I think you have to take every petition on its own merits.

396
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,497
But my question was just whether or not

397
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:17,762
and a year from now that we as a council can rescind this vote.

398
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:23,568
And I believe we can do that like on any Tuesday night, and I don't think it's a difficult process.

399
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:27,934
And if this didn't work out for whatever reason, I'm willing to take a vote to rescind.

400
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:31,494
Thank you, Counselor Marks.

401
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:35,297
If I may, from the chair, I hear what both counselors are saying.

402
00:29:35,697 --> 00:29:42,683
Would the attorney be amenable to, every year, a 90-day review, just in case there's not a mob rush three, four years from now?

403
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:48,067
We'll just review it after 90 days as a council, and if there's no, basically put the 90-day review.

404
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:49,769
I guess I'm not sure how that would work.

405
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:52,971
I mean, what I want to avoid is the necessity to come back every year.

406
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:57,315
I'm completely comfortable with the council reviewing this.

407
00:29:58,337 --> 00:30:02,819
you know, in 90 days and see how it went as Councilor DelaRusso went.

408
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,561
I'd also like to point out that, I mean, we're not being trailblazers here.

409
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:10,844
There are a number of establishments that are open 24 hours a day now.

410
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:11,964
You have Stop and Shop.

411
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:15,906
You have a number of 24-hour permits, correct, Mr. Clerk?

412
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:16,747
Correct me if I'm wrong.

413
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,848
So we're not being a trailblazer here.

414
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:24,951
This is... But they've closed at 11 because of the business.

415
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,343
And we will be closing at 9 or 10 o'clock, 358 days a year.

416
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:41,083
The first vote is on the amendment of Councilor Penta.

417
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:45,706
A yes vote is for Councilor Penta's amendment.

418
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:48,769
A no vote is... Well, the amendment... Tell them what the amendment is.

419
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:55,394
The amendment is to have... The amendment... Councilor Penta's amendment is to have this as a trial this year and this year only.

420
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:56,455
A yes vote.

421
00:30:56,535 --> 00:31:01,799
A no vote will be for the paper as presented, as amended by the Medford City Council up to this point.

422
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:05,442
Before I call the roll, we have a gentleman in the audience that would like to speak, I guess.

423
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,893
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street Method Mass.

424
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:21,414
I hate to go against the man upstairs, and once upon a time there were blue laws in this state.

425
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:28,936
However, as one of the councilors stated, it's the state of the times, it's capitalism, so to speak.

426
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:32,677
It's been a long discussion.

427
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:41,839
I believe in the spirit of compromise, especially with council, they're making some great points.

428
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:53,433
Maybe you people might want to consider a one-shot deal, and for eight days as a compromise.

429
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:58,475
And then you don't have to worry about 90-day review.

430
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,776
It can come back next year.

431
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:12,580
Because if it becomes an issue after 90 days or prior to 90 days, unfortunately, this country is strong on litigation.

432
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:14,879
You don't want to go down that road, I would think.

433
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,982
This is my thoughts.

434
00:32:17,122 --> 00:32:17,502
Thank you.

435
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:18,163
Thank you.

436
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,064
The clerk will call the roll.

437
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,789
Yes vote is for Council Appendix Amendment as stated earlier.

438
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:25,432
A no vote is for the original paper as amended.

439
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:39,775
No.

440
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:41,036
Six in the affirmative.

441
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:41,996
Six no's.

442
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:43,317
One in the affirmative.

443
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:50,241
The paper fails on the main motion as amended for 90 day review for a police detail on Black Friday.

444
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:53,462
That this goes along with the business only and not the property.

445
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:58,085
That the chief be notified by Veterans Day of the days you anticipate to be open.

446
00:32:58,325 --> 00:32:59,725
No deliveries from 11 p.m.

447
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:00,426
to 7 a.m.

448
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:05,548
And that we send a letter to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding all deliveries for the entire mall facility.

449
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:08,550
And the petition stays with Kohl's.

450
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:11,314
and not the facility itself.

451
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:13,315
Councilor Penta.

452
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:32,699
I'd like to amend it one step further and have a report back from our city solicitor as it relates to if we are going to give this as an indefinite license for a period of time, that the city solicitor report back to the council under what conditions can the city council terminate?

453
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,580
It's different than giving the license from 11 at night to seven in the morning.

454
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,381
You're giving something indefinite.

455
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:51,170
And I believe that this case law, as Counselor Bruese and the gentleman behind him is aware of, this case law that substantiates the fact you just cannot pull a license just because you're granted it because you feel something went wrong.

456
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,692
It has to be of substance.

457
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:55,594
And we don't have any of that information.

458
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:57,575
This is the first time we're doing this.

459
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:03,980
We're basically at a loss to even know what rights do we have, if anything, because you're giving the license.

460
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,263
The license is predicated on two particular issues, number one,

461
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:11,957
number one, the indefinite period of time, and number two, the hours of operation, making it 24 hours.

462
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:19,381
Cancelling out to 24 hours could be within the purview of the Council, but to eliminate the indefiniteness, I think that needs to be reviewed.

463
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:20,862
All right.

464
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:26,626
On that motion, but for the viewing public, this is not a licence.

465
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:27,866
This is a special permit.

466
00:34:27,926 --> 00:34:30,548
Basically, it's a variance on the original licence.

467
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,477
It's a license to extend the hours for 24 hours.

468
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:39,477
It's a special permit.

469
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:39,757
Permit.

470
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,059
It's a special permit under zoning law.

471
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,339
Excuse me, you're speaking from the chair.

472
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm speaking, and I'm setting the facts straight.

473
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,561
You're not setting the facts straight, because there's two issues here.

474
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,482
The other part of the issue is this.

475
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:53,805
You're giving the special permit an additional- Special permit, not a license.

476
00:34:53,985 --> 00:35:00,528
You're giving them an additional privilege, and that is granting it to the licensee for an indefinite period of time.

477
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:02,357
It's not a permit counselor.

478
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:04,438
It's not the same as giving the license.

479
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:07,139
I mean the extended hours, the extended hours.

480
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,100
Thank you.

481
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,021
There are two separate issues.

482
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:11,462
You just corrected yourself.

483
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:11,862
Thank you.

484
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:14,383
This is a special permit on the original license.

485
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:16,124
The clerk will call the roll.

486
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:17,765
Counselor Mox.

487
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:26,910
Just if I could, uh, if, if this is a special permit, as was stated, then we as a council can put conditions on the special permit.

488
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,151
So, and we did correct.

489
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,252
We can also put a condition on the indefinite period of time.

490
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:50,020
If Councilor Penta feels better about that, we can put some language in there stating that even though this is for an indefinite period of time, that if there are any concerns or complaints brought before the Memphis City Council, that the license will be reviewed.

491
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:52,442
The special permit will be reviewed automatically.

492
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:57,004
And that way it's in there, the language at least gives us an option to review it

493
00:35:57,683 --> 00:36:01,165
and a possible revocation of the license.

494
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:07,587
I would offer that if that's... No.

495
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:13,890
No, that's the 90... What Councilor Marks is stating, this is going to cover us years down the road.

496
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,290
Right.

497
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,931
The 90 days is for this current year.

498
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:26,435
So, we put a condition on the indefinite period of time stating that if there are any

499
00:36:27,293 --> 00:36:43,627
concerns brought before the Meffitt City Council relative to the extended hours of operation at Coles that the Meffitt City Council either hold a hearing or review the special permit and make a decision on the special permit.

500
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:50,813
So the special permit... Does that sound... I mean that's... That's a show cause hearing.

501
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,614
You can do that anytime.

502
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:03,586
It would only be relative to the extended of hours from 11 to 7.

503
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:10,971
I think what Councilor Marks is alluding to is the second part of this extended hours, it's a request to be indefinite.

504
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:12,813
Councilor Abuzi, let me ask you a question.

505
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:18,337
Maybe we're looking at this thing, we should be looking at this in two separate ways.

506
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,979
Coming in and asking for the extended hours is one thing.

507
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:26,483
Maybe the petition should be separate and broken down to have a second one to have it become indefinite.

508
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,113
Yeah, well, you've been here numerous times.

509
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:31,435
That's not the way the order is read.

510
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:32,776
You've been here numerous times.

511
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:36,619
You have never made a request to have any one of your petitioners be indefinite.

512
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,500
This is the first time.

513
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:41,463
A special permit, by its very nature, is indefinite.

514
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:42,684
No, it isn't.

515
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:43,444
Yes, it is.

516
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:44,065
No, it isn't.

517
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:44,705
Yes, it is.

518
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,968
On an annual basis, Mr. Clerk, don't they have to renew their application with you?

519
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,012
Special permit, any variance in zoning goes with the land.

520
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:54,213
You've already made a condition.

521
00:37:55,229 --> 00:38:05,275
that it will go with Kohl's, but as long as Kohl's is the operator of this facility, this special permit will go to them.

522
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:10,919
If they go and sell the business to whatever market it doesn't go with, then it always stays with Kohl's.

523
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:15,902
You've made that condition by Councilor De La Ruza, that this is a Kohl's permit.

524
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:25,908
If you did not make that condition, like stopping shops or whatever, they would just stay with the land, but here you already made that condition and it stayed with Coles.

525
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,551
I don't think there's a need for it then.

526
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:35,995
So it's not going to be indefinite unless Coles, you know, they stay 50 years.

527
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:41,098
Can the clerk read, can the clerk please read back with council Max, what's the inclusion going to be as the amendment?

528
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:46,962
You know, I have to, you know, we're, but it's, it's about the indefinite period of time that if,

529
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:52,928
Mr. Clerk, if Councilor Max can have the floor.

530
00:38:53,308 --> 00:39:10,982
Mr. President, maybe if we give initial approval tonight and ask that the city solicit a review language that would cover what we're talking about, that may be... You said something I think could be manageable.

531
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,843
Point of information, Councilor Dela Russo.

532
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:19,507
If I understand correctly, this is amended to include a 90 day review.

533
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:34,098
So with so many special permits we've issued over the years, that if at the time of that 90 day review that we're not pleased with the operation, knowing full well that petitioners come to us,

534
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:54,719
And there's concerns, and they're getting it with the 90-day review, that if it's not going to work out after 90 days, if we see problems there, it's a telltale sign to us as a council that it's not going to work, and that the special permits rescinded, or modified, or whatever.

535
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,761
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

536
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:02,225
Just if I could, and I hear what my colleague's saying, but the 90 days is for this year.

537
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:05,287
Next year, there's no 90-day review.

538
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:15,761
If something happens next year, we just want to make sure as a council that we have the authority to revoke the extended hours.

539
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:16,001
Right?

540
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,061
Is that what you're saying?

541
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,243
We just want to make sure we have the authority to revoke, because there's no official review next year.

542
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:25,644
The attorney said he doesn't want to come back every year for a review, which I don't blame him.

543
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:26,085
Of course not.

544
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:26,705
I don't blame him.

545
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:33,079
So we want to just put language in there that allows us, and maybe we don't need language, Mr. Clerk.

546
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:35,120
My point is that I don't think we need language.

547
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,100
We've done show cause hearings on certain situations.

548
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,281
So should we not ask the city solicitor?

549
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:41,542
I think that would be a wise idea to ask.

550
00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:42,162
I think so.

551
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:48,124
But I'd like to also see this granted tonight so that they can make their business plans.

552
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:57,127
I have no problem granting it with the contingency that the city solicitor provide language to us within the next several days.

553
00:40:57,574 --> 00:41:01,415
I mean, we don't meet for two weeks now because of election next Tuesday and the following.

554
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:04,375
If that's amendable.

555
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:21,838
I mean, you can, you can also, if I, if I may, you can also, uh, uh, I believe, uh, choose to adopt whatever additional language you want when the 90 day review comes about.

556
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:22,398
We could do that.

557
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:26,399
Meanwhile, as the attorney stated, we can ask the city solicitor for his,

558
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,980
opinion on the language within the 90 days.

559
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,421
And then we'll attach the language.

560
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:42,403
My only concern with that would be if in fact the city solicitor were to come back and indicate that the extended hours does not represent the same intent of making the thing indefinite or indefinite to the extended hours.

561
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:56,425
I would be more amenable to going back to your resolution relative to the fact that language be included as part of this, um, that, um, this be reviewed on an annual basis as it relates to the being indefinite.

562
00:41:56,778 --> 00:41:57,859
First year is 90 days.

563
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:00,600
Then after that, you really have nothing after the first year.

564
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,001
So I think it would be beneficial.

565
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:05,463
I mean, Councilor Bruese may not be here the next time.

566
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,544
They may have new management folks at Coles.

567
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:13,107
And there may be problems that could have taken place during the course of the year after the 90 days.

568
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:14,487
I don't know, because none of us know.

569
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:15,768
We can't predict the future.

570
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:21,591
Once again, I'm only concerned about the license going forward.

571
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:24,833
I mean, this indefinite period of time

572
00:42:25,465 --> 00:42:27,346
and having another petition to come before us.

573
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:28,366
So why don't we do this?

574
00:42:28,386 --> 00:42:31,488
Mr. President, not to belabor the issue.

575
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:47,436
Why don't we approve this year as was stated asked within the, uh, with the 90 day ask, uh, just allow for this year and then ask the city solicitor to come back with his opinion on language that would allow us to review it every year.

576
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:48,877
Is that, does that sound acceptable?

577
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,498
Does that mean I have to come back next year?

578
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:52,738
No, no.

579
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:56,761
Once we get the language, then we will take a vote on the language.

580
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:02,325
Councilor Knight.

581
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:08,269
You know, this is, this is not, it's not the type of situation.

582
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:15,693
I mean, it's expensive for, for, for goals to, you know, send an attorney each year for a few, a few days.

583
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:21,017
Now it is, you know, it is something they want to do to accommodate their customers, but it's not,

584
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,093
you know, cost-effective to do this on an annual basis.

585
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:26,135
Counselor Knight.

586
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:32,381
Mr. President, in looking at the language that we have here, we have a 90-day review.

587
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,404
90-day review is about March 25th.

588
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:41,570
If we amend the language to say there's an annual 90-day review upon the conclusion of the issue of the hours, I don't understand what the problem would be.

589
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,983
Why don't we just amend the 90-day review to be an annual 90-day review?

590
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,385
It has to take place before March 25th annually.

591
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,166
If it doesn't take place before March 25th annually, the permit remains.

592
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:51,727
It's fine.

593
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:58,311
And we'll notify Coles if there's a problem during that 90 days to be here representative, because there are some permits that we review without the petition.

594
00:43:58,451 --> 00:44:07,057
Further, Mr. President, I've made a number of phone calls to Mr. Bruese about this issue, and he's been more than responsive and more than willing to address some of the concerns that I had before we came to this meeting this evening.

595
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:09,679
So I don't have any reason to believe that that wouldn't continue.

596
00:44:11,677 --> 00:44:24,266
So the understanding is that the council will review it annually on a 90-day basis, and the petitioner will not have to appear unless requested to do so.

597
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:26,608
All right.

598
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:32,072
And this is not the only Black Friday shopping establishment that has a 24-hour permit.

599
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:36,375
Ocean State Job Lot currently has a 24-hour license for the whole year.

600
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:40,263
But they only utilize it during Black Friday and some holidays.

601
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:45,566
And that was granted from the original stop and shop from councilors many years ago.

602
00:44:45,926 --> 00:44:47,807
And it went with the land, not the business.

603
00:44:49,008 --> 00:44:49,208
All right.

604
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:51,009
On the motion, as amended.

605
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,270
I'm going to read the amendments now.

606
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,092
90-day review, annually now.

607
00:44:58,032 --> 00:44:58,592
Councilor Knight?

608
00:45:00,313 --> 00:45:04,235
Councilor De La Russa, you withdrew your original one to now include annually?

609
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:04,835
Councilor?

610
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:06,096
Yes.

611
00:45:06,116 --> 00:45:06,156
OK.

612
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:18,900
We got the police detail on Black Friday that it goes with the business and not the land, that the chief of police is notified by November, by Veterans Day of each year, which days they plan on.

613
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,241
As to the specific days that they intend to open.

614
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:23,322
No deliveries from 11 p.m.

615
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:34,687
to 7 a.m., and that we also, Councilor Marks, excuse me, an amendment to send a letter on behalf of this council to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding overnight deliveries for the entire mall.

616
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:38,611
Councilor Penta.

617
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:44,395
The police officer for Black Friday, I believe the police officer is for the eight days.

618
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:45,115
No.

619
00:45:45,935 --> 00:45:46,055
No.

620
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:46,496
Why?

621
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:49,097
It shouldn't be necessary.

622
00:45:49,117 --> 00:45:49,177
Why?

623
00:45:49,477 --> 00:45:50,278
Meadow Glen Mall has detail.

624
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:51,939
That was my amendment, Mr. President.

625
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:52,759
That was my amendment.

626
00:45:52,919 --> 00:46:03,765
And when I watch the news and I see what happens down in Alabama and Oklahoma on Black Friday, when droves of people push their way through the door and kill workers at Walmart and kill workers at these big box stores.

627
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,866
I think the big rush is going to be Black Friday.

628
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:13,072
I have a number of people that I know who I'm friends with who, all Thanksgiving long, can't wait to pack up their bags and get rolling at midnight to go out there and go shopping.

629
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:14,793
Everybody's chomping at the bit.

630
00:46:14,854 --> 00:46:18,237
It's historically a day where most of the problems happen.

631
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:21,539
That's why I said Black Friday would be something that would be amenable to me.

632
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,203
On the motion, the clerk will call the roll.

633
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:30,627
So what's your problem with having a police officer?

634
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:31,008
Expense.

635
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,661
The expense, and it's not necessary.

636
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:45,811
It's- So you're going to guarantee from 11 at night to 7 in the morning, without having a Method police officer there, that nothing's going to take place in that storage- No, I'm not going to guarantee anything.

637
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:46,411
Is that what you're saying?

638
00:46:46,451 --> 00:46:52,857
They have their own security, and if there does become an issue, it will be addressed.

639
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:54,358
But it shouldn't be a requirement.

640
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:58,328
Point of information.

641
00:46:58,389 --> 00:46:58,949
Counselor Knight.

642
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:11,837
Um, because we have this 90 day review, if anything does happen during that period of time, we can call Coles and have them back in there and we can discuss any other public safety concerns that we have after this initial issuance of a license and an immediate special permit.

643
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:12,257
I'm sorry.

644
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,999
And an immediate public safety threat that the chief deems a public safety threat.

645
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,901
We don't have to wait for the 90 day review.

646
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:21,443
We can have you in here the following Tuesday after it's duly publicly advertised.

647
00:47:23,691 --> 00:47:26,172
Point of further information, Counselor DelaRusso.

648
00:47:26,412 --> 00:47:33,913
If it becomes problematic, we shouldn't have to mediate conversations between a store and the police department.

649
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:42,756
They're all adults who know what's necessary, and should the police deem it necessary, they can make a requirement.

650
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:44,856
Vice President Caraviello.

651
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:45,876
Thank you, Mr. President.

652
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:47,777
The mall has security.

653
00:47:47,957 --> 00:47:52,038
I'm more than positive that Kohl's has their own security.

654
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:59,439
You know, to put a further burden on them by putting a policeman every day of the week is foolish.

655
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,621
Councilor Knight, other than that one day, I mean, that's pretty much the bulk of the rush.

656
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:10,841
I mean, you know.

657
00:48:10,861 --> 00:48:19,523
I mean, Kohl's is not the kind of a store that has a $600 computer that they sell for $2.99 that everyone's busting the doors down to get at.

658
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,043
You know, it's.

659
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,383
Yeah, I mean, that's it.

660
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:24,584
and they'll hire a detail.

661
00:48:24,624 --> 00:48:27,466
If they're busy enough where they need it, they're going to do it.

662
00:48:27,986 --> 00:48:29,888
All right.

663
00:48:30,128 --> 00:48:33,851
On the motion, a yes vote is for the original paper as amended.

664
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:35,772
A no vote is no.

665
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:39,295
Clerk will call the roll.

666
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:43,278
Vice President Caviello.

667
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:43,538
Yes.

668
00:48:44,178 --> 00:48:44,959
Councilor Dela Russa.

669
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:45,139
Yes.

670
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,200
Councilor Knight.

671
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,360
Yes.

672
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,801
Councilor Long and Kern.

673
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:47,921
Yes.

674
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:48,902
Councilor Marks.

675
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:49,282
Yes.

676
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:50,063
Councilor Penta.

677
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:50,143
Yes.

678
00:48:51,238 --> 00:48:51,919
President Camuso.

679
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,125
Yes, by a vote of 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the paper is passed as amended.

680
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:01,633
Thank you.

681
00:49:03,376 --> 00:49:03,596
Item 14-717.

682
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:09,634
locations of poles, attachments of fixtures, and underground conduits.

683
00:49:10,374 --> 00:49:20,457
You are hereby notified that, by order of the Medford City Council, a public hearing will be held at the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, City Hall, Medford, Mass., at 7 p.m.

684
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:28,920
on Tuesday, October 28, 2014, on a petition by Light Tower Fiber Networks, 80 Central Street, Boxborough, Massachusetts,

685
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:37,889
01719, permission to construct and install a fiber optic service to 101 Main Street, Medford, and that's for the Mass Iron Air.

686
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,353
Description of access, Emerson Street at the intersection of Main Street

687
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:55,733
at utility pole number 6088-1241 in the city of Medford by installing fiber optic service lateral from pole 6088-1241 on Emerson Street, crossing Emerson Street to service Mass.

688
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,855
Eye and Ear at 101 Main Street.

689
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:01,558
The underground utility work consists of to dig a service on Emerson Street 24 inches deep,

690
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:19,855
from electric pole number 6088 slash 1241 westerly on Emerson Street, 20 feet, turning northerly 30 feet, crossing Emerson Street with an additional eight foot dig to the back edge of the sidewalk to enter the property at 101 Main Street, where we will dig an additional 40 feet to enter the building at 101 Main Street.

691
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:25,117
Light tile will place one schedule 40 PVC conduit encased to 101 Main Street.

692
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:32,400
Light tile will backfill with suitable fill free of large rock and debris, placing caution tape 12 inches above concrete encased conduit.

693
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,411
Motions for the brief synopsis.

694
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:43,613
Most of the paper is what I just read with all the specifics, which I just read.

695
00:50:43,653 --> 00:50:45,173
We're down towards the bottom of the paper.

696
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:50,615
And any conditions that were put on this, this was approved by the chief engineer.

697
00:50:51,155 --> 00:51:00,819
This was approved also by the superintendent of wires with the normal conditions that the engineer puts on most papers as far as repairing the temporary trench.

698
00:51:01,379 --> 00:51:03,703
And it shall be asphalt, base coarse.

699
00:51:03,964 --> 00:51:08,652
It shall mask the existing thickness of the existing pavement, but not less than four inches in depth.

700
00:51:09,522 --> 00:51:34,013
uh... the concrete sidewalk panels that are disturbed shall be saw cut at the joints and new concrete replaced asphalt shall be replaced in kind and before beginning the work the vendor shall notify digsafe and shall obtain applicable permits from the engineering division the contractor shall utilize city of medford regulations and standards for restoration as well as remove all debris related to its work underground work will be done and there shall be no disturbance to the city of medford sidewalk or roadways

701
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:36,113
Approved by the superintendent of wires.

702
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:40,494
Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations slash aids.

703
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:43,775
TDD number 781-393-2516.

704
00:51:43,835 --> 00:51:45,995
Signed Edward P. Finn, city clerk.

705
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:48,315
Plans can be viewed in the city clerk's office.

706
00:51:48,335 --> 00:51:48,975
781-393-2425.

707
00:51:49,676 --> 00:51:54,496
And I'll open up the public hearing for those in favor of this paper.

708
00:51:55,096 --> 00:51:55,597
In favor.

709
00:51:56,017 --> 00:51:56,997
Name and address for the record.

710
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,457
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

711
00:51:59,497 --> 00:52:03,758
Todd Fargnoli, Lightower Fiber Networks, 80 Central Street, Boxborough, Massachusetts.

712
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:09,020
Can you give a quick, brief synopsis, and then we're going to open up to people?

713
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,361
And then we'll bring you back if we have more questions.

714
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,262
Yes, Mr. President.

715
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:25,791
Light Tower is looking to trench approximately 83 feet from a utility pole to 101 Main Street in Medford, Mass., for the purpose of delivering new fiber optic services to Massachusetts Eye and Ear.

716
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:27,288
Thank you.

717
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:29,829
Anybody else in favor of this petition?

718
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,090
In favor?

719
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:36,152
Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the hearing and open it up to people in opposition.

720
00:52:37,093 --> 00:52:38,413
Anyone in opposition to this?

721
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:41,035
Opposition?

722
00:52:41,935 --> 00:52:47,918
Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the public hearing and open it up to the city council.

723
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:52,300
Councillor Knight and then Councillor Marks.

724
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:55,682
Thank you very much, Mr. President, and through you to the gentleman.

725
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:58,264
Can you tell me who's going to be doing the work?

726
00:52:58,304 --> 00:52:59,525
Is it an internal job?

727
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:01,246
Do you have a contractor that's going to be performing the thing?

728
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:03,187
Yes, we contract all of our work out.

729
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:08,590
We don't have an internal construction group that handles the actual trench work.

730
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:17,075
But I do believe that the contractor that we are going to choose has done work in the city of Medford in the past.

731
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:20,457
The contractor been selected at this point in time?

732
00:53:21,418 --> 00:53:23,960
Right now, it's down to two contractors.

733
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:36,936
The reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I have some concern over the work the contractors have done in the past relative to repairing our roadways to the previously pristine conditions that they are in.

734
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:48,204
But I know that we have some contingencies and controls available here at the city level relative to the applicable permits in the City of Metro regulations and standards for restoration.

735
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:48,884
So I'll rest.

736
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,831
Thank you, Mr. President.

737
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:00,433
Roughly, how long will the construction take?

738
00:54:02,454 --> 00:54:10,377
In the public right-of-way, it should take a day, possibly two days for the trench in the public right-of-way.

739
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:13,018
The private property may take another day.

740
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:19,721
I would say that the total duration, three days, and then if there's any significant

741
00:54:21,677 --> 00:54:24,358
You know, permanent restoration, it may take a day longer.

742
00:54:24,438 --> 00:54:30,401
I mean, we're talking less than five business days to complete the project from start to finish.

743
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:31,881
Less than five days.

744
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:32,802
Less than five days.

745
00:54:32,942 --> 00:54:35,083
And just one day on the public way.

746
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:41,846
One to two days on the public way, depending on what conditions we may find when we open the roadway.

747
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:45,407
So, I mean, sometimes the digging's a little bit slower than anticipated.

748
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,666
In some of these older cities, there's a lot of utilities underground.

749
00:54:51,006 --> 00:54:56,290
We do have good plans indicating what utilities are in the ground.

750
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,491
Dig safe will be called in.

751
00:54:57,511 --> 00:54:59,032
The utilities will be marked out.

752
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:05,497
However, sometimes it's a little bit slow going, depending on what the earth is underneath the asphalt.

753
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:09,119
And what's the length of the trench on the public way?

754
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,041
83 feet.

755
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:11,041
83?

756
00:55:11,361 --> 00:55:13,102
And on the private?

757
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:14,603
Approximately 40, I believe it was.

758
00:55:14,623 --> 00:55:16,224
Approximately 40 feet.

759
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:23,732
And where is the trench again on the public way?

760
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:31,973
It's on the Emerson Street side of Main Street at the intersection of Emerson Street.

761
00:55:33,674 --> 00:55:35,114
The intersection of Emerson and Main?

762
00:55:35,954 --> 00:55:37,755
Yes.

763
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:41,755
I have a plan here if you'd like to review this.

764
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:42,415
I have a copy.

765
00:55:42,535 --> 00:55:45,556
I just wanted to know if you can explain it rather than look at that.

766
00:55:46,655 --> 00:55:46,875
Sure.

767
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:56,262
I mean, right now, we looked at all options to get into this building and try to exclude the necessity of a trench in the public right away.

768
00:55:56,923 --> 00:56:02,507
Obviously, it's less cost effective for Lightower as a company to do these types of digs.

769
00:56:03,188 --> 00:56:07,030
We typically only dig in the public right away when it's absolutely necessary.

770
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,893
We looked into the option of, you know,

771
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:30,613
A lot of the times phone company or the electric companies have these service conduits that enter into buildings and we look to lease those conduits or lease a partial conduit to enter a building so we don't have to take on such excavation and civil construction as this.

772
00:56:33,425 --> 00:56:39,329
So, we actually had to license our backbone fiber cable is aerial.

773
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,772
So, we have the aerial license to attach aerially.

774
00:56:43,112 --> 00:56:54,100
We end at pole 6088 on Emerson Street and we have to dig from 6088, pole 6088 to the building to make connection to the building.

775
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,482
What other options were there, entrance options?

776
00:56:56,826 --> 00:57:03,328
that the other options were to look to the local telephone company or the local power company to try and lease a conduit into the building.

777
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:04,869
However, there was none available.

778
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:06,509
So you did explore that option?

779
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:07,029
Yes, we did.

780
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,470
Yes.

781
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:13,132
I'm not up to date on this.

782
00:57:13,752 --> 00:57:18,753
If something was available, are they obligated to allow your access?

783
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:19,434
Yes, they are.

784
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:23,455
I mean, there's certain language in the

785
00:57:26,962 --> 00:57:37,446
you know, license agreements that we have with the ILEX, their incumbent local exchange carrier, such as Verizon or your AT&T.

786
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:45,890
There's, we have a contract with them where as a competitive local exchange carrier, we

787
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:54,145
We have the right to ask these ILECs to lease a partial conduit.

788
00:57:54,766 --> 00:58:01,895
And as long as the ILEC has the capacity to do so, they're obligated under

789
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:12,536
an agreement that has been previously executed between Lightower and said ILEC, namely, I mean, in this case it would be Verizon.

790
00:58:14,618 --> 00:58:16,140
They're obligated to give us that conduit.

791
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,144
We pay them for use of that conduit.

792
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:23,788
So we pay, we actually, we pay them for

793
00:58:24,907 --> 00:58:29,129
you know, looking up, there's three phases to the licensing process.

794
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,910
The first phase is engineering.

795
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:34,031
They look up their capacity internally.

796
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:38,853
Phase two is make ready and phase three is licensing.

797
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:46,557
And we have to pay, you know, engineers to go out and survey in the field and see if there's actual capacity for them to, you know,

798
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:51,377
to surrender that conduit to us for lease, things of that nature.

799
00:58:51,517 --> 00:58:56,481
So they are obligated to give us conduit if we license it and they have the capacity to do so.

800
00:58:58,262 --> 00:59:00,284
Thank you, Mr. I have a motion for approval, Mr. President.

801
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:01,725
Councillor Mayne.

802
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:03,106
Yes, Mr. President.

803
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:14,335
In thinking a little bit more about the location, Emerson Street is a one-way, if I do recall appropriately, one way up to Maine, up to the gate, correct?

804
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:19,589
So I guess I have some curiosity as to how exactly traffic would be routed around this project for a week.

805
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:32,135
And with that being said, I'd also have concern relative to the traffic that would be coming in and out of Tedeschi's and crossing over out of the gate and out to Emerson onto Main.

806
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:33,135
And where would that traffic go?

807
00:59:33,175 --> 00:59:43,320
Because I think the way that Tedeschi's is set up right now, the parking spots are all slanted so that the cars are directed to go down to the back of the parking lot, exit onto Emerson,

808
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:45,386
and back out onto Maine.

809
00:59:45,987 --> 00:59:48,329
So those are some concerns that I think we have here, Mr. President.

810
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:54,254
However, the Mass Eye and Ear Institute is one of the premier research hospitals in the country.

811
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:57,698
And I think it's a privilege and an honor to have them here located in Medford.

812
00:59:58,358 --> 01:00:04,063
I also think that without the technology that they need in order to operate, we're going to be doing them a disservice, Mr. President.

813
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:08,808
So I, too, will be supporting this resolution.

814
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:15,943
However, I do have some questions and concerns relative to the actual traffic flow and traffic mitigation that's going to be in place.

815
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:20,107
And I was wondering if the gentleman could speak to that a little bit, if possible.

816
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:33,097
Yes, and President, through you to Councilman, we do have a traffic management plan drafted up currently to address these types of

817
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:39,954
you know, issues, making sure that traffic remains fluent in the area of the work.

818
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:44,879
I have a traffic management plan here that we can leave for you to review.

819
01:00:44,899 --> 01:00:45,839
Appreciate it.

820
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:55,929
Also, when we do this type of work, we hire, you know, depending on the area, we'll hire at least one police detail.

821
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:59,212
In this case, the TMP calls for two police details.

822
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:09,586
So we'll have a police detail at the location of the trench on Emerson and a police detail at the intersection of Emerson and Main Street to monitor traffic.

823
01:01:09,706 --> 01:01:11,229
That satisfies my questions, Mr. President.

824
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,230
All those opposed?

825
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:17,831
The ayes have it.

826
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:18,611
Thank you.

827
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:19,391
Thank you very much.

828
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:20,712
Item 14-718.

829
01:01:20,912 --> 01:01:22,873
Excuse me, Mr. President.

830
01:01:23,053 --> 01:01:25,914
I would like to leave this behind if you would like to review it.

831
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:28,896
You've got the police officers that are going to be there.

832
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,756
They're going to be performing detail work on the site.

833
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:36,359
I'm sure that it'll be in compliance with the traffic plan, which is in compliance with the established rules and regulations that we have in place.

834
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:37,900
If you don't need it, I'll take it back.

835
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,340
I don't need it.

836
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,501
I'm satisfied based upon the plan.

837
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:41,842
Thank you.

838
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:42,622
Thank you very much.

839
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:48,766
Location of poles, attachments of fixtures, and underground conduits, Medford, Massachusetts, City Clerk's Office.

840
01:01:48,786 --> 01:01:58,551
You are hereby notified that by order of the City Council, a public hearing will be given at the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, City Hall, Medford, Mass., at 7 p.m.

841
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:04,515
on Tuesday, October 28, 2014, on a petition of Teleport Communications America, LLC.

842
01:02:05,395 --> 01:02:18,521
Subsidiary of AT&T Corporation, Sienna Engineering Group, Inc., for permission to lay, maintain, and operate underground conduits with cables, including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures under and across the public or ways hereinafter.

843
01:02:19,581 --> 01:02:29,346
Named Fulton Street from existing utility pole number 143 to P. Utility pole to the P.

844
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:39,928
Property pole number 143 to the property of 59 Valley Street, one four inch PVC conduit, approximately 138 feet in length.

845
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:46,289
The conduit shall be placed at an approximate depth of 48 inches and in accordance with the requirements of the city of Medford.

846
01:02:46,749 --> 01:02:54,731
Wherefore it prays that after due notice and hearing as provided by law, it may be granted permission to excavate the public highways and to run and maintain underground cables.

847
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,832
Said underground conduits, Councilor DelaRusso.

848
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:03,491
Respectfully, a motion to allow you to give a synopsis of the rest.

849
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:10,833
Brief synopsis is the petitions before us with the particulars that I just stated off of the original petition.

850
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:25,038
This has been approved with the chief engineer, as well as signed off by the superintendent of wires with the natural language that they put in all of these papers to restore it to its original condition.

851
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:35,794
This 393-2501, for any additional accommodations slash aids, TDD number 393-2516, signed Edward P. Finn, the city clerk.

852
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:39,657
And also for the viewing public, these plans can be viewed in the city clerk's office.

853
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,561
At this point, I open up the public hearing for people in favor.

854
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:45,562
In favor.

855
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:46,402
Counselor Penta.

856
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,905
Before you do that, I believe it's important that you read the last paragraph.

857
01:03:50,486 --> 01:03:52,027
That's a state law necessity.

858
01:03:52,307 --> 01:03:52,888
Starting with?

859
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:56,906
Before?

860
01:03:57,346 --> 01:03:57,967
Yeah, before.

861
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:03,548
Before beginning work, the contractor shall notify DIGSAFE and shall obtain applicable permits from the Engineering Division.

862
01:04:04,129 --> 01:04:09,651
The contractor shall utilize City of Medford regulations and standards for restoration, as well as remove all debris related to its work.

863
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:14,732
Underground work will be done and there shall be no disturbance to the City of Medford sidewalk or roadways.

864
01:04:15,492 --> 01:04:18,534
The Chair opens up this portion of the hearing for those in favor.

865
01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:19,414
In favor.

866
01:04:21,395 --> 01:04:26,636
Name and address for the record with a brief synopsis, and then we'll bring you back up for additional questions if the council has them.

867
01:04:26,877 --> 01:04:27,257
Good evening.

868
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:28,317
My name is David Edgar.

869
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:29,857
I'm with Sienna Engineering Group.

870
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:45,542
We're consultants for Teleport Communications America, and we're here to speak on behalf of the petition for a grant of location to install a conduit from pole 143 on Fulton Street at the intersection of Maple Park Ave to the property of 59 Valley Street.

871
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:46,982
Thank you.

872
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:48,963
Anyone else in favor of the petition?

873
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:50,343
In favor?

874
01:04:51,557 --> 01:04:54,439
Seeing and hearing none, I now declare that portion of the hearing closed.

875
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,139
Anyone in opposition?

876
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,641
Opposition to the hearing?

877
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:07,385
Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the hearing and open it up to members of the council for recommendation and or questions.

878
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,107
Councillor Marks.

879
01:05:12,548 --> 01:05:13,508
Thank you, Mr. President.

880
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,890
How long roughly will this construction take place?

881
01:05:17,467 --> 01:05:20,789
I would anticipate this construction could be completed in three days.

882
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,670
Three days?

883
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,291
With restoration, including restoration.

884
01:05:24,072 --> 01:05:25,833
And also, do you have a traffic plan?

885
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:34,499
I don't have one with me, but our contractor that will be doing the work will bring one in when they obtain the street opening permit from the city's engineering department.

886
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,402
And what will the hours of the construction be?

887
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:43,346
If the city has not imposed any restrictions on the construction, it would be approximately 8 a.m.

888
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:43,686
to 3 p.m.

889
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:49,193
During the weekdays or weekends?

890
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:50,153
During the weekdays, yeah.

891
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:55,035
I'm not aware of any time restrictions imposed by the city on this.

892
01:05:55,815 --> 01:06:09,521
Mr. President, too, just if I may add, and I know this is standard language, but what you just read, the last sentence says underground work will be done and there should be no disturbance to the city of Method sidewalk or roadways.

893
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:11,722
Doesn't make sense.

894
01:06:11,762 --> 01:06:13,103
We know that they're going to disturb.

895
01:06:13,123 --> 01:06:14,384
They're digging up the roadway.

896
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:17,685
So that sentence really doesn't make any sense to me.

897
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:21,986
Maybe if we can have that reviewed by the city engineer.

898
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:25,809
It doesn't make sense.

899
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,110
I know it's her language, but it doesn't make sense.

900
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:31,273
It should read something as it should be returned to its original state.

901
01:06:31,713 --> 01:06:31,873
Right.

902
01:06:32,634 --> 01:06:39,018
I don't recall that language in other petitions, but previous nights, but I would motion for approval, Mr. President.

903
01:06:39,398 --> 01:06:46,663
On the motion for approval and with the B paper going to the city engineer for that clarification, Councilor Dela Russo.

904
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:48,562
What is the purpose of this project?

905
01:06:49,523 --> 01:06:53,326
It is to provide fiber optic service to the building at 59 Valley Street.

906
01:06:55,148 --> 01:06:55,488
Thank you.

907
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:56,709
You're welcome.

908
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:58,230
Councilor Knight.

909
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,892
Yes, Mr. President, through to the gentleman.

910
01:07:00,212 --> 01:07:02,734
Is the work done in-house or is there a contractor that's going to be doing the work?

911
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:05,416
There will be a contractor that will be doing the work.

912
01:07:05,777 --> 01:07:12,863
A project like this, we will bid out to three AT&T approved contractors, all licensed, and we'll be able to provide a bond to the city.

913
01:07:15,959 --> 01:07:17,680
And a contract that hasn't been selected as of yet?

914
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:18,461
Not yet.

915
01:07:19,341 --> 01:07:22,324
There'll be a project manager on hand in case there are any complaints?

916
01:07:22,484 --> 01:07:26,386
If there are any complaints, they can reach out to me and I'll be certain that they'll be taken care of.

917
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:26,927
Terrific.

918
01:07:27,267 --> 01:07:27,767
Thank you very much.

919
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:28,848
I'm satisfied, Mr. President.

920
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:29,148
I yield.

921
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:31,970
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

922
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:32,271
Aye.

923
01:07:32,851 --> 01:07:33,491
All those opposed?

924
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:34,072
The ayes have it.

925
01:07:34,312 --> 01:07:34,912
Thank you very much.

926
01:07:34,933 --> 01:07:35,613
Thank you for your time.

927
01:07:36,402 --> 01:07:39,384
Item 14-724 offered by Councilor Penta.

928
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,826
Be it resolved that the Tufts Curtis School be discussed.

929
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:42,827
Councilor Penta.

930
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:54,476
Mr. President, I know this has come up in a few times during our annual budget meetings, and I know Councilor Marks has brought this up as it relates to, um, um, let's just say the school in and of itself.

931
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:54,937
Okay.

932
01:07:55,337 --> 01:08:00,821
I got a phone call from a parent, um, as it related to, um, something that was taking place at the school over there.

933
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:02,823
And then she indicated, uh, I indicated to her,

934
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:06,806
Had she spoken to Mr. Volpe, who was the principal, and she says, Mr. Who?

935
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:08,766
She says, there's no Mr. Volpe.

936
01:08:08,786 --> 01:08:09,687
He's no principal here.

937
01:08:10,947 --> 01:08:12,547
And I says, what are you talking about?

938
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:14,208
She says, yeah, there's a new person.

939
01:08:14,468 --> 01:08:16,528
There's a different person with a different name.

940
01:08:17,849 --> 01:08:24,850
And then I come to find out, and I think we should get to the bottom of this, because this is part of our budgetary process.

941
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:32,152
I understand that Mr. Prior Principal of the school is up at the high school with another job getting paid the same amount of money.

942
01:08:33,004 --> 01:08:36,626
And the question now becomes, when did this all take place?

943
01:08:37,586 --> 01:08:45,791
I believe we were told during our budgetary meetings by the superintendent that there were some concerns, they were going to be addressed, and we would be kept informed.

944
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:57,217
Well, I don't think anybody, unless anybody in this council knows, that the principal has left, a new one was hired, and he's up at the high school getting the same salary with another job.

945
01:08:59,184 --> 01:09:05,227
I think it's things like this, you know, I think she was more amazed to think that I wasn't aware of what she was trying to tell me.

946
01:09:05,287 --> 01:09:11,729
So, I mean, I don't know if anyone behind here has any information, but I think it would be important, um, and informative if we got a report back.

947
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:20,813
Um, and I don't know who's going to tell us this, um, why he left and why he's not the principal anymore and why he's up at the high school and who's the new principal of the Tufts Curtis school.

948
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,174
Yeah.

949
01:09:24,395 --> 01:09:27,036
On the motion of counselor Penta to ask the school committee, the superintendent,

950
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:43,528
I would say it would be the superintendent, because he must have done the hiring, and it would be nice to know what's the job that he has up at the high school, what's that salary, and what's the job of the lady or the man who's now the principal of the Turtus Cuff, and what's that salary?

951
01:09:45,871 --> 01:09:47,012
It's a confusing little story.

952
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:52,885
I think amazed at me that I didn't know because I just made an assumption that he was still there as the principal.

953
01:09:53,325 --> 01:09:55,026
I know one councilor, you're just letting me know.

954
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,547
So you're not alone councilor.

955
01:09:56,987 --> 01:10:01,030
On the motion to send this to the superintendent for a report, all those in favor.

956
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:01,991
Make that a roll call vote.

957
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,152
Roll call vote has been requested by councilor Penta.

958
01:10:04,592 --> 01:10:09,776
And to have it included Mr. Clerk, the name of the person who is the new principal.

959
01:10:10,936 --> 01:10:12,157
When was that person hired?

960
01:10:13,398 --> 01:10:14,239
What is the salary?

961
01:10:14,799 --> 01:10:16,420
And the gentleman who was the principal there,

962
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,291
Where is he up at the high school, and what is that salary?

963
01:10:19,991 --> 01:10:20,291
You got it?

964
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:24,432
Roll call has been requested by Councilor Penta.

965
01:10:30,354 --> 01:10:31,174
Councilor Dela Russo?

966
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:33,595
No.

967
01:10:33,635 --> 01:10:34,175
Councilor Knight?

968
01:10:34,295 --> 01:10:34,435
No.

969
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:36,116
Councilor McKernan?

970
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:36,576
Yes.

971
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:38,957
Councilor Mox?

972
01:10:39,517 --> 01:10:39,737
Yes.

973
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:41,337
Councilor Penta?

974
01:10:41,397 --> 01:10:41,697
Yes.

975
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,318
President Camuso?

976
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:47,781
Yes, by a vote of four in the affirmative, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

977
01:10:49,182 --> 01:10:52,124
Item 14-725, offered by Councilor Penta.

978
01:10:54,185 --> 01:11:02,131
Be it resolved, the city prepare a forward paying program starting with, in a clerical error here, this is to read, according to Councilor Penta, 500,000 rather than 5,000.

979
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:02,771
No, 500 is written.

980
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:03,852
500 rather than 50.

981
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:10,741
Is that correct, Councilor?

982
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:11,181
It should be $500,000.

983
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:12,021
Yes.

984
01:11:12,521 --> 01:11:12,802
OK.

985
01:11:12,962 --> 01:11:13,282
A year.

986
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,302
I'm going to start again.

987
01:11:15,202 --> 01:11:25,184
Be it resolved the city prepare a forward paying program starting with a $500,000 a year payment from the free cash account to begin offsetting the city's unfunded pension liability.

988
01:11:25,224 --> 01:11:25,844
Councilor Penta.

989
01:11:26,044 --> 01:11:33,026
Mr. President, we've had this discussion numerous times in the past as it relates to the unfunded liability that the city has been involved in.

990
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:38,507
And nothing, there's absolutely been no discussion by the city.

991
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:39,927
There's been nothing coming forward.

992
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:47,774
It's bad enough we've had our discussion relative to the water and sewer account sitting on $8.5 million, and ratepayers are getting no relief.

993
01:11:48,775 --> 01:11:58,980
But we have over $6.5 million in our free cash account, and it would be a good beginning if we started with a $500,000 a year and just moved itself forward.

994
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:08,425
You know, if this council wants to leave itself with some type of legacy as it relates to its fiscal responsibility, this would be one of them.

995
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:12,291
I don't think we should be given anything by the way of the administration.

996
01:12:12,731 --> 01:12:15,872
Well, we're going to come in here and we're going to bond this to get ourselves going.

997
01:12:16,693 --> 01:12:17,573
It doesn't go that way.

998
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:28,178
This city, the people in this city have been taxed to death between the state and the feds and the city and everything that's going on.

999
01:12:28,598 --> 01:12:37,562
But if we're sitting on this kind of money and we know we have this debt to pay, we should be upfront about it and start doing it and not leave this for any future city councils.

1000
01:12:38,009 --> 01:12:40,930
or any future administration to come in as being a headache.

1001
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:47,871
We get on an annual basis a federal reimbursement from Part D. Last year, we got $335,000.

1002
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:50,272
We got $335,000 from Part D, which is the Medicare Part D reimbursement.

1003
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:52,972
We were also identified in the state retirees annual review as having an 11.3%

1004
01:13:09,724 --> 01:13:13,906
11.31% return for the last five years on our investments.

1005
01:13:14,907 --> 01:13:36,580
But if you look at Malden and if you go to other cities and towns which have a higher rate of return, again, I think it's something that this council has asked for before to maybe to sit down with our retirement board and to go over the type of investments that they have and see where maybe we can streamline and make more and understand why and how other cities and towns

1006
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:37,598
can do better.

1007
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:44,702
It's not that we're doing that bad, but if somebody can do better, then we should be able to have that ability to look forward as well as that.

1008
01:13:45,222 --> 01:13:48,163
But I think this is a serious bone of contention.

1009
01:13:48,843 --> 01:13:50,004
I think this is something.

1010
01:13:50,444 --> 01:13:52,965
This isn't something that maybe we can or can't do.

1011
01:13:53,005 --> 01:13:54,826
This is something we have to do.

1012
01:13:55,206 --> 01:14:00,129
This city is obligated to pay its unfunded liability as it relates to its pensions.

1013
01:14:00,929 --> 01:14:02,450
It's well into the millions of dollars.

1014
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:03,630
This isn't the hundreds of thousands.

1015
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,271
It's well into the millions of dollars.

1016
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:28,197
And I think if we start nibbling away at it with $500,000 in the first year, setting the example, and each and every year going forward, as we're paying down the at-present cost on an annual basis, it'll greatly reduce the trauma, the fiscal trauma, because that's what it's going to be when the city has to financially realize they've got to pay for this thing.

1017
01:14:28,817 --> 01:14:30,239
I believe it's 2029 is the deadline, 2030 is the deadline.

1018
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:36,506
And we're no closer to having this thing resolved.

1019
01:14:37,086 --> 01:14:41,168
And each and every year, as the years go on, this keeps getting itself compounded.

1020
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:51,532
So, with that being said, Mr. President, I spoke to Ann Baker about this, a city auditor, and she believes it's a good — it's a good move forward.

1021
01:14:52,232 --> 01:14:56,054
At least we're addressing the subject matter, and that's what we need to do.

1022
01:14:56,174 --> 01:15:01,296
And let me just, once again, say we shouldn't be leaving this type of a debt for any future council.

1023
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:04,097
And if the administration doesn't want to address it,

1024
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:05,167
Shame on them.

1025
01:15:05,528 --> 01:15:10,630
This is taking a very proactive approach going forward and recognizing this debt has to get paid.

1026
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:22,877
And to get it paid, knowing that we're flush in our free cash account right now, and it's been an accumulation through the years to get to $6.5 million, I don't think this is going to hurt the city's bank at all.

1027
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:26,999
And at the same time, we're addressing the subject matter that needs to be addressed.

1028
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:34,003
So that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move that by a roll call vote to our city auditor and our finance department.

1029
01:15:35,688 --> 01:15:41,532
and get the city on some kind of a system here that addresses this financial liability that it needs to address.

1030
01:15:41,552 --> 01:15:43,354
Point of information.

1031
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:44,314
Point of information.

1032
01:15:44,394 --> 01:15:46,096
Councillor DelaRusso, then Councillor Knight.

1033
01:15:47,036 --> 01:15:49,978
If I could just ask, what is the amount of money owed?

1034
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,202
I believe it's in excess of $20 million the city owes.

1035
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:55,422
Thank you.

1036
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:57,204
Councillor Knight.

1037
01:15:57,264 --> 01:15:58,545
It's unfunded pension liability.

1038
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:00,326
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1039
01:16:00,846 --> 01:16:02,968
And thank you, Councillor Pinto, for bringing this issue up.

1040
01:16:04,023 --> 01:16:05,324
I certainly agree with some of your points.

1041
01:16:05,364 --> 01:16:07,505
However, I urge my colleagues to move with caution.

1042
01:16:08,265 --> 01:16:29,194
Recently, I believe this fiscal year, GASB, which is the Government Accounting Standards Bureau, has come out with a number of papers which will change the way that we're allowed to forecast and we're allowed to report our liabilities on our balance sheets, which means that if we're reporting liabilities that are less than what we have, our balance sheets are going to be off and we're actually going to go and owe more money.

1043
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:44,429
So if we owe more money on our liabilities that aren't showing up on our balance sheets now but will be later on, and we're spending money of our free cash to offset this, we might have a perilous effect on our bond rating, Mr. President, because we're going to be taking money out of our reserves to pay for this unfunded liability.

1044
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:49,672
With these new reforms that are coming in place and these new reporting requirements, I think that we need to move with caution.

1045
01:16:49,692 --> 01:16:58,797
I think we need to get a report back from the Retirement Board as to what steps they've taken to address the generally accepted accounting principles that have been adopted by the federal government and passed down to the state.

1046
01:16:59,575 --> 01:17:07,965
I think that it's important to understand that the unfunded liability is really a mismatch between the estimated returns that we have on our long-term investments and the estimated assets that we have.

1047
01:17:08,065 --> 01:17:12,810
So in looking at what's happened, the GASB group has

1048
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:17,058
really taking a look at the way that we forecast.

1049
01:17:17,358 --> 01:17:29,325
And municipalities usually forecast at a rate upwards of 8 percent, while private sector pension plans usually forecast at around a rate of 4 percent, which is a little bit more in line with what the actual returns on investments are.

1050
01:17:29,786 --> 01:17:38,571
Now, as I've done further research, I've seen that the 25 largest pension systems for municipalities are returning at about 7.5 percent or 7.25 percent.

1051
01:17:38,911 --> 01:17:40,912
So there's certainly some concern here, Mr. President.

1052
01:17:41,418 --> 01:17:43,279
I think that we need to be on strong financial footing.

1053
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:55,605
We need to make sure that we keep money in the bank, and we need to be sure that we don't have a perilous effect on our bond rating before we move forward and start, you know, issuing annual checks for $500,000 a year to offset this pension liability.

1054
01:17:55,865 --> 01:17:56,645
It might not be enough.

1055
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:57,466
It might be too much.

1056
01:17:57,846 --> 01:18:04,889
There might not be a break-even there, and our bond rate is going to start to drop, and our pension liability is going to go up because of the new reporting requirements, Mr. President.

1057
01:18:04,909 --> 01:18:07,070
So I urge my colleagues to proceed with caution.

1058
01:18:07,511 --> 01:18:10,512
For those reasons and the uncertainty, I'm going to be voting against this resolution.

1059
01:18:12,415 --> 01:18:13,435
Councilor DelaRusso.

1060
01:18:16,036 --> 01:18:18,356
I'm sorry, Vice President Caravaglia and then Councilor DelaRusso.

1061
01:18:18,516 --> 01:18:19,616
Thank you, Mr. President.

1062
01:18:19,636 --> 01:18:20,617
I agree with Councilor Penter.

1063
01:18:21,357 --> 01:18:23,137
We do need to stop paying this off.

1064
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,998
This has been one of my bones of contention during every budget.

1065
01:18:26,818 --> 01:18:36,760
But before I vote for this, I'd like to sit down with the retirement board and Baker and our budget director to see exactly where we stand and what this $500,000 does to us.

1066
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,082
if we're using the correct formula going forward.

1067
01:18:43,102 --> 01:18:57,833
So I'd rather have a committee meeting on the whole before I vote on this Mr. Penta, just to see where we stand before we allocate any further funding.

1068
01:18:57,973 --> 01:19:04,798
Though I do agree, the amount that's owed is quite large, and if I'm not mistaken,

1069
01:19:06,232 --> 01:19:13,274
I think Ian Baker said like 2032 or 36 was the projected date that they have for it to be funded.

1070
01:19:13,294 --> 01:19:18,615
But I'd like to see where we stand with all these people before we make a commitment.

1071
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:20,736
Councilor DelaRusso.

1072
01:19:21,196 --> 01:19:24,537
Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up.

1073
01:19:25,097 --> 01:19:34,480
And I'm supportive of this, but I think perhaps before we do vote on this and set a dollar amount to it,

1074
01:19:35,676 --> 01:19:55,544
the wise course of action given the information that Councilor Nigel shared with us and also Councilor Caraviello's concerns would be that we meet, perhaps the Finance and Budgeting Committee meet with all those persons who were mentioned by Councilor Caraviello to examine the matter.

1075
01:19:55,744 --> 01:20:05,388
But it is a critically serious issue and it needs to be addressed and dragging our feet on it is not the right thing to do.

1076
01:20:05,922 --> 01:20:09,943
So you're perfectly right there, Councilor Penta, that this should be moved on.

1077
01:20:10,444 --> 01:20:20,587
I think the way to do it would be to develop a plan with those pertinent persons and start to move on it.

1078
01:20:21,467 --> 01:20:24,008
And we can do it within this budget cycle.

1079
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:25,489
Thank you.

1080
01:20:26,089 --> 01:20:26,969
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1081
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,970
Thank you, President Camuso.

1082
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:34,872
I was going to agree with Councilor Caravaglio that we sit in subcommittee with Anne Baker.

1083
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:39,447
The same exact people, Ian Baker, budget director, and the retirement board.

1084
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:42,249
I would like to learn a little bit more.

1085
01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:46,171
I'm not ready to make a vote on it tonight, but I agree with my colleagues.

1086
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:48,152
And I thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up.

1087
01:20:48,652 --> 01:20:49,373
Councilor Penta.

1088
01:20:49,393 --> 01:21:01,219
Mr. President, as I said before, I'm going to disagree with my colleague, Councilor Knight, because the facts that he has are not representative of the cost

1089
01:21:03,148 --> 01:21:04,709
that's presently out there.

1090
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:10,131
The city of Medford, for example, on a return for its money last year, received 11.96%.

1091
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:12,511
But you go to Northbridge, they had 15.29%.

1092
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:12,872
Norwood, 15.84%.

1093
01:21:12,912 --> 01:21:13,232
Peabody had 15.34%.

1094
01:21:13,272 --> 01:21:13,732
Pittsfield had 14.91%.

1095
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:14,312
Plymouth had 19.66%.

1096
01:21:14,352 --> 01:21:16,113
And then you can go down to these other cities and towns.

1097
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:16,613
Weymouth had 18.2%.

1098
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:33,363
Winchester had 12 point.

1099
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:35,564
Winthrop had 14 percent.

1100
01:21:35,664 --> 01:21:37,005
Woburn had 18 percent.

1101
01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:50,895
And we can go down, and the question then becomes if our investments aren't meeting or keeping up with those folks, those folks who apparently are doing better than the city of Medford, why?

1102
01:21:51,215 --> 01:21:55,658
And maybe we should be looking at taking a lesson from how they do their investments.

1103
01:21:55,698 --> 01:21:56,378
That's number one.

1104
01:21:56,438 --> 01:21:59,020
Number two, this is a debt obligation that we owe.

1105
01:21:59,299 --> 01:22:17,048
And if this city is going to keep worrying about its bond rating, its bond rating has got nothing to do with paying off a debt because you show me the alternative other than taking it out of the money that you already have, other than going out to bond to want to pay for this thing, which would be the most ridiculous way to go.

1106
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:23,732
This city administration is paralyzing, is taking money away from Medford taxpayers

1107
01:22:24,142 --> 01:22:28,785
that either could be used for paying debts such as this or municipal improvements.

1108
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:31,407
This is just two particular areas.

1109
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:37,110
And if you're going to keep being worried about a bond, well, what's the next big thing to get bonded around here?

1110
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,171
The police station?

1111
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:41,073
Well, then let's do it if that's what we're waiting for.

1112
01:22:41,453 --> 01:22:44,075
But according to the mayor, that's a seven-year-old process.

1113
01:22:44,795 --> 01:22:46,816
This is something that's alive and well.

1114
01:22:47,077 --> 01:22:48,858
It's in front of your faces right now.

1115
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:58,947
This is a debt obligation that's owed because the city, for which has been this administration for 26 years, has never put a dime into paying or paying down on this debt obligation.

1116
01:22:59,327 --> 01:23:00,428
And now it's in front of us.

1117
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:01,609
And it's real.

1118
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,151
And it has to be addressed.

1119
01:23:03,551 --> 01:23:05,233
I'm not worried about a bond rating.

1120
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:13,060
I'm more concerned about if we have money sitting in the bank that can start to help to pay this debt down, then that's what we need to do.

1121
01:23:14,106 --> 01:23:22,830
For God's sakes, you get $8.5 million in a water and sewer account, and the city administration is afraid either to lower the rates or have a program set.

1122
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:25,171
Those are the only two things you can do with a surplus.

1123
01:23:25,831 --> 01:23:30,813
And he's being allowed to just get away with doing nothing and letting the money accumulate.

1124
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,474
And here you are, $6.5 million in free cash.

1125
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:40,237
But you also have a debt obligation that exists each and every year and continues to grow.

1126
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,641
This is not going to go away.

1127
01:23:42,661 --> 01:23:44,781
This isn't a political issue.

1128
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:50,504
This is a real, live, physical debt obligation that this city owes.

1129
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:54,745
And with that being said, $500,000 is a drop in the bucket.

1130
01:23:55,025 --> 01:23:55,826
It's a beginning.

1131
01:23:56,426 --> 01:24:00,247
It's a beginning to understand that we are going to address this problem.

1132
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:04,189
And if we're fortunate enough to keep going and having free cash,

1133
01:24:04,815 --> 01:24:07,476
then maybe that's the best way to just keep going.

1134
01:24:07,816 --> 01:24:17,221
Because I don't know any other way other than going out and, again, banging the taxpayer overhead by way of a bond or some other financial encumbrance that they're going to have to pay for this.

1135
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:18,662
And they shouldn't have to pay for it.

1136
01:24:19,322 --> 01:24:29,006
But when other cities and towns, other cities and towns can generate that kind of money by a rate of interest return for their last year, and we did 11 percent.

1137
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,707
We're somewhere in the middle or thereabouts.

1138
01:24:31,127 --> 01:24:34,489
But there are other cities and towns well ahead of us with their interest returns.

1139
01:24:34,883 --> 01:24:39,824
Then I think we need to have a — sit down with the Retirement Board and Baker and all our financial people.

1140
01:24:40,084 --> 01:24:40,944
But that's not the point.

1141
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,925
This issue has got to be addressed.

1142
01:24:43,425 --> 01:24:49,946
And the best way to address it, knowing right now that we're flushing at least one particular account, then let's get to it and let's start on it.

1143
01:24:50,206 --> 01:25:01,789
And let's not worry about, oh, my God, we might go from a triple-A to a double-A bond rating because we used money that the taxpayers have that are generally theirs that's not being used for anything else.

1144
01:25:02,049 --> 01:25:04,169
We're waiting for this administration to decide

1145
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:06,878
the next thing he wants to do to use the money on.

1146
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:16,486
And then maybe when he leaves next year or two years or whenever he decides to go or gets beaten out of office, that administration is going to have to deal with it.

1147
01:25:17,086 --> 01:25:19,228
That city council is going to have to deal with it.

1148
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:22,351
And then it will affect every single thing that a budget has.

1149
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:33,840
But if there's a commitment that's built in now, and it represents the fact that we're addressing this debt that wasn't started by this council or councils before, it's been sitting there for years,

1150
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:38,222
because no city administration wanted to deal with it, now's the time to do it.

1151
01:25:38,642 --> 01:25:41,645
All you have to do is pony up, however you want to do it.

1152
01:25:41,705 --> 01:25:42,465
Do you want to have a meeting?

1153
01:25:42,646 --> 01:25:43,526
I've got no problem with it.

1154
01:25:44,087 --> 01:25:52,954
But as Councilor De La Rosa, you alluded to it, it should be addressed this term, and the first payment should begin during this legislative session that we're serving in.

1155
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,235
Vice President Caravaglio.

1156
01:25:55,536 --> 01:25:56,176
Thank you, Mr. President.

1157
01:25:56,456 --> 01:26:03,822
You know, not only do we have this debt going to people that have already retired, but I want to see where we're going forward

1158
01:26:04,186 --> 01:26:07,887
for these younger people that are coming down the line.

1159
01:26:07,927 --> 01:26:12,149
I mean, when was the last time this formula was re-evaluated?

1160
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:16,030
Has it been increased, decreased over the years?

1161
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:16,890
That's what I want to see.

1162
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:28,994
Going forward, I mean, what's in the past is done, but there's a lot of young people that are working in the city that depend on this pension for when they retire in the next 20, 25, or 30 years.

1163
01:26:29,514 --> 01:26:31,115
That's the part where I'm concerned,

1164
01:26:32,346 --> 01:26:34,507
Are we using the correct formula going forward?

1165
01:26:35,808 --> 01:26:36,369
Councillor Knight.

1166
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:39,351
Thank you, Councillor Caviello.

1167
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:40,331
That's what I was getting at.

1168
01:26:40,351 --> 01:26:53,040
You know, with GASB making these changes to the actual accounting and reporting principles that are in place and the federal government adopting them as generally accepted accounting principles, the city of Medford is going to have to take a look at the way that we are doing things.

1169
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,161
I'm not saying that this is a bad idea.

1170
01:26:55,181 --> 01:26:56,462
I didn't say that at all.

1171
01:26:57,153 --> 01:27:04,456
What I'm saying is I think we need to tread lightly and we need to use caution because we don't want to make a decision that's going to have a long-term dramatic effect on our financial viability.

1172
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:11,279
Now, I understand what Councilor Pinto is coming from, saying, well, we're never going to have financial viability if we have this unfunded debt and this unfunded liability.

1173
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:16,041
However, if we're looking at how we're going to pay it off and we have the free cash sitting in the bank collecting 1%,

1174
01:27:17,207 --> 01:27:26,095
And we can take that money out and bond it for 2 or 3 or 4 percent because we have a AAA bond rating and then use that to spend down a pension liability that's going to get us a return to 15 percent, like he says.

1175
01:27:26,135 --> 01:27:27,035
I don't see how we're losing money.

1176
01:27:27,636 --> 01:27:29,618
But that's a question for another day, Mr. President.

1177
01:27:29,638 --> 01:27:42,448
I'll certainly support the paper to go to committee to ask these questions that we have to get better informed and to properly vet the issue before we make a demand or make a — ask the question for the mayor to expend $500,000 annually to fully fund the pension system.

1178
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:44,690
I know that we've gotten a report back from Ann Baker.

1179
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:45,511
I believe it was in April.

1180
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:47,989
relative to the plan that they currently have in place.

1181
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:56,911
However, I don't have any understanding or any commitment or any knowledge that the city's actually looking at these new accounting principles and these new accounting standards that have been put in place.

1182
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:59,171
That's why I asked my colleagues to tread lightly.

1183
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:06,333
That's why I think this issue needs to be vetted a little bit further before we can ask this question and make this recommendation, Mr. President.

1184
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:07,653
Thank you.

1185
01:28:07,753 --> 01:28:08,314
Councilor Fenton.

1186
01:28:08,334 --> 01:28:11,194
Mr. President, to bond 2 percent, maybe you misspoke.

1187
01:28:11,514 --> 01:28:13,915
You said maybe we should just go out and bond for 2 percent.

1188
01:28:14,248 --> 01:28:16,050
and that money will generate some money.

1189
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:18,812
Why would you be going out to bond 2% to pay?

1190
01:28:19,312 --> 01:28:21,694
When you go out to bond, you're bonding for something.

1191
01:28:23,316 --> 01:28:24,036
I think you misspoke.

1192
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,217
I don't understand what you said.

1193
01:28:25,277 --> 01:28:26,699
You said you bond for 2%?

1194
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:29,641
You're saying we're getting returns of 15%, 20%, right?

1195
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:31,803
Other communities are getting returns of 15% or 20%, right?

1196
01:28:31,823 --> 01:28:33,204
Those are, yeah.

1197
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:38,529
So if we bond the money for 3% and we invest that money and we're getting returns of 15%, I don't see how we're losing.

1198
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:42,332
That's not the investment that's going.

1199
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:52,350
If you look at how the Retirement Board invests its money, and if you read the State Investment Board Retirement Program, it's to pay for the investments that you have right now.

1200
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,531
We're talking about the unfunded liability.

1201
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:58,033
It doesn't make any difference what the Feds or Gatsby or anybody else says.

1202
01:28:58,273 --> 01:29:01,855
You're going to have to—and whatever the new accounting practices might be, they still

1203
01:29:02,527 --> 01:29:04,548
can't get you away from the fact that you owe this money.

1204
01:29:05,028 --> 01:29:10,091
And however you owe this money, if this money is put aside in a special account to offset it, so be it.

1205
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:12,353
We're not putting up $6 or $7 million.

1206
01:29:12,573 --> 01:29:14,634
We're starting at a $500,000 beginning here.

1207
01:29:14,654 --> 01:29:15,915
But what I'm saying is, why not?

1208
01:29:15,955 --> 01:29:21,478
Why aren't we putting up $6 or $7 million if that's going to address the problem and address the need and address it now, in the real time, right now?

1209
01:29:21,538 --> 01:29:22,299
Why aren't we doing that?

1210
01:29:22,599 --> 01:29:24,420
Well, then if that's the case, then maybe we should have

1211
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:27,942
Maybe the meeting should be the following.

1212
01:29:28,903 --> 01:29:34,526
A, that we have a meeting with the city's retirement board.

1213
01:29:35,027 --> 01:29:38,789
Ann Baker, she's our auditor, and I believe she sits on the board anyway.

1214
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,672
What is the total amount of the unfunded liability?

1215
01:29:43,112 --> 01:29:47,154
The unfunded pension liability, how much is that?

1216
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:47,995
As of which date?

1217
01:29:48,375 --> 01:29:48,895
As of today.

1218
01:29:49,356 --> 01:29:49,936
As of today.

1219
01:29:50,456 --> 01:29:54,399
The unfunded pension liability as of today, number one.

1220
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,158
Point of information, Mr. President.

1221
01:29:56,218 --> 01:29:57,299
Point of information, counsel.

1222
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:10,207
If the federal government has changed their standards and they're making the municipalities and the states report their unfunded liabilities differently than they have required them to do in the past, then this information and data that we're getting isn't going to be accurate.

1223
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:18,913
If they're not reporting the liabilities the way that GASB and the way that the generally accepted accounting principles are calling for, then they can give us all the data in the world.

1224
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:21,335
But if they're not giving us a forecasted

1225
01:30:22,198 --> 01:30:29,423
You know, if they're not giving us a forecasted, estimated liability that's done properly, it's garbage in, garbage out.

1226
01:30:30,164 --> 01:30:32,626
Well, that's Councilor Knight's opinion.

1227
01:30:32,946 --> 01:30:36,768
As of right now, let's just see, what is the unfunded liability?

1228
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:37,909
How is that determined?

1229
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:40,731
If you want to use the Gatsby, the new federal, I don't have no idea.

1230
01:30:40,951 --> 01:30:43,713
Let's just see, because they're the ones that have to deal with this on a daily basis.

1231
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:47,316
The unfunded liability, what's the due date that has to be paid out?

1232
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,090
And Committee of the Whole?

1233
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:53,310
Committee of the Whole.

1234
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:53,570
Sure.

1235
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:54,090
Committee of the Whole.

1236
01:30:55,251 --> 01:30:55,651
All those?

1237
01:30:57,831 --> 01:30:59,532
Councilor Marks, and then Councilor De La Russo.

1238
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:01,092
Thank you, Mr. President.

1239
01:31:01,393 --> 01:31:05,234
I think the one good thing is we're all in agreement here, behind the reeling, from what I hear.

1240
01:31:05,734 --> 01:31:08,055
And I think it's prudent to have this particular meeting.

1241
01:31:08,435 --> 01:31:11,876
I thank Councilor Penta for starting the ball rolling on this.

1242
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,318
This impacts a lot of people that are in the retirement system, and it really needs to be reviewed by the city.

1243
01:31:19,037 --> 01:31:23,898
And as was mentioned, the longer we wait, the bigger the unfunded liability becomes.

1244
01:31:24,518 --> 01:31:31,500
And at some point, it's going to become something that we're not going to even want to approach because it's so unapproachable to figure.

1245
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,400
So I thank my colleague for bringing this up.

1246
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:43,522
If we could just amend this to include the Director of Personnel, Budget, and Finance.

1247
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:45,703
As amended.

1248
01:31:46,758 --> 01:31:48,959
And also further, can we get a separate report?

1249
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:57,545
What, if any, finances, financial remuneration does the city of Medford get out of the Medicare drug subsidy?

1250
01:32:01,107 --> 01:32:02,869
And the updated actuarials, we should have it.

1251
01:32:02,929 --> 01:32:04,069
Yeah, we can do that.

1252
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:05,951
Is that it?

1253
01:32:06,171 --> 01:32:06,331
Yep.

1254
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:06,911
All right.

1255
01:32:07,752 --> 01:32:08,352
On the motion.

1256
01:32:08,933 --> 01:32:09,993
Roll call vote and have that voted.

1257
01:32:10,013 --> 01:32:15,517
Roll call has been requested for a meeting of the committee of the whole to discuss this with the retirement board.

1258
01:32:16,593 --> 01:32:22,896
And Baker as her role as the retirement board member and the city auditor, as well as budget and personnel director, Stephanie Burke.

1259
01:32:25,857 --> 01:32:26,377
Eddie, you have that?

1260
01:32:26,397 --> 01:32:27,517
Because you look like you had a little.

1261
01:32:29,698 --> 01:32:29,898
Yes.

1262
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,381
But we want that information at the committee.

1263
01:32:36,541 --> 01:32:36,701
Right.

1264
01:32:36,821 --> 01:32:38,422
If we can get that information ahead of time so we can discuss it.

1265
01:32:38,442 --> 01:32:40,483
So we have some information to discuss.

1266
01:32:41,483 --> 01:32:42,423
Vice President Cavanaugh.

1267
01:32:42,463 --> 01:32:42,664
Yes.

1268
01:32:44,964 --> 01:32:45,805
Councilor DelaRusso.

1269
01:32:45,905 --> 01:32:46,145
Yes.

1270
01:32:46,573 --> 01:32:47,033
Councilor Knight?

1271
01:32:47,053 --> 01:32:47,113
Yes.

1272
01:32:48,114 --> 01:32:49,235
Councilor Longo Kern?

1273
01:32:49,315 --> 01:32:49,395
Yes.

1274
01:32:49,835 --> 01:32:50,316
Councilor Mox?

1275
01:32:50,336 --> 01:32:50,416
Yes.

1276
01:32:51,496 --> 01:32:52,077
Councilor Penta?

1277
01:32:52,197 --> 01:32:52,417
Yes.

1278
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:53,598
President Camuso?

1279
01:32:54,018 --> 01:32:54,338
Yes.

1280
01:32:54,438 --> 01:32:59,181
By a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, this paper has been referred to the Committee of the Whole.

1281
01:33:00,662 --> 01:33:08,728
Item 14-726, petition by Jeannie M. Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, to address the Council on Police and Fire Headquarters and Personnel.

1282
01:33:11,332 --> 01:33:13,394
Mr. President, just a point of order.

1283
01:33:13,614 --> 01:33:15,456
Point of order, Councilor De La Russo.

1284
01:33:15,597 --> 01:33:16,758
I'm concerned.

1285
01:33:16,778 --> 01:33:25,787
I think we've had a report on this in the past couple weeks from this petitioner on the same subject.

1286
01:33:26,428 --> 01:33:27,289
We certainly have.

1287
01:33:27,509 --> 01:33:30,112
Is it similar in nature to your last few weeks' discussions?

1288
01:33:31,054 --> 01:33:33,295
Let's see, anything new?

1289
01:33:34,956 --> 01:33:35,596
School shootings.

1290
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:36,837
School what?

1291
01:33:37,037 --> 01:33:37,617
School shootings.

1292
01:33:38,198 --> 01:33:38,798
School shootings?

1293
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:39,138
Yes.

1294
01:33:39,318 --> 01:33:40,139
Can I speak about that?

1295
01:33:40,459 --> 01:33:40,799
Sure.

1296
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:41,419
Thank you.

1297
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,781
Just last week, there was another school shooting.

1298
01:33:45,981 --> 01:33:51,264
Starting in the 1990s, there were 35 school shootings without including Columbine.

1299
01:33:52,015 --> 01:33:55,116
resulting in 59 deaths and 105 injured.

1300
01:33:55,877 --> 01:34:07,922
On April 20th, 1999, in Littleton, Colorado, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Cabald opened fire on 15 kids, killing them and injured 21 others.

1301
01:34:08,963 --> 01:34:15,385
The 2000s get worse, up to and including Sandy Hook Elementary, where 28 were killed and two were injured.

1302
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,867
October 24th, 2014, Jalyn Fryberg opened fire

1303
01:34:21,744 --> 01:34:25,746
in his school's cafeteria, killing three and injuring three more.

1304
01:34:26,946 --> 01:34:32,709
We live in a grand theft auto and call of duty culture, and we need to do something about this.

1305
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:46,535
I would suggest that we increase our numbers of police to handle this, and that we also need a police station.

1306
01:34:47,125 --> 01:34:49,407
We need a new police station to handle cyber criminals.

1307
01:34:50,387 --> 01:34:53,650
And I know it's repetitive, but it needs to be said.

1308
01:34:54,891 --> 01:34:56,312
Because if we don't say it, who's going to?

1309
01:34:57,693 --> 01:34:57,993
Thank you.

1310
01:35:00,615 --> 01:35:01,195
Is there a motion?

1311
01:35:03,036 --> 01:35:05,138
On the motion of Council Night to receive and place on file.

1312
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:05,798
All those in favor?

1313
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:07,119
All those opposed?

1314
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:07,780
The ayes have it.

1315
01:35:08,974 --> 01:35:17,259
Item 14-727, petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, to address the Council on Arts slash Media Center.

1316
01:35:17,299 --> 01:35:18,239
Name and address for the record.

1317
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:22,362
Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Massachusetts.

1318
01:35:22,422 --> 01:35:23,482
Thank you, City Council.

1319
01:35:24,403 --> 01:35:37,390
The April 29th Medford transcript noted that the owner of the Springstep Building, Elizabeth Grady Company CEO, Joan Walsh, wanted the building to stay in the arts community when Councilor Caraviello floated the idea of having Springstep

1320
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:38,652
be the new home of Channel 3.

1321
01:35:40,273 --> 01:35:48,737
Rather than start with a $4.5 million building, a sports host colleague of mine suggested that we look at 101 George P. Hassett Drive.

1322
01:35:49,497 --> 01:35:53,279
The building next door to City Hall has been gutted internally.

1323
01:35:53,419 --> 01:35:55,420
I took a look at it today from the window.

1324
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,561
It is perfect for a build-out.

1325
01:35:59,101 --> 01:36:06,625
A new nonprofit would benefit by purchasing this entity, but to effectively do this,

1326
01:36:08,047 --> 01:36:13,730
A new AXS TV Corporation needs to be built, one that has City Hall's help in this endeavor.

1327
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:32,401
With the Mayor's Community AXS TV Committee having given its report, with zero information from the Mayor's Office on the future of AXS TV, Mayor McGlynn is now in violation of a good faith obligation to the taxpayers, cable TV rate payer subscribers, and the businesses, civic groups, and residents of Medford.

1328
01:36:33,962 --> 01:36:36,143
This City Council needs to be proactive

1329
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:45,484
As I've said so many times before, Winthrop and Stoneham own their own buildings, and the previous nonprofit that was running Channel 3 squandered monies.

1330
01:36:46,184 --> 01:36:50,166
Those monies spent in almost 30 years could have purchased a new building.

1331
01:36:51,407 --> 01:36:59,510
This city council needs to put pressure on the mayor until he lives up to his contractual obligations to the residents of this city who are paying the freight.

1332
01:37:00,431 --> 01:37:05,333
And the clock is ticking because April 20th, I believe, is the Comcast renegotiation date.

1333
01:37:06,812 --> 01:37:10,635
I am not here looking for a vote of the city council, some symbolic gesture.

1334
01:37:11,316 --> 01:37:18,181
I am here to demand this council protect rate payer monies or be voted out of office one year from next week, Tuesday, November 3rd, 2015.

1335
01:37:18,281 --> 01:37:24,326
This council needs to step up and help form a new non-profit.

1336
01:37:24,886 --> 01:37:35,275
Let us now invest in a new non-profit and a new building that the arts community, public access, and the Medford arts community together can share to improve life in Medford.

1337
01:37:36,196 --> 01:37:41,440
Now, I'm talking to lawyers to litigate soon if the mayor continues to ignore us, because as I said, the clock is ticking.

1338
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,402
The mayor has a contractual obligation now.

1339
01:37:45,102 --> 01:37:51,767
My fear is that come April 20th, he may say, well, well, I've heard them.

1340
01:37:51,887 --> 01:37:53,528
They all want access, but I don't want it.

1341
01:37:53,888 --> 01:37:55,550
And it shouldn't be up to one individual.

1342
01:37:56,290 --> 01:38:00,093
That building is beautiful for what we need, and it's been gutted.

1343
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:04,656
I hope this city council can just go take a gander over there, maybe tomorrow, maybe in the next week.

1344
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:08,501
because you have a week off next week because of the election, two weeks in fact.

1345
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:11,242
This is the time that I'll be formulating a plan.

1346
01:38:11,342 --> 01:38:14,284
I'll be talking to citizens about maybe forming a new non-profit.

1347
01:38:15,105 --> 01:38:18,967
And that building sitting right there, 101, I don't know if it's available.

1348
01:38:19,027 --> 01:38:20,768
The owner is in Winchester.

1349
01:38:21,468 --> 01:38:24,150
The company, the corporation is called Medford Square Realty.

1350
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:26,190
It's a great idea.

1351
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:27,751
It's just sitting there.

1352
01:38:28,091 --> 01:38:28,611
It's gutted.

1353
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:29,571
We could build it out.

1354
01:38:30,091 --> 01:38:33,612
We could put a radio station in there for 24-7 emergency.

1355
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:37,734
Captain Barry Clemente could use the radio station, and these stations are free.

1356
01:38:38,634 --> 01:38:39,734
There's a new company now.

1357
01:38:40,134 --> 01:38:41,755
There's Blog Talk Radio Charges.

1358
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:46,896
There's another company now that allows free Internet radio, and I could put a transmitter up there.

1359
01:38:47,456 --> 01:38:48,477
I've told this council before.

1360
01:38:48,497 --> 01:38:50,557
I've run radio stations.

1361
01:38:50,737 --> 01:38:52,578
A $2,000 transmitter, we can have

1362
01:38:53,266 --> 01:38:59,291
a part 15 FCC radio station where people can tune in for snow emergencies, for any other emergencies.

1363
01:38:59,771 --> 01:39:01,292
I'm passionate about this.

1364
01:39:01,372 --> 01:39:02,313
This council knows it.

1365
01:39:03,133 --> 01:39:04,494
This is very important to me.

1366
01:39:05,976 --> 01:39:13,201
And the whole access thing is going to be changing as CBS and HBO just, Mr. President, they just went on the Internet.

1367
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:14,954
And I think you probably read that.

1368
01:39:15,014 --> 01:39:16,635
So everything's shifting to the web.

1369
01:39:16,995 --> 01:39:18,175
We need an access center.

1370
01:39:18,715 --> 01:39:21,716
That building, we could clean it up because there is trash around it.

1371
01:39:21,856 --> 01:39:22,996
There is graffiti on it.

1372
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:25,737
And it's 100 yards from City Hall.

1373
01:39:26,037 --> 01:39:27,798
We have to have some self-respect in this city.

1374
01:39:28,478 --> 01:39:31,979
It's just right near City Hall, and it's a disgrace right now.

1375
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:32,959
And we need to improve it.

1376
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:33,799
Thank you.

1377
01:39:40,068 --> 01:39:40,288
Sure.

1378
01:39:40,688 --> 01:39:42,110
Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1379
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:42,830
Can I speak on this?

1380
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:44,211
Thank you.

1381
01:39:44,432 --> 01:39:45,773
Oh, thank you.

1382
01:39:46,654 --> 01:39:59,125
Every day that goes by, this city misses out on an opportunity to digitalize our history, our sports events, our concerts, our plays, our events at the Condon Shell.

1383
01:40:00,206 --> 01:40:04,990
And it's going to require the citizens of Medford to come forward

1384
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:06,906
to create the new non-profit.

1385
01:40:07,746 --> 01:40:12,929
And I want to thank Joe for all of his hard work and everything that he went through.

1386
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:14,130
I want to thank him for that.

1387
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:17,772
I personally don't think that buying the new building is a good idea.

1388
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,974
We need to buy a new police station before we buy a new building.

1389
01:40:21,755 --> 01:40:26,518
But I do believe that we need to rent a space downtown in Memphis Square someplace

1390
01:40:29,613 --> 01:40:34,798
have an access station, start using it, and getting this stuff digitally recorded.

1391
01:40:34,878 --> 01:40:43,165
If the new thing is to put it up on the computer or the iPod or the iPad or whatever the new i thing is, then fine, let's digitalize it and put it up on that for everybody to see.

1392
01:40:43,686 --> 01:40:51,573
We're missing out, the mayor doesn't want to do this, but the people, the people can step up and they can do this.

1393
01:40:52,113 --> 01:40:54,355
The people are going to have to come forward from the arts community.

1394
01:40:54,676 --> 01:40:55,797
They're going to have to demand this.

1395
01:40:55,857 --> 01:40:58,600
If they don't demand it, then it can't go anywhere.

1396
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,041
You folks can't do it.

1397
01:41:00,522 --> 01:41:01,483
The mayor can't even do it.

1398
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:06,628
But the mayor could ask the people in Medford to come forward, but he chooses not to.

1399
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:07,749
That's on him.

1400
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:11,253
But I do believe, I don't miss out on anything.

1401
01:41:11,793 --> 01:41:14,156
It's the citizens of Medford that miss out on this.

1402
01:41:14,717 --> 01:41:15,778
because they don't come forward.

1403
01:41:16,598 --> 01:41:18,800
And they need to feel comfortable coming forward.

1404
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:24,104
They need to come forward in mass, 12, 14, 15 of them, and start this thing up.

1405
01:41:24,504 --> 01:41:31,069
So I'm asking those folks out there to come forward, to build out the new 501c3, to get this thing off the ground.

1406
01:41:31,289 --> 01:41:31,609
Thank you.

1407
01:41:33,151 --> 01:41:33,771
Councilor Pinto.

1408
01:41:34,472 --> 01:41:41,277
Mr. President, whether it means buying the building or renting the space, something needs to be done.

1409
01:41:41,597 --> 01:41:44,439
A few weeks ago, I was led to believe by someone who

1410
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:55,158
who seems to be in the know in this building, that the mayor was going to be making his decision, and he was going to be making the announcement that public access was going to take place.

1411
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,581
I haven't seen it, and it hasn't taken place.

1412
01:41:59,502 --> 01:42:11,992
But just to go back with a reminder, Councilman Max, I think it was two budgets ago, because the money was not included in the budget, to put money in there for the arts, if you remember correctly.

1413
01:42:12,687 --> 01:42:18,372
And I believe the resolution was a joint resolution between yourself and myself for $10,000 to be put in the budget.

1414
01:42:18,973 --> 01:42:29,942
And then when the mayor found out about it, and it was right during the middle of an election period of time, he decided to up the ante to $20,000 or $15,000, I forget the final number, whatever it might be.

1415
01:42:30,423 --> 01:42:37,729
Never saying a word to the council, because the council all voted on that, and I believe the council even voted to amend it to a higher dollar amount.

1416
01:42:38,594 --> 01:42:48,700
never a thank you coming back to the council for at least enlightening him or whatever it might be, but because it was a political process or it was political benefit for him.

1417
01:42:49,561 --> 01:42:55,464
The part that I just don't understand right now is this $303,000 sitting downstairs in the general fund of this city.

1418
01:42:56,124 --> 01:42:57,845
That doesn't come from the city.

1419
01:42:57,925 --> 01:43:02,288
It comes from the rate payers for Comcast and Verizon subscribers.

1420
01:43:02,548 --> 01:43:03,328
That's their money.

1421
01:43:04,009 --> 01:43:05,970
And they are owed public access.

1422
01:43:06,812 --> 01:43:08,173
And that's what that money is for.

1423
01:43:08,893 --> 01:43:18,580
Now, for how unfortunately what took place in December of 2012 till now, and there's no more Channel 3, and, you know, that's a hauntedness unto itself.

1424
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:19,720
There's no records.

1425
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,521
There's no books.

1426
01:43:20,881 --> 01:43:22,402
There's no validity to what they've done.

1427
01:43:22,422 --> 01:43:23,523
There's no minutes to the meeting.

1428
01:43:24,203 --> 01:43:27,906
The Attorney General's Office still can't give you an answer as to what's going on.

1429
01:43:28,966 --> 01:43:29,487
That's a shame.

1430
01:43:30,768 --> 01:43:31,988
But that's one part.

1431
01:43:32,028 --> 01:43:34,490
And the other part of the coin is no public access.

1432
01:43:35,153 --> 01:43:47,017
And if April 20th is right around the corner, usually before the April 20th, I believe within six months prior to the deadline of the contract, public hearings are supposed to be taking place.

1433
01:43:47,617 --> 01:43:50,278
And I believe the city of Meffitt hires this gentleman from Newton.

1434
01:43:50,898 --> 01:43:57,561
I think they pay him $325 an hour as legal counsel and advisor to the city for cable television.

1435
01:43:58,141 --> 01:44:01,462
And they usually have these public meetings here at City Hall.

1436
01:44:01,502 --> 01:44:04,443
I think they're required to have one if not two public hearings

1437
01:44:05,002 --> 01:44:06,943
before they're submitted into Boston.

1438
01:44:07,883 --> 01:44:08,423
I just don't know.

1439
01:44:09,224 --> 01:44:12,745
I guess I'm lost for words right now to you and everyone who might be watching.

1440
01:44:13,405 --> 01:44:18,707
I was really hoping that the mayor was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat, and he was finally coming to his senses.

1441
01:44:18,767 --> 01:44:20,268
But I don't know.

1442
01:44:20,288 --> 01:44:22,788
I can't answer it, because it's a real shame.

1443
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:27,730
You know, we have an attorney general candidate from the city of Medford, Martha Coakley.

1444
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:32,732
She has gone to every single public access chase around the city of Medford.

1445
01:44:33,662 --> 01:44:37,425
around the city of Medford, but not in her own hometown that she lives in.

1446
01:44:37,826 --> 01:44:38,446
And that's a shame.

1447
01:44:38,787 --> 01:44:45,773
Whether you're voting for or not voting for, but you can't get any closer to home, to the highest elected office statewide.

1448
01:44:46,694 --> 01:44:53,980
And it isn't because there's no money, and it isn't because you're trying to find a place, because I don't see anybody trying to find it.

1449
01:44:55,802 --> 01:44:56,483
It's a lack of...

1450
01:44:57,461 --> 01:44:59,142
It's a lack of free speech being allowed.

1451
01:44:59,983 --> 01:45:05,167
The other night in Winchester, Pat Jalen and Bob Capucci had a debate.

1452
01:45:05,187 --> 01:45:06,267
They had to go to Winchester.

1453
01:45:07,128 --> 01:45:11,251
And it's going to be aired back in Somerville, but the city of Medford, you know, they don't have it.

1454
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:13,392
And these people represent our city.

1455
01:45:13,973 --> 01:45:21,538
Elections are just as important as anything else that goes on public access, whether it's an educational thing, whether it's a sports event, whatever it might be.

1456
01:45:22,099 --> 01:45:26,922
And, you know, I don't know why the people, when you look at your cable bill each and every month, whatever that dollar is,

1457
01:45:27,335 --> 01:45:31,316
or $0.98, or whatever the dollar amount might be, you're just throwing that away.

1458
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:36,357
Because this city administration doesn't want to seem to have cable access.

1459
01:45:36,637 --> 01:45:45,478
And like I said, and I apologize for repeating myself, I was led to believe by someone who seems to be pretty good in the know that he was going to do it, but apparently he hasn't done it.

1460
01:45:45,918 --> 01:45:48,599
So this is two times that this has happened.

1461
01:45:48,739 --> 01:45:53,040
Judge Jackson, when she did her report, so five years ago, she wrote an extensive report.

1462
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,640
I think we've all read it.

1463
01:45:55,010 --> 01:46:05,197
And then the most recent cable committee, not commission committee that the mayor had, and he indicated subsequent to Memorial Day and right after the 4th of July, he was going to make his announcement.

1464
01:46:05,217 --> 01:46:10,761
This is now almost November 1st and there's no announcement to be made and people keep paying and keep paying and keep paying.

1465
01:46:11,222 --> 01:46:16,826
So, um, I hear what you're saying, Jeannie, and it's just a shame that we don't have public access here in this city.

1466
01:46:17,266 --> 01:46:18,967
You know, elections are very important.

1467
01:46:19,128 --> 01:46:20,509
Candidates have an opportunity.

1468
01:46:20,809 --> 01:46:22,450
They don't have any opportunity in this city.

1469
01:46:23,354 --> 01:46:31,299
But you can be rest assured next year, Channel 15 will be proffering everything that the mayor wants to talk about during the election campaign.

1470
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:35,522
You know, it's kind of interesting here, and I'll just ask my colleagues about this one.

1471
01:46:36,843 --> 01:46:51,553
Have any one of you ever tried to have your own press release and try to get a hold of Channel 15 and have them come up and give you the same forum that the mayor gets and use the same people up at the high school getting paid on city time to do a public forum?

1472
01:46:52,895 --> 01:46:54,075
Try it and see if it works.

1473
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:59,397
Try to get an informational piece on the city's webpage and see what happens.

1474
01:47:00,037 --> 01:47:01,978
It doesn't happen and it doesn't exist.

1475
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:11,661
So this freedom of expression and freedom of what goes on as public officials here in the city is only designed for one person because that person's in control of it.

1476
01:47:12,261 --> 01:47:13,441
And it's very unfortunate.

1477
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:19,443
And I would hope people would wake up and realize that, you know, at the rate we're going and if you keep paying for it,

1478
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:23,049
And this is a very scary thought, and I'll conclude by saying the following.

1479
01:47:23,869 --> 01:47:26,871
I could be corrected, but I think I found this out information today that's correct.

1480
01:47:27,772 --> 01:47:34,817
The mayor does not have to allow public access by right of contract if he so chooses not to renew.

1481
01:47:34,837 --> 01:47:43,683
The big question then becomes who and what takes that $300,000 or $500,000 or $400,000, whatever the dollar amount is going to be then.

1482
01:47:44,404 --> 01:47:47,666
It's going to be a damn shame if that money winds up into the general coffers

1483
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:56,677
and never been used for public access, and nobody ever had an opportunity to understand why or how, because nobody spec'd up and nobody challenged it.

1484
01:47:57,217 --> 01:48:05,463
That's an issue right now, I believe, in a surrounding city and town that's in a legal contest, and if that be the case, you know, we better watch out and better be prepared for it.

1485
01:48:05,844 --> 01:48:14,250
So, with that being said, I thank you for making your remarks, and whether we buy the building, rent the building, or what have you, Gene, or anyone who might be watching,

1486
01:48:14,543 --> 01:48:17,325
You know, public access does not exist in the city of Medford.

1487
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:21,949
It's not alive and well, and you can thank the mayor of this community because he's not allowing it.

1488
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:24,191
Councillor Alango-Kern.

1489
01:48:24,591 --> 01:48:25,832
Thank you, President Camuso.

1490
01:48:25,892 --> 01:48:28,914
I actually want to echo Gene's sentiments.

1491
01:48:29,014 --> 01:48:32,197
I just feel, truly feel, that the city of Medford's missing out.

1492
01:48:33,258 --> 01:48:39,763
Teenagers, young children, all the way up to, you know, adults and the elderly who you could be using

1493
01:48:40,503 --> 01:48:44,687
TV access for many, many different reasons, including, you know, the many things you mentioned.

1494
01:48:45,067 --> 01:48:45,828
It's unfortunate.

1495
01:48:45,848 --> 01:48:51,013
This council, over a year ago, fought to get TV 3 on the right track.

1496
01:48:51,073 --> 01:48:55,958
And, you know, what we did was, with every, you know, the citizens' help, was an accomplishment.

1497
01:48:56,398 --> 01:48:59,040
But at this point, it just went to the wayside.

1498
01:48:59,181 --> 01:49:01,263
You know, in June, Father Hines was leaving.

1499
01:49:01,323 --> 01:49:04,826
We thought at that point that the committee, cable committee, would have been done.

1500
01:49:05,303 --> 01:49:08,365
with what they needed to do, and we'd have a new station up and running.

1501
01:49:08,545 --> 01:49:12,487
And at this point, we're already into November almost, and we've heard nothing.

1502
01:49:13,327 --> 01:49:20,771
We've asked for updates, we've asked for reports, we've asked for how we're gonna go forward, and the corner office is silent.

1503
01:49:21,612 --> 01:49:23,152
That's unfortunate for the city of Medford.

1504
01:49:23,172 --> 01:49:31,897
It's unfortunate for the candidates to the current election, state, senate, and the list goes on.

1505
01:49:32,485 --> 01:49:42,911
So I too, I don't know where TV should go, TV3 should go, but I do know that we are paying for it every day through our cable bill, and it's wrong.

1506
01:49:43,131 --> 01:49:47,954
I think the administration really needs to get in the ball and do what they need to do.

1507
01:49:50,456 --> 01:49:51,516
You'd like to speak again?

1508
01:49:51,816 --> 01:49:53,397
Name and address for the record.

1509
01:49:55,218 --> 01:49:55,559
Thank you.

1510
01:49:55,579 --> 01:49:56,759
Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1511
01:49:56,919 --> 01:49:58,801
And that's exactly what he's going to do.

1512
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:05,973
He's going to just fade out the whole program come June or whatever, May, April.

1513
01:50:06,793 --> 01:50:09,234
And he's going to use it like he does the other 3% out of the 5%.

1514
01:50:11,235 --> 01:50:17,498
Out of every $100 that you pay on your cable bill, $5 is taken out for, supposed to be for public access.

1515
01:50:18,219 --> 01:50:21,700
I guess it's technically he's within his legal rights as he always is.

1516
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:27,463
But $3 out of those $5 is used and thrown into the general fund.

1517
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:36,626
And so if he did it with that $3, he's absolutely going to do it with the other two that should be going towards public access, the 1% that's supposed to go to public access.

1518
01:50:36,646 --> 01:50:37,346
He's going to do that.

1519
01:50:37,867 --> 01:50:39,048
So it's not my loss.

1520
01:50:39,528 --> 01:50:40,569
It is my loss a little bit.

1521
01:50:40,949 --> 01:50:46,994
But it's really, the people that want a voice in this city, they're not going to have one.

1522
01:50:47,634 --> 01:50:48,395
It's going to be silent.

1523
01:50:48,635 --> 01:50:53,579
It's going to be more silent than it ever was once there's no chance of public access.

1524
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:57,062
So we're missing out on culture.

1525
01:50:59,093 --> 01:51:04,917
plays, you name it, and they should be working hand-in-hand with the auditorium that we already have.

1526
01:51:05,878 --> 01:51:11,561
I don't see why a station can't work hand-in-hand with the big auditorium, the Chevalier Auditorium.

1527
01:51:11,701 --> 01:51:15,083
I don't understand why the mayor wouldn't want that to happen.

1528
01:51:15,143 --> 01:51:21,747
Well, I understand why he doesn't want it to happen, because he doesn't want to be challenged on his views and his politics and his policies.

1529
01:51:22,147 --> 01:51:25,029
And that's why he keeps the whole program silent.

1530
01:51:25,249 --> 01:51:25,810
So thank you.

1531
01:51:27,647 --> 01:51:31,009
Councilor De La Russo, on the motion to receive.

1532
01:51:31,029 --> 01:51:31,950
Would you like to speak on this again?

1533
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:33,351
I'd just like to add a little something.

1534
01:51:33,371 --> 01:51:34,191
Name and address for the record.

1535
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:34,631
One more time.

1536
01:51:34,812 --> 01:51:36,913
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford.

1537
01:51:37,513 --> 01:51:40,535
Councilor Brianna Longo-Kern, you're right, and I brought up computers before.

1538
01:51:40,555 --> 01:51:42,837
The classes for the computer is so essential.

1539
01:51:43,417 --> 01:51:50,782
I'm learning more about Final Cut Pro than I ever learned before, and it is so important because they keep upgrading these systems, and I'm an old-timer.

1540
01:51:51,462 --> 01:51:57,146
As Councilor Penter, I was at Wakefield, and the president told me that they had three

1541
01:51:57,972 --> 01:51:58,753
political shows.

1542
01:51:59,113 --> 01:52:05,417
Catherine Clark, before she was a Congresswoman, Candidate Wong, and then there was a third person.

1543
01:52:06,238 --> 01:52:10,681
The elected officials had their own shows, which they have in many, many towns, so you people are all missing out.

1544
01:52:11,442 --> 01:52:15,965
And I talked to Stephanie Burke about the radio idea, and this is interesting.

1545
01:52:16,025 --> 01:52:20,248
She said, there is money available from Homeland Security for just such a thing.

1546
01:52:20,708 --> 01:52:25,952
So I'm glad we had this discussion tonight, because now I'm going to go back to Stephanie Burke with that idea.

1547
01:52:26,503 --> 01:52:31,165
And the final thing, as far as owning the old building, thank you, Jeanne, very much for your kind words.

1548
01:52:32,006 --> 01:52:35,528
I just think owning is a tangible, and the money doesn't dissolve.

1549
01:52:35,588 --> 01:52:40,470
So we have something, and the arts community has something, but I like the idea of the Chevalier, too.

1550
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:41,951
Thank you very much, City Council.

1551
01:52:43,051 --> 01:52:43,572
Councilor Max.

1552
01:52:44,892 --> 01:52:45,913
Thank you, Mr. President.

1553
01:52:46,133 --> 01:52:49,254
And both speakers brought up some very valid points.

1554
01:52:49,355 --> 01:52:52,816
And Jeanne, you're 100% correct.

1555
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:56,118
Every resident in this community is losing out.

1556
01:52:57,205 --> 01:53:08,408
You know, even if you're not involved in local cable or want to produce your own show, the fact that we don't have the opportunity to look at high school sports on our local access.

1557
01:53:08,988 --> 01:53:17,891
I remember the days where they used to have live feeds and you could watch the Meffitt High football game live on local cable for those people that couldn't get to the game.

1558
01:53:19,153 --> 01:53:26,799
Council President, I think it was you that a year or two ago asked that all the boards and commissions, their meetings be taped.

1559
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:45,132
On channel 16, which I thought, and I think it was voted by this council, an excellent way of providing transparency in this community and allowing residents to get involved or look into the process of government.

1560
01:53:45,713 --> 01:53:48,515
And I thought that was an excellent suggestion, but again,

1561
01:53:49,229 --> 01:53:53,051
The residents are being stifled because there's no access in this community.

1562
01:53:54,292 --> 01:54:04,437
Several weeks back, we had what I would say is one of the largest meetings in this community in the last 25 years regarding parking enforcement.

1563
01:54:05,178 --> 01:54:11,581
And that's an issue that's going to impact every resident in this community, every business owner in this community.

1564
01:54:12,122 --> 01:54:16,624
And we couldn't get that on local access to show the meeting.

1565
01:54:16,971 --> 01:54:17,751
The meeting was taped.

1566
01:54:18,132 --> 01:54:19,673
We couldn't get it on local access.

1567
01:54:20,413 --> 01:54:34,562
However, every other event, Mr. President, if you look in Channel 15, is the mayor cutting a ribbon, the mayor going to the dog run, saying how we're going to have a dog park, telling people we're going to have a dog park in the near future.

1568
01:54:35,762 --> 01:54:41,486
You know, it's almost laughable what is happening in this community now.

1569
01:54:42,066 --> 01:54:46,669
As Councilor Pinto said, you have one person controlling all access.

1570
01:54:47,222 --> 01:54:48,784
all media access.

1571
01:54:49,244 --> 01:55:02,576
Even the cameras here that are on the blink every so often, we have to beg the mayor to fix the cameras so viewers at home can watch our meeting without the tape going off and on, without the voice going up and down.

1572
01:55:02,596 --> 01:55:05,939
You know, it really is a shame what's going on.

1573
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:11,164
And I, as one member of the council, Mr. President,

1574
01:55:11,548 --> 01:55:19,090
think maybe it has come time that maybe that we do look at a class action suit, Mr. President.

1575
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:35,734
And I don't take this very lightly when I mention it, Mr. President, but there's no reason that ratepayers' money, week after week, month after month, year after year, is going into funding something that we're not providing to the residents of this community.

1576
01:55:36,757 --> 01:55:48,140
And it's no different than resident permit parking stickers for years that may have had residents buy permit parking stickers and never enforced permit parking in our city.

1577
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,160
Never enforced it.

1578
01:55:50,560 --> 01:56:04,243
It wasn't until one of the news stations came down and did a story on it that it uncovered many people parking on our streets, on resident permit streets,

1579
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:11,214
that didn't have stickers from other cities, days on end, and no enforcement, Mr. President.

1580
01:56:11,594 --> 01:56:21,401
So, there seems to be a pattern here with the mayor of, you know, in one breath saying, leadership that works, and on the other breath, doing absolutely nothing.

1581
01:56:22,661 --> 01:56:23,402
Absolutely nothing.

1582
01:56:23,722 --> 01:56:26,684
If I look in the local media again, in one of the websites,

1583
01:56:27,067 --> 01:56:39,314
and see another picture of the mayor walking around promoting candidates running for public office and not doing his job here at City Hall, Mr. President, to me, that's grounds for termination right there.

1584
01:56:40,135 --> 01:56:45,918
We have so many issues that really, you should not see the mayor at a ribbon cutting for the next five years.

1585
01:56:46,278 --> 01:56:54,283
His head should be buried in that office, working on the issues that he has promised the people and the residents of this community for the last several years.

1586
01:56:55,593 --> 01:56:58,354
And the inaction in this community speaks volumes.

1587
01:56:58,855 --> 01:57:02,636
It speaks volumes, Mr. President, on what's going on throughout this city.

1588
01:57:03,497 --> 01:57:07,319
And what you're hearing now is a sense of frustration, because it's not one issue.

1589
01:57:07,719 --> 01:57:10,960
It's many, many, many issues that are starting to build up.

1590
01:57:11,621 --> 01:57:13,942
And people are starting to get wise to it, saying, you know what?

1591
01:57:14,362 --> 01:57:15,162
Enough's enough.

1592
01:57:16,063 --> 01:57:17,523
Enough's enough in this community.

1593
01:57:18,124 --> 01:57:20,885
And whether it's the cable, whether it's parking enforcement.

1594
01:57:21,185 --> 01:57:25,247
And just if I could, Mr. President, on parking enforcement, Councilor Prenta brought up

1595
01:57:25,755 --> 01:57:52,773
and I won't steal his thunder, a few weeks back, the fact that the language that supposedly the mayor had added to the parking contract that stated there'll be two 30-minute free parking spots in each of the five business districts, and that there'll be a certain number of single head meters in each of the five business districts, as Councilor Penta so eloquently stated,

1596
01:57:53,244 --> 01:57:57,548
That language was never included in the final contract that was signed.

1597
01:57:58,148 --> 01:58:04,013
And I asked the city solicitor, and I'm not going to speak on his behalf, I said, why is that language not in the contract?

1598
01:58:04,394 --> 01:58:07,496
And he said, that language is outside of the contract.

1599
01:58:07,897 --> 01:58:13,942
He said, there's a lot of language that is included in the request for proposal that is not in the contract.

1600
01:58:14,362 --> 01:58:22,108
but enables the city to move forward on issues like providing additional free parking spots in the community.

1601
01:58:22,508 --> 01:58:35,278
So when the mayor came back to the business owners and said, I'm going to give two additional free 30-minute parking spots in each of the five business districts, he didn't have to negotiate that with Republic, the Tennessee company.

1602
01:58:35,678 --> 01:58:41,923
He did that unilaterally, and he did it without any vote of this council and without any other support.

1603
01:58:42,846 --> 01:58:54,754
In my situation, Mr. President, I would ask that the mayor increase that five-fold, that at least 10 spots, free 30-minute pocket spots be in each of the business districts.

1604
01:58:55,755 --> 01:59:06,562
And maybe at some point we'll get to a point where Republic says, hey, this changes the financial impact of the contract and we can no longer do this unless we negotiate a new contract.

1605
01:59:07,203 --> 01:59:10,245
But the fact is, Mr. President, the mayor was able to do that

1606
01:59:11,223 --> 01:59:17,327
without any support of Republic or this council or any vote in this community.

1607
01:59:18,207 --> 01:59:26,393
And I think, Mr. President, what we're seeing right now is not leadership from a mayor, but dictatorship, Mr. President.

1608
01:59:26,893 --> 01:59:28,434
And that's what we're experiencing now.

1609
01:59:28,834 --> 01:59:39,121
After 28 years of the same dictator, we're seeing that it's no longer consensus and trying to find out what's best for our community, Mr. President.

1610
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:40,882
It's someone just leading

1611
01:59:41,405 --> 01:59:42,146
as a dictator.

1612
01:59:42,626 --> 01:59:45,889
And I think that's a sad commentary, what's happening in this community.

1613
01:59:46,369 --> 01:59:51,293
And I hope residents of this community get wise to it, Mr. President.

1614
01:59:52,234 --> 01:59:53,374
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

1615
01:59:54,175 --> 01:59:55,977
Castaneda, Andrew, Cushing Street.

1616
01:59:58,839 --> 01:59:59,519
Don't recollect.

1617
01:59:59,539 --> 01:59:59,519
13.

1618
02:00:03,302 --> 02:00:09,167
I'm trying to blank.

1619
02:00:10,333 --> 02:00:11,633
I'm not here to challenge anyone.

1620
02:00:11,893 --> 02:00:12,734
It's not my style.

1621
02:00:14,334 --> 02:00:22,196
It seems to me, however, in a city of this size, they should have TV3 broadcasting or government access.

1622
02:00:23,896 --> 02:00:25,717
Surrounding towns and cities are doing it.

1623
02:00:26,757 --> 02:00:28,517
And he's sitting on the money.

1624
02:00:28,537 --> 02:00:30,338
He's raping his money.

1625
02:00:31,758 --> 02:00:32,038
I don't know.

1626
02:00:32,078 --> 02:00:36,659
It's just a sad state of affairs, especially during an election month coming up.

1627
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,580
You would think there would be a

1628
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:48,720
It's a great avenue for politicians to talk about what they think is important to help the citizens.

1629
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,823
It's a sad state of affairs.

1630
02:00:51,943 --> 02:00:55,687
It's a complete mystery.

1631
02:00:56,608 --> 02:01:01,013
I wish it gets back on the air so the community can use their monies.

1632
02:01:01,433 --> 02:01:01,754
Thank you.

1633
02:01:03,734 --> 02:01:06,816
The motion of Councilor DelaRusso to receive and place it on file.

1634
02:01:06,836 --> 02:01:07,476
All those in favor?

1635
02:01:08,237 --> 02:01:09,958
On the motion, Councilor Penta.

1636
02:01:11,079 --> 02:01:13,000
I don't think we should receive this and place it on file.

1637
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:13,820
I think this should be forwarded.

1638
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:14,761
That's the only motion right now.

1639
02:01:16,182 --> 02:01:16,902
Who made that motion?

1640
02:01:16,962 --> 02:01:17,843
Councilor DelaRusso.

1641
02:01:17,963 --> 02:01:27,929
Well, I will amend the motion to not be received and placed on file, and have this forwarded to the Mayor, and to have him make an answer.

1642
02:01:28,349 --> 02:01:33,032
Do you intend to, and when do you intend to have public access up and running in the city of Memphis?

1643
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:35,020
It's as simple as that.

1644
02:01:36,781 --> 02:01:37,761
Well, let's just do it again.

1645
02:01:37,801 --> 02:01:38,341
You know something?

1646
02:01:38,401 --> 02:01:46,283
And the more he doesn't respond, it just shows his arrogance and, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, his dictatorial attitude toward everything that's going on.

1647
02:01:46,743 --> 02:01:47,503
He's got no right.

1648
02:01:47,844 --> 02:01:52,685
He has absolutely no right to sit on $303,000 and not explain to the taxpayers what he's trying to do.

1649
02:01:53,085 --> 02:01:54,605
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1650
02:01:55,005 --> 02:02:00,807
I believe the paper that was before us was for the gentleman to address the council on whether or not we should purchase an arts and media center.

1651
02:02:02,268 --> 02:02:03,409
That is the paper before us.

1652
02:02:03,949 --> 02:02:04,730
Thank you for your point.

1653
02:02:07,792 --> 02:02:09,713
On the motion to send this to the mayor.

1654
02:02:09,893 --> 02:02:10,093
Yes.

1655
02:02:10,393 --> 02:02:11,074
All those in favor?

1656
02:02:11,154 --> 02:02:11,975
Roll call vote, Mr. Mayor.

1657
02:02:11,995 --> 02:02:13,175
Roll call has been requested.

1658
02:02:13,215 --> 02:02:15,317
Can you read back from the board what exactly we asked for?

1659
02:02:15,337 --> 02:02:17,578
The motion is to send this to the mayor on where he is going.

1660
02:02:17,598 --> 02:02:24,503
Does he plan on having a- When does he intend, where, and when does he intend to have public access up and running in the city of Medford?

1661
02:02:26,204 --> 02:02:27,605
On the motion, the clerk will call the roll.

1662
02:02:30,687 --> 02:02:31,568
Vice President Carvio.

1663
02:02:32,877 --> 02:02:33,697
Councilor De La Russa?

1664
02:02:34,997 --> 02:02:35,558
Councilor Nye?

1665
02:02:35,618 --> 02:02:35,818
No.

1666
02:02:36,578 --> 02:02:37,298
Councilor Kern?

1667
02:02:37,758 --> 02:02:37,918
Yes.

1668
02:02:38,798 --> 02:02:39,278
Councilor Motz?

1669
02:02:39,298 --> 02:02:39,398
Yes.

1670
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:40,739
Councilor Panda?

1671
02:02:40,779 --> 02:02:40,859
Yes.

1672
02:02:41,859 --> 02:02:42,519
President Caruso?

1673
02:02:42,839 --> 02:02:43,119
No.

1674
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:46,520
By a vote of five in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

1675
02:02:50,561 --> 02:02:51,101
Four and three.

1676
02:02:51,141 --> 02:02:51,981
I apologize.

1677
02:02:52,621 --> 02:02:54,121
Jeannie was against it.

1678
02:02:55,342 --> 02:02:55,802
All right.

1679
02:02:56,362 --> 02:03:00,763
On the motion to go suspend rule number 33 to take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

1680
02:03:00,783 --> 02:03:01,383
All those in favor?

1681
02:03:02,235 --> 02:03:03,557
All those opposed, the ayes have it.

1682
02:03:09,485 --> 02:03:11,608
Communication from the mayor.

1683
02:03:11,628 --> 02:03:13,831
Do we have another paper there?

1684
02:03:13,851 --> 02:03:14,652
I apologize.

1685
02:03:16,295 --> 02:03:18,237
I was laughing at my miscalculation.

1686
02:03:19,533 --> 02:03:24,957
14-728, communications from the mayor, council president, and members of the Medford City Council.

1687
02:03:24,977 --> 02:03:33,783
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $173,400 from the sale of Lots and Graves account to the Cemetery Department salary account.

1688
02:03:34,183 --> 02:03:39,287
This recommended appropriation is requested in accordance with page 40 of the fiscal 2015 budget.

1689
02:03:39,707 --> 02:03:45,471
The Cemetery Department salary account is reduced each year in anticipation of an appropriation from sales of Lots and Graves.

1690
02:03:46,154 --> 02:03:56,679
In addition, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $159,759 from perpetual care to the cemetery department expense budget.

1691
02:03:57,199 --> 02:04:02,982
This recommended appropriation is requested in accordance with page 41 of the fiscal 2015 budget.

1692
02:04:03,502 --> 02:04:09,305
The cemetery expense budget is reduced each year in anticipation of an appropriation from perpetual care.

1693
02:04:10,325 --> 02:04:11,806
Signed, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

1694
02:04:12,807 --> 02:04:13,347
Is there a motion?

1695
02:04:16,219 --> 02:04:20,221
Motion for approval.

1696
02:04:20,301 --> 02:04:22,363
Vice President Caravello, all those in favor?

1697
02:04:22,383 --> 02:04:22,883
Aye.

1698
02:04:23,463 --> 02:04:24,264
All those opposed?

1699
02:04:24,304 --> 02:04:24,944
The ayes have it.

1700
02:04:28,206 --> 02:04:31,528
The motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1701
02:04:33,769 --> 02:04:34,670
Thank you, Councilor.

1702
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:39,652
President Camuso, I think the end of suspension has to do with ending the meeting.

1703
02:04:39,692 --> 02:04:45,516
I just wanted to bring up, we got a response from the mayor with regards to the mayor's office with regards to

1704
02:04:46,749 --> 02:04:53,731
The ledger sheet showing funds received and directed to fund for City Dog Park, I don't think this was brought up, 60,000 from J.F.

1705
02:04:54,371 --> 02:04:58,272
White and $1,766.93 was a donation from Boston Volunteer Solutions who ran the Doggy Fun Run 2013.

1706
02:04:58,312 --> 02:05:00,392
Supposedly there's more funds coming in from the Doggy Fun Run 2014.

1707
02:05:12,998 --> 02:05:15,560
I wanted to question if we could send a request.

1708
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:22,605
I believe there's also a dog show three or four years ago that was raising money specifically so Medford could open a dog park.

1709
02:05:22,685 --> 02:05:27,989
So that would be my question to the mayor's office, what monies were included in that.

1710
02:05:28,909 --> 02:05:30,551
And I just want to bring up the issue again.

1711
02:05:30,611 --> 02:05:37,736
I was in South Boston over the weekend and I saw, it was a beautiful day, a little chilly, but beautiful.

1712
02:05:38,376 --> 02:05:40,678
There's a dog park in South Boston and is,

1713
02:05:41,203 --> 02:05:43,284
nothing more than a fence.

1714
02:05:43,704 --> 02:05:48,666
And there were more people and dogs in this dog park, right on the water.

1715
02:05:49,386 --> 02:05:51,067
It was beautiful.

1716
02:05:51,187 --> 02:05:52,067
I just stopped.

1717
02:05:52,107 --> 02:05:57,189
I was doing an ALS walk, and I stopped and looked, and I just threw my hands up.

1718
02:05:57,209 --> 02:05:58,549
My husband's like, what's the matter with you?

1719
02:05:58,569 --> 02:06:00,630
I'm like, what is the problem?

1720
02:06:01,070 --> 02:06:03,731
Well, what's $200,000 about that?

1721
02:06:03,811 --> 02:06:09,974
Yeah, it's definitely, I mean, we have $62,000 here, and more money's coming in from the doggie fun run.

1722
02:06:11,178 --> 02:06:19,982
Councilman Marks has a petition going out and he's chaired this issue and this council has voted numerous times for a dog park, but I couldn't help myself.

1723
02:06:20,202 --> 02:06:38,230
Number one, we got some of our answers and number two, just to see a fence with a few barrels and some turf, you know, it wasn't turf, it was cheap material and everybody was out having their coffee and there was probably 20 dogs in the dog park.

1724
02:06:38,690 --> 02:06:39,670
I just wanted to bring that up

1725
02:06:41,597 --> 02:06:47,578
all this council can do is just bring up issues again and again because eventually they do, some of them do stick.

1726
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,479
So again, I believe this city needs a dog park.

1727
02:06:50,499 --> 02:06:52,179
We have the money here for it.

1728
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:57,341
There's a number of spots that I could recommend as could any of this city council.

1729
02:06:57,741 --> 02:06:59,701
And I just really hope the mayor moves forward.

1730
02:07:01,242 --> 02:07:01,562
Thank you.

1731
02:07:02,402 --> 02:07:03,722
On that motion, all those in favor?

1732
02:07:04,262 --> 02:07:04,862
All those opposed?

1733
02:07:04,882 --> 02:07:05,423
The ayes have it.

1734
02:07:05,903 --> 02:07:06,803
Why we're on this?

1735
02:07:11,672 --> 02:07:13,394
We are under suspension of the rule.

1736
02:07:14,455 --> 02:07:27,551
Okay, offered by Councilor Knight, in light of the upcoming celebration of Veterans Day, be it resolved that the Medford City Council adjourn this meeting on 10-28-2014 in honor of the men and women serving in our armed forces.

1737
02:07:29,533 --> 02:07:30,835
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1738
02:07:31,486 --> 02:07:36,388
I felt it was appropriate that we bring this resolution forward this week, whereas we're not going to be meeting the week of Veterans Day.

1739
02:07:37,328 --> 02:07:43,071
As we all know, the country has been embroiled in turmoil for a number of years overseas in the Middle East.

1740
02:07:43,611 --> 02:07:52,194
And we've had many men and women return to Medford and return to Massachusetts, suffering from the effects of being overseas at war.

1741
02:07:53,035 --> 02:07:58,697
I think that we've seen a number of people come back from being overseas that are suffering from traumatic brain injury.

1742
02:07:59,479 --> 02:08:10,235
I just think that it's nice that we raise awareness and that we thank the men and women who've actually dedicated their lives and dedicated their time and dedicated their souls to protecting our freedoms, our democracy, and our country.

1743
02:08:11,697 --> 02:08:12,439
All those in favor?

1744
02:08:13,282 --> 02:08:13,922
All those opposed?

1745
02:08:13,942 --> 02:08:14,542
The ayes have it.

1746
02:08:15,042 --> 02:08:15,763
Thank you, Councillor.

1747
02:08:16,423 --> 02:08:21,304
And just a reminder, there will be no council meeting next Tuesday evening because of election day.

1748
02:08:21,824 --> 02:08:25,865
And the following Tuesday, there will not be a meeting either because it is Veterans Day.

1749
02:08:26,445 --> 02:08:29,466
So therefore, we'll be meeting in three weeks from tonight.

1750
02:08:31,186 --> 02:08:40,108
Offered by Councillor Knight and Councillor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its sincere and deep condolences to the family of Martin Ford on his recent passing.

1751
02:08:40,508 --> 02:08:42,489
If we could please rise for a moment of silence.

1752
02:08:50,312 --> 02:08:51,773
And just one announcement.

1753
02:08:51,833 --> 02:09:00,359
Last week, when the topic came up during our meeting regarding ballot questions, the chair was in doubt whether we could take a stance as a body or not.

1754
02:09:00,879 --> 02:09:15,970
I got advised this week by the appropriate authorities that an elected body can take a stance on ballot questions, but they cannot take a stance on individual elected office, for governor, state rep, lieutenant governor example.

1755
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:18,472
So I did seek out that answer because I was

1756
02:09:19,834 --> 02:09:22,875
Didn't know the answer last week, so that is where it is.

1757
02:09:25,616 --> 02:09:26,356
Councilor Marks.

1758
02:09:27,016 --> 02:09:27,996
Thank you, Mr. President.

1759
02:09:28,196 --> 02:09:39,079
And also, last week, the issue of the South Method neighborhood safety walk was brought up to a resolution offered by myself.

1760
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:42,380
And we had a number of South Method residents here.

1761
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:48,322
And at the time, it was mentioned that there was a violation

1762
02:09:48,855 --> 02:09:55,037
of the open meeting law if more than four members of the council attended this particular meeting.

1763
02:09:55,857 --> 02:10:07,520
And where part of my resolution was to try to expand this particular safety walk, I sent an email to the city solicitor and also the city clerk.

1764
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:14,581
And I believe we all got a response back via email from the city solicitor, Mark Rumley.

1765
02:10:15,141 --> 02:10:17,522
And I just would like to read it for the edification of

1766
02:10:18,219 --> 02:10:30,548
people that may be watching, I don't want anyone to believe that there was any doubt that there was no violation of the open meeting law at this neighborhood walk.

1767
02:10:30,908 --> 02:10:45,739
But it says, dear Councilor Marks, you have asked me whether the attendance of city councilors at an event organized by a private citizen group for the purpose of addressing neighborhood safety and other related concerns could potentially be a violation of the open meeting law.

1768
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:47,660
My answer is that the attendance

1769
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:52,453
by City Council is at such an event would not be a violation of the Open Meeting Law.

1770
02:10:52,994 --> 02:10:59,299
The basis for my conclusion is that General Law Chapter 38, the Open Meeting Law applies to public bodies.

1771
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:13,510
According to the facts you have presented to me, the neighborhood safety walk was organized by a private citizen group and was neither scheduled by the City Council nor was it subject to the Council's direction or control.

1772
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:15,952
It was therefore essentially an opportunity

1773
02:11:16,427 --> 02:11:26,795
for the participants, including the counselors, to observe conditions in a particular neighborhood rather than to make decisions through a vote of a quorum or the city council.

1774
02:11:27,516 --> 02:11:32,980
Even though the private citizen group that called for the walk was concerned with public issues, i.e.

1775
02:11:33,061 --> 02:11:44,670
neighborhood safety and related issues, it is not a public body as it is not an entity within the executive or legislative branches of state government or within any county, district, city, region, or town.

1776
02:11:45,182 --> 02:11:46,423
I hope this answers your opinion.

1777
02:11:46,844 --> 02:11:47,965
Respectfully, Mark Rumley.

1778
02:11:48,565 --> 02:11:49,906
Thank you very much, Councillor Marks.

1779
02:11:50,067 --> 02:11:57,053
And also, I'm glad you brought this up because the Attorney General's office is actually the oversight authority on this particular matter now.

1780
02:11:57,454 --> 02:12:03,199
It used to be the District Attorney's office, but within the last four or five years, it changed under the jurisdiction of the AG's office.

1781
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:13,523
And the AG's office, if anyone wants to call them, if any deliberations or anything come up at a meeting, whether it's public body or not, it could be constitute a violation.

1782
02:12:14,003 --> 02:12:24,046
So I know at your meeting there was no deliberations, but even talking about something that maybe the council has jurisdiction over, and I'm glad you asked the question to the city solicitor though.

1783
02:12:24,446 --> 02:12:31,028
But any further questions, you can ask the Attorney General's office, who is the authority, and they will give guidance to any public body.

1784
02:12:32,515 --> 02:12:40,339
On the motion of the records, the records were passed to Councilor Knight.

1785
02:12:40,379 --> 02:12:41,920
How did you find the records, Councilor Knight?

1786
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:44,582
Mr. President, I reviewed the records and I found them in order.

1787
02:12:44,822 --> 02:12:50,665
I took special consideration to look at the South Medford neighborhood walk to be sure that everything there was in order.

1788
02:12:50,705 --> 02:12:55,688
There were 13 amendments and they certainly all look like they were right to me, Mr. President, so I'd move for approval.

1789
02:12:56,387 --> 02:12:58,553
On the motion of approval of the records, all those in favor?

1790
02:12:59,315 --> 02:12:59,956
All those opposed?

1791
02:12:59,976 --> 02:13:00,538
The ayes have it.

1792
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:03,084
On the motion for adjournment, all those in favor?

1793
02:13:03,746 --> 02:13:04,348
All those opposed?

1794
02:13:04,368 --> 02:13:04,889
The ayes have it.
