    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=119.783s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=121.144s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=122.064s">Members</a>  of the Council, my name is Robert Abruzzi. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=124.106s">I'm</a>  an attorney with offices here in Medford at 92 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=128.188s">I'm</a>  here on behalf of the petitioner, Coles, in support of this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=133.692s">With</a>  me also this evening is Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=136.754s">Serena</a>  Bierce, who is the district manager for Coles, the district she <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=144.425s">is</a>  in charge of, consists of a total of 12 stores, 11 of which are in Massachusetts, one in Southern New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=151.487s">Obviously,</a>  one of these stores is the Medford location. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=155.328s">So</a>  at Cole's other stores, they typically open for Black Friday and on several days, maybe as much as a week leading up to Christmas, up to and including Christmas Eve. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=168.092s">Here</a>  in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=169.452s">You're</a>  in favor, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=170.533s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=171.293s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=172.178s">Just</a>  the public hearing, in favor and against at this point.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=175.901s">I've</a>  already indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=177.062s">Do</a>  you want me to present the case at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=178.844s">We're</a>  going to have the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=180.145s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=180.365s">And</a>  then you can present your case.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=181.326s">All</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=183.848s">Anyone</a>  else in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=186.971s">Seeing</a>  and hearing none, I now open up this portion of the public hearing for those in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=193.977s">Opposition,</a>  seeing and hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=196.639s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=197.52s">Hi,</a>  Bill Barabino. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=200.872s">3920</a>  mystic valley parkway, suite 109. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=205.874s">So</a>  my concern is I didn't, I got a letter a couple of years ago that they were extending the hours, I think in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=213.256s">And</a>  I didn't come to the hearing, you know, but I knew that they, that's what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=217.618s">And</a>  at night, early in the morning, I get woken up and both my, my wife too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=223.52s">And</a>  so when I saw this, I felt that my obligation to take my time out of the day to, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=228.512s">I</a>  appreciate Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=230.093s">I</a>  mean, I like Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=231.053s">I</a>  appreciate them trying to make a successful business. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=234.214s">However,</a>  what you have is 109, which is right next to, essentially, the mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=244.839s">And</a>  so I live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=246.059s">I'm</a>  an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=247.92s">I</a>  have an office there, the same office, 92 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=250.441s">We</a>  both, I know I own and pay those taxes timely. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=256.925s">That</a>  being said, my wife lives with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=261.007s">She's</a>  a dentist. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=262.228s">She</a>  has to drive from Medford to Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=266.11s">And</a>  she has to do that every day, six days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=271.093s">Her</a>  parents live with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=272.854s">One's</a>  83 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=274.535s">He's</a>  in good health. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=276.817s">The</a>  other one is my mother-in-law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=279.398s">She</a>  is 74. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=281.88s">She's</a>  got heart problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=282.88s">She</a>  doesn't sleep that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=283.961s">She's</a>  been taken to Mass General a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=286.409s">And</a>  we're fortunate where the fire department here is so quick to respond that we couldn't imagine going anywhere else when she has had to leave to go to Mass General, which has been several times over the last half decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=298.774s">But</a>  given that we've had an increase in traffic, I think the last time they increased it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=307.272s">And</a>  it's cumbersome, not so much for me, but for my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=310.793s">And</a>  she's got to get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=311.894s">She's</a>  doing surgery all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=313.334s">And</a>  it's a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=315.075s">And</a>  I just don't see how this is just going to disrupt our ability to have a nice sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=325.098s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=326.919s">Anyone</a>  else in opposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=329.02s">Opposition?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=330.98s">Seeing</a>  and hearing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=332.041s">Attorney</a>  Abruzzese.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=336.693s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=337.973s">Uh,</a>  I appreciate the comments of the gentleman who just spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=343.675s">However,</a>  I would ask the, uh, the council to take note of the fact that the, the, uh, condominium building he's talking about is to the rear of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=353.658s">And,</a>  um, the activity would primarily be in the parking lot in front of, uh, in front of calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=360.36s">We're</a>  talking about a total of, uh, not more than 10 days per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=366.381s">Black</a>  Friday and perhaps five or six days leading up to Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=371.862s">I</a>  think it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=376.283s">Coles</a>  is indirectly a big taxpayer and everyone has a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=382.444s">Obviously,</a>  there should not be any disturbance to the neighbors, but I think that the impact would be minimal in terms of the building, which is behind the shopping center. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=394.945s">and</a>  not in the front parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=400.386s">I</a>  know that Councilor Knight has spoken to me about having a police officer on duty for the Black Friday holiday, and the petitioner is certainly willing to go along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=413.788s">And</a>  I think it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=415.969s">I</a>  would ask the Council's indulgence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=418.869s">And</a>  if there were to be any problems, we certainly could address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=426.162s">I</a>  think that, you know, we're in a position where we want to try to support business as much as we can, and this is also a service to the local shoppers as well.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=439.027s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Caraviello, and then Councilor Dello Russo, chairperson of licensing, for a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=447.71s">Zoning,</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=448.851s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=450.271s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=452.152s">Zoning,</a>  and then Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=455.055s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=456.556s">I've</a>  reviewed the paperwork, and I find everything to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=459.018s">I've</a>  had conversations with Attorney Abruzzi and also with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=463.582s">Pierce</a>  relative to requiring a police detail, especially for the Black Friday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=469.147s">And</a>  they've been willing to accommodate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=472.069s">So</a>  I'd be willing to move for approval, provided that we amend the paper to require a police detail on Black Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=478.634s">And</a>  I think that it might be a good idea to have a 90-day review, whereas this is an open-ended allowance.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=485.232s">On</a>  the motion of approval as amended, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=488.074s">Mr.</a>  President, I want a second approval and with the amendment that this permission for hours be restricted to Coles and not to the location.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=501.065s">On</a>  the motion that this stays with that particular portion of the Meadow Glen Mall, known as Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=507.13s">Kohl's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=507.791s">Exactly,</a>  known as Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=509.172s">So</a>  if it changes eventually, this no longer goes with a new business that may be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=513.476s">On</a>  the motion as amended, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=515.918s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=518.64s">Mr.</a>  Bruce, Attorney Bruce, when you say 10 days, they specified which days?</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=523.745s">They,</a>  well, it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=527.496s">The</a>  expectation is probably four or five days, actually, leading up to Christmas Eve. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=534.841s">I've</a>  put a limit not to exceed 10 days, depending upon what day of the week Christmas falls on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=540.506s">In</a>  some years, it may be, you know, maybe a full week prior to Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=545.95s">This</a>  particular year, Christmas, I believe this year is on a — I believe it's on a Thursday, so we're probably only talking four days this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=560.359s">And</a>  it would be appropriate, I think, for the council to require that when the particular days are determined that Coles notifies the city clerks so that you have a record of which particular days or notify the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=573.385s">A</a>  condition like that might be appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=576.466s">Yeah,</a>  my concern would actually be with the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=579.308s">We've</a>  met with the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=581.549s">Oh,</a>  geez. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=584.15s">I</a>  believe that was the end of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=587.153s">Chief</a>  of Police was before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=590.175s">I'm</a>  not sure exactly when he said it, but he said one of the biggest callers to the police department with regards to retail stores is Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=598.299s">And</a>  I think that's good with the fact that Kohl's is proactive trying to catch, you know, shoplifters, but it also takes a lot of time from the police officer's daily business. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=611.165s">I</a>  would make that a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=613.626s">If</a>  you only need the five days, maybe you could just <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=617.237s">I</a>  think 10 is a little excessive between Thanksgiving and Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=621.978s">But</a>  I think the chief of police definitely needs to be notified two weeks in advance of which days Kohl's is going to be open 24 hours so that he can prep the department and make sure there's enough officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=637.861s">I</a>  like the idea of a police detail, especially on Black Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=641.101s">I</a>  don't know if that's something that the council believes maybe should be all four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=646.563s">But</a>  that's just my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=648.665s">And</a>  you also have neighbors that are complaining about the possible noise, while crime is something that you definitely don't want to wake up to in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=658.613s">So</a>  I would recommend that the chief of police have to be notified of the days, the possible days that the colds will be open for 24 hours.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=670.763s">On</a>  the motion as amended, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=673.685s">I'd</a>  like to ask the gentleman to come back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=680.982s">You</a>  indicated that there was — the noise was a disturbance?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=684.505s">Yeah,</a>  and I'm glad — thank you for letting me come back, because the noises wouldn't come from the — I don't think I'd have any problem with the people coming into the store, that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=695.555s">What</a>  happens is you have the — what I assume to be third-party contractor vendors delivering stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=701.827s">So</a>  that's the concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=704.068s">So</a>  when they back in, first of all, they make the beeping sound, which just, and then there's a long corridor there in back of poles, and it just sort of echoes into the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=714.674s">So</a>  once you hear it, I mean, you know it's a truck and it's clear what it is, but it's only that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=721.598s">So</a>  I don't know, was that your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=723.94s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=724.3s">My</a>  question, I guess it runs along that with Councilor Langel-Curran relative to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=730.3s">the</a>  10 days being undetermined, but more importantly, um, this idea of being open from 11 at night to seven in the morning, which would allow them to have a 24 hour operation for up to 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=744.126s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=745.647s">So</a>  could we put it also further stipulation that no deliveries take place during that period of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=750.889s">If</a>  this is just for shopping and shopping alone, then I'm okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=754.991s">But</a>  if deliveries are going to be an issue and if that's an issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=758.435s">If</a>  I'm understanding you.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=760.516s">If</a>  there was no deliveries, that would solve my concerns, probably in full.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=769.902s">Can</a>  you address the microphone, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=771.203s">I</a>  just saw.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=772.304s">Are</a>  you saying that on occasion there have been deliveries prior to 7 in the morning?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=778.748s">I'm</a>  not saying it's calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=780.529s">I</a>  mean, there's a whole host of stores, so I don't want to put calls on them.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=784.072s">We</a>  don't have any problem stipulating that there'll be no deliveries before 7 a.m.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=789.092s">No,</a>  between the hours of 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=790.973s">and</a>  7 a.m.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=791.894s">Right,</a>  prior to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=796.596s">Not</a>  a problem.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=797.617s">On</a>  the motion as amended, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=800.619s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I agree with the restriction on delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=804.821s">I</a>  think that's a wise move. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=806.562s">Also,</a>  where the gentleman stated, Mr. President, that he believes it's deliveries from other parts or other stores within the mall that we as a council through the city clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=818.613s">send</a>  a letter to Meadow Glen Mall to make sure that no deliveries are happening prior to 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=824.535s">in</a>  the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=826.456s">I</a>  think that's only appropriate for the neighbors and abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=830.137s">I</a>  agree with council at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=831.698s">I</a>  like the 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=833.879s">And</a>  I also agree with councilor Lungo-Koehn that 10 days to me sounds a little excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=840.181s">I</a>  think we should probably put a cap on it, maybe at five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=844.003s">That</a>  would be something that, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=845.967s">I</a>  think would be amendable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=847.308s">I</a>  don't know how my other colleagues feel, but, uh, I would vote in support of this with the restriction on the deliveries and also with the 90 day review and also with council Lungo-Koehn brought up about limiting it to five days, uh, rather than 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=863.539s">And</a>  as, as was mentioned, uh, this is open ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=866.401s">So</a>  next year there's no need to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=869.223s">This</a>  is going to be in perpetuity, right?</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=872.525s">Uh,</a>  it, uh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=873.926s">Uh,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=875.09s">you</a>  know, provided there are no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=876.99s">Obviously,</a>  the council always has an opportunity to bring the petitioner back in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=883.832s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=885.853s">This</a>  is amended with a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=888.913s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=889.774s">My</a>  issue is actually the number of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=891.534s">I</a>  think 10 is excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=893.094s">The</a>  90-day review was offered by council.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=895.435s">I</a>  think I would like, you know, depending, again, depending upon what day of the week Christmas is, I'd like to have the opportunity to have at least a week during the Christmas season. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=903.795s">if</a>  you could agree that the Black Friday plus up to seven days during Christmas season for a total of eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=910.456s">But</a>  as I say, in most cases in this particular year, since Christmas is on a Thursday, I don't see this as being more than four or five days this year, but I would like the opportunity to have at least up to eight days.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=930.419s">I</a>  think it should be specific days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=932.52s">So</a>  the police department, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=934.452s">knows</a>  when this is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=936.612s">For</a>  example, every Black Friday, if we're going to do this, if this is going to be approved and approved from now until Kohl's is no longer there, I think the police department need to know that it's going to happen on Black Friday and it's going to happen three days before Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=955.557s">You</a>  can't have, although, you know, it's an amendment right now to have the police notified within two weeks prior to, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=962.385s">You're</a>  going to have them every year wondering when the 24-hour market, you know, when Kohl's is going to be open for 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=969.247s">I</a>  don't know if we've done this for any retail store, so I want to set good ground rules now in case there's other stores that want to follow the lead, whether that's in the Meadow Glen Mall or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=980.991s">We</a>  need to make sure that the store is safe and that the police department know that there is going to be an establishment where there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=989.635s">good</a>  amount of shoplifting like in any retail store, and they need to be aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=996.238s">You</a>  know, we know what happened to other Kohl's in the past, so I think we need more specifics on which actual days Kohl's is going to be open for 24 hours.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1024.02s">Mr.</a>  President, I, I'm not satisfied over the fact that we're going to give this thing out in finitum because this is the first tryout. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1030.663s">Um,</a>  regardless whether it's cold or anyone else, if you give it to them, it's going to set a precedent for any other type of store within the city of Medford department store or what have you claiming that the Christmas season, you know, it's going to be helpful to their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1044.768s">I've</a>  got no problem and allowing it to go through for the first year and on an annual basis has just come back because if everything works out satisfactory, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1051.684s">there</a>  should be no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1052.885s">But</a>  we're setting a precedent here to allow one department store, large as it might be, taxpayer as they might be, but there are a lot of small business folks here in the city of Medford, and they're taxpayers too, and they should be looked upon equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1068.197s">And</a>  I just think we're setting a precedent here that we're not gonna be able to offset because if Coles gets it, three or four other people or five or six, no matter what part of the city they might be in, might be just coming down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1081.801s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1082.442s">You</a>  can go to Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1083.562s">You</a>  can go to the new mall down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1086.484s">And</a>  I can see them wanting to operate and open during that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1090.686s">Restaurants</a>  to accommodate businesses that are going to be open during that period of time to satisfy people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1096.45s">I've</a>  got no problem in having a designated amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1099.512s">I</a>  have no problem allowing it for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1101.553s">I</a>  have no problem in giving the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1103.794s">But</a>  I am not in favor of making this a rule in perpetuity, to be honest with you.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1110.76s">But</a>  I think one of the councilors has suggested a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1114.403s">So</a>  the council would have the opportunity to review in 90 days whether or not there are any problems during this season, and assuming there is not, not require coals to come back again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1125.751s">If</a>  there are problems, then they could be addressed at the 90-day review time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1129.254s">Well,</a>  whether it's 90 days, or one day, or a year from now, the management of coals could be entirely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1136.439s">Issues</a>  could take place after the 90 days that could present a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1140.966s">I</a>  just — listen, I've got no problem with it, but I just can't — to me, 90 days means nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1144.93s">I</a>  just think they should come in on an annual basis on a case-by-case. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1148.153s">Because</a>  if we grant it for one, it's going to be very hard for us to be argued of being arbitrary and capricious and not allowing it to go to somebody else.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1159.242s">The</a>  Press Thank you very much, Mr. President, and through you to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1163.286s">Would</a>  Kohl's be amenable to providing the dates that they would like to be open? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1169.095s">say</a>  maybe the day following Veterans Day to the Chief of Police, would that be enough time? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1173.036s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1173.316s">I</a>  mean, I think we could specify now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1175.836s">It</a>  wouldn't be anything earlier than seven days prior to Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1180.677s">So,</a>  I mean, if that's the kind of specificity that the council is looking for, you know, you know, between, between the dates of December 18th and December 25th, Black Friday plus, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1196.45s">up</a>  to seven days between December 18 and December 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1199.133s">I</a>  mean, that's — those are specific dates, so — Mr. Rubinstein.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1208.001s">Mr.</a>  President — December 24, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1210.303s">The</a>  sad reality of retail in America is that it's become, unfortunately, common practice for retail stores of this magnitude <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1221.467s">to</a>  engage in these extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1225.529s">We</a>  can perhaps spend another evening talking about how this is a commentary on society. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1232.172s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1234.093s">But</a>  that's not our purpose here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1237.174s">They've</a>  made a reasonable request of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1240.416s">It's</a>  a matter that allows such a retail establishment to compete with peer stores to remain competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1251.088s">Maybe</a>  none of us like that idea that people are out shopping at 3 in the morning, but, you know, this is America. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1262.255s">They've</a>  made a reasonable request, and also we've put very reasonable amendments to this request, one of them being a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1274.822s">And</a>  so with regards to precedent-setting, at that point of 90 days, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1280.658s">Well,</a>  it's all fresh in our minds, fresh after the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1284.121s">We'll</a>  have them in here and review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1286.983s">And</a>  if at that time that we want to limit it to four days, we can do that based on the experience of how this went during this holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1297.371s">If</a>  at that time we say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1299.892s">This</a>  was nothing but a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1301.954s">We're</a>  not going to let it happen anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1303.515s">We're</a>  going to rescind this permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1305.617s">Or</a>  my suspicion is that we're going to get to nine days and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1310.627s">It</a>  went without any unexpected incident, and it may continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1315.73s">So</a>  I think, again, I'd like to move the question as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1322.413s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1323.794s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1324.655s">I</a>  agree with my Councilor De La Rosa here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1327.216s">You</a>  know, the holiday season is a very important time for these stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1332.639s">They've</a>  only got so many days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1334.14s">And</a>  now they're facing more competition from the new assembly mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1339.49s">All</a>  the outlet stores over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1341.711s">And</a>  I'm sure they're going to be open in the same hours as they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1345.312s">And</a>  it's not fair to us to saddle these guys with these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1352.715s">They</a>  said there's going to be no deliveries after a certain hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1355.216s">They're</a>  going to have a policeman there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1356.296s">They're</a>  going to specify the days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1358.257s">And</a>  like I said, come 90 days, if it doesn't work out, then that'll be a story for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1368.21s">I</a>  feel it's unfair to say no to these people, and all the other cities and towns are doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1373.054s">And</a>  then we complain that all our people are going elsewhere.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1377.476s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1378.837s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1380.218s">Just</a>  last, if we can move that as an amendment, what Attorney Bruzee said for Black Friday and seven days between December 18th and December 24th.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1394.365s">Are</a>  you withdrawing your original motion?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1396.026s">No,</a>  as well as notifying the chief specifically.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1398.547s">Your</a>  original motion, councillor, was for five days.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1402.27s">I</a>  didn't move that as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1403.59s">I</a>  just said I thought it was excessive.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1406.032s">It</a>  was an amendment, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1407.193s">Are</a>  you withdrawing that amendment for the new one?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1409.794s">Yes,</a>  I don't believe I made that as an amendment, but.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1411.775s">It</a>  was, the clerk has it written down as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1414.337s">So</a>  on the... Councilor?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1417.739s">I</a>  think Attorney Bruese was amendable to eight days, which this covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1421.922s">So</a>  maybe we can make it eight days rather than five.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1424.183s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1425.624s">Total</a>  of eight.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1426.844s">Total</a>  of eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1428.765s">Total</a>  of eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1429.226s">That's</a>  what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1429.746s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1431.407s">Total</a>  of eight with the notification for the chief two weeks before. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1435.249s">Is</a>  that our veterans day? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1439.611s">Veterans</a>  day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1441.352s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1441.952s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1442.755s">On</a>  the motion, as amended.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1444.996s">And</a>  a letter to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding deliveries that take place between 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1450.098s">and</a>  7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1450.718s">in</a>  the morning, other than Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1454.0s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1454.08s">I</a>  want to send a letter to Austin to refrain from truck deliveries between those hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1459.242s">We</a>  have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1459.642s">On</a>  behalf of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1461.703s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1464.304s">Some</a>  of the amendments I'm okay with, but I'm still concerned over the fact that you're going to review it in 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1471.828s">I</a>  think if I was a proprietor in the Meadow Glen Mall right now, and I knew that they could be open during those particular hours, I think I'd be coming here next and just saying, well, I'd like to be open, because you just gave it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1484.055s">And</a>  if I was a food establishment in the Meadow Glen Mall as they are, I think they're going to come in here, and they're going to want extended hours to accommodate the people who are going to be possibly shopping all night long. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1494.902s">And</a>  then if you go to Stations Landing, and if you want to go over there, and if those stores want to be open, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1500.751s">I've</a>  got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1502.011s">I</a>  don't understand why you just have to give it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1505.132s">Why</a>  can't we just give it out for this first year and see where this goes? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1508.053s">See</a>  how many other people want to apply for this 24—I mean, they're trailblazing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1513.015s">They're</a>  setting the trademark as to what they want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1515.676s">And</a>  let's just see how many other people come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1517.836s">It'd</a>  be a shame to have somebody come in here and want to have the exact same thing, and they get shot down because, quote-unquote, either the neighbors or someone, you know, want to object to it because they don't want to be disturbed during those particular hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1531.629s">You</a>  can put all the amendments you want onto this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1533.671s">That's</a>  the only thing that bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1535.212s">You</a>  know, I just don't think you should be able to give it out in perpetuity, because if you give it out in perpetuity, and if you bring it back in 90 days, and for whatever the problems, and even if there were problems, and you were going to address them, they still have the thing in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1547.863s">And</a>  to get rid of that, as both attorneys know, it's going to be pretty hard, because you haven't specifically laid down rules that could cancel out that rule of perpetuity while they're extended forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1559.577s">I've</a>  got no problem voting for it, but I want to amend it that it just become, on an annual basis, a first-time basis, and let's just see where we go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1567.743s">It's</a>  as simple as that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1569.184s">That</a>  is an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1570.325s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1571.866s">The</a>  amendment is in direct contrast with the paper, so we're going to take a separate vote on Councilor Penta's amendment first, and then we'll take the paper as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1579.532s">On</a>  Councilor Penta's amendment, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1582.594s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1583.875s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1584.776s">Roll</a>  call vote.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1585.777s">Roll</a>  call has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1588.274s">A</a>  yes vote is for Councilor Penta's amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1590.595s">A</a>  no vote is to take a vote on the paper as amended prior to his proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1601.381s">Annual</a>  rather than perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1602.941s">Yes</a>  is to have it just this one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1605.323s">A</a>  no vote will be the original intent of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1609.925s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1611.185s">I</a>  want to understand my Councilor colleague's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1615.393s">Why</a>  would you think it would be so difficult for us to rescind the perpetuity that allows them to do it every year automatically? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1622.915s">Why</a>  would that be so difficult by a vote of the kind? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1625.215s">Just</a>  say in a year, two years from now, we say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1627.496s">Even</a>  after the 90-day review, we no longer like this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1630.576s">What's</a>  the reason? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1631.456s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1633.417s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1635.497s">Is</a>  perpetuity the proper legal term to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1638.358s">Is</a>  this granted in perpetuity? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1639.918s">No,</a>  it's indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1641.279s">Or</a>  is it indefinite? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1642.259s">Indefinite.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1642.819s">Indefinitely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1644.346s">Because</a>  there's a difference in the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1645.947s">Imperfectuity</a>  is... Forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1649.549s">Forever</a>  and ever, till the Lord walks on this earth again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1653.032s">So</a>  I don't think that's in anything that we give. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1659.175s">Thank</a>  you for your clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1661.357s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1662.998s">My</a>  question was to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1664.799s">Why</a>  you would think that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1665.659s">Because</a>  this is the first time this is appearing before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1668.801s">And</a>  I think being for the first time, let's just see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1672.482s">I'm</a>  not about to give away the store on the very first time somebody comes here and then have another person come and get denied because maybe they just don't cut the same—it's not cut the same way, whether it's their neighbors, whether it's the neighborhood, whether it's the location or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1687.912s">I</a>  can just see other people wanting to have the same issue, have the same argument, and I've got no problem with that, and I think we should address them one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1697.072s">Give</a>  it to them for the first year, I've got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1699.174s">Even</a>  if you want to review it after 90 days, cut it to five, call the police chief, chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1703.578s">And</a>  if everything works out great, and the gentleman in the back there, they have no problems, they come back again next year, it shouldn't present a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1710.163s">But</a>  what are we going to do in the meantime? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1711.945s">I</a>  ask all of you, if company X comes in now, and they want the same thing, what are we going to do?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1719.311s">Honestly,</a>  I think we have to base every request on its own merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1724.607s">And</a>  you're right, if it was a business that was nestled in a neighborhood that wanted to open 24 hours, I would look upon it differently than a business that's in a mall establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1736.511s">And</a>  even the abutter stated that the front entrance would really have no bearing, people coming through the front entrance, on their sleep and so forth in the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1746.294s">So</a>  I think you have to take every petition on its own merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1750.616s">But</a>  my question was just whether or not <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1754.358s">and</a>  a year from now that we as a council can rescind this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1758.222s">And</a>  I believe we can do that like on any Tuesday night, and I don't think it's a difficult process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1763.608s">And</a>  if this didn't work out for whatever reason, I'm willing to take a vote to rescind.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1770.593s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1771.594s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, I hear what both Councilors are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1775.697s">Would</a>  the attorney be amenable to, every year, a 90-day review, just in case there's not a mob rush three, four years from now? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1782.783s">We'll</a>  just review it after 90 days as a council, and if there's no, basically put the 90-day review.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1788.127s">I</a>  guess I'm not sure how that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1789.809s">I</a>  mean, what I want to avoid is the necessity to come back every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1793.472s">I'm</a>  completely comfortable with the council reviewing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1798.337s">you</a>  know, in 90 days and see how it went as Councilor Dello Russo went. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1803.44s">I'd</a>  also like to point out that, I mean, we're not being trailblazers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1806.781s">There</a>  are a number of establishments that are open 24 hours a day now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1811.044s">You</a>  have Stop and Shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1811.984s">You</a>  have a number of 24-hour permits, correct, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1815.966s">Correct</a>  me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1816.767s">So</a>  we're not being a trailblazer here.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1819.028s">This</a>  is... But they've closed at 11 because of the business.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1826.72s">And</a>  we will be closing at 9 or 10 o'clock, 358 days a year.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1839.001s">The</a>  first vote is on the amendment of Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1841.143s">A</a>  yes vote is for Councilor Penta's amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1845.746s">A</a>  no vote is... Well, the amendment... Tell them what the amendment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1848.789s">The</a>  amendment is to have... The amendment... Councilor Penta's amendment is to have this as a trial this year and this year only. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1855.894s">A</a>  yes vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1856.535s">A</a>  no vote will be for the paper as presented, as amended by the Medford City Council up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1862.379s">Before</a>  I call the roll, we have a gentleman in the audience that would like to speak, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1872.632s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1875.733s">I</a>  hate to go against the man upstairs, and once upon a time there were blue laws in this state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1882.954s">However,</a>  as one of the councilors stated, it's the state of the times, it's capitalism, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1889.976s">It's</a>  been a long discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1894.617s">I</a>  believe in the spirit of compromise, especially with council, they're making some great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1903.81s">Maybe</a>  you people might want to consider a one-shot deal, and for eight days as a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1914.854s">And</a>  then you don't have to worry about 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1918.495s">It</a>  can come back next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1923.077s">Because</a>  if it becomes an issue after 90 days or prior to 90 days, unfortunately, this country is strong on litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1933.237s">You</a>  don't want to go down that road, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1936.101s">This</a>  is my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1937.122s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1937.843s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1938.203s">The</a>  clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1940.025s">Yes</a>  vote is for Council Appendix Amendment as stated earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1943.129s">A</a>  no vote is for the original paper as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1959.555s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1960.095s">Six</a>  in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1961.416s">Six</a>  no's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1962.517s">One</a>  in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1963.517s">The</a>  paper fails on the main motion as amended for 90 day review for a police detail on Black Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1970.801s">That</a>  this goes along with the business only and not the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1974.082s">That</a>  the chief be notified by Veterans Day of the days you anticipate to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1978.325s">No</a>  deliveries from 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1979.745s">to</a>  7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1981.366s">And</a>  that we send a letter to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding all deliveries for the entire mall facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1987.249s">And</a>  the petition stays with Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1989.474s">and</a>  not the facility itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1992.755s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1993.355s">I'd</a>  like to amend it one step further and have a report back from our city solicitor as it relates to if we are going to give this as an indefinite license for a period of time, that the city solicitor report back to the council under what conditions can the city council terminate? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2013.879s">It's</a>  different than giving the license from 11 at night to seven in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2017.96s">You're</a>  giving something indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2020.042s">And</a>  I believe that this case law, as Councilor Bruese and the gentleman behind him is aware of, this case law that substantiates the fact you just cannot pull a license just because you're granted it because you feel something went wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2031.571s">It</a>  has to be of substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2033.592s">And</a>  we don't have any of that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2036.094s">This</a>  is the first time we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2038.036s">We're</a>  basically at a loss to even know what rights do we have, if anything, because you're giving the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2044.04s">The</a>  license is predicated on two particular issues, number one, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2047.694s">number</a>  one, the indefinite period of time, and number two, the hours of operation, making it 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2052.457s">Cancelling</a>  out to 24 hours could be within the purview of the Council, but to eliminate the indefiniteness, I think that needs to be reviewed.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2060.642s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2061.002s">On</a>  that motion, but for the viewing public, this is not a licence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2066.806s">This</a>  is a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2067.926s">Basically,</a>  it's a variance on the original licence.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2076.096s">It's</a>  a license to extend the hours for 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2078.557s">It's</a>  a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2079.517s">Permit.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2079.778s">It's</a>  a special permit under zoning law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2082.079s">Excuse</a>  me, you're speaking from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2083.659s">I'm</a>  speaking, and I'm setting the facts straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2085.44s">You're</a>  not setting the facts straight, because there's two issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2088.022s">The</a>  other part of the issue is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2089.843s">You're</a>  giving the special permit an additional- Special permit, not a license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2093.985s">You're</a>  giving them an additional privilege, and that is granting it to the licensee for an indefinite period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2101.076s">It's</a>  not a permit Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2102.377s">It's</a>  not the same as giving the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2104.718s">I</a>  mean the extended hours, the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2107.62s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2108.44s">There</a>  are two separate issues.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2110.061s">You</a>  just corrected yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2111.542s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2112.182s">This</a>  is a special permit on the original license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2115.204s">The</a>  clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2117.185s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2118.926s">Just</a>  if I could, uh, if, if this is a special permit, as was stated, then we as a council can put conditions on the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2127.65s">So,</a>  and we did correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2129.49s">We</a>  can also put a condition on the indefinite period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2134.072s">If</a>  Councilor Penta feels better about that, we can put some language in there stating that even though this is for an indefinite period of time, that if there are any concerns or complaints brought before the Medford City Council, that the license will be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2150.461s">The</a>  special permit will be reviewed automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2153.522s">And</a>  that way it's in there, the language at least gives us an option to review it <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2157.683s">and</a>  a possible revocation of the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2162.245s">I</a>  would offer that if that's... No.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2168.267s">No,</a>  that's the 90... What Councilor Marks is stating, this is going to cover us years down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2174.13s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2174.51s">The</a>  90 days is for this current year.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2178.212s">So,</a>  we put a condition on the indefinite period of time stating that if there are any <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2187.293s">concerns</a>  brought before the Medford City Council relative to the extended hours of operation at Coles that the Medford City Council either hold a hearing or review the special permit and make a decision on the special permit.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2203.867s">So</a>  the special permit... Does that sound... I mean that's... That's a show cause hearing.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2210.853s">You</a>  can do that anytime.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2220.543s">It</a>  would only be relative to the extended of hours from 11 to 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2223.866s">I</a>  think what Councilor Marks is alluding to is the second part of this extended hours, it's a request to be indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2231.472s">Councilor</a>  Abuzi, let me ask you a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2234.634s">Maybe</a>  we're looking at this thing, we should be looking at this in two separate ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2238.877s">Coming</a>  in and asking for the extended hours is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2241.379s">Maybe</a>  the petition should be separate and broken down to have a second one to have it become indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2247.452s">Yeah,</a>  well, you've been here numerous times.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2249.153s">That's</a>  not the way the order is read.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2251.695s">You've</a>  been here numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2252.796s">You</a>  have never made a request to have any one of your petitioners be indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2256.639s">This</a>  is the first time.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2258.501s">A</a>  special permit, by its very nature, is indefinite.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2262.243s">No,</a>  it isn't.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2262.884s">Yes,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2263.604s">No,</a>  it isn't.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2264.165s">Yes,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2264.845s">On</a>  an annual basis, Mr. Clerk, don't they have to renew their application with you?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2269.569s">Special</a>  permit, any variance in zoning goes with the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2273.072s">You've</a>  already made a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2275.229s">that</a>  it will go with Kohl's, but as long as Kohl's is the operator of this facility, this special permit will go to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2285.455s">If</a>  they go and sell the business to whatever market it doesn't go with, then it always stays with Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2291.759s">You've</a>  made that condition by Councilor De La Ruza, that this is a Kohl's permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2298.263s">If</a>  you did not make that condition, like stopping shops or whatever, they would just stay with the land, but here you already made that condition and it stayed with Coles. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2308.49s">I</a>  don't think there's a need for it then.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2310.571s">So</a>  it's not going to be indefinite unless Coles, you know, they stay 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2316.055s">Can</a>  the clerk read, can the clerk please read back with council Max, what's the inclusion going to be as the amendment?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2322.959s">You</a>  know, I have to, you know, we're, but it's, it's about the indefinite period of time that if, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2328.605s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if Councilor Marks can have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2333.308s">Mr.</a>  President, maybe if we give initial approval tonight and ask that the city solicit a review language that would cover what we're talking about, that may be... You said something I think could be manageable.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2351.042s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2353.503s">If</a>  I understand correctly, this is amended to include a 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2360.688s">So</a>  with so many special permits we've issued over the years, that if at the time of that 90 day review that we're not pleased with the operation, knowing full well that petitioners come to us, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2376.806s">And</a>  there's concerns, and they're getting it with the 90-day review, that if it's not going to work out after 90 days, if we see problems there, it's a telltale sign to us as a council that it's not going to work, and that the special permits rescinded, or modified, or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2395.159s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2397.821s">Just</a>  if I could, and I hear what my colleague's saying, but the 90 days is for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2403.065s">Next</a>  year, there's no 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2405.997s">If</a>  something happens next year, we just want to make sure as a council that we have the authority to revoke the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2415.821s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2416.041s">Is</a>  that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2417.081s">We</a>  just want to make sure we have the authority to revoke, because there's no official review next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2421.523s">The</a>  attorney said he doesn't want to come back every year for a review, which I don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2425.664s">Of</a>  course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2426.105s">I</a>  don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2427.577s">So</a>  we want to just put language in there that allows us, and maybe we don't need language, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2433.179s">My</a>  point is that I don't think we need language. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2435.14s">We've</a>  done show cause hearings on certain situations.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2437.18s">So</a>  should we not ask the city solicitor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2439.301s">I</a>  think that would be a wise idea to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2441.662s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2442.502s">But</a>  I'd like to also see this granted tonight so that they can make their business plans.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2448.164s">I</a>  have no problem granting it with the contingency that the city solicitor provide language to us within the next several days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2457.574s">I</a>  mean, we don't meet for two weeks now because of election next Tuesday and the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2463.615s">If</a>  that's amendable.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2464.515s">I</a>  mean, you can, you can also, if I, if I may, you can also, uh, uh, I believe, uh, choose to adopt whatever additional language you want when the 90 day review comes about.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2481.878s">We</a>  could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2482.438s">Meanwhile,</a>  as the attorney stated, we can ask the city solicitor for his, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2487.14s">opinion</a>  on the language within the 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2489.34s">And</a>  then we'll attach the language.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2491.681s">My</a>  only concern with that would be if in fact the city solicitor were to come back and indicate that the extended hours does not represent the same intent of making the thing indefinite or indefinite to the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2503.243s">I</a>  would be more amenable to going back to your resolution relative to the fact that language be included as part of this, um, that, um, this be reviewed on an annual basis as it relates to the being indefinite. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2516.778s">First</a>  year is 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2517.899s">Then</a>  after that, you really have nothing after the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2521.16s">So</a>  I think it would be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2523.261s">I</a>  mean, Councilor Bruese may not be here the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2525.723s">They</a>  may have new management folks at Coles. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2528.784s">And</a>  there may be problems that could have taken place during the course of the year after the 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2533.207s">I</a>  don't know, because none of us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2534.748s">We</a>  can't predict the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2536.589s">Once</a>  again, I'm only concerned about the license going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2541.611s">I</a>  mean, this indefinite period of time <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2545.465s">and</a>  having another petition to come before us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2547.666s">So</a>  why don't we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2548.386s">Mr.</a>  President, not to belabor the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2551.908s">Why</a>  don't we approve this year as was stated asked within the, uh, with the 90 day ask, uh, just allow for this year and then ask the city solicitor to come back with his opinion on language that would allow us to review it every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2567.676s">Is</a>  that, does that sound acceptable?</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2570.017s">Does</a>  that mean I have to come back next year?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2572.178s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2573.619s">Once</a>  we get the language, then we will take a vote on the language.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2581.644s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2582.845s">You</a>  know, this is, this is not, it's not the type of situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2588.309s">I</a>  mean, it's expensive for, for, for goals to, you know, send an attorney each year for a few, a few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2595.834s">Now</a>  it is, you know, it is something they want to do to accommodate their customers, but it's not, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2601.47s">you</a>  know, cost-effective to do this on an annual basis.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2605.534s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2608.657s">Mr.</a>  President, in looking at the language that we have here, we have a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2612.401s">90-day</a>  review is about March 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2615.484s">If</a>  we amend the language to say there's an annual 90-day review upon the conclusion of the issue of the hours, I don't understand what the problem would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2623.121s">Why</a>  don't we just amend the 90-day review to be an annual 90-day review? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2626.003s">It</a>  has to take place before March 25th annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2628.425s">If</a>  it doesn't take place before March 25th annually, the permit remains. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2631.186s">It's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2632.167s">And</a>  we'll notify Coles if there's a problem during that 90 days to be here representative, because there are some permits that we review without the petition.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2638.451s">Further,</a>  Mr. President, I've made a number of phone calls to Mr. Bruese about this issue, and he's been more than responsive and more than willing to address some of the concerns that I had before we came to this meeting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2647.097s">So</a>  I don't have any reason to believe that that wouldn't continue.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2651.677s">So</a>  the understanding is that the council will review it annually on a 90-day basis, and the petitioner will not have to appear unless requested to do so.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2666.288s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2667.148s">And</a>  this is not the only Black Friday shopping establishment that has a 24-hour permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2672.172s">Ocean</a>  State Job Lot currently has a 24-hour license for the whole year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2677.182s">But</a>  they only utilize it during Black Friday and some holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2680.904s">And</a>  that was granted from the original stop and shop from councilors many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2685.926s">And</a>  it went with the land, not the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2689.008s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2689.328s">On</a>  the motion, as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2691.029s">I'm</a>  going to read the amendments now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2694.29s">90-day</a>  review, annually now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2698.032s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2700.313s">Councilor</a>  De La Russa, you withdrew your original one to now include annually? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2704.435s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2705.976s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2706.116s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2706.835s">We</a>  got the police detail on Black Friday that it goes with the business and not the land, that the chief of police is notified by November, by Veterans Day of each year, which days they plan on.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2719.26s">As</a>  to the specific days that they intend to open.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2721.701s">No</a>  deliveries from 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2723.502s">to</a>  7 a.m., and that we also, Councilor Marks, excuse me, an amendment to send a letter on behalf of this council to the Meadow Glen Mall regarding overnight deliveries for the entire mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2737.891s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2740.172s">The</a>  police officer for Black Friday, I believe the police officer is for the eight days.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2744.915s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2745.935s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2746.276s">Why?</a> </p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2747.876s">It</a>  shouldn't be necessary.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2749.117s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2749.477s">Meadow</a>  Glen Mall has detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2750.298s">That</a>  was my amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2751.959s">That</a>  was my amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2752.919s">And</a>  when I watch the news and I see what happens down in Alabama and Oklahoma on Black Friday, when droves of people push their way through the door and kill workers at Walmart and kill workers at these big box stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2764.044s">I</a>  think the big rush is going to be Black Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2765.946s">I</a>  have a number of people that I know who I'm friends with who, all Thanksgiving long, can't wait to pack up their bags and get rolling at midnight to go out there and go shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2773.672s">Everybody's</a>  chomping at the bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2774.854s">It's</a>  historically a day where most of the problems happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2778.257s">That's</a>  why I said Black Friday would be something that would be amenable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2783.281s">On</a>  the motion, the clerk will call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2787.204s">So</a>  what's your problem with having a police officer? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2790.687s">Expense.</a> </p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2792.88s">The</a>  expense, and it's not necessary.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2794.942s">It's-</a>  So you're going to guarantee from 11 at night to 7 in the morning, without having a Method police officer there, that nothing's going to take place in that storage- No, I'm not going to guarantee anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2805.831s">Is</a>  that what you're saying?</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2806.451s">They</a>  have their own security, and if there does become an issue, it will be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2812.937s">But</a>  it shouldn't be a requirement.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2817.568s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2818.389s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2819.529s">Um,</a>  because we have this 90 day review, if anything does happen during that period of time, we can call Coles and have them back in there and we can discuss any other public safety concerns that we have after this initial issuance of a license and an immediate special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2831.917s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2832.497s">And</a>  an immediate public safety threat that the chief deems a public safety threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2836.26s">We</a>  don't have to wait for the 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2837.941s">We</a>  can have you in here the following Tuesday after it's duly publicly advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2843.691s">Point</a>  of further information, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2846.412s">If</a>  it becomes problematic, we shouldn't have to mediate conversations between a store and the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2854.434s">They're</a>  all adults who know what's necessary, and should the police deem it necessary, they can make a requirement.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2890.861s">I</a>  mean, Kohl's is not the kind of a store that has a $600 computer that they sell for $2.99 that everyone's busting the doors down to get at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2899.563s">You</a>  know, it's.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3173.401s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President, and through you to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3177.023s">Can</a>  you tell me who's going to be doing the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3178.304s">Is</a>  it an internal job? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3179.545s">Do</a>  you have a contractor that's going to be performing the thing?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3181.266s">Yes,</a>  we contract all of our work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3183.227s">We</a>  don't have an internal construction group that handles the actual trench work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3190.531s">But</a>  I do believe that the contractor that we are going to choose has done work in the city of Medford in the past.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3197.956s">The</a>  contractor been selected at this point in time?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3201.418s">Right</a>  now, it's down to two contractors.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3209.51s">The</a>  reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I have some concern over the work the contractors have done in the past relative to repairing our roadways to the previously pristine conditions that they are in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3218.156s">But</a>  I know that we have some contingencies and controls available here at the city level relative to the applicable permits in the City of Metro regulations and standards for restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3228.264s">So</a>  I'll rest.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3237.03s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3238.452s">Roughly,</a>  how long will the construction take?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3242.454s">In</a>  the public right-of-way, it should take a day, possibly two days for the trench in the public right-of-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3251.357s">The</a>  private property may take another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3254.939s">I</a>  would say that the total duration, three days, and then if there's any significant <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3261.677s">You</a>  know, permanent restoration, it may take a day longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3264.438s">I</a>  mean, we're talking less than five business days to complete the project from start to finish.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3271.261s">Less</a>  than five days.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3271.921s">Less</a>  than five days.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3272.942s">And</a>  just one day on the public way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3276.743s">One</a>  to two days on the public way, depending on what conditions we may find when we open the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3282.586s">So,</a>  I mean, sometimes the digging's a little bit slower than anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3287.884s">In</a>  some of these older cities, there's a lot of utilities underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3291.006s">We</a>  do have good plans indicating what utilities are in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3296.41s">Dig</a>  safe will be called in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3297.511s">The</a>  utilities will be marked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3299.512s">However,</a>  sometimes it's a little bit slow going, depending on what the earth is underneath the asphalt.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3306.277s">And</a>  what's the length of the trench on the public way?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3309.94s">83</a>  feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3311.361s">And</a>  on the private? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3313.122s">Approximately</a>  40, I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3314.623s">Approximately</a>  40 feet.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3318.151s">And</a>  where is the trench again on the public way?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3327.193s">It's</a>  on the Emerson Street side of Main Street at the intersection of Emerson Street.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3333.674s">The</a>  intersection of Emerson and Main?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3335.954s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3338.055s">I</a>  have a plan here if you'd like to review this.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3341.775s">I</a>  have a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3342.535s">I</a>  just wanted to know if you can explain it rather than look at that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3346.655s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3347.055s">I</a>  mean, right now, we looked at all options to get into this building and try to exclude the necessity of a trench in the public right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3356.923s">Obviously,</a>  it's less cost effective for Lightower as a company to do these types of digs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3363.188s">We</a>  typically only dig in the public right away when it's absolutely necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3367.09s">We</a>  looked into the option of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3372.084s">A</a>  lot of the times phone company or the electric companies have these service conduits that enter into buildings and we look to lease those conduits or lease a partial conduit to enter a building so we don't have to take on such excavation and civil construction as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3393.425s">So,</a>  we actually had to license our backbone fiber cable is aerial. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3400.13s">So,</a>  we have the aerial license to attach aerially. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3403.112s">We</a>  end at pole 6088 on Emerson Street and we have to dig from 6088, pole 6088 to the building to make connection to the building.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3414.44s">What</a>  other options were there, entrance options?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3416.826s">that</a>  the other options were to look to the local telephone company or the local power company to try and lease a conduit into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3423.788s">However,</a>  there was none available.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3425.449s">So</a>  you did explore that option?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3426.529s">Yes,</a>  we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3427.27s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3429.15s">I'm</a>  not up to date on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3433.752s">If</a>  something was available, are they obligated to allow your access?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3538.262s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. I have a motion for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3540.464s">Councilor</a>  Mayne.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3542.225s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3543.166s">In</a>  thinking a little bit more about the location, Emerson Street is a one-way, if I do recall appropriately, one way up to Maine, up to the gate, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3554.867s">So</a>  I guess I have some curiosity as to how exactly traffic would be routed around this project for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3560.269s">And</a>  with that being said, I'd also have concern relative to the traffic that would be coming in and out of Tedeschi's and crossing over out of the gate and out to Emerson onto Main. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3572.175s">And</a>  where would that traffic go? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3573.175s">Because</a>  I think the way that Tedeschi's is set up right now, the parking spots are all slanted so that the cars are directed to go down to the back of the parking lot, exit onto Emerson, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3584.405s">and</a>  back out onto Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3585.987s">So</a>  those are some concerns that I think we have here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3588.909s">However,</a>  the Mass Eye and Ear Institute is one of the premier research hospitals in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3594.915s">And</a>  I think it's a privilege and an honor to have them here located in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3598.358s">I</a>  also think that without the technology that they need in order to operate, we're going to be doing them a disservice, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3604.124s">So</a>  I, too, will be supporting this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3609.438s">However,</a>  I do have some questions and concerns relative to the actual traffic flow and traffic mitigation that's going to be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3617.325s">And</a>  I was wondering if the gentleman could speak to that a little bit, if possible.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3620.887s">Yes,</a>  and President, through you to Councilman, we do have a traffic management plan drafted up currently to address these types of <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3634.389s">you</a>  know, issues, making sure that traffic remains fluent in the area of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3640.855s">I</a>  have a traffic management plan here that we can leave for you to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3644.899s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3646.54s">Also,</a>  when we do this type of work, we hire, you know, depending on the area, we'll hire at least one police detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3656.309s">In</a>  this case, the TMP calls for two police details. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3660.211s">So</a>  we'll have a police detail at the location of the trench on Emerson and a police detail at the intersection of Emerson and Main Street to monitor traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3669.706s">That</a>  satisfies my questions, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3676.61s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3677.25s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3678.291s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3685.974s">You've</a>  got the police officers that are going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3688.936s">They're</a>  going to be performing detail work on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3690.897s">I'm</a>  sure that it'll be in compliance with the traffic plan, which is in compliance with the established rules and regulations that we have in place.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3696.539s">If</a>  you don't need it, I'll take it back.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3955.815s">Mr.</a>  President, too, just if I may add, and I know this is standard language, but what you just read, the last sentence says underground work will be done and there should be no disturbance to the city of Medford sidewalk or roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3969.541s">Doesn't</a>  make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3971.762s">We</a>  know that they're going to disturb. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3973.123s">They're</a>  digging up the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3974.784s">So</a>  that sentence really doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3979.485s">Maybe</a>  if we can have that reviewed by the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3985.048s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3985.849s">I</a>  know it's her language, but it doesn't make sense.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3988.271s">It</a>  should read something as it should be returned to its original state.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4063.087s">Mr.</a>  President, I know this has come up in a few times during our annual budget meetings, and I know Councilor Marks has brought this up as it relates to, um, um, let's just say the school in and of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4074.616s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4075.337s">I</a>  got a phone call from a parent, um, as it related to, um, something that was taking place at the school over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4080.861s">And</a>  then she indicated, uh, I indicated to her, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4083.525s">Had</a>  she spoken to Mr. Volpe, who was the principal, and she says, Mr. Who? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4087.626s">She</a>  says, there's no Mr. Volpe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4088.786s">He's</a>  no principal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4090.947s">And</a>  I says, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4092.567s">She</a>  says, yeah, there's a new person. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4094.468s">There's</a>  a different person with a different name. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4097.849s">And</a>  then I come to find out, and I think we should get to the bottom of this, because this is part of our budgetary process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4105.71s">I</a>  understand that Mr. Prior Principal of the school is up at the high school with another job getting paid the same amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4113.004s">And</a>  the question now becomes, when did this all take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4117.586s">I</a>  believe we were told during our budgetary meetings by the superintendent that there were some concerns, they were going to be addressed, and we would be kept informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4125.931s">Well,</a>  I don't think anybody, unless anybody in this council knows, that the principal has left, a new one was hired, and he's up at the high school getting the same salary with another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4139.184s">I</a>  think it's things like this, you know, I think she was more amazed to think that I wasn't aware of what she was trying to tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4145.287s">So,</a>  I mean, I don't know if anyone behind here has any information, but I think it would be important, um, and informative if we got a report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4151.91s">Um,</a>  and I don't know who's going to tell us this, um, why he left and why he's not the principal anymore and why he's up at the high school and who's the new principal of the Tufts Curtis school.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4160.833s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4164.395s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Penta to ask the school committee, the superintendent,</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4167.81s">I</a>  would say it would be the superintendent, because he must have done the hiring, and it would be nice to know what's the job that he has up at the high school, what's that salary, and what's the job of the lady or the man who's now the principal of the Turtus Cuff, and what's that salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4185.871s">It's</a>  a confusing little story. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4188.682s">I</a>  think amazed at me that I didn't know because I just made an assumption that he was still there as the principal.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4193.325s">I</a>  know one councilor, you're just letting me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4195.066s">So</a>  you're not alone councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4196.987s">On</a>  the motion to send this to the superintendent for a report, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4201.17s">Make</a>  that a roll call vote.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4286.044s">Mr.</a>  President, we've had this discussion numerous times in the past as it relates to the unfunded liability that the city has been involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4294.046s">And</a>  nothing, there's absolutely been no discussion by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4298.587s">There's</a>  been nothing coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4300.57s">It's</a>  bad enough we've had our discussion relative to the water and sewer account sitting on $8.5 million, and ratepayers are getting no relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4308.775s">But</a>  we have over $6.5 million in our free cash account, and it would be a good beginning if we started with a $500,000 a year and just moved itself forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4319.28s">You</a>  know, if this council wants to leave itself with some type of legacy as it relates to its fiscal responsibility, this would be one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4329.389s">I</a>  don't think we should be given anything by the way of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4332.731s">Well,</a>  we're going to come in here and we're going to bond this to get ourselves going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4336.693s">It</a>  doesn't go that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4338.533s">This</a>  city, the people in this city have been taxed to death between the state and the feds and the city and everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4348.598s">But</a>  if we're sitting on this kind of money and we know we have this debt to pay, we should be upfront about it and start doing it and not leave this for any future city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4358.009s">or</a>  any future administration to come in as being a headache. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4362.67s">We</a>  get on an annual basis a federal reimbursement from Part D. Last year, we got $335,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4367.911s">We</a>  got $335,000 from Part D, which is the Medicare Part D reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4370.292s">We</a>  were also identified in the state retirees annual review as having an 11.3% <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4389.724s">11.31%</a>  return for the last five years on our investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4394.907s">But</a>  if you look at Malden and if you go to other cities and towns which have a higher rate of return, again, I think it's something that this council has asked for before to maybe to sit down with our retirement board and to go over the type of investments that they have and see where maybe we can streamline and make more and understand why and how other cities and towns <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4417.018s">can</a>  do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4418.479s">It's</a>  not that we're doing that bad, but if somebody can do better, then we should be able to have that ability to look forward as well as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4425.222s">But</a>  I think this is a serious bone of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4428.843s">I</a>  think this is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4430.444s">This</a>  isn't something that maybe we can or can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4433.005s">This</a>  is something we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4435.206s">This</a>  city is obligated to pay its unfunded liability as it relates to its pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4440.929s">It's</a>  well into the millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4442.47s">This</a>  isn't the hundreds of thousands. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4443.93s">It's</a>  well into the millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4445.958s">And</a>  I think if we start nibbling away at it with $500,000 in the first year, setting the example, and each and every year going forward, as we're paying down the at-present cost on an annual basis, it'll greatly reduce the trauma, the fiscal trauma, because that's what it's going to be when the city has to financially realize they've got to pay for this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4468.817s">I</a>  believe it's 2029 is the deadline, 2030 is the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4474.545s">And</a>  we're no closer to having this thing resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4477.086s">And</a>  each and every year, as the years go on, this keeps getting itself compounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4481.708s">So,</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I spoke to Ann Baker about this, a city auditor, and she believes it's a good — it's a good move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4492.232s">At</a>  least we're addressing the subject matter, and that's what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4496.174s">And</a>  let me just, once again, say we shouldn't be leaving this type of a debt for any future council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4501.996s">And</a>  if the administration doesn't want to address it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4504.607s">Shame</a>  on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4505.528s">This</a>  is taking a very proactive approach going forward and recognizing this debt has to get paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4511.151s">And</a>  to get it paid, knowing that we're flush in our free cash account right now, and it's been an accumulation through the years to get to $6.5 million, I don't think this is going to hurt the city's bank at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4522.897s">And</a>  at the same time, we're addressing the subject matter that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4527.439s">So</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move that by a roll call vote to our city auditor and our finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4535.688s">and</a>  get the city on some kind of a system here that addresses this financial liability that it needs to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4541.552s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4547.036s">If</a>  I could just ask, what is the amount of money owed?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4551.64s">I</a>  believe it's in excess of $20 million the city owes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4555.082s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4556.583s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4557.264s">It's</a>  unfunded pension liability.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4559.005s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4560.846s">And</a>  thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4564.023s">I</a>  certainly agree with some of your points. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4565.364s">However,</a>  I urge my colleagues to move with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4568.265s">Recently,</a>  I believe this fiscal year, GASB, which is the Government Accounting Standards Bureau, has come out with a number of papers which will change the way that we're allowed to forecast and we're allowed to report our liabilities on our balance sheets, which means that if we're reporting liabilities that are less than what we have, our balance sheets are going to be off and we're actually going to go and owe more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4589.76s">So</a>  if we owe more money on our liabilities that aren't showing up on our balance sheets now but will be later on, and we're spending money of our free cash to offset this, we might have a perilous effect on our bond rating, Mr. President, because we're going to be taking money out of our reserves to pay for this unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4604.709s">With</a>  these new reforms that are coming in place and these new reporting requirements, I think that we need to move with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4609.692s">I</a>  think we need to get a report back from the Retirement Board as to what steps they've taken to address the generally accepted accounting principles that have been adopted by the federal government and passed down to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4619.575s">I</a>  think that it's important to understand that the unfunded liability is really a mismatch between the estimated returns that we have on our long-term investments and the estimated assets that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4628.065s">So</a>  in looking at what's happened, the GASB group has <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4634.897s">really</a>  taking a look at the way that we forecast. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4637.358s">And</a>  municipalities usually forecast at a rate upwards of 8 percent, while private sector pension plans usually forecast at around a rate of 4 percent, which is a little bit more in line with what the actual returns on investments are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4649.786s">Now,</a>  as I've done further research, I've seen that the 25 largest pension systems for municipalities are returning at about 7.5 percent or 7.25 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4658.911s">So</a>  there's certainly some concern here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4661.418s">I</a>  think that we need to be on strong financial footing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4663.319s">We</a>  need to make sure that we keep money in the bank, and we need to be sure that we don't have a perilous effect on our bond rating before we move forward and start, you know, issuing annual checks for $500,000 a year to offset this pension liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4675.865s">It</a>  might not be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4676.685s">It</a>  might be too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4677.846s">There</a>  might not be a break-even there, and our bond rate is going to start to drop, and our pension liability is going to go up because of the new reporting requirements, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4684.909s">So</a>  I urge my colleagues to proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4687.511s">For</a>  those reasons and the uncertainty, I'm going to be voting against this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4698.516s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4699.636s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4701.357s">We</a>  do need to stop paying this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4703.157s">This</a>  has been one of my bones of contention during every budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4706.818s">But</a>  before I vote for this, I'd like to sit down with the retirement board and Baker and our budget director to see exactly where we stand and what this $500,000 does to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4719.68s">if</a>  we're using the correct formula going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4723.102s">So</a>  I'd rather have a committee meeting on the whole before I vote on this Mr. Penta, just to see where we stand before we allocate any further funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4737.973s">Though</a>  I do agree, the amount that's owed is quite large, and if I'm not mistaken, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4746.232s">I</a>  think Ian Baker said like 2032 or 36 was the projected date that they have for it to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4753.294s">But</a>  I'd like to see where we stand with all these people before we make a commitment.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4759.876s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4761.196s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4765.097s">And</a>  I'm supportive of this, but I think perhaps before we do vote on this and set a dollar amount to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4775.676s">the</a>  wise course of action given the information that Councilor Nigel shared with us and also Councilor Caraviello's concerns would be that we meet, perhaps the Finance and Budgeting Committee meet with all those persons who were mentioned by Councilor Caraviello to examine the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4795.744s">But</a>  it is a critically serious issue and it needs to be addressed and dragging our feet on it is not the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4805.922s">So</a>  you're perfectly right there, Councilor Penta, that this should be moved on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4810.444s">I</a>  think the way to do it would be to develop a plan with those pertinent persons and start to move on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4821.467s">And</a>  we can do it within this budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4825.109s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4826.089s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4828.37s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4829.99s">I</a>  was going to agree with Councilor Caraviello that we sit in subcommittee with Anne Baker. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4835.445s">The</a>  same exact people, Ian Baker, budget director, and the retirement board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4839.467s">I</a>  would like to learn a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4842.489s">I'm</a>  not ready to make a vote on it tonight, but I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4846.611s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4848.652s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4849.393s">Mr.</a>  President, as I said before, I'm going to disagree with my colleague, Councilor Knight, because the facts that he has are not representative of the cost <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4863.148s">that's</a>  presently out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4864.929s">The</a>  city of Medford, for example, on a return for its money last year, received 11.96%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4870.171s">But</a>  you go to Northbridge, they had 15.29%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4872.551s">Norwood,</a>  15.84%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4872.912s">Peabody</a>  had 15.34%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4873.272s">Pittsfield</a>  had 14.91%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4873.772s">Plymouth</a>  had 19.66%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4874.352s">And</a>  then you can go down to these other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4876.133s">Weymouth</a>  had 18.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4892.142s">Winchester</a>  had 12 point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4894.264s">Winthrop</a>  had 14 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4895.664s">Woburn</a>  had 18 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4897.986s">And</a>  we can go down, and the question then becomes if our investments aren't meeting or keeping up with those folks, those folks who apparently are doing better than the city of Medford, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4911.215s">And</a>  maybe we should be looking at taking a lesson from how they do their investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4915.698s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4916.438s">Number</a>  two, this is a debt obligation that we owe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4919.299s">And</a>  if this city is going to keep worrying about its bond rating, its bond rating has got nothing to do with paying off a debt because you show me the alternative other than taking it out of the money that you already have, other than going out to bond to want to pay for this thing, which would be the most ridiculous way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4937.989s">This</a>  city administration is paralyzing, is taking money away from Medford taxpayers <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4944.142s">that</a>  either could be used for paying debts such as this or municipal improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4949.245s">This</a>  is just two particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4951.947s">And</a>  if you're going to keep being worried about a bond, well, what's the next big thing to get bonded around here? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4957.41s">The</a>  police station? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4958.771s">Well,</a>  then let's do it if that's what we're waiting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4961.453s">But</a>  according to the mayor, that's a seven-year-old process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4964.795s">This</a>  is something that's alive and well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4967.077s">It's</a>  in front of your faces right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4969.278s">This</a>  is a debt obligation that's owed because the city, for which has been this administration for 26 years, has never put a dime into paying or paying down on this debt obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4979.327s">And</a>  now it's in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4980.809s">And</a>  it's real. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4981.93s">And</a>  it has to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4983.551s">I'm</a>  not worried about a bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4985.493s">I'm</a>  more concerned about if we have money sitting in the bank that can start to help to pay this debt down, then that's what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4994.106s">For</a>  God's sakes, you get $8.5 million in a water and sewer account, and the city administration is afraid either to lower the rates or have a program set. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5003.21s">Those</a>  are the only two things you can do with a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5005.831s">And</a>  he's being allowed to just get away with doing nothing and letting the money accumulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5011.373s">And</a>  here you are, $6.5 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5014.334s">But</a>  you also have a debt obligation that exists each and every year and continues to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5021.16s">This</a>  is not going to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5022.661s">This</a>  isn't a political issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5025.062s">This</a>  is a real, live, physical debt obligation that this city owes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5031.444s">And</a>  with that being said, $500,000 is a drop in the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5035.025s">It's</a>  a beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5036.426s">It's</a>  a beginning to understand that we are going to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5040.768s">And</a>  if we're fortunate enough to keep going and having free cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5044.815s">then</a>  maybe that's the best way to just keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5047.816s">Because</a>  I don't know any other way other than going out and, again, banging the taxpayer overhead by way of a bond or some other financial encumbrance that they're going to have to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5057.481s">And</a>  they shouldn't have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5059.322s">But</a>  when other cities and towns, other cities and towns can generate that kind of money by a rate of interest return for their last year, and we did 11 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5069.106s">We're</a>  somewhere in the middle or thereabouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5071.127s">But</a>  there are other cities and towns well ahead of us with their interest returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5074.883s">Then</a>  I think we need to have a — sit down with the Retirement Board and Baker and all our financial people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5080.084s">But</a>  that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5081.344s">This</a>  issue has got to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5083.425s">And</a>  the best way to address it, knowing right now that we're flushing at least one particular account, then let's get to it and let's start on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5090.206s">And</a>  let's not worry about, oh, my God, we might go from a triple-A to a double-A bond rating because we used money that the taxpayers have that are generally theirs that's not being used for anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5102.049s">We're</a>  waiting for this administration to decide <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5104.536s">the</a>  next thing he wants to do to use the money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5107.679s">And</a>  then maybe when he leaves next year or two years or whenever he decides to go or gets beaten out of office, that administration is going to have to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5117.086s">That</a>  city council is going to have to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5119.628s">And</a>  then it will affect every single thing that a budget has. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5122.651s">But</a>  if there's a commitment that's built in now, and it represents the fact that we're addressing this debt that wasn't started by this council or councils before, it's been sitting there for years, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5134.239s">because</a>  no city administration wanted to deal with it, now's the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5138.642s">All</a>  you have to do is pony up, however you want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5141.705s">Do</a>  you want to have a meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5142.646s">I've</a>  got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5144.087s">But</a>  as Councilor De La Rosa, you alluded to it, it should be addressed this term, and the first payment should begin during this legislative session that we're serving in.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5198.13s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5199.471s">That's</a>  what I was getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5200.351s">You</a>  know, with GASB making these changes to the actual accounting and reporting principles that are in place and the federal government adopting them as generally accepted accounting principles, the city of Medford is going to have to take a look at the way that we are doing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5213.74s">I'm</a>  not saying that this is a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5215.181s">I</a>  didn't say that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5217.153s">What</a>  I'm saying is I think we need to tread lightly and we need to use caution because we don't want to make a decision that's going to have a long-term dramatic effect on our financial viability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5224.836s">Now,</a>  I understand what Councilor Penta is coming from, saying, well, we're never going to have financial viability if we have this unfunded debt and this unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5231.719s">However,</a>  if we're looking at how we're going to pay it off and we have the free cash sitting in the bank collecting 1%, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5237.207s">And</a>  we can take that money out and bond it for 2 or 3 or 4 percent because we have a AAA bond rating and then use that to spend down a pension liability that's going to get us a return to 15 percent, like he says. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5246.135s">I</a>  don't see how we're losing money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5247.636s">But</a>  that's a question for another day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5249.638s">I'll</a>  certainly support the paper to go to committee to ask these questions that we have to get better informed and to properly vet the issue before we make a demand or make a — ask the question for the mayor to expend $500,000 annually to fully fund the pension system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5262.869s">I</a>  know that we've gotten a report back from Ann Baker. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5264.71s">I</a>  believe it was in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5265.968s">relative</a>  to the plan that they currently have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5268.049s">However,</a>  I don't have any understanding or any commitment or any knowledge that the city's actually looking at these new accounting principles and these new accounting standards that have been put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5277.271s">That's</a>  why I asked my colleagues to tread lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5279.491s">That's</a>  why I think this issue needs to be vetted a little bit further before we can ask this question and make this recommendation, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5287.333s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5287.753s">Councilor</a>  Fenton.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5288.334s">Mr.</a>  President, to bond 2 percent, maybe you misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5291.514s">You</a>  said maybe we should just go out and bond for 2 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5294.248s">and</a>  that money will generate some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5296.79s">Why</a>  would you be going out to bond 2% to pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5299.312s">When</a>  you go out to bond, you're bonding for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5303.316s">I</a>  think you misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5304.257s">I</a>  don't understand what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5305.277s">You</a>  said you bond for 2%?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5306.739s">You're</a>  saying we're getting returns of 15%, 20%, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5310.041s">Other</a>  communities are getting returns of 15% or 20%, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5311.823s">Those</a>  are, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5313.224s">So</a>  if we bond the money for 3% and we invest that money and we're getting returns of 15%, I don't see how we're losing.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5320.03s">That's</a>  not the investment that's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5323.365s">If</a>  you look at how the Retirement Board invests its money, and if you read the State Investment Board Retirement Program, it's to pay for the investments that you have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5332.71s">We're</a>  talking about the unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5334.751s">It</a>  doesn't make any difference what the Feds or Gatsby or anybody else says. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5338.273s">You're</a>  going to have to—and whatever the new accounting practices might be, they still <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5342.527s">can't</a>  get you away from the fact that you owe this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5345.028s">And</a>  however you owe this money, if this money is put aside in a special account to offset it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5350.432s">We're</a>  not putting up $6 or $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5352.573s">We're</a>  starting at a $500,000 beginning here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5354.654s">But</a>  what I'm saying is, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5355.955s">Why</a>  aren't we putting up $6 or $7 million if that's going to address the problem and address the need and address it now, in the real time, right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5361.538s">Why</a>  aren't we doing that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5362.599s">Well,</a>  then if that's the case, then maybe we should have <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5364.78s">Maybe</a>  the meeting should be the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5368.903s">A,</a>  that we have a meeting with the city's retirement board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5375.027s">Ann</a>  Baker, she's our auditor, and I believe she sits on the board anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5379.57s">What</a>  is the total amount of the unfunded liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5383.112s">The</a>  unfunded pension liability, how much is that?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5387.174s">As</a>  of which date?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5388.375s">As</a>  of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5389.356s">As</a>  of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5390.456s">The</a>  unfunded pension liability as of today, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5395.057s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5396.218s">Point</a>  of information, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5397.319s">If</a>  the federal government has changed their standards and they're making the municipalities and the states report their unfunded liabilities differently than they have required them to do in the past, then this information and data that we're getting isn't going to be accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5410.708s">If</a>  they're not reporting the liabilities the way that GASB and the way that the generally accepted accounting principles are calling for, then they can give us all the data in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5419.033s">But</a>  if they're not giving us a forecasted <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5422.198s">You</a>  know, if they're not giving us a forecasted, estimated liability that's done properly, it's garbage in, garbage out.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5430.164s">Well,</a>  that's Councilor Knight's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5432.946s">As</a>  of right now, let's just see, what is the unfunded liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5436.909s">How</a>  is that determined? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5438.149s">If</a>  you want to use the Gatsby, the new federal, I don't have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5440.951s">Let's</a>  just see, because they're the ones that have to deal with this on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5444.014s">The</a>  unfunded liability, what's the due date that has to be paid out? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5451.029s">And</a>  Committee of the Whole?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5452.11s">Committee</a>  of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5453.49s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5453.59s">Committee</a>  of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5455.251s">All</a>  those? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5457.831s">Councilor</a>  Marks, and then Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5460.132s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5461.393s">I</a>  think the one good thing is we're all in agreement here, behind the reeling, from what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5465.734s">And</a>  I think it's prudent to have this particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5468.435s">I</a>  thank Councilor Penta for starting the ball rolling on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5472.256s">This</a>  impacts a lot of people that are in the retirement system, and it really needs to be reviewed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5479.037s">And</a>  as was mentioned, the longer we wait, the bigger the unfunded liability becomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5484.518s">And</a>  at some point, it's going to become something that we're not going to even want to approach because it's so unapproachable to figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5491.84s">So</a>  I thank my colleague for bringing this up.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5497.401s">If</a>  we could just amend this to include the Director of Personnel, Budget, and Finance.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5505.263s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5506.758s">And</a>  also further, can we get a separate report? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5509.74s">What,</a>  if any, finances, financial remuneration does the city of Medford get out of the Medicare drug subsidy?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5521.107s">And</a>  the updated actuarials, we should have it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5522.929s">Yeah,</a>  we can do that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5525.69s">Is</a>  that it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5526.171s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5526.651s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5527.752s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5528.933s">Roll</a>  call vote and have that voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5530.013s">Roll</a>  call has been requested for a meeting of the committee of the whole to discuss this with the retirement board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5536.593s">And</a>  Baker as her role as the retirement board member and the city auditor, as well as budget and personnel director, Stephanie Burke.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5545.857s">Eddie,</a>  you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5546.397s">Because</a>  you look like you had a little.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5549.698s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5554.76s">But</a>  we want that information at the committee.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5556.541s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5556.821s">If</a>  we can get that information ahead of time so we can discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5558.442s">So</a>  we have some information to discuss.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5700.615s">Is</a>  there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5703.036s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5705.158s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5706.479s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5707.159s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5708.974s">Item</a>  14-727, petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, to address the Council on Arts slash Media Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5717.299s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5718.679s">Joseph</a>  Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5722.422s">Thank</a>  you, City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5724.403s">The</a>  April 29th Medford transcript noted that the owner of the Springstep Building, Elizabeth Grady Company CEO, Joan Walsh, wanted the building to stay in the arts community when Councilor Caraviello floated the idea of having Springstep <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5737.672s">be</a>  the new home of Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5740.273s">Rather</a>  than start with a $4.5 million building, a sports host colleague of mine suggested that we look at 101 George P. Hassett Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5749.497s">The</a>  building next door to City Hall has been gutted internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5753.419s">I</a>  took a look at it today from the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5755.88s">It</a>  is perfect for a build-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5759.101s">A</a>  new nonprofit would benefit by purchasing this entity, but to effectively do this, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5768.047s">A</a>  new AXS TV Corporation needs to be built, one that has City Hall's help in this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5774.931s">With</a>  the Mayor's Community AXS TV Committee having given its report, with zero information from the Mayor's Office on the future of AXS TV, Mayor McGlynn is now in violation of a good faith obligation to the taxpayers, cable TV rate payer subscribers, and the businesses, civic groups, and residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5793.962s">This</a>  City Council needs to be proactive <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5796.96s">As</a>  I've said so many times before, Winthrop and Stoneham own their own buildings, and the previous nonprofit that was running Channel 3 squandered monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5806.184s">Those</a>  monies spent in almost 30 years could have purchased a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5811.407s">This</a>  city council needs to put pressure on the mayor until he lives up to his contractual obligations to the residents of this city who are paying the freight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5820.431s">And</a>  the clock is ticking because April 20th, I believe, is the Comcast renegotiation date. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5826.812s">I</a>  am not here looking for a vote of the city council, some symbolic gesture. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5831.316s">I</a>  am here to demand this council protect rate payer monies or be voted out of office one year from next week, Tuesday, November 3rd, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5838.281s">This</a>  council needs to step up and help form a new non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5844.886s">Let</a>  us now invest in a new non-profit and a new building that the arts community, public access, and the Medford arts community together can share to improve life in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5856.196s">Now,</a>  I'm talking to lawyers to litigate soon if the mayor continues to ignore us, because as I said, the clock is ticking. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5862.32s">The</a>  mayor has a contractual obligation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5865.102s">My</a>  fear is that come April 20th, he may say, well, well, I've heard them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5871.887s">They</a>  all want access, but I don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5873.888s">And</a>  it shouldn't be up to one individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5876.29s">That</a>  building is beautiful for what we need, and it's been gutted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5880.573s">I</a>  hope this city council can just go take a gander over there, maybe tomorrow, maybe in the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5885.379s">because</a>  you have a week off next week because of the election, two weeks in fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5889.181s">This</a>  is the time that I'll be formulating a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5891.342s">I'll</a>  be talking to citizens about maybe forming a new non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5895.105s">And</a>  that building sitting right there, 101, I don't know if it's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5899.027s">The</a>  owner is in Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5901.468s">The</a>  company, the corporation is called Medford Square Realty. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5905.45s">It's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5906.51s">It's</a>  just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5908.091s">It's</a>  gutted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5908.711s">We</a>  could build it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5910.091s">We</a>  could put a radio station in there for 24-7 emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5914.033s">Captain</a>  Barry Clemente could use the radio station, and these stations are free. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5918.634s">There's</a>  a new company now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5920.134s">There's</a>  Blog Talk Radio Charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5921.815s">There's</a>  another company now that allows free Internet radio, and I could put a transmitter up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5927.456s">I've</a>  told this council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5928.497s">I've</a>  run radio stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5930.737s">A</a>  $2,000 transmitter, we can have <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5933.266s">a</a>  part 15 FCC radio station where people can tune in for snow emergencies, for any other emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5939.771s">I'm</a>  passionate about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5941.372s">This</a>  council knows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5943.133s">This</a>  is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5945.976s">And</a>  the whole access thing is going to be changing as CBS and HBO just, Mr. President, they just went on the Internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5953.614s">And</a>  I think you probably read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5955.014s">So</a>  everything's shifting to the web. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5956.995s">We</a>  need an access center. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5958.715s">That</a>  building, we could clean it up because there is trash around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5961.856s">There</a>  is graffiti on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5963.797s">And</a>  it's 100 yards from City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5966.037s">We</a>  have to have some self-respect in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5968.478s">It's</a>  just right near City Hall, and it's a disgrace right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5971.999s">And</a>  we need to improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5973.479s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5980.068s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5980.688s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5982.13s">Can</a>  I speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5983.751s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5984.432s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5986.654s">Every</a>  day that goes by, this city misses out on an opportunity to digitalize our history, our sports events, our concerts, our plays, our events at the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6000.206s">And</a>  it's going to require the citizens of Medford to come forward <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6005.465s">to</a>  create the new non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6007.746s">And</a>  I want to thank Joe for all of his hard work and everything that he went through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6013.33s">I</a>  want to thank him for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6014.65s">I</a>  personally don't think that buying the new building is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6017.792s">We</a>  need to buy a new police station before we buy a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6021.755s">But</a>  I do believe that we need to rent a space downtown in Medford Square someplace <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6029.613s">have</a>  an access station, start using it, and getting this stuff digitally recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6034.878s">If</a>  the new thing is to put it up on the computer or the iPod or the iPad or whatever the new i thing is, then fine, let's digitalize it and put it up on that for everybody to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6043.686s">We're</a>  missing out, the mayor doesn't want to do this, but the people, the people can step up and they can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6052.113s">The</a>  people are going to have to come forward from the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6054.676s">They're</a>  going to have to demand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6055.857s">If</a>  they don't demand it, then it can't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6059.0s">You</a>  folks can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6060.522s">The</a>  mayor can't even do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6061.523s">But</a>  the mayor could ask the people in Medford to come forward, but he chooses not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6067.109s">That's</a>  on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6068.57s">But</a>  I do believe, I don't miss out on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6071.793s">It's</a>  the citizens of Medford that miss out on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6074.717s">because</a>  they don't come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6076.598s">And</a>  they need to feel comfortable coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6079.24s">They</a>  need to come forward in mass, 12, 14, 15 of them, and start this thing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6084.504s">So</a>  I'm asking those folks out there to come forward, to build out the new 501c3, to get this thing off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6091.289s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6093.151s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6094.472s">Mr.</a>  President, whether it means buying the building or renting the space, something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6101.597s">A</a>  few weeks ago, I was led to believe by someone who <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6105.75s">who</a>  seems to be in the know in this building, that the mayor was going to be making his decision, and he was going to be making the announcement that public access was going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6116.319s">I</a>  haven't seen it, and it hasn't taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6119.502s">But</a>  just to go back with a reminder, Councilman Max, I think it was two budgets ago, because the money was not included in the budget, to put money in there for the arts, if you remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6132.687s">And</a>  I believe the resolution was a joint resolution between yourself and myself for $10,000 to be put in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6138.973s">And</a>  then when the mayor found out about it, and it was right during the middle of an election period of time, he decided to up the ante to $20,000 or $15,000, I forget the final number, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6150.423s">Never</a>  saying a word to the council, because the council all voted on that, and I believe the council even voted to amend it to a higher dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6158.594s">never</a>  a thank you coming back to the council for at least enlightening him or whatever it might be, but because it was a political process or it was political benefit for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6169.561s">The</a>  part that I just don't understand right now is this $303,000 sitting downstairs in the general fund of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6176.124s">That</a>  doesn't come from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6177.925s">It</a>  comes from the rate payers for Comcast and Verizon subscribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6182.548s">That's</a>  their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6184.009s">And</a>  they are owed public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6186.812s">And</a>  that's what that money is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6188.893s">Now,</a>  for how unfortunately what took place in December of 2012 till now, and there's no more Channel 3, and, you know, that's a hauntedness unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6198.92s">There's</a>  no records. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6199.74s">There's</a>  no books. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6200.881s">There's</a>  no validity to what they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6202.422s">There's</a>  no minutes to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6204.203s">The</a>  Attorney General's Office still can't give you an answer as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6208.966s">That's</a>  a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6210.768s">But</a>  that's one part. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6212.028s">And</a>  the other part of the coin is no public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6215.153s">And</a>  if April 20th is right around the corner, usually before the April 20th, I believe within six months prior to the deadline of the contract, public hearings are supposed to be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6227.617s">And</a>  I believe the city of Medford hires this gentleman from Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6230.898s">I</a>  think they pay him $325 an hour as legal counsel and advisor to the city for cable television. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6238.141s">And</a>  they usually have these public meetings here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6241.502s">I</a>  think they're required to have one if not two public hearings <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6245.002s">before</a>  they're submitted into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6247.883s">I</a>  just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6249.224s">I</a>  guess I'm lost for words right now to you and everyone who might be watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6253.405s">I</a>  was really hoping that the mayor was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat, and he was finally coming to his senses. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6258.767s">But</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6260.288s">I</a>  can't answer it, because it's a real shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6263.149s">You</a>  know, we have an attorney general candidate from the city of Medford, Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6268.37s">She</a>  has gone to every single public access chase around the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6273.662s">around</a>  the city of Medford, but not in her own hometown that she lives in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6277.826s">And</a>  that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6278.787s">Whether</a>  you're voting for or not voting for, but you can't get any closer to home, to the highest elected office statewide. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6286.694s">And</a>  it isn't because there's no money, and it isn't because you're trying to find a place, because I don't see anybody trying to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6295.802s">It's</a>  a lack of... <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6297.461s">It's</a>  a lack of free speech being allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6299.983s">The</a>  other night in Winchester, Pat Jalen and Bob Capucci had a debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6305.187s">They</a>  had to go to Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6307.128s">And</a>  it's going to be aired back in Somerville, but the city of Medford, you know, they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6311.471s">And</a>  these people represent our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6313.973s">Elections</a>  are just as important as anything else that goes on public access, whether it's an educational thing, whether it's a sports event, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6322.099s">And,</a>  you know, I don't know why the people, when you look at your cable bill each and every month, whatever that dollar is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6327.335s">or</a>  $0.98, or whatever the dollar amount might be, you're just throwing that away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6331.416s">Because</a>  this city administration doesn't want to seem to have cable access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6336.637s">And</a>  like I said, and I apologize for repeating myself, I was led to believe by someone who seems to be pretty good in the know that he was going to do it, but apparently he hasn't done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6345.918s">So</a>  this is two times that this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6348.739s">Judge</a>  Jackson, when she did her report, so five years ago, she wrote an extensive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6353.8s">I</a>  think we've all read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6355.01s">And</a>  then the most recent cable committee, not commission committee that the mayor had, and he indicated subsequent to Memorial Day and right after the 4th of July, he was going to make his announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6365.217s">This</a>  is now almost November 1st and there's no announcement to be made and people keep paying and keep paying and keep paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6371.222s">So,</a>  um, I hear what you're saying, Jeannie, and it's just a shame that we don't have public access here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6377.266s">You</a>  know, elections are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6379.128s">Candidates</a>  have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6380.809s">They</a>  don't have any opportunity in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6383.354s">But</a>  you can be rest assured next year, Channel 15 will be proffering everything that the mayor wants to talk about during the election campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6392.16s">You</a>  know, it's kind of interesting here, and I'll just ask my colleagues about this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6396.843s">Have</a>  any one of you ever tried to have your own press release and try to get a hold of Channel 15 and have them come up and give you the same forum that the mayor gets and use the same people up at the high school getting paid on city time to do a public forum? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6412.895s">Try</a>  it and see if it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6415.076s">Try</a>  to get an informational piece on the city's webpage and see what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6420.037s">It</a>  doesn't happen and it doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6422.958s">So</a>  this freedom of expression and freedom of what goes on as public officials here in the city is only designed for one person because that person's in control of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6432.261s">And</a>  it's very unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6433.861s">And</a>  I would hope people would wake up and realize that, you know, at the rate we're going and if you keep paying for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6440.567s">And</a>  this is a very scary thought, and I'll conclude by saying the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6443.869s">I</a>  could be corrected, but I think I found this out information today that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6447.772s">The</a>  mayor does not have to allow public access by right of contract if he so chooses not to renew. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6454.837s">The</a>  big question then becomes who and what takes that $300,000 or $500,000 or $400,000, whatever the dollar amount is going to be then. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6464.404s">It's</a>  going to be a damn shame if that money winds up into the general coffers <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6468.07s">and</a>  never been used for public access, and nobody ever had an opportunity to understand why or how, because nobody spec'd up and nobody challenged it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6477.217s">That's</a>  an issue right now, I believe, in a surrounding city and town that's in a legal contest, and if that be the case, you know, we better watch out and better be prepared for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6485.844s">So,</a>  with that being said, I thank you for making your remarks, and whether we buy the building, rent the building, or what have you, Gene, or anyone who might be watching, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6494.543s">You</a>  know, public access does not exist in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6497.625s">It's</a>  not alive and well, and you can thank the mayor of this community because he's not allowing it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6503.23s">Councilor</a>  Alango-Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6504.591s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6505.892s">I</a>  actually want to echo Gene's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6509.014s">I</a>  just feel, truly feel, that the city of Medford's missing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6513.258s">Teenagers,</a>  young children, all the way up to, you know, adults and the elderly who you could be using <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6520.503s">TV</a>  access for many, many different reasons, including, you know, the many things you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6525.067s">It's</a>  unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6525.848s">This</a>  council, over a year ago, fought to get TV 3 on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6531.073s">And,</a>  you know, what we did was, with every, you know, the citizens' help, was an accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6536.398s">But</a>  at this point, it just went to the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6539.181s">You</a>  know, in June, Father Hines was leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6541.323s">We</a>  thought at that point that the committee, cable committee, would have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6545.303s">with</a>  what they needed to do, and we'd have a new station up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6548.545s">And</a>  at this point, we're already into November almost, and we've heard nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6553.327s">We've</a>  asked for updates, we've asked for reports, we've asked for how we're gonna go forward, and the corner office is silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6561.612s">That's</a>  unfortunate for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6563.172s">It's</a>  unfortunate for the candidates to the current election, state, senate, and the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6572.485s">So</a>  I too, I don't know where TV should go, TV3 should go, but I do know that we are paying for it every day through our cable bill, and it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6583.131s">I</a>  think the administration really needs to get in the ball and do what they need to do.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6590.456s">You'd</a>  like to speak again? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6591.816s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6595.218s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6595.579s">Gene</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6596.919s">And</a>  that's exactly what he's going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6600.99s">He's</a>  going to just fade out the whole program come June or whatever, May, April. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6606.793s">And</a>  he's going to use it like he does the other 3% out of the 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6611.235s">Out</a>  of every $100 that you pay on your cable bill, $5 is taken out for, supposed to be for public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6618.219s">I</a>  guess it's technically he's within his legal rights as he always is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6621.82s">But</a>  $3 out of those $5 is used and thrown into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6628.439s">And</a>  so if he did it with that $3, he's absolutely going to do it with the other two that should be going towards public access, the 1% that's supposed to go to public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6636.646s">He's</a>  going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6637.867s">So</a>  it's not my loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6639.528s">It</a>  is my loss a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6640.949s">But</a>  it's really, the people that want a voice in this city, they're not going to have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6647.634s">It's</a>  going to be silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6648.635s">It's</a>  going to be more silent than it ever was once there's no chance of public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6654.2s">So</a>  we're missing out on culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6659.093s">plays,</a>  you name it, and they should be working hand-in-hand with the auditorium that we already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6665.878s">I</a>  don't see why a station can't work hand-in-hand with the big auditorium, the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6671.701s">I</a>  don't understand why the mayor wouldn't want that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6675.143s">Well,</a>  I understand why he doesn't want it to happen, because he doesn't want to be challenged on his views and his politics and his policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6682.147s">And</a>  that's why he keeps the whole program silent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6685.249s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6687.647s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo, on the motion to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6691.029s">Would</a>  you like to speak on this again? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6692.23s">I'd</a>  just like to add a little something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6693.371s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6694.211s">One</a>  more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6694.812s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6697.513s">Councilor</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn, you're right, and I brought up computers before. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6700.555s">The</a>  classes for the computer is so essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6703.417s">I'm</a>  learning more about Final Cut Pro than I ever learned before, and it is so important because they keep upgrading these systems, and I'm an old-timer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6711.462s">As</a>  Councilor Penter, I was at Wakefield, and the president told me that they had three <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6717.972s">political</a>  shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6719.113s">Catherine</a>  Clark, before she was a Congresswoman, Candidate Wong, and then there was a third person. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6726.238s">The</a>  elected officials had their own shows, which they have in many, many towns, so you people are all missing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6731.442s">And</a>  I talked to Stephanie Burke about the radio idea, and this is interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6736.025s">She</a>  said, there is money available from Homeland Security for just such a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6740.708s">So</a>  I'm glad we had this discussion tonight, because now I'm going to go back to Stephanie Burke with that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6746.503s">And</a>  the final thing, as far as owning the old building, thank you, Jeanne, very much for your kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6752.006s">I</a>  just think owning is a tangible, and the money doesn't dissolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6755.588s">So</a>  we have something, and the arts community has something, but I like the idea of the Chevalier, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6760.59s">Thank</a>  you very much, City Council.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6763.051s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6764.892s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6766.133s">And</a>  both speakers brought up some very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6769.355s">And</a>  Jeanne, you're 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6773.417s">Every</a>  resident in this community is losing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6777.205s">You</a>  know, even if you're not involved in local cable or want to produce your own show, the fact that we don't have the opportunity to look at high school sports on our local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6788.988s">I</a>  remember the days where they used to have live feeds and you could watch the Medford High football game live on local cable for those people that couldn't get to the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6799.153s">Council</a>  President, I think it was you that a year or two ago asked that all the boards and commissions, their meetings be taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6808.5s">On</a>  channel 16, which I thought, and I think it was voted by this council, an excellent way of providing transparency in this community and allowing residents to get involved or look into the process of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6825.713s">And</a>  I thought that was an excellent suggestion, but again, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6829.229s">The</a>  residents are being stifled because there's no access in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6834.292s">Several</a>  weeks back, we had what I would say is one of the largest meetings in this community in the last 25 years regarding parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6845.178s">And</a>  that's an issue that's going to impact every resident in this community, every business owner in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6852.122s">And</a>  we couldn't get that on local access to show the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6856.971s">The</a>  meeting was taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6858.132s">We</a>  couldn't get it on local access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6860.413s">However,</a>  every other event, Mr. President, if you look in Channel 15, is the mayor cutting a ribbon, the mayor going to the dog run, saying how we're going to have a dog park, telling people we're going to have a dog park in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6875.762s">You</a>  know, it's almost laughable what is happening in this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6882.066s">As</a>  Councilor Penta said, you have one person controlling all access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6887.222s">all</a>  media access. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6889.244s">Even</a>  the cameras here that are on the blink every so often, we have to beg the mayor to fix the cameras so viewers at home can watch our meeting without the tape going off and on, without the voice going up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6902.596s">You</a>  know, it really is a shame what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6906.6s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6911.548s">think</a>  maybe it has come time that maybe that we do look at a class action suit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6920.85s">And</a>  I don't take this very lightly when I mention it, Mr. President, but there's no reason that ratepayers' money, week after week, month after month, year after year, is going into funding something that we're not providing to the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6936.757s">And</a>  it's no different than resident permit parking stickers for years that may have had residents buy permit parking stickers and never enforced permit parking in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6949.28s">Never</a>  enforced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6950.56s">It</a>  wasn't until one of the news stations came down and did a story on it that it uncovered many people parking on our streets, on resident permit streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6964.65s">that</a>  didn't have stickers from other cities, days on end, and no enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6971.594s">So,</a>  there seems to be a pattern here with the mayor of, you know, in one breath saying, leadership that works, and on the other breath, doing absolutely nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6982.661s">Absolutely</a>  nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6983.722s">If</a>  I look in the local media again, in one of the websites, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=6987.067s">and</a>  see another picture of the mayor walking around promoting candidates running for public office and not doing his job here at City Hall, Mr. President, to me, that's grounds for termination right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7000.135s">We</a>  have so many issues that really, you should not see the mayor at a ribbon cutting for the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7006.278s">His</a>  head should be buried in that office, working on the issues that he has promised the people and the residents of this community for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7015.593s">And</a>  the inaction in this community speaks volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7018.855s">It</a>  speaks volumes, Mr. President, on what's going on throughout this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7023.497s">And</a>  what you're hearing now is a sense of frustration, because it's not one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7027.719s">It's</a>  many, many, many issues that are starting to build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7031.621s">And</a>  people are starting to get wise to it, saying, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7034.362s">Enough's</a>  enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7036.063s">Enough's</a>  enough in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7038.124s">And</a>  whether it's the cable, whether it's parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7041.185s">And</a>  just if I could, Mr. President, on parking enforcement, Councilor Prenta brought up <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7045.755s">and</a>  I won't steal his thunder, a few weeks back, the fact that the language that supposedly the mayor had added to the parking contract that stated there'll be two 30-minute free parking spots in each of the five business districts, and that there'll be a certain number of single head meters in each of the five business districts, as Councilor Penta so eloquently stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7073.244s">That</a>  language was never included in the final contract that was signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7078.148s">And</a>  I asked the city solicitor, and I'm not going to speak on his behalf, I said, why is that language not in the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7084.394s">And</a>  he said, that language is outside of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7087.897s">He</a>  said, there's a lot of language that is included in the request for proposal that is not in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7094.362s">but</a>  enables the city to move forward on issues like providing additional free parking spots in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7102.508s">So</a>  when the mayor came back to the business owners and said, I'm going to give two additional free 30-minute parking spots in each of the five business districts, he didn't have to negotiate that with Republic, the Tennessee company. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7115.678s">He</a>  did that unilaterally, and he did it without any vote of this council and without any other support. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7122.846s">In</a>  my situation, Mr. President, I would ask that the mayor increase that five-fold, that at least 10 spots, free 30-minute pocket spots be in each of the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7135.755s">And</a>  maybe at some point we'll get to a point where Republic says, hey, this changes the financial impact of the contract and we can no longer do this unless we negotiate a new contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7147.203s">But</a>  the fact is, Mr. President, the mayor was able to do that <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7151.223s">without</a>  any support of Republic or this council or any vote in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7158.207s">And</a>  I think, Mr. President, what we're seeing right now is not leadership from a mayor, but dictatorship, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7166.893s">And</a>  that's what we're experiencing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7168.834s">After</a>  28 years of the same dictator, we're seeing that it's no longer consensus and trying to find out what's best for our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7179.641s">It's</a>  someone just leading <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7181.405s">as</a>  a dictator. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7182.626s">And</a>  I think that's a sad commentary, what's happening in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7186.369s">And</a>  I hope residents of this community get wise to it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7649.533s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7651.486s">I</a>  felt it was appropriate that we bring this resolution forward this week, whereas we're not going to be meeting the week of Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7657.328s">As</a>  we all know, the country has been embroiled in turmoil for a number of years overseas in the Middle East. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7663.611s">And</a>  we've had many men and women return to Medford and return to Massachusetts, suffering from the effects of being overseas at war. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7673.035s">I</a>  think that we've seen a number of people come back from being overseas that are suffering from traumatic brain injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7679.479s">I</a>  just think that it's nice that we raise awareness and that we thank the men and women who've actually dedicated their lives and dedicated their time and dedicated their souls to protecting our freedoms, our democracy, and our country.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7691.697s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7693.282s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7693.942s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7695.042s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7696.423s">And</a>  just a reminder, there will be no council meeting next Tuesday evening because of election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7701.824s">And</a>  the following Tuesday, there will not be a meeting either because it is Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7706.445s">So</a>  therefore, we'll be meeting in three weeks from tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7711.186s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its sincere and deep condolences to the family of Martin Ford on his recent passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7720.508s">If</a>  we could please rise for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7730.312s">And</a>  just one announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7731.833s">Last</a>  week, when the topic came up during our meeting regarding ballot questions, the chair was in doubt whether we could take a stance as a body or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7740.879s">I</a>  got advised this week by the appropriate authorities that an elected body can take a stance on ballot questions, but they cannot take a stance on individual elected office, for governor, state rep, lieutenant governor example. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7756.45s">So</a>  I did seek out that answer because I was <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7759.834s">Didn't</a>  know the answer last week, so that is where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7765.616s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7767.016s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7768.196s">And</a>  also, last week, the issue of the South Method neighborhood safety walk was brought up to a resolution offered by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7779.86s">And</a>  we had a number of South Method residents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7783.1s">And</a>  at the time, it was mentioned that there was a violation <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7788.855s">of</a>  the open meeting law if more than four members of the council attended this particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7795.857s">And</a>  where part of my resolution was to try to expand this particular safety walk, I sent an email to the city solicitor and also the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7808.14s">And</a>  I believe we all got a response back via email from the city solicitor, Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7815.141s">And</a>  I just would like to read it for the edification of <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7818.219s">people</a>  that may be watching, I don't want anyone to believe that there was any doubt that there was no violation of the open meeting law at this neighborhood walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7830.908s">But</a>  it says, dear Councilor Marks, you have asked me whether the attendance of city councilors at an event organized by a private citizen group for the purpose of addressing neighborhood safety and other related concerns could potentially be a violation of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7846.239s">My</a>  answer is that the attendance <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7848.09s">by</a>  City Council is at such an event would not be a violation of the Open Meeting Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7852.994s">The</a>  basis for my conclusion is that General Law Chapter 38, the Open Meeting Law applies to public bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7860.079s">According</a>  to the facts you have presented to me, the neighborhood safety walk was organized by a private citizen group and was neither scheduled by the City Council nor was it subject to the Council's direction or control. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7874.05s">It</a>  was therefore essentially an opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7876.427s">for</a>  the participants, including the Councilors, to observe conditions in a particular neighborhood rather than to make decisions through a vote of a quorum or the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7887.516s">Even</a>  though the private citizen group that called for the walk was concerned with public issues, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7893.061s">neighborhood</a>  safety and related issues, it is not a public body as it is not an entity within the executive or legislative branches of state government or within any county, district, city, region, or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7905.182s">I</a>  hope this answers your opinion.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7906.844s">Respectfully,</a>  Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7908.565s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7910.067s">And</a>  also, I'm glad you brought this up because the Attorney General's office is actually the oversight authority on this particular matter now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7917.454s">It</a>  used to be the District Attorney's office, but within the last four or five years, it changed under the jurisdiction of the AG's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7923.74s">And</a>  the AG's office, if anyone wants to call them, if any deliberations or anything come up at a meeting, whether it's public body or not, it could be constitute a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7934.003s">So</a>  I know at your meeting there was no deliberations, but even talking about something that maybe the council has jurisdiction over, and I'm glad you asked the question to the city solicitor though. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7944.446s">But</a>  any further questions, you can ask the Attorney General's office, who is the authority, and they will give guidance to any public body. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7952.515s">On</a>  the motion of the records, the records were passed to Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7960.379s">How</a>  did you find the records, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7962.26s">Mr.</a>  President, I reviewed the records and I found them in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7964.822s">I</a>  took special consideration to look at the South Medford neighborhood walk to be sure that everything there was in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7970.705s">There</a>  were 13 amendments and they certainly all look like they were right to me, Mr. President, so I'd move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7976.387s">On</a>  the motion of approval of the records, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7979.315s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7979.976s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7981.18s">On</a>  the motion for adjournment, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7983.746s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7984.368s">The</a>  ayes have it.</p>
