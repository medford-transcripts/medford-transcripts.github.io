    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=180.897s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Hey mesye.
 Mersi, Msye Chairman, manm Board of Directors.
 Wi, se konsa isit la nou ye.
 Nou pral sèlman prezante epi bay dènye enfòmasyon sou pwojè jeni sivil nou yo.
 Manm ekip nou yo tout isit la.
 Mwen ta mande Steve Majorano si sa a oke.
 Pataje ekran an ak aswè a li pral vin mèt la glise.
 Premyèman, mwen pral bay yon ti ajou sou sa ki te pase depi dènye odyans lan epi prepare pou Steve ak ekip li a pran plas.
 Mèsi.
 Donk, ann kòmanse ak yon ti aktyalizasyon sou kote nou ye depi dènye odyans lan sa gen kèk semèn.
 Lè li rive revizyon kanmarad, nou te fè pwogrè sou plizyè fwon.
 Mr Chairman parey ou’n mansyonn sa problenm trafik, semenn pase nou’n ganny komanter Bayda lo analiz lenpak trafik. Nou ap revize ak absòbe kòmantè sa yo epi prepare yon repons fòmèl.
 Nou gen Scott Thornton sou liy lan aswè a.
 Repons pou kòmantè sa yo pa fè pati prezantasyon fòmèl sa a.
 Men, mwen wè ke manm ekip tès yo isit la epi yo ka fè kòmantè dirèkteman.
 Men, nou te resevwa yo, n ap revize yo, epi yon fwa nou te gen yon chans dijere yo konplètman, nou pral òganize yon reyinyon revizyon parèy swiv ak ekip la pou diskite sou yo.
 Sou bò konstriksyon, nou te resevwa fidbak nan men Cliff.
 Revize pa Cliff Bowmer nan Davis Square Architects.
 Nou apresye kòmantè ou epi n ap revize li epi n ap prepare yon repons.
 Nou ap kowòdone ak Cliff yon reyinyon revizyon parèy swiv semèn pwochèn.
 Nou pral pare pou li kòmantè ou yo epi kontinye
 Konbine yo epi sèvi ak li anvan pwochen odyans lan kote nou ka revize ak prezante achitekti a ankò.
 Se konsa, nan yon pèspektiv sivil, nou jwenn
 Note de BEDA ki kontinye travay.
 Nou pa t resevwa fòmèlman fidbak ou, kidonk aswè a pa reprezante fidbak revizyon parèy yo.
 Lè nou resevwa fidbak nan moman sa a, nou pral fè ajisteman oswa ranje ki baze sou limit fidbak la ak si li bezwen adrese.
 Yon fwa nou gen yo, sa nou pral definitivman fè, mwen pa pral pale pou ekip tès la ki nan apèl la ankò, men nan pèspektiv nou an, se la nou chita kounye a, ap tann pou demo a aswè a.
 Mwen panse ke diskou sa a pral reponn anpil kesyon.
 Nou te eseye adapte li pou konsantre sou bagay ki te diskite nan odyans anvan yo, pwoblèm ki te soulve anvan, pou eseye bay plis klarifikasyon ke posib.
 Se konsa, si ou vle ale nan pwochen glise a, Steve, mwen pral fè sa pou ou.
 Mwen pral pase li sou ou pita, ak yon mesaj itil nan men ekip mwen an nan fen.
 Mesye Peter Tam nan Goulston pa la aswè a.

 Se konsa, si ou gen nenpòt dout
 Sa a se espesifik nan bò legal la nan bagay sa yo epi pandan ke li pa la mwen ka ranvwaye li jiskaske li se.
 Li pral rive pita aswè a.
 Mwen jis vle montre sa a nenpòt moun ki kontakte mwen oswa ekip legal la pita nan odyans lan.
 Sa te di, Steve, si ou vle kòmanse yon Demo, sa ta bon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=455.983s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  Great.
 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

 Lakou rekreyasyon pou timoun nan koulwa a ak bò kote bilding lan.
 Kòm ou ka wè, youn nan premye se vizitè a k ap antre nan zòn nan livrezon.
 Dezyèm lan se lakou rekreyasyon an.
 Twazyèm lan se yon pak chen zèb atifisyèl.
 Yo tout antoure pa pyebwa pwopoze ak lòt plantasyon, ki pral ajoute valè estetik epi amelyore kapasite dlo lapli nan sit la epi kreye yon pi bon eksperyans espas ouvè pou kominote a.
 Katriyèmman se etajè bisiklèt la, ki sitiye akote depo bisiklèt la, ki bay plis espas pakin pou bisiklèt.
 Nan nimewo 5, gen kèk ekipman fizik sou yon pasaj siwouyan ki kontinye nan nimewo 8, ki se tan kap vini an epi ki gen potansyèl pou konekte ak yon liy tren nan lavni.
 Sizyèm lan se te pou bay yon pasaj nan espas vèt amenaje sou bò lwès bilding lan pou pwoteje pakin sifas yo ak pi byen entegre ak katye a pandan bilding lan ap bese, epi answit nou te kreye yon kwen ki pi dous ak pwopozisyon jaden flè ak pye bwa ak plis touf ak kontinuèl.
 Uh, uh, anplis de twotwa yo ke Steve uh, uh, te pwopoze yo, li kreye yon chemen adisyonèl, uh, nou ap ajoute twotwa adisyonèl nan Amarante ki ka itilize pou, uh, mache ak bisiklèt, epi alavni ta ka fè pati sa a, uh, rezo bisiklèt ki ta ka konekte kominote a ak liy tren sa a.
 Nimewo 10 se kote nou espere ke ak plis kowòdinasyon yon estasyon sik ble ka enkli, sa sanble se yon bon adisyon nan zòn sa a akote estasyon otobis la ak amelyore kapasite transpò nan zòn nan.
 Epi ou ka wè lakou a.
 Nou gen de teras ak fonksyon diferan adjasan ak zòn sèvis entèn yo.
 Nou gen yon pisin nan dezyèm etaj la, ansanm ak espas vèt ak aktivite deyò pou rezidan yo itilize.
 Pwochen glise tanpri.
 Sa a se yon apèsi sou plan ekleraj la ak estrateji ekleraj nou an ki pral itilize yon konbinezon diferan aparèy limyè ki gen ladan aparèy mi, poto limyè pou pyeton, pi gwo poto limyè pou pakin machin ak bollard.
 Nou te travay ak Lighting Design pou asire ke tout enstalasyon yo te dirije ak Dark Sky konpatib epi evite enpak sou zòn adjasan yo, pandan y ap bay tout espas deyò ak nivo limyè apwopriye ki nesesè pou asire sekirite ak aksè pou moun ki pakin alantou bilding nan.
 Sa yo se jis yon gade pi detaye sou ekipman yo, espas deyò ak karakteristik espas ouvè yo montre nan apèsi a, ansanm ak kèk imaj adisyonèl anvan ak imaj enspirasyon pou ba ou yon lide sou kisa espas sa a ta ka sanble nan:
 Ki jan li pral sanble, ki jan li pral travay, ak materyèl yo ki pral itilize nan potansyèl sa a.
 Kare devan an pral louvri epi pètèt pi lejè, ak pave ak plante adisyonèl, ki pral bay bilding nan yon aparans plezi ak akeyan.
 Next glise.
 Sa a sanble anpil ak aparans nan yon lakou rekreyasyon, ak adisyon a nan kloti apwopriye, pètèt chèz adisyonèl ak ti ekipman jwe pou rezidan yo ak vwazen yo.
 Kòm ou ka wè, pak chen klase twazyèm.
 Nou te fè entansyonèl deplase pak pou chen an lwen lari a epi nou te plante plis pye bwa alantou li pou filtre nenpòt bri adisyonèl ki ta ka pwodwi.
 Pwodui lè l sèvi avèk pak la chen, li se tou pratik pou rezidan yo itilize chak jou.
 Gen kèk ki prezante imaj ekipman fizik ak etajè pou bisiklèt ki pral liy pasaj la sou bò lwès bilding lan.
 Ak sa li ka ofri moun k ap itilize li.
 Pwochen youn.
 Foto karaktè sa yo montre ki jan jaden ak twotwa yo pral sanble, bay espas pou moun kouri, monte bisiklèt, epi ajoute ekran vèt nan bilding yo epi pwoteje twotwa yo nan lari a, machin ki estasyone, ak fasad bilding yo.
 Gen kèk foto enspire sou teren yo ak ekipman ki nan yo pou rezidan yo itilize.
 Sa a se estasyon bisiklèt ble mwen mansyone.
 Gen plas pou objeksyon.
 Nou te panse li ta yon kote ki apwopriye, men evidamman lè ou ale ak bisiklèt ble ou dwe reflechi plis ak anpil atansyon sou mete sit la nan pi bon plas pou moun jwenn aksè ak itilize li.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se dènye glisad la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2419.579s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, sa a se dènye glise nou an.
 Yeah, bisiklèt ble a, jis pou ba ou kèk kontèks poukisa nou te chwazi bisiklèt ble la, anpil fwa yo vle mete l sou pwopriyete prive, men nan yon kote ki trè vizib tou pre twotwa piblik la pou moun konnen li la.
 Se konsa, nou te chwazi kote sa a, men evidamman gen kèk fleksibilite ak gade nan ki soti nan kwen sa a.
 Bisiklèt ble panse yon lòt jan.
 Nou pral jwenn li yon nouvo kay, men li fè sans.
 Dwat nan estasyon bis la.
 Moun yo ka monte yon bisiklèt ble pou ale nan bis la, pake li epi monte nan otobis la, oswa yo ka pran otobis la epi desann, monte sou bisiklèt ble a epi ale nan yo...
 Pi pre lakay ou.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon bon kote.
 Nou panse ke sa a se yon gwo adisyon nan pwojè a.
 Sa a fini prezantasyon nou an.
 Pat, mwen pa konnen si ou gen nenpòt nòt final oswa ou vle fini.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2470.844s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Yeah, pa espesifik, mwen ka sèlman akonpli yon ti kras, fèmen bisiklèt la ble mwen tou espesyalman te panse a. Mwen te gen kèk konvèsasyon inisyal ak kèk nan mesye yo nan ekip ble a, jis yo rive konnen yo.
 Opinyon ou sou posibilite kote a.
 An jeneral, yo tout te dakò se te yon bon kote, pa sèlman an tèm de gwosè, men tou an tèm de pwoksimite ak lòt estasyon yo te panse ta dwe apwopriye.
 Se konsa, nou ap pwopoze epi yo ta sètènman vle ajoute ak kowòdone ak vil la ak Bluebikes ajoute yon estasyon la.
 Men, nan fen prezantasyon an jeneral,
 Mwen konnen nou pral yon ti kras temèt, kidonk mwen panse ke nou pral ba ou kèk konsèy nan fen.
 Sa a se yon ti rezime kèk nan travay sivil n ap fè sou pwojè jeni sivil nou yo, pa gen anyen plis.
 Senpleman mete, li se planifikasyon sit, jaden, sèvis piblik, pakin, ak anpil nan sa ou wè tout travay ansanm.
 Se konsa, jis konfime pou tout moun, sa a se pa yon koleksyon o aza nan bagay.
 Nou ap eseye reponn kesyon yo epi bay plis detay sou sa Bowler ap mande vil la nan pwosè sivil la ak sa k ap revize parèy yo.
 Te pase vèsyon beta a.
 Se konsa, jan Steve mansyone anvan, men kèk bagay nou ta renmen revize, adrese, oswa elaji sou.
 Nou pa vle pèsonn santi tankou si gen yon pwoblèm ak demo a, kòm toujou, nou vle asire w ke nou ka reponn kesyon sa yo, men nou gen opòtinite tou pou
 Menm bagay la tou ale pou revizyon kanmarad ak repons ekip swivi.
 Se konsa, mwen jis te vle vlope nan diskou a.
 Se konsa, èspere ke li pa twò okipe pou tout moun, men jis te vle asire w ke nou kouvri tout sijè ke nou te santi nou bezwen.
 Se konsa, mwen pral fèmen epi louvri li jiska kesyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2612.827s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi, se konsa panse mwen se nou pral nan beta trè byento.
 Mwen konnen kòmantè revizyon parèy yo poko pare, men mwen jis vle jwenn yon lide jeneral ak ki lè nou ta dwe antisipe yo epi apre nou pral poze kesyon nan tablo a.
 Mwen wè nou gen Jeff nan gwoup tès la.
 Tanpri kontinye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2639.459s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Wi bonswa Msye Chairman, bann manm board.
 Se konsa, kite m 'di ou sa mwen genyen aswè a.
 Se konsa, mwen gen sa a.
 Prezantasyon PowerPoint, mwen ka rezime kòmantè transpò nou te bay nan lèt la.
 Lè sa a, mwen ka montre li ba ou.
 Mwen gen kèk kòmantè nan men Bill McGrath, enjenyè sivil nou an.
 Mwen revize pwojè sa a epi li an vakans semèn sa a, men mwen gen yon lis imèl pou li.
 Mwen siyen kòm yon prezantasyon.
 Mwen ka li lis la si ou vle, men si ou gen kesyon detaye, mwen pa ka reponn yo.
 Sa a se eksperyans mwen, men mwen ka li kòmantè preliminè ou yo si ou ta renmen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2690.178s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, donk, èske li sanble ke Bill toujou ap travay sou kòmantè yo? Oswa èske gen yon lis kòmantè ou poko fè kòmantè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2700.087s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Oke, mwen pa vle pale pou li.
 Mwen ta di sa a se lis preliminè yo.
 Sa a ka pa yon bagay ki sèten ankò, men nou ap travay sou li.
 Mwen ta ka di petèt semèn pwochèn lè mwen tounen soti nan vakans mwen ta ka vlope yo nan yon lèt kouvèti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2716.223s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, sanble bon.
 Se poutèt sa, nou planifye pou egzamine yo an plis detay nan pwochen odyans lan.
 Sa ap bay moun k ap poze kesyon an yon ti tan tou pou l resevwa fidbak epi kòmanse reponn.
 Son plan.
 Wi, Jeff, mwen pral retounen sou kesyon ou a sou transpò pita.
 Premyèman, mwen ale nan whiteboard la epi poze kesyon sou prezantasyon an.
 Li sanble bon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2745.784s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Wi, mèsi.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2747.785s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tout se byen.
 Kesyon ak kòmantè Komisyon Konsèy yo pral kòmanse kounye a.
 Jamie, ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2762.478s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke li se yon gwo Demo.
 Mwen apresye jaden flè an jeneral ekleraj ak jan li konfòme ak syèl nwa.
 Mwen te panse li te trè konplè pou kondisyon yo ak eleman nou te vle kouvri.
 Mwen gen yon kesyon lè ou pale sou pwen fokal antre nan bilding lan ak fasad la se pwen antre nan Myrtle Street.
 Mwen devine sèl enkyetid mwen an se nan yon pwendvi adrès: Èske bilding lan ta dwe rele 970 Fellsway san referans a adrès Myrtle Street, jis nan konsiderasyon pou Google Maps, Apple Maps, ak moun ki pa konnen zòn nan ta dwe dirije nan antre nan Fellsway olye de antre Myrtle Street la?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2809.941s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, mwen ka reponn sa.
 Si sa nesesè, pwopriyete a ta dwe sibdivize epi pwopriyete rezidansyèl la pa ta gen fasad Fellsway e kidonk pa ta gen yon adrès Fellsway.
 970 ap gen plis chans toujou ap adrès depo a.
 Jodi a, li nan tout nan pake a, se poutèt sa yo rele 970 la.
 Men, bilding ki egziste a pral kenbe adrès sa a.
 Nouvo bilding lan pral gen yon adrès, li ka sèlman gen yon adrès nan Murta oswa Amaranto.
 Myrtle sanble se kandida nou genyen kounye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2849.895s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Sa a se yon dezas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2855.676s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tout se byen.
 Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?
 Andre, tanpri ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2866.31s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Mèsi pou entwodiksyon an.
 Super enfòmasyon itil.
 Jis kèk kesyon.
 Youn, mwen konnen te gen kèk kòmantè piblik yon ti tan de sa sou enstalasyon, jaden, epi mwen ap mande si te gen nenpòt konvèsasyon ak vwazen sou karakteristik sa yo, espesyalman lakou rekreyasyon an.
 Mwen kirye tou si ou gen nenpòt lide konseptyèl ekspresyon pou enkòpore atizay piblik oswa enfòmasyon istorik oswa sèvis oswa nenpòt bagay tankou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2908.533s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, mwen ka sote.
 Kòmanse ak premye kesyon an, mwen te rankontre ak kèk vwazen epi mwen te gen anpil diskisyon sou pwojè a.
 Youn nan pwoblèm yo se aranjman nan espas deyò, ak jeneralman pale, kèk nan vwazen yo mwen te rankontre yo sou apèl.
 Mwen pa vle defòme anyen ki di, men an jeneral kòmantè mwen jwenn yo se sou jwe deyò, ekipman fizik deyò ki pa nesesèman enteresan pou kèk vwazen.
 Yo pa nesesèman imajine tèt yo lè l sèvi avèk li.
 Konvèsasyon nou te fè a se te ke nou te vle espas deyò a te planifye yo dwe yon benefis pou kominote a epi nou te ouvè a fidbak yo si te gen nenpòt bagay yo te vle wè.
 Men an jeneral, men repons mwen te resevwa jiskaprezan.
 Konsènan atizay piblik,
 Repons kesyon sa a se wi, sa depann de si nou gen kapasite pou konsidere li.
 Nou pa gen espesifik
 Gen yon lide espesifik nan tèt ou.
 Mon krwar sa ki nou’n retire dan sa dernyen odisyon ki konsantre lo lachitektir se ki nou pou kontinyen konsider sa kestyon, pou dir, dan kad sa peer review.
 Mwen pa vle jete sèvyèt la, men mwen panse ke ak pwochen reyinyon revizyon parèy achitèk Davis Square ak eksteryè bilding yo, ak pote eleman yo jaden flè nan konsantre nan konvèsasyon aktyèl la.
 Sa a se yon bagay nou ap eseye panse plis sou.
 Mon pa konnen ki finalman nou kapab garanti ki nou pou annan en design tre formel pou public art.
 Sa a se yon ti kras TBD, men jeneralman pale, reponn kesyon an, wi, nou ta sètènman ouvè a enkòpore li kòm yon pati nan sit la nan diferan zòn nan sit la.
 Si manm konsèy la oswa manm kominote a gen sijesyon sou sa pou yo fè oswa ki kote pou fè li, nou ta renmen tande fidbak.
 Franchman, li te trè itil pandan nou te avanse ak plan yo pou bilding lan ak ki sa li ta aktyèlman sanble.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3071.088s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen te wè Direktè Hunter leve men l.
 Mwen jis vle pale ak Andre anvan.
 Andre, ou gen lòt kesyon? Oswa èske sa a reponn kesyon ou a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3082.759s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Wi, pa gen pwoblèm sou pwoblèm sa yo.
 Mwen gendwa te fè kèk lòt kòmantè, men mwen byen kontan ke Alicia te antre.
 Direktè Hunter, tanpri antre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3090.006s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Mèsi.
 An reyalite, mwen jis te vle pote moute, padon, swivi a nan sa ou mansyone, paske
 Enpresyon m, e m ap mande si w panse sa se vre, se ke vwazen ou te pale ak yo se te tout vwazen adrès Myrtle Street la, kidonk yo te tout kay ak lakou.
 Èske w te janm pale ak moun ki abite Amaranth Place yo, ki se apatman ki sanble pa gen yon lakou louvri ki asosye avèk yo?
 Paske se la li ye
 Biwo a kwè kèk espas ouvè ta benefisye katye apatman sa yo.
 Mwen jis vle klarifye sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3128.948s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Non, sa se yon bon kesyon.
 Mwen pa t rankontre okenn moun ki abite nan Amaranth Place Apartments.
 Kidonk, mo mwen reprezante yo pa soti nan yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3139.158s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Ekselan.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3141.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi, Andre.
 Retounen ba ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3143.899s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Wi, sa se yon bon pwen.
 Alice.
 Mèsi pou mansyone sa a.
 oh.
 Jis kèk kòmantè oswa kesyon sou sikilasyon.
 Oke, 1 se liy dwat ki genyen ant.
 Pwojè a pwopoze ak etablisman depo, imedyatman te sanble long.
 Mwen mande si yo ap konsidere kèk baryè oswa lòt kalite mitigasyon.
 Mwen kirye tou si ou ta ka eksplike yon ti kras plis.
 Ki kote kamyon yo pral deplase epi ki jan yo pral antre epi ale nan garaj la ak ki kote yo pral fè li?
 Ki kote moun pral deplase mèb elatriye?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3191.623s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Natirèlman, mwen pral pataje ekran an ankò pou nou ka wè kèk grafik.
 Wi, yon liy dwat se yon liy dwat long.
 Bonis la se ke pakin devan kalme trafik, dwa?
 Li pa pral sanble ak yon lari vil ki ankouraje kondwi gwo vitès.
 Nou pa gen vitès monte oswa
 Nenpòt flyover oswa nenpòt bagay konsa ki pwopoze kounye a, mwen pa di nou pa ka fè li, men yo anjeneral yo se yon pwoblèm antretyen e ki prezante yon seri diferan defi.
 Men, nou pral definitivman pran yon gade pi pre.
 Nou fè entansyonèlman fè sa nan yon ang 90 degre nan papòt la.
 Se konsa, moun yo dwe vini epi yo dwe konsa.
 Se konsa, li pa tankou liy rapid.
 Aparamman gen yon ang 90 degre sou lòt bout la tou.
 Se poutèt sa, moun yo gen yon sèten kantite tan yo rete dwat anvan yo kanpe ak vire 90 degre.
 Alor mon krwar sa i en distans rezonnab, me definitivman i en bon pwen pour regard en pti pe pli lwen.
 Konsènan chajman, jan nou te wè, nou te travay sou kamyon ponpye a pou kamyon nechèl la te kapab vwayaje nan tout bilding nan.
 Kamyon k ap deplase yo souvan itilize pou pwojè tankou sa a.
 Panse a yon U-Haul gqo, ki se yon ti kras pi piti pase yon machin pasaje, men li pa nesesèman yon U-Haul.
 Men, kalite kamyon bwat sèl sa a,
 Li se yon ti kras pi bon pase yon kamyon ponpye.
 Se konsa, nenpòt kote nou montre kamyon ponpye mobil yo, kamyon dife mobil yo ka ale, men yo pral aktyèlman nan dèyè bilding lan.
 Se konsa, yo ap eseye rive nan kornich ki nan do a pou yo ka jwenn sou Amaranth ak monte sou kornich la isit la.
 yo kapab
 Si yo pèmèt yo, yo ta ka travèse Fellsway epi antre nan bò sa a nan bilding lan.
 Operasyon chaj yo pran plas dèyè pòt sa a.
 Gen kago ak asansè la.
 Se konsa, operasyon an chaje se aktyèlman sou liy sa a bò wout, epi pa gen okenn espas pakin sou bò wout la.
 Sitiye sou bò lari a nan bilding lan pou yo ka pake sou twotwa a, dechaje makèt, ale nan pòt la dèyè epi pran asansè a nan etaj yo.
 Kamyon yo pa gen dwa nan garaj la.
 Aksè nan garaj la pral nan nivo kamyon, kidonk pral gen pakin aksesib pou kamyon.
 Se konsa, si ou gen yon pi piti kamyon k ap deplase, li ka anfòm nan yon garaj, men se pa kòm yon kamyon bwat.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3362.226s">[Unidentified]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Mwen jis vle fè kòmantè.
 Ou te di yo te kapab pake sou twotwa a.
 Sa a se yon twotwa, dwa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3368.909s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Gen yon pasaj ki defini kwen bilding lan.
 Donk, gen yon twotwa, epi apre twotwa a ap monte pou yo ka pake sou twotwa a adjasan ak twotwa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3383.955s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tout se byen.
 Èske konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon?
 Kim, ou silans.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3406.901s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: Kòm pou bisiklèt, konbyen bisiklèt nou ka estoke lakay nou?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3419.029s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Mwen ka sote.
 Sa a te youn nan kòmantè nou te resevwa nan men evalè Mesye Bomer kòm yon pati nan konsepsyon achitekti k ap kontinye.
 Nou ap finalize gwosè chanm sa a sou plan sit la e plan tè a rete.
 Kounye a nou ap travay sou detèmine pye kare nan chanm sa a ak Lè sa a, mete ansanm yon konsepsyon konsèp.
 Nou te konsantre sou anpil bisiklèt ke posib epi gade diferan gwosè etajè bisiklèt ak mont etajè, si wi ou non etaj kanpe oswa sou miray, ap eseye maksimize efikasite nan espas sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen pa gen yon repons espesifik an tèm de nimewo, men an tèm de pye kare nan chanm nan, nou ap travay sou rafine sa kounye a epi yo ta dwe kapab bay omwen yon nimewo ballpark nan prezantasyon an pwochen apre revizyon bilding lan.
 Mèsi.
 Padon, sa a aplike a bisiklèt nan chanm bisiklèt bilding lan.
 Nou te montre zòn ki deyò sal la, kote etajè yo mete deyò pou sere bisiklèt tou.
 Mwen panse ke nou ta ka tou presize yon kantite lajan pou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3500.71s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3509.002s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Oke, èske mwen ka kontinye kòmantè mwen sou pakin bisiklèt?
 Nan dènye pwojè 40B nou te gade, yon bagay nou te fè fas ak anpil se pakin bisiklèt.
 Se konsa, bay scooter elektrik ak bisiklèt yo pi komen pase tout tan anvan, lè w ap konsidere konsepsyon yon etajè bisiklèt,
 Oke, ou konnen, gen dife okazyonèl ki difisil pou etenn ak bagay sa yo.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle pran sa an kont epi asire w ke li se yon kote ki ignifuje.
 Oke, zòn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3548.73s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Tanpri sonje ke depo bisiklèt nou an sitiye nan etaj la, li pral nan nivo Podium ak sa a se yon bilding ki pa ka pran dife.
 Li evidan, nou ka antre nan bagay sa yo lè pwojè a vin nan nivo dokiman konsepsyon, dokiman konstriksyon, ak Lè sa a, voye li soti pou revizyon kòd.
 Men, li pi bon asire w ke nou trete li kòm yon jaden jwe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3579.455s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: Jim?
 Wi, sou menm sijè a, mwen konnen anpil kote pa pèmèt e-bisiklèt nan inite akòz danje dife.
 Èske sa ap konsidere?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3601.675s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sa a se yon bon kesyon.
 Jouk jounen jodi a, nou poko gen konvèsasyon sa a.
 Nou te chèche opinyon plizyè ekip jesyon pwopriyete, ansanm ak ekip jesyon byen entèn Davis la.
 Sa a se pa yon sijè ki vini, kidonk mwen pa gen yon repons konkret pou kesyon sa a.
 Nou ka sètènman envestige ak kowòdone ak ekip jesyon pwopriyete a, ak ansanm ak lòt bagay,
 Moun ki rete nan bilding nan pral jwenn enfòmasyon detaye ak règ ak règleman yo siyen lè egzekite kontra lwaye yo.
 Nou ka sètènman gade nan sa a pi lwen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3647.971s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tèlman enpòtan, an reyalite, ke mwen pa sonje li.
 Mwen panse ke sa a ka yo te mansyone nan yon pòs anvan.
 Piblik, men èske ankadreman sa a nan pati rezidansyèl la fèt an bwa oswa kèk lòt materyèl?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3666.182s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Se vre.
 Se konsa, ki sa bilding lan te sanble ak pwojè aktyèl yo
 Sa a se yon bilding podium.
 Konfigirasyon aktyèl la te evidamman rive nan nivo siperyè.
 Gen eleman konstriksyon senk sou youn ak kat sou youn.
 Plis pase yon sèl se nivo ki pa pran dife ou, si se asye oswa konkrè pa te defini fòmèlman ankò, men pi wo a nivo ki pa pran dife ta dwe yon ankadreman bwa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3702.173s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mwen wè.
 Rezon ki fè mwen mande se,
 Youn nan rezon ki fè nou te pase anpil tan diskite sou pwoblèm sa a nan odyans 40B anvan yo se ke sa a se te yon bilding ki sanble ak komisyonè bilding nou an nan epòk la te gen eksperyans dirèk ak Waltham Fire, nan ka sa a yon dife estrikti.
 Men, fondamantalman se kalite bilding sa a bati
 Risk dife a wo nan sèten sitiyasyon.
 Se konsa, kenbe sa a nan tèt ou lè w ap gade lòt gwoup yo.
 Mwen panse ke oryantasyon, espesyalman pou menm kalite bilding, se pwobableman pi bon pratik yo itilize isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3745.348s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, konprann ak yon bon pwen.
 An tèm de ranpli konsepsyon an, sa a pral konplètman konfòme ak kondisyon kòd epi li pral evidamman ale nan yon pwosesis revizyon.
 Lè sa a, pandan konstriksyon, manadjè konstriksyon an pral travay ak Medford Ponpye Depatman an pou devlope plan NFPA 241 la epi konfòme li ak tout règ ak règleman ki gen rapò ak li.
 Nou bay tout konsiderasyon ki kalite konstriksyon ki an bwa ankadreman ak risk ki asosye ak li.
 Oke, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3787.53s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?
 Andre, ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3795.043s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Èske w ka eksplike an plis detay de ki enfrastrikti chaje machin elektrik w ap pale a?
 Paske li pa sanble anpil.
 Mwen vle di, nou ap pale de yon tranzisyon rapid nan machin elektrik pandan senk a dis ane kap vini yo.
 Li evidan, youn nan pi gwo obstak yo se disponiblite estasyon rechaj yo.
 Li ta bon si ou ta ka eksplike nou li yon ti kras plis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3822.498s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, Pat, ou vle mwen fè sa?
 Mwen pral di w kote yo ye.
 Mwen pral pote imaj la tounen nan ekran an montre sa nou te kòmanse avèk yo.
 Apre sa, nou pral pale sou opòtinite ki genyen nan bilding nan.
 Se konsa, jis rale nan yon ti kras isit la.
 Ankò, gen 14 espas, de nan yo se tradisyonèl ak Lè sa a, de espas aksesib.
 Akoz i difisil pou retourn pli tar e enstal lenfrastriktir, tiyo, pran kouran, e met anplas lo deor sa batiman, nou anvi met tou sa ki an plas depi premye zour pour ki lenfrastriktir i an plas e pare pour ale.
 Opsyon ekstansyon an pèmèt aksè nan garaj la, men nou jis pa t 'gen li
 Mete li andedan yon garaj se relativman fasil osi lontan ke nou planifye davans epi enstale enfrastrikti elektrik apwopriye a, dwa?
 Transformateur, switchboards, elatriye.
 Nou bezwen prepare pou konstwi sou pouvwa sa a alavni.
 Nou bezwen planifye davans e enplimant sa plan.
 Lè nou antre nan faz konsepsyon lòd travay la, nou pral kowòdone travay sa a ak konpayi elektrik la.
 Sepandan, yon fwa ou gen enfrastrikti enpòtan sa a, ajoute ekipman nan garaj ou relativman fasil paske ou ka enstale tiyo sou do kay garaj ou.
 Epi kouri li kote ou vle epi ajoute estasyon nenpòt ki lè.
 Se konsa nou apwoche sit la, n ap chèche konnen bagay ki pi difisil yo depi premye jou a epi bay fleksibilite sa a.
 Kòm Anjanita te di, li ap agrandi rapidman.
 Nou pa konnen ki demann lan pral genyen nan kèk ane, men li fasil pou ajoute.
 Pat, mwen mande si ou gen nenpòt lòt bagay pou ajoute sou bilding lan?
 Men opinyon mwen sou opòtinite ekspansyon EV.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ou frape klou a sou tèt la.
 Pwosesis panse nou an se te enstale chajè EV sou eksteryè bilding lan kòm yon pati nan estrikti bilding lan.
 Nou te tande nan men manm konsèy la ak lòt moun ki te patisipe nan odyans ki anwo a ke yo jis te vle wè chajè machin elektrik yo ki sitiye deyò bilding lan.
 Se konsa, nou panse ke fè sa sou plas se yon bagay ke nou ka fè an konsè ak ekspansyon nan lavni, gen kapasite nan fè sa epi yo gen fleksibilite nan bon gwosè enfrastrikti elektrik la, men ke yo te kapab fè sa nan nivo a Podium, nan nivo bilding ki pa ka pran dife, tout wout la jiska nivo garaj, ke yo te kapab enstale tiyo sou do kay la epi ajoute estasyon rechaj machin elektrik.
 Franchman, Davis Company te gen siksè ak lòt pwojè epi li kapab ajoute sou jan sa nesesè oswa kòm demann ap grandi.
 Li vrèman yon kesyon de kowòdone enfrastrikti elektrik ou.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, repete sa Steve te di, men tande li dirèkteman nan men mwen, sa a se jis yon pati nan fason nou konsepsyon sit la ak panse sou li konseptyèlman, poukisa ou pral wè yo chita sou sit la ak chanje kòm bilding nan ap grandi nan lavni.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Wi, mwen jis vle di, mwen vle di, mwen kontan ou ap gade agrandi anndan an.
 Mwen jis panse ke ak anpil pakin, menm nan premye jou a, li ta ase yo chaje machin yo elektrik.
 Mwen ta definitivman rekòmande plis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sa a se yon bagay nou ka definitivman gade nan.
 Mwen pa gen yon repons konkrè pou quantifier, men nou pran nòt sijesyon ou epi definitivman pral konsidere li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4075.973s">[Unidentified]</a>: Mèsi.
 Kòm yon swivi, èske estasyon chaj rapid sa yo oswa kote ou vle moun yo pake ak chaje lannwit lan?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sa a se yon bon kesyon.
 Mwen panse ke gen plizyè nivo.
 Tout se yon ti kras kowòdinasyon ak enfrastrikti pouvwa a, ki kantite pouvwa ou ka jwenn, ak ki jan gwo nan yon bwat ou bezwen bay ki kalite pouvwa ou bezwen.
 Mwen ka di ke mwen panse estasyon chaj rapid yo reyèlman plis pase sa yo ye.
 Pou yon bilding tankou sa a, sa a ta dwe konsidere kòm tipik, menm atipik, nan sans gwo dimansyon li yo.
 Mwen pa gen yon repons konkret.
 Mwen panse ke nou vle rann yo efikas ke posib, men nou pral bezwen kalkile espesifikasyon egzak estasyon chaj yo pita yon fwa nou ka aktyèlman quantifier ak enjenyè elektrik yo epi travay ak founisè sèvis piblik yo konfime konbyen pouvwa ka rive sou sit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Kòm yon nòt bò, anjeneral nan kalite devlopman sa a nou itilize sèlman chajè konvansyonèl paske rezidan yo espere ale lakay yo epi pake lannwit lan.
 Se poutèt sa, pousantaj chak swa yo pa pral yon baryè pou fè biznis tipik.
 Si sa a se yon wotasyon ki pi kout tèm, ou reyèlman bezwen yon chaj pi vit nan pwen sa a.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4170.979s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: OK
 Sepandan, si menm 14 moun yo itilize 14 espas sa yo nan mitan lannwit, epi ou gen plis pase 300 espas pou tcheke, w ap toujou itilize yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4186.36s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi, se sa mwen vle di.
 Se sa mwen panse.
 Èske espas sa yo fèt pou moun ki gen machin elektrik? Oswa, ou konnen, nan opinyon Andre, si yo pa dedye epi yo chaje pi vit, èske nou ka bay lokatè espas sa yo, sèvi ak yo pou chaje, ak Lè sa a, deplase machin yo epi fè yo disponib pou lòt moun?
 Pale soti, li nan evidamman jis yon lide.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, se yon bagay nou dwe kowòdone.
 Nou bezwen kowòdone atravè lekip jesyon pwopriyete.
 Mon krwar anba sa bann kondisyon ki ou pe koz lo la, ler nou finaliz bann kantite, si i imedyatman determinen ki i bezwen plis, mon krwar nou santi nou konfortab avek abilite pou fasilman ajoute plis.
 Kidonk, si rezidan yo pa kapab chaje machin yo paske yo okipe nan travay yo, nou pral kapab kowòdone plis estasyon rechaj yo alavni.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi, yon bagay mwen pral mansyone nan pòs sa a se ke sa a se yon anviwònman klima frèt.
 Se poutèt sa mwen panse ke machin elektrik bezwen omwen kèk espas enteryè.
 Se konsa, konpreyansyon an se ke li se pi fasil yo ajoute.
 Nan retwouve, pre-planifikasyon lè li rive enstalasyon enfrastrikti te nesesè.
 Kidonk, li ta bon pou fiti telespektatè nou yo konnen ki plan yo ye, tankou, ki sa yo ap gade fè, konbyen yo ka elaji, epi si yo pral gen kèk, tankou, èske w konnen jodi a ke yo pral gen kèk espas dedye?
 Epitou nan pakin nan, oswa ak aranjman aktyèl la tout bagay se deyò?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4304.051s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Nan pwen sa a, aparans la rekòmande pou enstalasyon.
 Parey mon’n dir detrwa minit, nou’n konpran feedback ki pou nou eksplore konbyen vacancy ki i annan e si sa ki nou pe propoze aktyelman i paret pa ase, nou ava fer enpe resers lo sa e apre nou kapab reponn avek sa ki nou krwar i bon.
 Epi si wi ou non genyen plis enteryè oswa plis eksteryè.
 Se konsa, nou ka sètènman elaji sou lide sa a.
 OK, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4340.081s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?
 Yon kesyon yo te poze m men yo poko poze se:
 Kote posib pou estasyon otobis lekòl la.
 Kidonk, mwen pa konnen ki kote estasyon otobis ki pi pre a ye jodi a, men mwen konnen kounye a li nan itilizasyon endistriyèl e pwobableman ap gen kèk fanmi k ap viv nan nouvo bilding nan.
 Se konsa, wi, ki kote otobis lekòl la ta kanpe toupre pasèl sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4387.755s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Pèsonèlman, mwen pa t gade estasyon otobis lekòl yo oswa wout yo.
 Mwen pa konnen si yo ale nan Myrtle Street oswa ki wout ki pi pre a, men nou ka definitivman gade ak ekip transpò a epi chèche konnen ki kote sa a.
 Mwen panse ke ekspansyon Myrtle la prezante kèk nouvo opòtinite ke nou poko eksplore, men nou ta renmen pran yon gade nan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4413.771s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4417.797s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4419.959s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Mwen gen yon kesyon ak kòmantè.
 Se Yvette.
 Konsènan inite depo ki rete yo, mwen eskize si yo manke apre ou fin tcheke, mwen tanporèman gen kèk pwoblèm rezo.
 Èske bilding lan bezwen amelyorasyon?
 Mwen konnen nou ap pale de gad piblik, e nan kou petèt sa ta ka yon kote, men yo ap adjasan a yon gwo pak endistriyèl.
 Kidonk, sa k ap pase nan domèn sa a pou ede amelyore...?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4459.498s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Anjeneral pale?
 Sa a se yon trè bon kesyon.
 Nou pa manyen li.
 Gen definitivman lide amelyore espas sa a.
 Petèt kraze pwosesis panse a pou ou.
 Nou ap gade de kalite prensipal zòn yo.
 Steve, ou ka jwenn sa retire
 Jis plan an mèt nan sit la kòm yon pwen referans.
 Premye a se jis nan Fellsway epi jan ou ka wè ofri opòtinite pou tou senpleman reyaji koupe twotwa yo pou benefis nan tout pwopriyete a.
 Modifye pwen aksè nan bilding sa a ak chaj nan bilding sa a ak fason kamyon yo antre ak soti la.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se evidamman espesifik nan kesyon ou a.
 Sa a ta dwe yon modifikasyon nan kondisyon ki egziste deja.
 Dezyèmman, mwen panse.
 Ki sa nou vle konprann se sijè ki abòde lan, e sa a se yon ti kras nan yon detire, Steve, men yon fwa ke bilding lan la, yon fwa ke depo ki deja egziste a demoli, pral evidamman gen yon miray ki ekspoze lontan kite pou bilding nan pwòp tèt ou-depo ki egziste deja.
 Nou planifye pou fini miray sa a yon jan kanmenm.
 Kounye a li se yon miray CMU nan bilding lan.
 Pral gen plan pou antre epi amelyore kondisyon eksteryè miray sa a.
 Li evidan nou pral asire w ke demolisyon an fèt san danje, men estetik li se jis yon kesyon de fini miray sa a ak sekirite tout koneksyon yo nan do kay la.
 Tout sa ki gen rapò ak enpèmeyab nan bilding sa a te fèt kòrèkteman.
 Donk non sèlman demolisyon bilding ki egziste a, men tou travay nou planifye pou fè yo pral gen kèk amelyorasyon ki pral pèmèt nou sòt de rezoud pwoblèm antre prensipal la nan bilding nan.
 Mwen pa vle
 Konvèsasyon sa a pou pwopriyete rezidansyèl la te ale nan ray yo, men n ap pwodwi kèk desen ke nou pral diskite endividyèlman ak vil la pou ede konprann chemen an pou avanse pou bilding nan kòm kèk nan travay sou li a vin abòdab.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Mwen repete, mwen pa gen okenn lide ki jan bilding sa a fonksyone.
 Se konsa, mwen admèt ke mwen te nayif oswa inyoran sou fason biznis sa a fonksyone.
 Men, mwen jis panse sou pwòp eksperyans mwen ak kote mwen te grandi.
 Mwen sonje nan bilding endistriyèl yo, travayè yo t ap soti epi yo te gen espas pou rasanble deyò epi, ou konnen, yo te gen poz lafimen ak repa manje midi ak bagay konsa.
 Èske sa a ki kalite kote ki bezwen bagay sa yo?
 Si sa rive, ki kote sa pral rive?
 Èske sa vle di kominike avèk vwazen?
 Paske li pa fèmen ankò.
 Sa a se komèsyal.
 Sa a se yon katye.
 sètènman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Non, sa a se yon kesyon itil.
 Se konsa, itilizasyon aktyèl bilding lan se kòm yon etablisman pwòp tèt ou depo, ki vle di depans antretyen trè ba pou nou ak travayè sou plas.
 Sa a se pa travay pwodiksyon, jis jesyon jeneral ak sipèvizyon
 Konpleksite moun yo, konpleksite moun ki gen aksè nan kaj depo pèsonèl yo.
 Se konsa, entansite a trè ba an tèm de travayè sou sit, ak kondisyon yo pou nenpòt ki travay deyò.
 Nou pa kwè li nesesè pou bay yo yon zòn rasanbleman andedan bilding lan.
 Gen yon biwo ak yon chanm repo ak bagay konsa, yon biwo egzekitif.
 Se konsa, an jeneral, nou panse ke ak kalite itilizasyon bilding sa a jwenn ak kalite sipèvizyon ki fèt ak yon anplwaye redwi,
 Mwen pa t espere sa w te di a rive.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4732.384s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen pa gen okenn lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4734.786s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tout se byen.
 Mèsi.
 Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?
 Pa wè okenn, mwen panse òganizasyonèlman sa ki fè plis sans se ke nou pral vote pou fè kòmantè piblikman sou pwosesis sivil la.
 Lè sa a, apre kòmantè piblik sou pwoblèm sivil yo, nou pral pase nan yon faz tès revizyon parèy trafik.
 Apre sa, Prezidan an ap tann yon mosyon pou kòmantè piblik sou pwoblèm transpò.
 Entwodiksyon nan jeni sivil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4776.651s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Trè emosyonèl.</p>

 Oke tout moun, kounye a nou pral aksepte kòmantè piblik la sou aktyalizasyon jeni sivil nou te resevwa jodi a.
 Oh wi.
 Cliff, tanpri ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4813.254s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Hey mesye.
 Non mwen se Cliff Bomer.
 Mwen se yon revizyon achitekti e mwen di ou mèsi anpil pou diskou ou a.
 Mwen gen kèk kesyon ki ta ka leve.
 Mwen konnen nou youn gade lòt
 Sesyon travay, mwen panse ke li nan gwo e mwen ap chèche pou pi devan pou li.
 Mwen jis gen kèk pwoblèm sivil, petèt tounen sou sijè.
 Mwen panse ke an tèm de pakin machin elektrik, mwen aktyèlman pa sonje kote Medford te adopte kòd patisipasyon an, men kenbe nan tèt ou.
 Kòd k ap patisipe yo gen kondisyon trè espesifik pou espas pakin pou machin elektrik yo, epi yo varye anpil.
 Sa a se yon gwo kwasans konpare ak lòt kòd.
 Mwen panse ke kòd angajman an mande pou 20% nan espas pakin yo dwe rezo, mwen panse ke se mo a,
 Pou pakin machin elektrik.
 Se konsa, mwen pa vle prezante tèt mwen kòm yon otorite sou règleman espesifik yo, men tanpri revize yo paske sa a ta ka vin yon pwoblèm trè reyèl si vil la adopte li anvan yo kòmanse pwosesis la pèmi.
 Epitou, de plis, twa plis kòmantè.
 Premyèman, mwen apresye li
 Dyagram sik ak konpreyansyon sa mwen panse ki sou ajanda a pou pwochen sesyon travay la se te kèk nan tèm ki parèt an tèm de eklere fasad bilding yo.
 Mwen te wè li.
 Antre segondè yo se yon gwo opòtinite pou kreye plis enterè volumetrik sou fasad bilding lan.
 Se konsa, mwen te pran li kòm yon opòtinite.
 Mwen panse ke menm pwen Andre sou atizay piblik la se vre.
 Li gen yon fasad long ki bay pakin nan, koulè amaranth long, e mwen te panse se te yon gwo opòtinite pou yon espas mural ki ta ka vrèman anrichi sa mwen te panse se te yon bon lide pou plan aménagement sou bò bilding lan.
 Mwen panse ke gen yon gwo opòtinite la.
 De plis kòmantè rapid.
 Youn se,
 Mwen pa kwè okenn nan plan nou te wè aswè a te reflete lide nou te diskite sou koupe kwen nòdwès bilding lan.
 Nou te gade etid volumetrik, ki mwen panse yo trè efikas nan reseksyon kwen nòdwès la pou li mwens enpòtan.
 Se konsa, mwen pral kite li la.
 Mwen pa konnen si sa a se entansyonèl oswa jis yon pwoblèm kowòdinasyon ant jeni sivil ak konstriksyon.
 Dènye a se, mwen pa yon moun transpòtasyon, mwen ta ka an reta pou yon konferans, petèt menm de fwa, men mwen panse ke gen yon diskisyon sou admisyon.
 Piske zòn arive a se sou bò nò bilding lan, te gen kèk diskisyon sou fason pou kreye yon chemen ki ta separe bilding ki deja egziste a ak nouvo bilding lan, deplase premye 100 pye yo oswa konsa nan nò pou moun pa t ap vini soti nan Myrtle nan zòn arive yo epi apre sa soti nan antre pakin nan bò lès nan bilding lan.
 Mwen eskize mwen si mwen rate nenpòt lòt konvèsasyon sou pwoblèm sa a, epi mwen vle ensiste ke mwen pa yon moun transpò piblik, kidonk mwen pa konnen si nenpòt moun ki enkyete sou kantite machin ki ta ka itilize sa a kòm yon pòtay.
 Men, nan lòt men an, sa a se tout sa mwen te aprann nan yon pèspektiv sivil e mwen vrèman ap tann li.
 Yon seyans travay te fèt ankò e mwen te remèsye kandida yo pou volonte yo pou avanse pou pi devan ak achitekti bilding lan, ki ta dwe lye nan jaden flè ak plan sivil yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5106.377s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi, Cliff.
 Donk, piske kèk nan diskisyon k ap fèt nan gwoup travay la gen kèk pwen ki klarifye bagay yo yon ti kras plis, èske gen moun ki vle pale de sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Pat, si ou vle mwen kòmanse, mwen ta ale nan lòd ranvèse epi adrese plis nan pwoblèm sikilasyon yo ke Cliff jis soulve, aktyèlman nan antre seremoni an.
 Mwen pral pataje ekran mwen an ankò, jis yon lòt fwa ankò, pou mwen ka montre li epi asire nou tout sou menm paj la.
 Mwen panse ke kòmantè yo se sou detire wout sa a, si li vle sou yon bò, nan yon direksyon oswa nan yon lòt, oswa omwen nan direksyon antre a, mwen panse ke se konvèsasyon an.
 Nou te diskite sou li.
 Finalman nou te deside sa a ta dwe yon pati nan de-fason.
 Rezon an se ke si yon machin vin pran ou, pou egzanp
 Depoze yon moun oswa ranmase yon moun, sa a se plis nan yon sitiyasyon depoze.
 Yon moun pran sak fè makèt epi li kite yo nan papòt la, epi lè lapli tonbe, li kouri al devan pòt la ak
 Lè sa a, moun ki te depoze w la ka vire epi ale nenpòt kote dèyè bilding lan, jwenn plas pakin yo, epi antre nan nenpòt lòt pòt selon pakin ki disponib.
 Donk nou panse se yon opòtinite pou antre, kit se nan garaj la, epi si yo antre nan garaj la, pwobableman yo p ap soti.
 Men, si yo pake deyò, gen yon chans pou yon moun ka sote tounen sou Myrtle Street, promenade desann Fellsway, ak Lè sa a, tounen soti nan lòt antre an.
 Se konsa, nou panse ke se yon karakteristik enpòtan, sitou si li se yon vizitè kout tèm ak yon moun vin gade nan pwopriyete a, Lè sa a, sa yo kat fwa depoze, sipoze yo tout okipe, Lè sa a, moun sa a gen pou yo kite ak vini nan Fellsway antre epi gade.
 Yon lòt espas yon kote nan sit la, nou konsidere vwayaj sa yo pa nesesè soti nan wout adjasan a epi kenbe yo nan sit la.
 Se konsa, nou te fè sa, te gen yon diskisyon, epi ou pa pral sonje li mal, men kòm nou te iterasyon, enjenyè trafik yo te fè kèk analiz, ak apeprè 90 pousan nan moun yo te nan sijè ki abòde lan etid la.
 Mwen pral vin achte lòt tikè.
 Yo kwè anviwon 10 pousan moun ap vini pou antre a.
 Se vrèman premye fwa.
 Se poutèt sa, nou kwè li enpòtan pou kenbe lari de sans sa a baze sou volim trafik ki pi ba epi kreye opòtinite pou pa retounen nan Fells Way.
 Se sa nou panse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5271.853s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5274.586s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, wi, mwen ka entèvni byen vit epi mwen pral kontinye travay nan lòd ranvèse.
 Mwen t ap pran nòt.
 Se konsa, li nan kwen nòdwès falèz la nan bilding nan, dezole si gen nenpòt konfizyon isit la.
 Yo ye.
 Pwosesis konsepsyon an divize an de pati nan plizyè fason, kidonk nou konsantre espesyalman sou avyon an tè. Mwen panse ke se kòmantè a ou te fè. Nou renove pati rezidansyèl nan bilding nan pou ke bilding lan se nan nivo tè
 Anprint bilding lan se jan yo montre nan figi ki anwo a ki bilding lan kouche tounen.
 Mwen dwe di, chante sa a tounen.
 Sa a se yon chanfrein.
 Se konsa, sa a ki konsistan avèk Demo a nou te fè.
 Anvan sa, nan odyans anvan nou yo ki konsantre sou achitekti ak revizyon parèy anvan yo.
 Se konsa, nou pa t 'tounen ak detwi bilding nan.
 Se jis ke w ap gade nan plan an etaj.
 Se konsa, èspere ke nou ka klè konfizyon an.
 Mwen pral kontinye, atizay piblik nan UAE la.
 Trè, trè note, jan mwen mansyone anvan, mwen panse ke gen yon lòt kòmantè sou sa a.
 Sa a se yon bagay nou planifye pou diskite nan pwochen reyinyon revizyon parèy nou an.
 Sa a se yon bagay nou te konsidere nan revizyon parèy achitekti nou an e nou te kontan resevwa kote yo pwopoze a.
 Mwen mande si sa a se atis piblik.
 Oke, bilding sou yon chemen likidasyon, oswa yon bagay sou bilding yo tèt yo.
 Ou konnen, mwen panse ke nou definitivman ouvè a lide, nou vle fè li yon otèl akeyan ke vil la ka fyè de, ak atizay piblik ki asosye ak li se yon bagay nou ouvè a.
 Finalman, konsènan pakin, sa a se yon kòmantè itil.
 Mwen panse ke nou te resevwa anpil fidbak aswè a.
 Kòm mwen te mansyone, sèl bagay mwen te aprann se ke nou te fè plis devwa sou sa a.
 Mwen pa ka fè referans a direktiv regilasyon espesifik pou pakin machin elektrik, men ekip nou an ap kapab fè sa lè nou pwochen rankontre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5413.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ekselan.
 Mèsi.
 Wi, mèsi.
 Tout se byen.
 Zanmi, nou ouvè a kòmantè piblik.
 Kidonk, si w se yon manm odyans ki vle pale sou yon sijè jeni sivil, ou ka leve men w pou w rale, limen kamera w epi leve men w, ou ka ekri yon bagay konsa.
 Ou ka voye yon imèl tou pou Dennis D. McDougal nan Medford dash ma.gov.
 Mwen wè nou gen yon Allison D. Tanpri mete non li ak adrès li pou dosye ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5447.956s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Bonjou, Allison D'Agostino.
 Mwen reprezante D'Agostino Family Trust nan 1022-1024 Fellsway.
 Mèsi tout moun.
 An reyalite, mwen gen yon anpil nan kòmantè ak yon anpil nan nimewo ak kesyon tagged.
 Mwen eseye òganize otank posib.
 Pou kòmanse, si mwen te kapab evite tout bagay sa yo.
 Mwen konnen yon bagay oswa de sou estasyon otobis yo.
 Se konsa, mwen pral kòmanse la.
 Mwen konnen gen yon estasyon otobis.
 Li aktyèlman sou lòt bò a nan Fellsway.
 Se konsa, kounye a timoun yo fondamantalman dwe ale nan kote Myrtle Street se epi mache jiskaske yo travèse Fells Road.
 Se konsa, se yon chemen ki byen foule.
 An reyalite, anfas twotwa aktyèl la ki mennen ale nan depo sou Fells Way se kote timoun yo t ap tann.
 Gen yon lòt estasyon otobis nan fen Myrtle.
 Paske ankò, sa a se endistri, dwa?
 Se konsa, yo pa mennen okenn timoun isit la.
 Dapre sa mwen konprann, li nan kwen Myrtle ak Spring Street, si sa ede.
 Se konsa, nou te kondwi la.
 Kèk kòmantè.
 Premyèman, mèsi a Konsèy Administrasyon an ak, nan kou, Davis Corporation.
 Mwen aktyèlman te konnen Pat.
 Se te yon gwo sesyon e mwen cheri tan an.
 Se konsa, yon sèl bagay yo kòmanse ak nan kòmantè yo:
 Mwen panse se yon ti kras twonpe, ou konnen, mwen panse, espesyalman nan kòmansman pwojè a, nou te pale sou ki jan Myrtle Street ta sanble, ou konnen, nou te eseye devye trafik, epi mwen tande aswè a ke, ou konnen, adrès pwopriyete a ta pral nan Myrtle.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen kwè moun ta ap mache nan Myrtle nan pwen sa a ak aktyèlman ap itilize antre nan Fellsway jan sa nesesè, ki se yon ti jan detire.
 Men, ankò, sa a se jis yon kòmantè.
 Mwen swete mwen tande yon bagay diferan aswè a.
 Lòt pati a se mwen vrèman renmen tantativ pou elaji Myrtle Street.
 Mwen panse ke pi gwo bagay ki pa klè pou mwen se si nou pa deplase poto yo, nenpòt moun ki rete nan lari sa a pral remake sa, ou konnen, yo se
 Gwo, kèk.
 Mwen panse ke gen plis nan li pase sa ki ilistre nan ilistrasyon sa a, e se sa ki pi bon fason yo mete li.
 Kidonk, pandan mwen apresye ke, si kolòn yo pa deplase ansanm, lari a pa elaji ase.
 Li evidan, entèseksyon Fellsway ak Bernal pa ka elaji, jan nou te diskite sou sa a ak nan byen Walsh.
 Pa gen okenn solisyon reyèlman.
 Sepandan, yon lòt kòmantè se ke mwen vrèman renmen kantite espas pakin ke Davis Corporation ap pwopoze.
 Epitou, pak chen yo se de enkyetid prensipal mwen pou mwen, jis pou dosye a.
 Pa gen okenn espas pakin adisyonèl nan zòn nan.
 Trè ki gen anpil moun.
 Pandan yon ijans nèj, moun yo fè konpetisyon pou espas, menm jan yo te fè nan South West, kote mwen te viv tou.
 Se konsa, se pa tankou mwen te fè li ditou.
 Trè ki gen anpil moun.
 Genyen tou potansyèl pou 289 chen yo dwe prezante nan zòn nan.
 Pandan ke mwen apresye espas vèt, mwen panse li pi enpòtan pou mwen konsantre plis sou espas ki zanmitay chen pase lakou rekreyasyon oswa lòt kalite pak.
 Se konsa, mwen jis espere sa a vin komen.
 Mwen vrèman apresye ke yo eseye pake jan sa nesesè jan li nesesè.
 Pa gen okenn koule epi mwen bezwen kite garaj la chak jou.
 Sa yo se kòmantè mwen yo, kesyon mwen yo, pou yo pa pèdi twòp tan.
 Mwen panse ke pwoblèm mwen an se ke mwen pa konnen anpil sou Warren Street.
 Li pa parèt nan ilistrasyon sa yo.
 Sa a se yon wout trafik kwaze.
 Li se yon lari yon sèl nan Myrtle, dwa nan kafou Amarans yo.
 Mwen devine kesyon mwen an se: Èske gen yon lòt bagay ki konsidere?
 Kafou sa a trè danjere pou mwen.
 Li danjere kounye a.
 Donk, kesyon mwen te soulve ak Davis Corporation, e menm konsèy administrasyon an, se yon bagay ke nou toujou ap konsidere.
 Konsernan kestyon sekirite, mon dezyenm kestyon i zis pou klarifikasyon lo bann townhouses, i pa kler.
 Èske gen yon pasaj?
 Dirèkteman sou Myrtle oswa nan otèl la.
 Twazyèm kesyon mwen an se sou pakin pou tout bilding eksteryè deyò garaj la, men espesyalman zòn chaje dèyè a.
 Li sanble klè.
 Èske kamyon yo ka antre?
 Èske kamyon yo, kamyon transpò ak ranp yo oke?
 Èske ou ka mache desann ranp lan?
 Èske ou kapab telechaje san danje?
 Petèt mwen te viv nan kay sa a pou yon ti tan, men mwen te deplase chak ane apre kolèj.
 Lè sa a, mwen sonje ke yo te kapab deplase se te yon defi.
 Nan yon bilding ki gen yon pakin.
 Se konsa, kamyon sa yo pa ka antre nan garaj la.
 Vrè enkyetid mwen ak kesyon an se: èske ou te konsidere kantite espas nan yon kamyon k ap deplase ak yon ranp?
 Se konsa, sa se yon anpil.
 Mèsi anpil.
 Mèsi ankò paske w te pran tan an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5763.815s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Wi, gen kèk pwoblèm.
 Gen yon kesyon sou kamyon k ap deplase, sou Lawrence.
 Èske kandida yo vle pale sou sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5775.499s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi.
 Ou vle ale, Pat?
 Kamyon k ap deplase ak pakin.
 Kamyon k ap deplase a sitiye nan tout dèyè bilding lan.
 Gen plas pou kèk kamyon la.
 Nou pa atann pou gen anpil kamyon la paske jesyon pwopriyete aktyèlman ap.
 Nou pral jere aksyon, antre ak sòti.
 Nou panse ke gen ase espas pou jere kèk kondisyon pik k ap deplase.
 N ap mennen ankèt sou zafè sa a epi n ap kontinye travay ak ekip operasyon nou an pou nou konprann sitiyasyon an.
 Pou kay semi-detache, li bezwen klarifye ke tout aksè se andedan tè a.
 Pa gen okenn twotwa oswa aksè nan Myrtle Street.
 Aksè nan kote sa a se atravè antre entèn nan dèyè a.
 Se konsa, mwen devine si ou vle bay yon ajou sou Florence Street, mwen konnen li ap gade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5841.227s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, wi, absoliman wi.
 Sa a se yon kesyon alè, kidonk jeneralman repons lan se wi.
 Mwen panse ke nou ap travay sou sa kounye a epi mwen pa konnen si Jeff soti nan Beta pral fè kèk kòmantè nan fen odyans lan, men nou te resevwa anpil fidbak nan men Beta sou trafik la epi nou ap gade li.
 Kòm yon pati nan sa a, gen kèk
 Sigjere alèjman nou ta dwe konsidere ak kèk lòt bagay nou ta dwe gade nan.
 San rapò a devan m ', mwen pa konnen si Lawrence Street ta egziste, men an jeneral mwen panse ke trafik nan zòn sa a ak alèjman nan zòn sa a te konsidere an jeneral, pa sèlman jasmen oswa amaranth.
 Mwen te panse Lawrence ta ka la.
 Mwen ta dwe double tcheke, men repons lan kout nan kesyon ou a se wi.
 N ap kontinye travay avèk ekip nou an ak ekip revizyon parèy nou an pou devlope opsyon pou diminye trafik pou zòn nan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5904.591s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mèsi pou kòmantè w sou estasyon bis la.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5908.352s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Ou byen akeyi.

 Donk, mèsi anpil pou klarifikasyon ak kòmantè ou yo.

 Lòt kòmantè piblik sou travay jeni sivil.
 Wi, nou arete Christina.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5934.505s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5935.446s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mwen panse ke sa a se dezyèm fwa nan yon ranje ke mwen te fè byen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5941.353s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Christina te achte yon kay nan 30 Myrtle Street.
 Premyerman mon soulez serten kestyon avek sa board e apre sa bann kestyon lo sa ki’n ganny diskite avek sosyete sivil.
 Èske nou te enfòme rezidan yo nan Amaranth Apartments sou reyinyon sa yo?
 Paske nan tout nan yo mwen te ale nan, pa gen okenn kòmantè piblik nan direksyon sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen vle asire w ke si yo nan bwat la Demo, yo ap resevwa imèl, bwochi, elatriye pou vwa yo ka tande.
 Lè sa a, dezyèm lan se
 Jodi a, ak nan reyinyon anvan yo, nou te tande anpil nan men Pat sou konpayi an jesyon ki pral jere pwopriyete a.
 Yon anpil nan kesyon yo te dirije nan direksyon: Ebyen, konpayi jesyon an ap okipe sa a, konpayi jesyon an ap okipe sa a, konpayi jesyon an ap okipe sa a.
 Mwen espere ke konsèy la konsidere pou yo patisipe nan youn nan reyinyon yo.
 Se konsa, apre Davis te bati bilding lan,
 Rezidan yo santi yo rasire pa moun ki posede ak jere eksperyans chak jou a, ki jan yo planifye pou jere bagay tankou kamyon k ap deplase, ki jan yo pral fè fas ak nenpòt grafiti potansyèl ki parèt sou travay atistik oswa lakou rekreyasyon, ak fason yo pral netwaye li.
 Se konsa, mwen jis ale nan ranvwaye sa a kòm yon sijesyon.
 Se konsa, mwen fè kòmantè sou sa nou analize pi wo a.
 Konsènan pakin, mwen tande gen kounye a 330 pye pakin sou Myrtle Street.
 Donk ou konprann, lè ou pale ak nou e di nou, ann di, ou ogmante li a 370, ou pa ogmante parking nan Myrtle Street.
 Ant Amaranth Street ak Myrtle Street,
 Ou gen plis espas pakin.
 Men, pa gen plis espas pakin sou Myrtle Street.
 Kòm yon rezidan nan Myrtle Street mwen trè enkyete w sou ki lè raboure pral fèt ak ki lè pral gen yon ijans nèj paske kounye a mwen dwe pake nan Amaranth.
 Mwen viv pou kont mwen.
 Mwen pa renmen lide vin lakay byen ta nan mitan lannwit epi wè rezidan yo pran sou yon pakin Myrtle pandan mwen oblije pake nan kwen an.
 Manje amaranth epi mache lakay ou.
 Mwen panse ke li pral, paske tout konpayi sa yo ak tout kondo liks sa yo ap chaje rezidan yo pak, yo pral reyalize Amaranth ak Myrtle yo gratis epi yo pral pran plas nou an.
 Kidonk, mwen jis vle ou konnen ke plan amelyorasyon $130,000 a $170,000 ou pwopoze pou Myrtle Street se vreman twonpe, epi ou reyalize sa.
 Finalman, mwen reyèlman panse ke nou kòmanse rive nan yon kote kote vwa rezidan nou yo tande.
 Se konsa, mwen te trè desi lè mwen te aprann ke nou pa t 'ap devye trafik nan Myrtle Street, ki Allison jis mansyone.
 Cliff te mansyone tou ke nan yon reyinyon anvan nou te di ke rezidan yo pa ta kapab
 Antre nan garaj la soti nan Myrtle Street.
 Se yon ti wonn ki gen yon bout depas antre epi soti.
 Se konsa, mwen jis te vle eksprime desepsyon mwen paske mwen santi ke bagay ke mwen tande yo te retire nan men m 'nan apèl sa a an patikilye.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6166.32s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi.
 Wi, se konsa sou sijè sa a
 Mwen panse ke aksè se yon bagay nou pral adrese nan aktyalizasyon revizyon kanmarad la.
 Donk mwen pa konnen si kandida yo dispoze pale de sa.
 Mwen konnen ou deja mansyone poukisa.
 Se konsa, nou pral jwenn fidbak nan beta a tou.
 Se konsa, mwen regrèt.
 Fart nan sèvo.
 Lè sa a, ah, li nèj.
 Wi, nou poko diskite sou nèj.
 Se konsa, bagay tankou retire nèj.
 Mwen konnen gen pakin ki kouvri pou rezidan yo.
 Men, mwen panse ke li ta itil pou komite a konnen kounye a oswa nan yon odyans alavni ki plan yo genyen pou evènman nèj.
 Apre sa, li tire tou.
 Padon Christina, ki sa ki te twazyèm lan mwen rate?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6235.053s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Si w ap pale de pakin, li te nèj, kidonk mwen devine, tankou tout kondo liks sa yo, yo chaje pou pakin.
 Mwen sèten espas ki kouvri yo pral pi gwo ak anpil la pi piti.
 Men, evantyèlman, rezidan yo pral dekouvri ke amaranth ak jasmen yo gratis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6255.102s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi, sa kòrèk.
 Se konsa, pa sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen ranmase sou sa epi li te resevwa li.
 Se biznis ak jesyon.
 Oh wi.
 Pandan 40B ki sot pase a, nou te jwenn kèk detay sou operasyon ak plan jesyon bilding lan.
 Mwen konprann ke Davis gen entansyon dirije biznis sa a.
 Èske sa kòrèk?
 Oswa èske mwen konprann li mal?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6281.057s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Se poutèt sa, Davis Companies gen fonksyon jesyon pwopriyete ki pa pwolonje nan pwopriyete rezidansyèl yo.
 Mwen konprann.
 Se konsa, kòm yon pati nan sa, Christina, se jis yon mwatye etap tounen,
 Nan bay kèk repons, entansyon an se pa bay repons dirèk.
 Mwen ap eseye bay pi bon repons mwen kapab nan moman sa a.
 Mwen panse ke kèk nan travay mwen te kapab fè sou pwojè a nan etap sa a, nan nivo sa a nan konsepsyon, se konsiltasyon entèn ak ekip jesyon pwopriyete nou an ak ekip jesyon byen nou an, ki vrèman konsantre sou rezidansyèl,
 Genyen tou konvèsasyon ak gwoup jesyon pwopriyete ke nou travay avèk yo kouri kèk nan pwopriyete yo rezidansyèl yo.
 Nou poko siyen okenn kontra ak yon administratè pwopriyete pou pwojè sa a, kidonk mwen pa gen yon ekip espesifik ke mwen ka envite epi mande pou mwen patisipe nan moman sa a.
 Mr Chairman si i annan
 Mwen ta gade referans nan pwojè 4DB anvan ou yo pou wè sa ki te ofri, epi si nou ka bay nenpòt bagay ki sanble, nou pral sètènman fè sa pou reponn anpil kesyon ki konsantre sou operasyon ke posib ak onètman ak enfòmasyon ke posib.
 Gen kèk kesyon ke mwen gen yon tan difisil bay repons espesifik.
 Pou egzanp, ak retire nèj, mwen panse ke li pral sou yon baz ka-pa-ka ki baze sou kantite nèj la.
 Gen zòn vèt nan tout sit la kote yo ka retire nèj ak pozisyone si ta gen yon tanpèt.
 Lè sa a, si gen yon tanpèt ak anpil nèj,
 Lè ou pale ak konpayi jesyon pwopriyete w la, yo pral kowòdone retire nèj sou pwopriyete a.
 Alor mon pa kapab dir spesifikman ki sa threshold oubyen konbyen fwa i arive.
 Sa a pral yon analiz ka pa ka.
 Se konsa, mwen vle rezime,
 Si mwen ka gade dosye yo epi jwenn sa ansyen aplikan 40B yo te bay, nou ka fè kèk devwa epi eseye bay enfòmasyon sou fason bilding nan te opere pou jwenn plis enfòmasyon.
 mwen pa vle
 Pa kite moun panse nou pa transparan sou sa.
 Nou swete ke sa a reponn omwen yon pati nan kesyon an.
 Mwen regrèt si ou panse mansyone gwoup jesyon pwopriyete se yon aza sou pati nou an.
 Sa a se sètènman pa entansyon an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6463.915s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi, wi, si ou ta ka gade sa nou te resevwa nan aplikasyon anvan yo epi wè ki detay ou ka bay. Mwen konprann se yon sitiyasyon diferan paske nan ka sa a, se yon sitiyasyon.
 Pleyan an te gen entansyon opere bilding lan pou kont li.
 Men wi, detay sa yo pral ede tou de konsèy la ak rezidan yo.
 Wi, li ta definitivman ede si kèk nan bagay ou konnen kounye a gen yon nivo menm jan an detay.
 Nou ka definitivman fè sa.
 OK, mèsi.

 Mwen vle di, machin elektrik ak dife gen enkyetid menm jan ak bisiklèt elektrik.
 Jiskaprezan, jan ou te di, nan anpil vil, e mwen konnen sa a pa inik nan Medford oswa pwopriyete sa a nou ap pale sou yo, men ou konnen, yon dife komen,
 Depatman ponpye ak kamyon yo pa pral mete dife nan machin elektrik.
 Yo souvan oblije ale nan Massport pou jwenn li.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle pote sa a moute, nou ap tou diskite sou konbyen pwen pouvwa nou bezwen.
 Mwen devine lòt pwoblèm mwen te vle pote, ki te pote pa Christina ak Alison, se te enkyetid sou pakin ak ke yo te kapab soti nan garaj la.
 Mwen konnen sa a te mansyone, men mwen jis vle mete l 'nan dosye a ankò ke si trafik sou Myrtle Street ogmante, Myrtle Street se adrès la.
 Menmsi ou gen yon zòn livrezon ak ranmasaj sou Myrtle Street, konbyen chofè Uber Eats ki genyen lè ou gen anpil rezidan?
 Ou pral gen plizyè moun nan yon fwa, pa sèlman youn oswa de.
 Se jis, ou ka wè apatman mwen te ale nan lòt zanmi yo.
 Mwen vle di, se sa k ap pase nan inite sa yo.
 Mwen pa vle Myrtle Street (piske li se zòn pick-up ak depoze) vin tounen yon pakin pandan moun ap tann pou yo antre nan espas la.
 Se konsa, kounye a w ap bloke trafik sou wout la.

 那么，晚安。
 回到那个和婴儿组。
 开展交通影响评估研究。
 为了开始这个过程，我们进行了实地考察，观察交通状况，审查了 Van Essen Associates 影响研究、Polar Engineering 项目计划，并审查了所有交通方式，不仅包括交通，还包括行人、自行车和公共交通。
 我们与土建工程也有一些重叠，因此您可以在场地规划、内部循环、装载和交付以及运输需求管理计划中看到一些内容。
 总体而言，交通研究是按照我们现有的国家和行业专业标准进行的，是一份综合报告。
 因此，我将总结我们的评论。
 有些评论要求提供更多信息，要求澄清。
 我们更多地谈论外部缺陷以及可能的改进。
 感谢您的介绍。
 亲爱的玩家，我认为我们提出的一些意见在今天的演示中得到了回答。
 所以我谢谢你。
 也许这有点多余。
 我们讨论了一些主题，所以这或多或少是按照流量影响研究的顺序进行的。
 因此，在研究区域内，对整个区域的交叉口进行了综合评估。
 这有点难以阅读。
 我想说的是，第一个正在考虑纳入的十字路口是您注意到的唯一一个未包括在内的十字路口，即第四街。
 嗯，这里看起来围栏很围，所以标有人行横道。
 所以那将是唯一的地方。
 我想你可以考虑看看。
 因此，在现有条件下，采集1月11日的流量。
 小马丁·路德·金
 假期是15号。
 我只是想得到一些答案，以及周一假期是否会对周四的计数产生任何预期影响。
 然后收集并汇总流量。
 我们想了解更多有关该网站现有使用所产生的行程的信息。
 所以，这里只是有关该地区行人现有状况的一些信息。
 我们自己根据刚刚写下的观察结果做了一个清单。
 中环街和春街交叉口没有行人信号灯，该路口是正在研究的交叉路口。
 该地区的几个十字路口没有可检测的人行横道和警告牌，而这些必须符合 ADA 标准，其中包括 Myrtle、Amaranth 和 Lawrence 街道的十字路口。
 这些只是一些观察和笔记。
 安全方面，该地区有多个路口曾发生过安全事故。
 正如我刚才提到的，Central 和 Spring 有 13 次失败。
 最重要的是，事故发生率超过了马萨诸塞州交通部第 4 区的平均水平和州平均水平，达到了令人担忧的程度。
 Fellsway 和 Riverside 五年内发生了 31 起事故。
 MassDOT 将其认定为高事故群体，使其有资格接受 2019 年进行的高速公路安全审计，并被认定为存在安全问题。
 Fellsway Central 和 Medford Street 五年内发生了 23 起事故。
 我们只是想更多地了解该地区发生的行人和自行车事故类型。
 停车，我们询问在现有条件下，是否有关于今天该地点街道和停车场占用情况的信息，您知道，这些空间在相邻街道和该地点本身占用的百分比，了解这些信息会很有用。
 未来的情况，所以我先讲一下出行生成和出行分配归因。
 因此，预计该项目将在工作日上午和下午高峰时段产生约 90 趟车次。
 我们认为这是一个合理的数字。
 我们希望获得更多关于卡车出行次数的信息，包括这个数字。
 行人、自行车和公共交通出行。
 因此，如果能够对它们进行分解和识别，将会很有帮助。
 计算中使用了未来 5% 的自行车比例。
 我们认为它可能有点高。
 我认为全市 Medford 模式的总体比例为 1%。
 所以我想知道如果计算时假设从自行车模式分裂到较低模式，这会对车辆的出行产生多大影响？
 Fells Way 上的许多行程都会在中央大街掉头返回该地点。
 我想知道是否有其他交通可以使用的替代路线，因为认识到此行进中存在一些延误和拥堵，尤其是在下午，例如河滨大道，左转进入河滨，甚至使用 I-93 作为替代路线。
 其中一些交通是否会使用 I-93 而不是 Fells Way？
 嗯，报告中有一个表格确定了该项目的流量增加情况，但事实并非如此。
 识别现场附近的道路，例如 Fellsway、Myrtle、Pinker、Lawrence 和 Spring。
 因此，我想量化有关该地点附近道路交通量增加的信息。
 一个已经被谈论了一点的停车项目，停车比例为1.14。
 我们只是想确保这个数字是正确且足够的，可以满足该地点的预期停车需求。
 你知道，请记住，我们希望确保我们做的每件事都是正确的。
 因此，如果有足够的停车位，就不会溢出到邻近的社区和道路。
 我们看到前面有 4 个访客空间，即送货区。
 我们认为它可能有点低。
 嗯，我们还想更多地了解游客空间本身。
 不仅是短期送货，而且如果人们拜访该综合体的居民，他们会在哪里停车，如果他们这样做几个小时？
 如果他们停车很长时间或停车过夜。
 所以一些关于这是如何运作的讨论。
 访客空间将由网站运营和管理。
 关于拟议的停车位，新的Amaranth停车位，只是这些停车位的意图，我知道它们是向公众开放的，但它们应该供现场访客使用吗？
 这些空间的用途是什么？
 进行了交叉口通行能力分析。
 交通工程师使用所谓的交叉口服务级别。
 它类似于成绩单，其中 A，表示条件极佳，几乎没有延误或拥堵。
 E和F不足。
 F 是最差的，或者因巨大的延迟、拥塞和排队而失败。
 所以，你知道，我们在那里看到了 Fellsway 上的拥堵情况，大部分是早上向南行，下午向北行。
 Fellsway、Central 以及 Fellsway 和 Riverside 交叉口目前以 F 服务级别运行，这意味着它们有一个或多个交通通常无法达到 F 服务级别。
 而项目未来的非施工条件和施工条件又使这些条件更加恶化。
 该项目将导致中环 Fellsway 的交通显着增加，而中央大道东行通道的延误将会增加。
 其中一些问题已经得到解决。
 就在今天晚上，我看到了这里右上角的空间。
 我想我们在仓库的 A 区。
 感谢您提供这个。
 此外，还可以进入建筑物和会场周围的空间，今晚也展示了这一点，所以这很棒。
 这里显示了与未来自行车道的联系。
 我想这一切都已经解决了。
 只是对街道空间、默特尔街和阿默斯特的新空间进行澄清。
 我知道它们向公众开放，但谁对这些空间拥有管辖权？
 它们真的是城市还是属于私人管辖？
 因此，对这些空间进行更多澄清。
 就其本身而言，我们谈论的是场地规划中更广阔的空间，即流通道路的宽度。
 抱歉，必须提供路边停车位。
 讨论居民和游客的自行车停放只是为了明确车位数量。
 现场必须标明储雪区域。
 我知道有人在谈论默特尔街，但我还需要知道那里的雪将储存在哪里。
 这就是制定运输需求管理计划的原因。
 这些计划的目标是减少汽车出行次数，尤其是单人车辆。
 我们还确定了该计划需要考虑的其他一些领域或措施。
 您可能早些时候已经谈到过这一点。
 停车费与停车费是分开的吗？
 今晚我没有听到，但也许会有更多的讨论。
 我知道对于网站来说最好的选择是需要权衡的。
 您可以考虑向居民提供交通补贴或蓝色自行车订阅，作为一项 TDM 措施。
 你展示了蓝色的自行车站，所以照顾好它真是太好了。
 并且您应该考虑现场是否有汽车共享空间，例如汽车共享拉链车。
 那么项目提出的外部改进，我们稍微谈了一下公交候车区。
 MBTA 巴士站附近的现有停车位将进行重新配置和景观美化，如今晚向我们展示的那样，以及新的停车位、扩大 Amaranth 街和 Myrtle 街的通行权，或者更好的是街道和人行道停车位。
 因此，我们确定了一些其他的措施，只是为了考虑和改进。
 这些大多是外部地点。
 其中许多位于我提到的十字路口，存在操作或安全缺陷。
 第一个是Fellsway Riverside Avenue。
 因此，我提到，已识别出在服务级别 F 上运行的高崩溃集群的交叉点。此次交通安全审计确定了对策和安全对策的改进，包括交通信号优化、增强左转阶段和通行时间。
 所以这些事情是可以考虑的。
 Avenida Central 和 Rua Primavera 的事故发生率很高。
 可以考虑升级旧的信号设备并安装现有的行人标志。
 Fellsway、Central 和 Medford Street 在两个高峰时段再次在 F 级服务条件下运行，可以看到并提供信号定时优化。
 北行左转车道多次被堵塞，特别是在晚高峰期间，因此车辆在车道畅通之前无法进入该车道。
 是否有可能拓宽 Fells Way 北行左转车道？
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle Street 相连，因此 Fellsway 有一条长长的人行横道。
 我们知道，交通流量大，车速高，可以考虑使用矩形快闪灯，这是对行人的安全措施，也能提高驾驶员的安全意识。
 我们只是想评估提供中间间隔是否可行，无论是在红绿灯处还是向北左转处。
 我知道这样做有利有弊，但这样做是否有足够的好处来考虑这种改变？</p>

 Layout lari a yon sèl konfonn chofè ak pyeton.
 Mwen konnen pwojè a pwopoze kèk agrandisman ak pasaj pou pyeton.
 Mwen panse ke kwazman sa a merite plis atansyon.
 Mwen konnen yo te mansyone Lawrence tou.
 Lòt ekstansyon twotwa yo ka lokalize nan kwen sidwès oswa menm ogmante entèseksyon an.
 Mwen panse ke li se yon pòtay enpòtan adjasan a pwojè a ak nan kominote a.
 Men yon opòtinite pou kalme trafik
 Diminye vitès machin yo epi amelyore sikilasyon pyeton yo ak sekirite nan zòn nan.
 Kèk plis kòmantè.
 Estasyon otobis ki egziste sou Fells Way nan direksyon sid se adjasan ak sit la epi li an bon kondisyon.
 Se te vre yon abri brit.
 Mwen panse modènizasyon estasyon bis sa a ta dwe konsidere.
 Oke, yon plan signalisation wayfinding bezwen devlope.
 Pwogrè sou pwojè a pral montre klèman kote rezidan yo, vizitè yo ak anplwaye livrezon yo pral antre epi retounen sou sit la.
 Twotwa yo nan Amherst nan sid Myrtle Street yo nan move kondisyon.
 Se poutèt sa, repavaj lari sa a ta dwe konsidere kòm yon pati nan pwojè a.
 Anfèt, li nesesè pou devlope yon plan jesyon trafik pou konstriksyon pou montre enpak sou kominote a.
 Yon dènye kòmantè se ke depi nati pwojè a ap chanje, yon pèmi konstriksyon oblije antre nan DCR a.
 Yon pèmi DCR oblije antre ak sòti nan Fellsway.
 Men yon rezime revizyon nou an.

 Nou tande kèk kòmantè aswè a konsènan pwoblèm adrès Myrtle Avenue.
 Oke, mwen t ap mande si ou te gen nenpòt sijesyon espesifik, epi mwen konnen ou t ap pale de konsèy, tankou ki kalite siyal ta ka nan antre Fellsway la, ou konnen,
 Asire w ke sa a se opinyon prensipal la nan pwojè a.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8116.863s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Wi.
 Se poutèt sa, nou pral konsidere devlope yon plan siyal pou gide rezidan yo ak vizitè yo ansanm ak livrezon pou ale ak soti nan sit la.
 Natirèlman, rezidan yo pral konnen ki jan yo antre ak soti yon fwa yo rive la.
 Ou konnen, nou pral dirije vizitè yo nan anpil kote nan pak la, kidonk li ta ka yon konbinezon de diferan kalite siy, li ta ka siy moniman, li ta ka lòt siy, men li pral montre, ou konnen, prensipalman chemen.
 Endike kote pakin yo ak kote yo baze sou kondisyon espesifik.
 Ki moun ou ye epi ale kote nou vle gide vwayaj ekstèn sa yo.
 Mwen panse ke Fells Road pral antre prensipal la men mwen panse adrès sa a se yon bon pwen.
 Si yon moun antre yon adrès nan Waze epi li pa abitye ak sit la, li pral dirije yo nan Myrtle Street, ki ka pa kote nou vle yo ale.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8194.189s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Mwen wè kòmantè Chris nan chat la kounye a se konsa mwen pral poste li.
 Èske nenpòt moun konnen ki pousantaj nan trafik entrant oswa sortan pral sèvi ak bò Amaranth nan garaj la?
 Mwen dakò ak konsiltan an ke fusion lari se yon pwoblèm.
 So mon krwar mon vwar serten poursantaz dan plan management demand transportation.
 Mwen konnen nou gen Scott.
 Mwen pa konnen si yo reflete dènye mizajou yo, li se yon pati diferan nan otèl la men li gen trafik de direksyon.
 Men wi, petèt ou ka pale sou sa, Scott.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8236.272s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi nan kou.
 Mèsi Mesye Prezidan.
 Scott Thornton ak Vanessa Associates.
 Se konsa, nou estime ke apeprè 30, 30 a 40 pousan nan trafik la pral sèvi ak aksè nan Amaranth Avenue, ak lide ki dèyè sa a se jis baze sou pwoksimite espas pakin yo ak kote sa a.
 Anplis de sa, ka gen kèk trafik ki ta renmen
 Pa egzanp, nan direksyon lwès ou ka jwenn aksè nan sit ki mennen ale nan Route 93.
 Gen kèk nan zòn sa yo ki ofri aksè nan zòn, ki ka pi pratik selon lè nan jounen an
 Li fasil epi byen vit aksesib atravè Amaranth, Lè sa a, tounen nan Spring Street atravè Myrtle Street oswa Lawrence Street.
 Sepandan, premye estimasyon yo te ant 30 ak 40 pousan.
 Mwen panse ke sa toujou aplike nan dènye plan ki prezante isit la aswè a.
 Nou pa atann chanjman enpòtan nan distribisyon sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8322.547s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: OK

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8333.162s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Èske mwen ka kontinye sa Chris te di?
 Se konsa, ou konnen, jis gade nan trafik la nan lari yo, mwen vle di, mwen konprann ke yon sèten pousantaj nan trafik ka kite Amarance epi ale nan lwès, men apwoche kote sa a soti nan lwès la sanble prèske enposib.
 Li sanble prèske tout trafik ap oblije kite Fellsway.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8361.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, nou fè, ou konnen, distribisyon an vrèman baze sou kote nou panse moun yo ye, oswa kote done resansman yo montre moun ap travay ak k ap viv nan zòn nan.
 Sa a se kote nou distribye pa konbine modèl vwayaj ki deja egziste.
 Mwen dakò pafwa
 Si moun ap vini soti nan lwès oswa nan sid li ta pi efikas yo sèvi ak Fellsway la.
 Men, sa a se pa vre nan tout moman nan jounen an.
 Sa a se pwoblèm distribisyon sa a vize rezoud.
 Padon, li matche ak modèl atribisyon nou ta atann, ki se atribisyon nan trafik pou tout peryòd tan ki enplike.</p>

 Mwen vle di,
 Apwoche pwojè a konsa ankò.
 Mwen vle di, li sanble tankou sèl fason pou ale nan antre nan Amaranth se mache desann Lawrence, pase Amaranth Place ak pwojè a kondo, ak Lè sa a, nan pwojè a Amaranth, ki pou nenpòt moun ki pa tèlman abitye sanble trè sitouris ak prèske enposib.</p>

 Èske konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8485.526s">[Unidentified]</a>: Jaime.
 Kòm pou travay entèseksyon an, mwen devine kesyon mwen an soti nan rekòmandasyon yo te fè nan beta a amelyore limyè trafik ak pasaj pou pyeton yo.
 Tankou, ki kote sa a prale?
 Èske sa se yon bagay pou ale nan vil?
 Èske sa a yon bagay nou travay ak kandida sou dimansyon?
 Mwen konplètman dakò ke tout entèseksyon sa yo bezwen amelyorasyon.
 Mwen jis pa konnen ki jan nou atribiye li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8526.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Dapre sa mwen konprann, sa depann de yon ti jan sou entèseksyon an.
 Se konsa, mwen panse,
 Aplikan yo ka endike entansyon yo pou aplike kèk oswa tout amelyorasyon sa yo nan repons yo.
 Nan kèk ka, se sèlman pèmisyon vil la obligatwa.
 Nan lòt ka, li ta ka soti nan eta a, ki se yon ti kras pi konplike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8553.604s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi, mwen travay nan Spring Street Center Crossing e sa a se yon pwoblèm kontinyèl.
 Espesyalman lè n ap pale de pyeton, Haynes Plaza gen yon estasyon bisiklèt ble pou moun ka itilize li.
 Si gen yon estasyon bisiklèt ble sou sit, ou ka evidamman desann la.
 Men, si gen pyeton k ap mache, si gen plis trafik pyeton, entèseksyon sa a se definitivman konsène.
 Yo rele li, ou konnen, mank de pasaj pou pyeton ak bagay konsa.
 Wi, sa a se definitivman yon bagay mwen pa t 'atann, men etid sa a klèman revele li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8595.186s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Mèsi, Jaime.
 Jeff, ou gen yon lide sou sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Oke, wi, sa depann de ki jan vil la vle priyorite wout yo nan jiridiksyon sa yo.
 Se konsa, li se yon ti kras diferan.
 Entèseksyon ki konplètman kontwole pa vil la pral pi fasil pou rezoud.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, Santral ak Spring, men, ou konnen.
 ak operasyon ak reta konjesyon, ki afekte sekirite tou.
 Men, mwen panse ke li ta dwe jiska vil la fikse priyorite li yo ki baze sou amelyorasyon yo santi yo rezonab ak ki gen rapò ak pwojè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8662.117s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mwen se pwochen.
 Se konsa, mwen vrèman mande si trafik sa a de sans, um, ta gen sans nan antre Myrtle Street la.
 Se konsa, mwen tande enkyetid rezidan yo.
 Konfigirasyon aktyèl la lakòz anpil vwayaj siplemantè, alòske li te deja konprann ke nou t ap pran anpil prekosyon pou evite sa.
 Mwen konprann sa a bezwen louvri pou itilize chape dife.
 Men, enfòmasyon yo te bay la pa t ban m yon ide klè sou ki kantite pwoblèm sa a ta lakòz kominote a.
 Se konsa, wi, gen livrezon.
 Si li fèmen nan yon fason, ou ka bezwen pran kouran an yon sèl-fason tounen nan Myrtle.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke rasyonalize sa, mwen sètènman konprann konsiderasyon yo konsepsyon, men li sanble ke gen yon risk isit la ke pou trafik de-direksyon, se tankou louvri baryè yo, li se yon etap bak.
 Eseye fasilite konjesyon trafik nan yon pèspektiv Myrtle Street.
 Mwen ta renmen tande panse ou sou sa, Jeff.
 Mwen pa konnen si w gen tan pou w revize li nèt epi pare pou w pataje panse w ak kòmantè w sou li, oswa si w bezwen reflechi plis sou li men ou vle konnen plis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8778.533s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Ou pa bezwen panse ditou si, ou konnen, si objektif la se limite kantite vwayaj nan Myrtle Street, ou konnen, si ou fè yon sèl-fason oswa, ou konnen, si ou fè yon sèl-fason oswa.
 Se konsa, ou dwe reflechi sou ki jan vwayaj sa yo pral koule nan kote a ak ki kote yo pral ale, ou konnen, si yo pral fini nan Myrtle oswa, ou konnen, si yo pral Fellsway.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke sa a se yon gwo kesyon.
 Nou pwobableman bezwen fè plis evalyasyon, ou konnen, konbine Scott ak Varness epi reflechi sou sa a ak sa,
 Ou konnen, ki enpak la ta ka si li te yon sèl-fason olye pou yo de-fason.
 Ankò, sa a se yon bon sijè.
 Mon krwar nou bezwen diskit e evalye sa plis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8834.447s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa kòmantè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8841.325s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Wi.
 Jeff, mwen dezole si mwen pa sonje sa ki te rive ou, men.
 Ou konnen, la.
 Pasaj pou pyeton an nan Fellsway ak Myrtle, mwen vle di, pa gen okenn limyè trafik oswa nenpòt kalite aparèy sekirite pyeton ki pa pasaj pou pyeton an ak yon ti medyàn.
 Ou konnen, li sètènman sanble konsa.
 Wi, n ap gen plis rezidan k ap viv nan kwen sa a.
 Oke, sa ki pi enpòtan se ke gen yon bagay sou entèseksyon sa a.
 Ralanti pyeton yo oswa omwen mete yon siyal pou pyeton yo.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, ou te panse sou li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Wi, nan youn nan glisad mwen yo mwen te pale sou konsidere yon limyè devan rektangilè rapid flash.
 Sa a se yon siyal bouton pouse pou pyeton yo.
 Donk wi, mwen panse ke entèseksyon an bezwen amelyorasyon, sitou paske gen estasyon otobis sou tou de bò.
 Pandan m te la mwen te wè moun ki t ap soti nan machin yo epi yo t ap travèse lari a.
 Se konsa, mwen devine sa a se yon nivo antre flash rektangilè limyè devan.
 Pli lwen, li pral yon limyè arè konplè, tankou sa ki sou Katriyèm Street la.
 Men, mwen panse ke sekirite tapi sa a bezwen kèk amelyorasyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8959.722s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Mèsi.
 Padon si mwen te rate li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8962.498s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi, mwen menm tou konsène sou sekirite pyeton nan pasaj pou pyeton yo.
 Bon bagay sou estasyon otobis yo sou tou de bò yo.
 Kidonk, si nou gen rezidan k ap vwayaje nan otobis, gen plis chans pou yo depoze yo lòt bò Fells Way.
 Lè sa a, lòt bagay la, mwen konnen kèk nan faktè sa yo jeneralman trè difisil chanje, reyèlman
 An atandan vwayaj aswè a, rezidan yo pral kondui sou Fells Way, pase pwojè a epi fè yon vire.
 pral sèlman
 Mwen ta ka mal, men tout siy yo sanble montre sa a pètèt se yon pwoblèm.
 Mwen ta renmen konnen kisa pou m fè la.
 Mwen konnen ou bezwen pèmisyon ECR, men sa pa sou mwen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9048.76s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Mwen jis dakò ak sa w di Mike.
 Mwen vle di, mwen konprann enkyetid Butters genyen konsènan ogmantasyon trafik sou Myrtle Street, men mwen panse se.
 Li pi danjere pou tout moun vire.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9067.528s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bon, aktyèlman mwen panse de yo separe paske dapre sa mwen konprann, si ou ale nan nò, ki mwen panse se wout ki pi komen, si ou te devine ki kote moun yo pral travay, li se pwobableman yon kote anba lavil, e mwen panse ou ta toujou oblije vire.
 Oswa ou oblije mache desann nan kèk ale.
 Se konsa, mwen panse Myrtle e non,
 Li ka gen yon pi gwo enpak sou kite pwopriyete a.
 Men, mwen panse ke pou anpil moun si yo pral nan nò, vire toutotou ta pi bon opsyon, menm si li nan tou de fason.
 Robert Parkhurst (PB) - li, li, li): Bon, mwen pa wè okenn lòt manm konsèy ki vle pale sou pwoblèm sa a.
 Robert Parkhurst, PB - li, li, li:
 : Lè sa a
 Pou nou an sekirite, mwen panse ke nou ta dwe relouvri kòmantè piblik la.
 Mwen konnen nou te fè kòmantè piblik sou trafik anvan, men nou te diskite sou yon bagay nouvo.
 Mwen panse ke kèk manm nan piblik la ki te parèt isit la te pataje kòmantè yo sou trafik.
 Men wi, mwen vle asire w ke sa pa rive
 Inyore moun ki t ap tann pou pale sou sa.
 Kidonk, Prezidan an ap tann yon mosyon pou kòmantè piblik sou Revizyon Kanmarad Transpò.
 Èske mwen gen yon dezyèm?

 Bonjou Alison D'Agostino.
 Mwen reprezante 1022-1024 Pillsbury.
 Padon, mwen gen yon refwadisman.
 Men, mèsi pou louvri sa a ankò.
 Mwen jis vle fè premye kòmantè mwen pou di ou mèsi pou revizyon parèy ou a.
 Lefèt ke tout entèseksyon sa yo te deklare F-rated te louvri je e li sanble trè konsistan ak sa mwen fè eksperyans chak jou.
 Mwen jis te vle fè kòmantè ak di ou mèsi anpil pou rezoud sa a.
 Mwen panse ke evidamman entèseksyon an ak Amaranth, Lawrence, Myrtle se reyèlman kle.
 M ap di w kounye a, mwen abite nan yon kay nan Fells Road ki mennen nan Myrtle, epi mwen oblije gade plizyè fwa nan yon jounen paske yon moun ap vire kwen an ak mache nan Myrtle Street.
 Mwen te pèsonèlman te prèske frape pa yon machin ki rete isit la omwen twa oswa kat fwa.
 Se konsa, pou mwen, domèn kle yo ke mwen reyèlman respekte konsèy la ak lòt moun konsidere, Davis Companies, se Myrtle ak Faithway,
 Myrtle, ansanm ak Fellsway ak Central, gen yon pousantaj rekiperasyon 100 pousan.
 Yo te travay ak Fellsway ak DCR pou kreye nouvo pasaj pop-up sa a, pafè pou pyeton yo.
 Men, rezon ki fè sa a se ke gwo machin pa ka reyèlman reyalize sa a kalite chanjman nan direksyon.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle soulve pwoblèm nan.
 Ak yon enkyetid.
 Mari m ', enteresan ase, kamyon li nan Demo a te youn nan ou wè, ki te yon Dodge Ram.
 Men, li aktyèlman te oblije ale sou Central, sou Kendall, sou Myrtle pou rive nan kay nou an, epi answit sou Amarans pase transfè sa a.
 Nou te tounen nan Fells Road pou nou ale lakay nou.
 Kidonk, si nenpòt moun ki nan bilding lan posede kamyon oswa gwo machin, yo p ap kapab vire nan Fells Way ak Central.
 Mwen panse ke ou ta dwe definitivman konsidere sa nan evalyasyon ou.
 Antouka, dènye kòmantè mwen an se jis pou remèsye ou pou mansyone sa a. Mwen vrèman rekonesan pou konsèy administrasyon an ak konpayi Davis ke mwen te rankontre epi yo te trè akeyan tou.
 Ou konnen, li vokal ak itil lè w ap eseye fè konvèsasyon sa yo.
 Se konsa, mwen pa panse ke reyinyon sa a ranmase sou sa.
 Men, nan opinyon mwen, kòm yon rezidan depi lontan reprezante pa bèlmè m 'nan de ane, li te posede kay sa a pou plis pase senkant ane, li vrèman bèl bagay.
 Men, wè ke evalyasyon trafik aktyèl la ap pran li trè seryezman, espesyalman Lawrence ak Myrtle ak Fellsway, mèsi anpil.
 Men, mwen jis vle fè remake ke aktyèlman koupe twotwa yo, mwen panse ke nouvo kòd DCR yo, mwen panse ke yo bezwen konsidere paske si ou gen yon machin gwo sou Central ak Fellsway, ou pa ka menm vire.
 Se konsa, mwen pral sispann isit la.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9437.128s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Christina Katch, tanpri bay non ak adrès ki anrejistre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9440.37s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Christina Kach, 130 Myrtle Street.
 Mwen pa te di sa anvan paske mwen pa janm panse nou ta konsidere pasaj pou piaton ak siy stop ak kondisyon aktyèl kondwi nan katye sa a, ki gen ladan U-viraj yo nan Central, Lawrence,
 Gen plizyè lari a yon sèl nan katye nou an.
 Ou ka sèlman ogmante ak bese yo nan yon sèten fason.
 Antanke yon rezidan depi lontan ki te fè plizyè milye kilomèt nan lari sa yo, Allison, lè m ap pase lakay ou, mwen kòmanse siy ou.
 Moun pa kanpe nan siy stop.
 Lè m kanpe nan pasaj triyangilè sa yo, lè m ap pran bis la, moun pa kanpe nan pasaj triyangilè sa yo.
 Lè ou rive nan estasyon tren an, moun pa kanpe sou Fells Way pou kite ou travèse.
 Gen plizyè siy stop oswa, padon, pa gen okenn siy pou pyeton nan limyè lari ki tou pre yo.
 Ou ka sèlman evite frape si pèsonn pa vire adwat nan moman limyè a vin wouj.
 Mwen byen kontan gen yon diskisyon sou sekirite pyeton paske lari sa yo difisil pou pyeton yo.
 Nou pa mansyone twotwa yo pa gwo, men sa se vil Bedford.</p>

 Mwen ta dwe louvri li kounye a.
 Oke, ann kòmanse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9645.58s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Se konsa, an tèm de delè inisyal nou an, nou te diskite sou achitekti ak revizyon parèy bonè.
 Nou te diskite sou pwoblèm sivil la, men nou pa gen opinyon preliminè sou li.
 Kounye a nou diskite sou trafik ak revizyon parèy preliminè.
 Kòmantè sou sa.
 Nou te ale nan plizyè iterasyon nan plan achitekti a.
 Se konsa, nou toujou bezwen fè kòmantè revizyon parèy jeni.
 Nou bezwen mizajou pou reflete plan konstriksyon ak jeni.
 Lè sa a, sijesyon an bezwen rive
 Egzanpsyon yo mande yo ak kondisyon yo pwopoze yo.
 Donk nou gen anpil bagay pou nou fè men pa gen anpil tan.
 Se poutèt sa pwochen reyinyon nou an pwograme pou 22 avril.
 Dapre mwen konnen, nou pral resevwa fidbak nan men revizyon parèy sivil anvan lè sa a.
 Li sanble anvan reyinyon sa a, men li pa klè konbyen tan ki rete pou reyinyon sa a.
 Kandida yo pral gen kèk tan pou yo revize men yo ka pa pare ak repons konplè.
 Se konsa, sa a se sitou repons kandida yo nan revizyon kanmarad transpò, revizyon parèy sivil, e petèt jis yon mizajou pwojè jeneral.
 Lè sa a, mwen vle pale ak mesye Noon.
 Èske sa a anfòm plan ou ak konpreyansyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9760.153s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Oke, mwen panse sa, pandan n ap reflechi sou odyans kap vini yo, nou eseye prepare.
 Pou aktyalizasyon chema a, mwen jis resevwa kòmantè sa yo.
 Hmm.
 Epi pwograme yon reyinyon revizyon parèy ak Mesye Bomber semèn pwochèn.
 Pèsonèlman, mwen pa te gen okenn lide beta a ta pral lage apremidi a nan eleman transpò a.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke kòmantè sa yo gen sans.
 Kounye a ke li fre nan lespri tout moun, nou bezwen peye yon ti kras atansyon sou odyans nan 20, mwen kwè se te 23 la, Mr Chairman, jis pou konfime sa.
 Li nan 2 a.m. Madi maten.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9810.864s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Madi.
 Wi jodia se madi 23 la.
 Se konsa, mwen te mal.
 Donk wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9818.083s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Uh... Se konsa, mwen panse ke nan odyans sa a nou uh... nou te pral eseye fè kèk repons nan trafik. Mwen pa vle pale pou Scott. Mwen konnen li ap travay sou li, epi franchman, nou pa te gen yon chans konekte ... kote li ye nan pwosesis la. Mwen panse ke nou te resevwa kòmantè sa yo Vandredi dènye apremidi, uh... Se konsa, sa te gen kèk jou depi pwosesis la revizyon, si mwen ka sijere, uh...
 Si konsèy la dakò, nou pral avanse ak kèk kalite pwogram ajanda.
 Mwen panse ke lide a se reponn a trafik nan kèk fason ak reponn a fidbak achitekti nan yon fason.
 San kòmantè sivil, li difisil pou di si nou pral pare sou 23 la.
 Donk mwen panse ke objektif nou se yon konbinezon transpò ak achitekti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9870.349s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Oke, sa sanble rezonab pou mwen.
 Wi, nou ta apresye li si ou ta swiv ak konfime delè a.
 Bagay prensipal mwen espere ke nou dakò se ke nou reyèlman bezwen tout repons yo ak mizajou sou plan yo nan lòd yo jwenn nenpòt rezilta nan reyinyon 9 Me a.
 Kenbe fèmti 21 me a se yon posibilite reyalis.
 Donk, ou konnen, si nan diskite sou delè ak kontakte nou, li sanble ke nou ap antre nan yon sitiyasyon kote nou ka pa kapab delivre tout sa ki te mande.
 Mwen sètènman ouvè a eksplore yon ekstansyon trè kout apre 21 me si ou ta renmen, men mwen jis fè w konnen kounye a ke yo nan lòd yo aktyèlman satisfè dat 21 me a, nou bezwen
 Tout bagay te aliye e nou jis pale de dispans ak pwopozisyon nan dat 9 me.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9955.037s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Wi, mwen konprann.
 Mwen kwè ke piske de nan twa disiplin yo ka bay opinyon parèy revizyon, si nou ka sivil pi vit posib, anplwaye nou yo pral sètènman travay pou asire ke nou resevwa repons epi yo ka bay opinyon nan odyans fiti an repons a kòmantè ak kesyon.</p>

 Lè mwen rekòmanse òdinatè mwen an, sa mwen te oblije fè, anpil bagay te koupe epi mwen remake ke bagay anvan yo pa t 'travay.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10068.429s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Wi nan kou.
 Lè sa a, mwen te resevwa kèk repons.
 Se konsa, sa a pa gen anyen fè ak aktyèl, otreman ou ta tande
 Konsèy la ap bezwen planifye yon lòt reyinyon espesyal.
 Lè sa a, nan dat 3 avril, konsèy la te resevwa yon aplikasyon ak demann pou yon odyans sou Mystic Avenue.
 40B, HAC a te retounen bay Konsèy la.
 Se poutèt sa nou bezwen yon nouvo odyans nan 30 jou.
 Nou pafwa bezwen li akòz kondisyon notifikasyon.
 Fondamantalman semèn 29 avril la.
 Se konsa, mwen tcheke dat yo ak konsèy la pou tou de kandida yo: 30 avril ak 2 me.
 Sa a pral yon reyinyon tou kout epi nou pa pral tande temwayaj.
 Ann ale nan kèk etap pwosedi epi kontinye.
 Nou ka mande kandida yo prezante tèt yo.
 Men, mwen te resevwa yon repons e li sanble ke gen chèz ki disponib soti nan 4yèm a 30yèm lan.
 Kidonk 4yèm rive 30yèm lan pral dat pou reyinyon espesyal sa a.
 Sèl atik sou ajanda a pral ka a.
 Kòm mwen te di, sa a pral yon reyinyon pwosedi.
 Se poutèt sa, Konsèy Vil la ta dwe konsidere otorize vil la anboche konsiltan revizyon kanmarad.
 Mwen vle di, pale de konsiltan 40B ak chwazi yon dat pou adrese sa a ki pèmèt tan anboche konsiltan sa yo.
 Donk wi.
 Mwen estime nou ta ka fè sa nan 30 minit oswa mwens.
 Pa gen anyen ki pwomèt, men dat yo chwazi a se madi 30 avril a 6:30 p.m.
