 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​កំពុង​តែ​ស្នើ ហើយ​ប្រាកដ​ជា​ចង់​បន្ថែម សម្របសម្រួល​ជាមួយ​ទីក្រុង និង Bluebikes ដើម្បី​បន្ថែម​ស្ថានីយ​នៅ​ទីនោះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃបទបង្ហាញទូទៅ
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងនឹងមានភាពប្រែប្រួលបន្តិច ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនឹងផ្តល់ដំបូន្មានខ្លះដល់អ្នកនៅចុងបញ្ចប់។
 នេះជាការសង្ខេបខ្លីៗនៃការងារស៊ីវិលមួយចំនួនដែលយើងកំពុងធ្វើលើគម្រោងវិស្វកម្មសំណង់ស៊ីវិលរបស់យើង មិនមានអ្វីទៀតទេ។
 និយាយឱ្យសាមញ្ញទៅ វាជាការរៀបចំទីតាំង ការរៀបចំទេសភាព បរិក្ខារ កន្លែងចតរថយន្ត និងអ្វីៗជាច្រើនដែលអ្នកឃើញទាំងអស់ដំណើរការជាមួយគ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះ​គ្រាន់​តែ​បញ្ជាក់​សម្រាប់​អ្នក​រាល់​គ្នា នេះ​មិន​មែន​ជា​ការ​ប្រមូល​ចៃដន្យ​ទេ។
 យើងកំពុងធ្វើការដើម្បីឆ្លើយសំណួរ និងផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានលម្អិតបន្ថែមអំពីអ្វីដែល Bowler កំពុងស្នើសុំឱ្យទីក្រុងធ្វើនៅក្នុងបណ្តឹងរដ្ឋប្បវេណី និងអ្វីដែលកំពុងត្រូវបានពិចារណាដោយសហការី។
 បានឆ្លងផុតកំណែបែតា។
 ដូច្នេះ ដូចដែល Steve បានលើកឡើងពីមុន ទាំងនេះគឺជារឿងមួយចំនួនដែលយើងចង់មើល ដោះស្រាយ ឬពង្រីកបន្ថែម។
 យើងមិនចង់ឱ្យនរណាម្នាក់មានអារម្មណ៍ថាមានបញ្ហាជាមួយការបង្ហាញនោះទេ ដូចរាល់ដង យើងចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាយើងអាចឆ្លើយសំណួរទាំងនេះបាន ប៉ុន្តែយើងក៏មានឱកាសដើម្បី

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បញ្ចប់សុន្ទរកថារបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 ដូច្នេះសង្ឃឹមថា វាមិនរវល់ពេកសម្រាប់អ្នករាល់គ្នា ប៉ុន្តែគ្រាន់តែចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា យើងគ្របដណ្តប់លើប្រធានបទទាំងអស់ដែលយើងមានអារម្មណ៍ថាចាំបាច់។

 ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះទេសភាពនៅក្នុងភ្លើងបំភ្លឺទូទៅ និងរបៀបដែលវាត្រូវគ្នានឹងមេឃងងឹត។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ទូលំទូលាយ​ណាស់​ក្នុង​លក្ខខណ្ឌ​នៃ​តម្រូវការ​និង​កត្តា​ដែល​យើង​ចង់​គ្របដណ្តប់។

 ខ្ញុំគិតថាកង្វល់តែមួយគត់របស់ខ្ញុំគឺមកពីទស្សនៈអាស័យដ្ឋាន៖ តើអគារនេះគួរត្រូវបានគេហៅថា 970 Fellsway ដោយមិននិយាយពីអាសយដ្ឋាន Myrtle Street ដោយគ្រាន់តែពិចារណាថា Google Maps, Apple Maps និងមនុស្សដែលមិនស្គាល់តំបន់នោះគួរតែត្រូវតម្រង់ទៅច្រកចូល Fellsway ជំនួសឱ្យច្រកចូល Myrtle Street?</p>

 ព័ត៌មានមានប្រយោជន៍ដ៏អស្ចារ្យ។
 គ្រាន់តែសំណួរមួយចំនួន។
 ជាដំបូង ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមានមតិសាធារណៈមួយចំនួនមិនយូរប៉ុន្មានអំពីគ្រឿងបរិក្ខារ និងការរៀបចំទេសភាព ហើយខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើមានការសន្ទនាជាមួយអ្នកជិតខាងអំពីលក្ខណៈពិសេសទាំងនោះ ជាពិសេសកន្លែងក្មេងលេង។

 បញ្ហា​មួយ​គឺ​ការ​រៀបចំ​កន្លែង​ក្រៅ ហើយ​ជា​ទូទៅ អ្នក​ជិត​ខាង​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ជួប​នៅ​ពេល​ហៅ​ទូរសព្ទ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​បំភ្លៃ​អ្វី​ដែល​បាន​និយាយ​នោះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​ជា​ទូទៅ​មតិ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ទទួល​គឺ​អំពី​ការ​លេង​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រៅ ឧបករណ៍​រាងកាយ​ខាង​ក្រៅ​គឺ​មិន​ពិត​ជា​សប្បាយ​សម្រាប់​អ្នក​ជិត​ខាង​មួយ​ចំនួន​ទេ។
 ពួកគេមិនចាំបាច់ស្រមៃថាខ្លួនឯងកំពុងប្រើវាទេ។
 ការសន្ទនាដែលយើងមានគឺថា យើងចង់បានកន្លែងក្រៅដែលបានគ្រោងទុក ដើម្បីផ្តល់អត្ថប្រយោជន៍ដល់សហគមន៍ ហើយយើងបើកចំហចំពោះមតិកែលម្អរបស់ពួកគេ ប្រសិនបើមានអ្វីដែលពួកគេចង់ឃើញ។
 ខាងក្រោម​នេះ​ជា​ចម្លើយ​ទូទៅ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ទទួល​រហូត​មក​ដល់​ពេល​នេះ។
 ទាក់ទងនឹងសិល្បៈសាធារណៈ។
 ចម្លើយ​ចំពោះ​សំណួរ​នេះ​គឺ​បាទ វា​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​ថាតើ​យើង​មាន​សមត្ថភាព​ពិចារណា​ឬ​អត់។
 យើងមិនមានព័ត៌មានជាក់លាក់ទេ។
 មានគំនិតជាក់លាក់មួយនៅក្នុងចិត្ត។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាអ្វីដែលយើងបានរៀនពីការសវនកម្មដែលផ្តោតលើស្ថាបត្យកម្មចុងក្រោយនេះគឺថា យើងនឹងបន្តមើលសំណួរនេះ ដើម្បីនិយាយ ជាផ្នែកនៃការពិនិត្យពីមិត្តភ័ក្តិនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​បោះបង់​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ជាមួយ​នឹង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​លើក​ក្រោយ​របស់​ស្ថាបត្យករ Davis Square និង​ផ្នែក​ខាង​ក្រៅ​នៃ​អគារ សូម​នាំ​យក​ធាតុ​ទេសភាព​មក​ជា​ចំណុច​សំខាន់​នៃ​ការ​សន្ទនា​បច្ចុប្បន្ន។
 នេះគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងព្យាយាមគិតបន្ថែមទៀត។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថានៅទីបំផុតយើងអាចធានាថាយើងនឹងមានការរចនាជាផ្លូវការសម្រាប់សិល្បៈសាធារណៈ។
 នេះគឺជា TBD បន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែជាទូទៅ ដើម្បីឆ្លើយសំណួរ បាទ/ចាស យើងប្រាកដជាបើកចំហរក្នុងការបញ្ចូលវាជាផ្នែកមួយនៃគេហទំព័រនៅក្នុងតំបន់ផ្សេងៗគ្នានៃគេហទំព័រ។
 ប្រសិនបើសមាជិកក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល ឬសមាជិកសហគមន៍មានការណែនាំអំពីអ្វីដែលត្រូវធ្វើ ឬកន្លែងដែលត្រូវធ្វើនោះ យើងចង់ឮពីអ្នក។

 អូ
 គ្រាន់​តែ​ជា​មតិ​មួយ​ចំនួន​ឬ​សំណួរ​អំពី​ការ​ចរាចរ​។
 មែនហើយ 1 គឺជាខ្សែកណ្តាល។
 គម្រោងដែលបានស្នើឡើង និងកន្លែងផ្ទុកភ្លាមៗអាចហាក់ដូចជាវែង។
 ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើពួកគេកំពុងសម្លឹងមើលរបាំងខ្លះ ឬទម្រង់នៃការបន្ធូរបន្ថយផ្សេងទៀត។
 ខ្ញុំក៏ចង់ដឹងដែរ ប្រសិនបើអ្នកអាចពន្យល់បន្ថែមបន្តិច។
 តើ​រថយន្ត​ដឹក​ទំនិញ​ទៅ​ណា ហើយ​តើ​ពួកគេ​ចូល​ទៅ​ក្រៅ​យានដ្ឋាន​ដោយ​របៀប​ណា ហើយ​តើ​ពួកគេ​នឹង​ធ្វើ​វា​នៅ​ទីណា?
 តើមនុស្សនឹងផ្លាស់ទីគ្រឿងសង្ហារឹមរបស់ពួកគេទៅណា?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3191.623s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ជាការពិតណាស់ ខ្ញុំនឹងចែករំលែកអេក្រង់ម្តងទៀត ដូច្នេះអ្នកអាចឃើញក្រាហ្វិកមួយចំនួន។
 បាទ បន្ទាត់ត្រង់គឺជាបន្ទាត់ត្រង់វែង។
 ប្រាក់រង្វាន់គឺថាចំណតខាងមុខជួយសម្រួលចរាចរណ៍មែនទេ?
 វានឹងមិនដូចផ្លូវក្នុងទីក្រុងដែលជំរុញឱ្យមានការបើកបរក្នុងល្បឿនលឿននោះទេ។
 យើងក៏មិនមានល្បឿនកើនឡើងដែរ។
 ផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់ ឬអ្វីក៏ដោយដែលត្រូវបានស្នើឡើងនៅថ្ងៃនេះ ខ្ញុំមិននិយាយថាយើងមិនអាចធ្វើវាបានទេ ប៉ុន្តែជារឿយៗវាជាបញ្ហាថែទាំ និងបង្ហាញពីបញ្ហាប្រឈមផ្សេងៗ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​យើង​ប្រាកដ​ជា​នឹង​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​ឲ្យ​បាន​ដិត​ដល់។
 យើងធ្វើវាដោយចេតនានៅមុំ 90 ដឺក្រេពីច្រកចូល។
 ដូច្នេះមនុស្សម្នាក់ត្រូវតែមក ហើយក្លាយជាបែបនោះ។
 ដូច្នេះវាមិនដូចផ្លូវល្បឿនលឿនទេ។
 ជាក់ស្តែងចុងម្ខាងទៀតក៏មានមុំ 90 ដឺក្រេផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ មនុស្ស​មាន​ពេល​វេលា​ជាក់លាក់​មួយ​ក្នុង​ការ​ឈរ​ឲ្យ​ត្រង់​មុន​ពេល​ឈប់ និង​បង្វិល ៩០ ដឺក្រេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ចម្ងាយ​សមរម្យ ប៉ុន្តែ​ប្រាកដ​ណាស់​ជា​កន្លែង​ល្អ​ដើម្បី​មើល​ទៅ​ឆ្ងាយ​បន្តិច។
 ទាក់ទងនឹងសមត្ថភាពផ្ទុក ដូចដែលយើងបានឃើញ យើងធ្វើការលើឡានពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យ ដូច្នេះឡានដឹកជណ្ដើរអាចផ្លាស់ទីពេញអាគារ។
 ឡានដឹកជញ្ចូនជារឿយៗត្រូវបានប្រើសម្រាប់គម្រោងបែបនេះ។
 គិតអំពី U-Haul ដែលមានទំហំតូចជាងរថយន្តដឹកអ្នកដំណើរបន្តិច ប៉ុន្តែមិនចាំបាច់ជា U-Haul នោះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រភេទរថយន្តដឹកទំនិញប្រអប់តែមួយ
 វាប្រសើរជាងឡានពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យបន្តិច។
 ដូច្នេះគ្រប់ទីកន្លែងដែលយើងណែនាំរថយន្តពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យចល័ត រថយន្តពន្លត់អគ្គីភ័យចល័តអាចទៅបាន ប៉ុន្តែតាមពិតទៅពួកគេនឹងនៅខាងក្រោយអាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ ពួកគេកំពុងព្យាយាមឡើងដល់កំពូលភ្នំនៅខាងក្រោយ ដើម្បីឡើងទៅកាន់ Amaranth ហើយឡើងដល់កំពូលភ្នំនៅទីនេះ។
 ពួកគេអាចធ្វើបាន
 ប្រសិនបើអនុញ្ញាត ពួកគេអាចឆ្លងកាត់ Fellsway ហើយចូលផ្នែកម្ខាងនៃអគារនេះ។
 ប្រតិបត្តិការផ្ទុកធ្វើឡើងនៅខាងក្រោយទ្វារនេះ។
 មានកន្លែងដឹកទំនិញ និងជណ្តើរយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​សកម្មភាព​ដឹក​ជញ្ជូន​តាម​ពិត​នៅ​សងខាង​ផ្លូវ​នេះ​គ្មាន​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត​នៅ​ចំហៀង​ផ្លូវ​ទេ ។

 ឡានដឹកទំនិញមិនត្រូវបានអនុញ្ញាតនៅក្នុងយានដ្ឋានទេ។
 ច្រកចូលយានដ្ឋាននឹងនៅកម្រិតឡានដឹកទំនិញ ដូច្នេះនឹងមានចំណតសម្រាប់ឡានដឹកទំនិញ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមានឡានដឹកទំនិញតូចជាងនេះ វាអាចដាក់ក្នុងយានដ្ឋានជាជាងរថយន្តដឹកទំនិញប្រអប់។</p>

 បច្ចុប្បន្នយើងកំពុងធ្វើការដើម្បីកំណត់ទំហំការ៉េនៃបន្ទប់នេះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកបង្កើតគំនិត។
 យើងបានផ្តោតលើកង់ឱ្យបានច្រើនតាមតែអាចធ្វើទៅបាន ហើយពិនិត្យមើលទំហំផ្សេងគ្នានៃទូដាក់កង់ និងកន្លែងដាក់នាឡិកា មិនថាជាន់លើ ឬដាក់ជញ្ជាំងនោះទេ ដោយព្យាយាមបង្កើនប្រសិទ្ធភាពនៃទំហំនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនមានចំលើយជាក់លាក់មួយទាក់ទងនឹងចំនួនទេ ប៉ុន្តែបើនិយាយពីរូបភាពការ៉េនៅក្នុងបន្ទប់ យើងកំពុងធ្វើការកែលម្អចម្លើយនោះឥឡូវនេះ ហើយប្រហែលជាមានយ៉ាងហោចណាស់លេខមួយនៅក្នុងបទបង្ហាញបន្ទាប់បន្ទាប់ពីយើងមើលអគារ។

 ដូច្នេះហើយ ក្នុងបរិបទដែលម៉ូតូ និងកង់អគ្គិសនី កាន់តែមានប្រជាប្រិយភាពជាងពេលណាៗទាំងអស់ ពេលដែលគិតគូរដល់ការរចនាកន្លែងដាក់កង់។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ពេលខ្លះមានភ្លើងឆេះ ដែលពិបាកពន្លត់ជាមួយវត្ថុទាំងនេះ។

 បន្ទាប់មកយើងនឹងនិយាយអំពីឱកាសនៅក្នុងអាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះគ្រាន់តែពង្រីកបន្តិចនៅទីនេះ។
 ជា​ថ្មី​ម្តង​ទៀត មាន​កន្លែង​ចំនួន ១៤ ដែល​ពីរ​ជា​កន្លែង​បុរាណ និង​ពីរ​អាច​ចូល​បាន។
 ដោយសារវាពិបាកពេលក្រោយ ហើយដំឡើងហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធ បំពង់ទឹក ភ្លើង និងដំឡើងនៅខាងក្រៅអគារ យើងចង់រៀបចំអ្វីៗគ្រប់យ៉ាងចាប់ពីថ្ងៃដំបូង ដូច្នេះហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធរួចរាល់ និងរួចរាល់។
 ជម្រើសផ្នែកបន្ថែមអនុញ្ញាតឱ្យចូលទៅកាន់យានដ្ឋាន ប៉ុន្តែយើងមិនមានវាទេ។
 ការដាក់វានៅក្នុងយានដ្ឋានគឺមានភាពងាយស្រួល ដរាបណាយើងរៀបចំផែនការទុកជាមុន និងដំឡើងហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធអគ្គិសនីត្រឹមត្រូវមែនទេ?
 Transformer, switchboard ជាដើម។
 យើងត្រូវរៀបចំដើម្បីកសាងកម្លាំងនេះនាពេលអនាគត។
 យើងត្រូវរៀបចំផែនការជាមុន ហើយអនុវត្តផែនការនោះ។
 នៅពេលដែលយើងចូលទៅក្នុងដំណាក់កាលរចនាលំដាប់ យើងនឹងសម្របសម្រួលការងារនេះជាមួយក្រុមហ៊ុនថាមពល។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ នៅពេលដែលអ្នកមានហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធដ៏សំខាន់នេះ ការបន្ថែមឧបករណ៍ទៅក្នុងយានដ្ឋានរបស់អ្នកគឺងាយស្រួលបន្តិច ព្រោះអ្នកអាចដំឡើងបំពង់នៅលើដំបូលយានដ្ឋានរបស់អ្នក។
 ហើយដំណើរការវានៅកន្លែងដែលអ្នកចង់បាន ហើយបន្ថែមស្ថានីយ៍នៅពេលណាក៏បាន។
 នោះហើយជារបៀបដែលយើងចូលទៅដល់គេហទំព័រ ដោយស្វែងរកអ្វីដែលពិបាកបំផុតចាប់ពីថ្ងៃដំបូង និងផ្តល់នូវភាពបត់បែននោះ។
 ដូចដែល Anjanita បាននិយាយថាវាកំពុងពង្រីកយ៉ាងឆាប់រហ័ស។
 យើងមិនដឹងថាតម្រូវការនឹងទៅជាយ៉ាងណានៅប៉ុន្មានឆ្នាំខាងមុខ ប៉ុន្តែវាងាយស្រួលក្នុងការបំពេញបន្ថែម។
 ប៉ាត ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកមានអ្វីនិយាយអ្វីទៀតអំពីអគារនេះ?
 នេះជាទស្សនៈរបស់ខ្ញុំអំពីឱកាសពង្រីក EV ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកវាយក្រចកនៅលើក្បាល។
 ដំណើរការគិតរបស់យើងគឺតំឡើងឆ្នាំងសាក EV នៅផ្នែកខាងក្រៅនៃអាគារដែលជាផ្នែកនៃរចនាសម្ព័ន្ធអាគារ។
 យើង​បាន​ឮ​សមាជិក​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សា និង​អ្នក​ដទៃ​ទៀត​ដែល​បាន​ចូល​រួម​ក្នុង​សវនាការ​ខាង​លើ​និយាយ​ថា ពួក​គេ​ចង់​ឃើញ​ឆ្នាំងសាក​អគ្គិសនី​ដាក់​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រៅ​អគារ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងគិតថា ការធ្វើនៅនឹងកន្លែង គឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចធ្វើជាមួយនឹងការពង្រីកនាពេលអនាគត មានសមត្ថភាពធ្វើ និងមានភាពបត់បែនក្នុងលក្ខខណ្ឌនៃទំហំត្រឹមត្រូវនៃហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធអគ្គិសនី ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេអាចធ្វើវាបាននៅកម្រិតវេទិកា នៅកម្រិតអគារការពារភ្លើង រហូតដល់កម្រិតយានដ្ឋាន ដែលពួកគេអាចដំឡើងបំពង់នៅលើដំបូល និងបន្ថែមស្ថានីយបញ្ចូលភ្លើងសម្រាប់រថយន្តអគ្គិសនី។
 ដោយស្មោះត្រង់ ក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis បានទទួលជោគជ័យជាមួយនឹងគម្រោងផ្សេងទៀត ហើយអាចបន្ថែមបន្ថែមទៀតតាមតម្រូវការ ឬតម្រូវការកើនឡើង។
 វាពិតជាបញ្ហានៃការសម្របសម្រួលហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធអគ្គិសនីរបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះ អ្នកដឹងទេ បន្ទរពីអ្វីដែល Steve បាននិយាយ ប៉ុន្តែស្តាប់វាដោយផ្ទាល់ពីខ្ញុំ នេះគ្រាន់តែជាផ្នែកនៃរបៀបដែលយើងរចនាគេហទំព័រ ហើយគិតអំពីវាដោយគំនិត ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកឃើញពួកគេអង្គុយនៅលើគេហទំព័រ ហើយផ្លាស់ប្តូរនៅពេលអគាររីកចម្រើននាពេលអនាគត។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: បាទ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់និយាយថា ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ខ្ញុំរីករាយដែលអ្នកចាប់អារម្មណ៍ក្នុងការពង្រីកខាងក្នុង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​គិត​ថា​ជាមួយ​នឹង​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត​ច្រើន សូម្បី​តែ​ថ្ងៃ​ដំបូង​ក៏​នឹង​មាន​ការ​គ្រប់​គ្រាន់​ដើម្បី​សាក​រថយន្ត​អគ្គិសនី។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជានឹងណែនាំបន្ថែមទៀត។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: នេះគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចពិចារណាបានយ៉ាងពិតប្រាកដ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនមានចម្លើយជាក់លាក់សម្រាប់កំណត់បរិមាណទេ ប៉ុន្តែយើងយកចិត្តទុកដាក់លើការណែនាំរបស់អ្នក ហើយពិតជានឹងពិចារណាវា។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: នេះគឺជាសំណួរដ៏ល្អមួយ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមានកម្រិតជាច្រើន។
 អ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងតម្រូវឱ្យមានការសម្របសម្រួលបន្តិចជាមួយនឹងហេដ្ឋារចនាសម្ព័ន្ធថាមពលរបស់អ្នក តើថាមពលប៉ុន្មានដែលអ្នកអាចទទួលបាន និងប្រអប់ទំហំណាដែលអ្នកត្រូវការដើម្បីចែកចាយប្រភេទថាមពលដែលអ្នកត្រូវការ។
 ខ្ញុំអាចនិយាយបានថា ខ្ញុំគិតថា ស្ថានីយ៍សាកថ្មលឿន ពិតជាមានច្រើនជាងនេះ។
 សម្រាប់អគារបែបនេះ នេះអាចត្រូវបានចាត់ទុកថាធម្មតា សូម្បីតែ atypical ដែលបានផ្តល់ឱ្យទំហំធំរបស់វា។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​មាន​ចម្លើយ​ជាក់លាក់​ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងចង់ធ្វើឱ្យពួកវាមានប្រសិទ្ធភាពតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន ប៉ុន្តែយើងនឹងត្រូវគណនាលក្ខណៈជាក់លាក់នៃស្ថានីយសាកថ្មនៅពេលក្រោយ នៅពេលដែលយើងអាចគណនាបរិមាណជាមួយវិស្វករអគ្គិសនី និងធ្វើការជាមួយអ្នកផ្តល់ឧបករណ៍ប្រើប្រាស់ដើម្បីបញ្ជាក់ថាតើថាមពលប៉ុន្មានអាចទៅដល់កន្លែងនោះ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ជាការកត់សម្គាល់ ជាធម្មតានៅក្នុងប្រភេទនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍នេះ យើងគ្រាន់តែប្រើឆ្នាំងសាកធម្មតាប៉ុណ្ណោះ ព្រោះមនុស្សរំពឹងថានឹងទៅផ្ទះ ហើយចតរថយន្តរបស់ពួកគេពេញមួយយប់។
 ដូច្នេះ អត្រា​មួយ​យប់​នឹង​មិន​មែន​ជា​ឧបសគ្គ​ចំពោះ​ប្រតិបត្តិការ​អាជីវកម្ម​ធម្មតា​ទេ។
 ប្រសិនបើនេះគឺជាការបង្វិលខ្លីជាងនេះ អ្នកពិតជាត្រូវការការផ្ទុកលឿនជាងមុននៅចំណុចនេះ។

 តើកន្លែងទាំងនេះត្រូវបានរចនាឡើងសម្រាប់អ្នកប្រើប្រាស់រថយន្តអគ្គិសនីមែនទេ? ឬអ្នកដឹងទេថា តាមគំនិតរបស់ Andrew ប្រសិនបើពួកគេមិនឧស្សាហ៍ព្យាយាម និងសាកថ្មលឿនជាងនេះទេ តើយើងអាចផ្តល់កន្លែងទំនេរទាំងនោះដល់អ្នកជួល ប្រើវាសម្រាប់បញ្ចូលថ្ម ហើយបន្ទាប់មកផ្លាស់ទីរថយន្ត ហើយធ្វើឱ្យពួកគេអាចរកបានសម្រាប់អ្នកផ្សេង?
 និយាយអញ្ចឹង វាច្បាស់ណាស់ថាវាគ្រាន់តែជាគំនិតប៉ុណ្ណោះ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: បាទ នោះជាអ្វីដែលយើងត្រូវសម្របសម្រួល។
 យើងត្រូវការការសម្របសម្រួលរវាងក្រុមគ្រប់គ្រងទ្រព្យសម្បត្តិ។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថានៅក្រោមលក្ខខណ្ឌដែលអ្នកកំពុងនិយាយអំពី នៅពេលដែលយើងចាក់សោលេខ ប្រសិនបើវាត្រូវបានគេកំណត់ភ្លាមៗថាត្រូវការច្រើនជាងនេះ ខ្ញុំជឿថាយើងមានអារម្មណ៍ស្រួលជាមួយនឹងសមត្ថភាពក្នុងការបន្ថែមបានយ៉ាងងាយស្រួល។
 ដូច្នេះ ប្រសិនបើមនុស្សមិនអាចគិតថ្លៃរថយន្តរបស់ពួកគេបានទេ ដោយសារពួកគេរវល់នៅកន្លែងធ្វើការ យើងនឹងអាចសម្របសម្រួលស្ថានីយសាកថ្មបន្ថែមទៀតនាពេលអនាគត។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, រឿងមួយដែលខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយនៅក្នុងអត្ថបទនេះគឺថានេះគឺជាបរិយាកាសអាកាសធាតុត្រជាក់។

 ទីមួយគឺនៅ Fellsway ហើយដូចដែលអ្នកអាចមើលឃើញផ្តល់ឱកាសដើម្បីឆ្លើយតបដោយគ្រាន់តែកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវដើម្បីផលប្រយោជន៍នៃអចលនទ្រព្យទាំងមូល។
 កែប្រែចំណុចចូលរបស់អគារនេះ និងសមត្ថភាពផ្ទុករបស់វា ព្រមទាំងរបៀបដែលរថយន្តដឹកទំនិញចូល និងចេញពីអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ច្បាស់​ជា​ជាក់លាក់​ចំពោះ​សំណួរ​របស់​អ្នក។
 នេះនឹងជាការកែប្រែលក្ខខណ្ឌដែលមានស្រាប់។
 ទីពីរ ខ្ញុំគិតថា។
 អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ចង់​យល់​គឺ​វិសាលភាព ហើយ​នេះ​ជា​ការ​លំបាក​បន្តិច Steve ប៉ុន្តែ​ពេល​អគារ​នៅ​ទីនោះ ពេល​ឃ្លាំង​ដែល​មាន​ស្រាប់​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​វាយ​កម្ទេច ច្បាស់​ជា​មាន​ជញ្ជាំង​វែង​ដែល​ទុក​សម្រាប់​អគារ​ស្តុក​ទុក​ដោយ​ខ្លួន​ឯង​ដែល​មាន​ស្រាប់។
 យើងគ្រោងនឹងបញ្ចប់ជញ្ជាំងនេះដោយរបៀបណា។
 ឥឡូវនេះវាជាជញ្ជាំង CMU នៅក្នុងអគារ។
 វា​នឹង​មាន​គម្រោង​ដើម្បី​ចូល​ទៅ​ក្នុង​និង​ការ​កែ​លម្អ​ស្ថានភាព​ខាង​ក្រៅ​នៃ​ជញ្ជាំង​នេះ​។
 ជាក់ស្តែងយើងនឹងធានាថាការរុះរើត្រូវបានធ្វើដោយសុវត្ថិភាព ប៉ុន្តែសោភ័ណ្ឌភាពរបស់វាគ្រាន់តែជាបញ្ហានៃការបញ្ចប់ជញ្ជាំងនេះ និងសុវត្ថិភាពនៃការតភ្ជាប់ទាំងអស់ទៅនឹងដំបូល។
 អ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលទាក់ទងនឹងការការពារទឹកជ្រាបនៃអគារនេះត្រូវបានធ្វើយ៉ាងត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ដូច្នេះមិនត្រឹមតែការរុះរើអគារដែលមានស្រាប់ប៉ុណ្ណោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែការងារដែលយើងគ្រោងនឹងធ្វើក៏នឹងមានការកែលម្អមួយចំនួនដែលនឹងអនុញ្ញាតឱ្យយើងដោះស្រាយបញ្ហានៃច្រកចូលសំខាន់នៃអគារមួយផ្នែកផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនចង់ទេ។
 ការសន្ទនាអំពីអចលនទ្រព្យលំនៅដ្ឋាននេះបានរលត់ទៅវិញ ប៉ុន្តែយើងកំពុងផលិតការបង្ហាញមួយចំនួនដែលយើងនឹងពិភាក្សាជាលក្ខណៈឯកជនជាមួយទីក្រុង ដើម្បីជួយស្វែងយល់ពីផ្លូវឆ្ពោះទៅមុខសម្រាប់អគារ នៅពេលដែលការងារមួយចំនួននៅលើវាមានភាពសមហេតុផល។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: ខ្ញុំនិយាយម្តងទៀត ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថា តើអគារនេះដំណើរការយ៉ាងដូចម្តេចទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​ទទួល​ស្គាល់​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ល្ងង់ ឬ​ល្ងង់​អំពី​របៀប​ដែល​អាជីវកម្ម​នេះ​ដំណើរការ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែគិតអំពីបទពិសោធន៍ផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ខ្ញុំ និងកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំធំឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំចាំថានៅក្នុងអគារឧស្សាហកម្ម កម្មករនឹងចេញទៅក្រៅ ហើយមានកន្លែងជួបជុំគ្នានៅខាងក្រៅ ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេ ឈប់ជក់បារី សម្រាកអាហារថ្ងៃត្រង់ និងអ្វីៗដូចនោះ។
 តើនេះជាកន្លែងដែលត្រូវការរបស់ទាំងនេះទេ?
 បើ​វា​កើត​ឡើង តើ​វា​នឹង​កើត​ឡើង​នៅ​ទីណា?
 មានន័យថា អន្តរកម្មជាមួយអ្នកជិតខាង?
 ព្រោះ​មិន​បាន​បិទ​ទៀត​ទេ។
 នេះជាពាណិជ្ជកម្ម។
 នេះគឺជាសង្កាត់មួយ។
 ប្រាកដ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: ទេ នេះជាសំណួរដែលមានប្រយោជន៍។
 ដូច្នេះការប្រើប្រាស់បច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់អគារគឺសម្រាប់ការរក្សាទុកដោយខ្លួនឯង ដែលមានន័យថាតម្លៃថែទាំទាបបំផុតសម្រាប់យើង និងកម្មករនៅនឹងកន្លែង។
 នេះ​មិន​មែន​ជា​ការងារ​ផលិត​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ជា​ការ​គ្រប់​គ្រង​ទូទៅ និង​ការ​ត្រួត​ពិនិត្យ
 ភាពស្មុគស្មាញរបស់មនុស្ស ភាពស្មុគស្មាញនៃអ្នកដែលមានសិទ្ធិចូលទៅកាន់ទ្រុងផ្ទុកផ្ទាល់ខ្លួន។
 ដូច្នេះ អាំងតង់ស៊ីតេការងាររបស់កម្មករនៅនឹងកន្លែង និងលក្ខខណ្ឌសម្រាប់ការងារក្រៅកន្លែងគឺទាបណាស់។
 យើងជឿថាវាមិនចាំបាច់ក្នុងការផ្តល់ឱ្យពួកគេនូវកន្លែងប្រមូលផ្តុំនៅខាងក្នុងអគារនោះទេ។
 មានការិយាល័យ បន្ទប់សម្រាក និងអ្វីៗដូចនោះ ការិយាល័យប្រតិបត្តិ។
 ដូច្នេះជារួម យើងគិតថាជាមួយនឹងគុណភាពនៃការប្រើប្រាស់អគារនេះ និងគុណភាពនៃការត្រួតពិនិត្យដែលធ្វើឡើងដោយកាត់បន្ថយចំនួនបុគ្គលិក។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​បាន​រំពឹង​ថា​នឹង​មាន​អ្វី​ដែល​អ្នក​បាន​និយាយ​នឹង​កើត​ឡើង​។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4813.254s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: សួស្តីលោក
 ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះ Cliff Bomer ។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នករិះគន់ស្ថាបត្យកម្ម ហើយអរគុណអ្នកខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ការនិយាយរបស់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំមានសំណួរមួយចំនួនដែលអាចកើតឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងមើលគ្នាទៅវិញទៅមក
 វគ្គនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាអស្ចារ្យណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​មាន​រឿង​រដ្ឋប្បវេណី​មួយ​ចំនួន​ប្រហែល​ជា​ត្រឡប់​មក​លើ​ប្រធាន​បទ​វិញ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតអំពីកន្លែងចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនចាំកន្លែងដែល Medford អនុវត្តលេខកូដចូលរួមនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែត្រូវចាំ។
 លេខកូដចូលរួមមានតម្រូវការជាក់លាក់សម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ហើយវាប្រែប្រួលយ៉ាងទូលំទូលាយ។
 នេះគឺជាការលោតផ្លោះដ៏ធំបើប្រៀបធៀបទៅនឹងលេខកូដផ្សេងទៀត។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាច្បាប់អន្តរប្រតិបត្តិការទាមទារ 20% នៃចំណតរថយន្តដើម្បីភ្ជាប់បណ្តាញ ខ្ញុំគិតថាមកពី
 សម្រាប់ចំណតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​បង្ហាញ​ខ្លួន​ឯង​ជា​អាជ្ញាធរ​លើ​បទប្បញ្ញត្តិ​ជាក់លាក់​នោះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​សូម​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​វា​ឡើង​វិញ ព្រោះ​វា​អាច​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ពិត​ប្រាកដ ប្រសិន​បើ​ទីក្រុង​ឆ្លងកាត់​វា​មុន​ដំណើរការ​អនុញ្ញាត​ចាប់ផ្តើម។
 ក៏មានមតិពីរឬបីទៀត។
 ជាដំបូងខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍យ៉ាងខ្លាំង
 ដ្យាក្រាមរង្វង់ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាមាននៅក្នុងរបៀបវារៈសម្រាប់វគ្គបន្ទាប់ គឺជាប្រធានបទមួយចំនួនដែលបានលេចឡើងទាក់ទងនឹងការបំភ្លឺនៃអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំបានឃើញវា។
 ច្រកចូលចំហៀងគឺជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អមួយដើម្បីបន្ថែមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍បរិមាណដល់ facade អាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មើល​ឃើញ​ថា​វា​ជា​ឱកាស។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចស្រដៀងគ្នារបស់ Andrew អំពីសិល្បៈសាធារណៈគឺត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 វាមានផ្នែកខាងមុខវែងដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងចំណតរថយន្ត ពណ៍ amaranth វែង ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ទីធ្លាជញ្ជាំងដែលពិតជាអាចបង្កើននូវអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាជាគំនិតដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ផែនការចំហៀងរបស់អាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមានឱកាសដ៏អស្ចារ្យនៅទីនោះ។
 យោបល់រហ័សពីរទៀត។
 មួយគឺ,
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​ផែនការ​ណា​មួយ​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ឃើញ​នៅ​យប់​នេះ​ឆ្លុះ​បញ្ចាំង​ពី​គំនិត​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​អំពី​ការ​កាត់​ជ្រុង​ភាគ​ពាយព្យ​នៃ​អគារ​នោះ​ទេ។
 យើង​បាន​មើល​ទៅ​លើ​ការ​សិក្សា​បរិមាណ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មាន​ប្រសិទ្ធិ​ភាព​ខ្លាំង​ក្នុង​ការ​កាត់​ចេញ​ជ្រុង​ពាយ័ព្យ ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​សូវ​សំខាន់​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងទុកវាចោល។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថានេះជាចេតនា ឬគ្រាន់តែជាបញ្ហាសម្របសម្រួលរវាងការងារសំណង់ និងសំណង់។
 ចំណុចសំខាន់គឺ ខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាអ្នកធ្វើដំណើរទេ ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាយឺតពេលទៅសន្និសីទ ប្រហែលជាពីរដង ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថានឹងមានជម្លោះលើការចូលរៀន។
 ដោយសារតំបន់មកដល់គឺនៅផ្នែកខាងជើងនៃអគារ មានការពិភាក្សាខ្លះអំពីរបៀបបង្កើតផ្លូវដើរដែលបំបែកអគារដែលមានស្រាប់ពីអគារថ្មី ដោយផ្លាស់ទីចម្ងាយ 100 ហ្វីតដំបូងទៅភាគខាងជើង ដើម្បីកុំឱ្យមនុស្សទៅពី Myrtle ទៅតំបន់មកដល់ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកចេញពីច្រកចូលចំណតនៅផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃអាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំសូមអភ័យទោសប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំខកខានការសន្ទនាផ្សេងទៀតអំពីបញ្ហានេះ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់បញ្ជាក់ថាខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាមនុស្សឆ្លងកាត់ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីចំនួនយានជំនិះដែលអាចប្រើវាជាច្រកទ្វារ។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្យ៉ាងវិញទៀត នេះជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានរៀនពីទស្សនៈស៊ីវិល ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 សម័យប្រជុំការងារត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងម្តងទៀត ហើយខ្ញុំបានថ្លែងអំណរគុណដល់បេក្ខជនចំពោះឆន្ទៈរបស់ពួកគេក្នុងការបន្តអភិវឌ្ឍស្ថាបត្យកម្មរបស់អគារ ដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវភ្ជាប់ជាមួយផែនការទេសភាព និងសំណង់ស៊ីវិល។</p>

 អ៊ីចឹង​ដោយសារ​ការ​ពិភាក្សា​ខ្លះ​ក្នុង​ក្រុម​ការងារ​មាន​ចំណុច​ខ្លះ​បំភ្លឺ​រឿង​បន្តិច​បន្តួច តើ​មាន​នរណា​ចង់​និយាយ​រឿង​ហ្នឹង​ទេ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ផាត ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ឱ្យខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើម ខ្ញុំនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងលំដាប់បញ្ច្រាស និងគ្របដណ្តប់បន្ថែមទៀតនៃបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ដែល Cliff ទើបតែបានលើកឡើង តាមពិតនៅដើមពិធី។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចែករំលែករូបថតអេក្រង់របស់ខ្ញុំម្តងទៀត តែមួយដងទៀតប៉ុណ្ណោះ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំអាចបង្ហាញវាចេញ ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាយល់ព្រម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមតិទាំងអស់គឺអំពីប្រវែងនៃផ្លូវនេះ ប្រសិនបើវាចង់នៅម្ខាង ទិសមួយ ឬផ្លូវផ្សេងទៀត ឬយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ក្នុងទិសដៅនៃច្រកចូល ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាការសន្ទនា។
 យើងបានពិភាក្សាវា។
 ទីបំផុត​យើង​បាន​សម្រេច​ថា នេះ​ជា​ផ្នែក​ពីរ​ផ្លូវ។
 ហេតុផលគឺប្រសិនបើឡានមកយកអ្នកឧទាហរណ៍
 ការទម្លាក់នរណាម្នាក់ចេញ ឬរើសនរណាម្នាក់ឡើង នេះគឺដូចជាស្ថានភាពរើស និងទម្លាក់ចោល។
 អ្នកខ្លះកាន់កាបូបដើរទិញឥវ៉ាន់ ហើយទុកវានៅមុខទ្វារ។ ពេល​ភ្លៀង គេ​យក​កាបូប​រត់​ចេញ​តាម​ទ្វារ។
 អ្នក​ដែល​បើក​អ្នក​ចុះ​ពី​ផ្ទះ​អាច​បត់​ចូល​ទៅ​ណា​ក៏​បាន​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រោយ​អគារ រក​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត​របស់​គេ និង​ចូល​តាម​ទ្វារ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដើម្បី​ចូល ទោះ​បី​វា​នៅ​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​ក៏​ដោយ ហើយ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួកគេ​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន ពួកគេ​ប្រាកដ​ជា​មិន​ចេញ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើពួកគេចតនៅខាងក្រៅ វាមានឱកាសដែលនរណាម្នាក់នឹងត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដើរចុះក្រោម Fellsway ហើយបន្ទាប់មកត្រលប់មកវិញតាមច្រកចូលមួយទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងគិតថា នោះជាលក្ខណៈពិសេសមួយដ៏សំខាន់ ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើវាជាអ្នកមកទស្សនារយៈពេលខ្លី ហើយមាននរណាម្នាក់មកមើលអចលនទ្រព្យនោះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកដាក់ប្រាក់បញ្ញើទាំងបួននេះ ដោយសន្មត់ថាពួកគេត្រូវបានកាន់កាប់ទាំងអស់ បន្ទាប់មកបុគ្គលនេះត្រូវតែចាកចេញ ហើយទៅកាន់ Fellsway ដើម្បីចូលមកមើល។
 កន្លែងផ្សេងទៀតនៅកន្លែងណាមួយក្នុងតំបន់ យើងចាត់ទុកការធ្វើដំណើរទាំងនេះថាមិនសំខាន់ពីផ្លូវដែលនៅជាប់គ្នា ហើយរក្សាវានៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបានធ្វើវា មានការពិភាក្សា ហើយអ្នកនឹងមិនចាំខុស ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលយើងនិយាយម្តងទៀត វិស្វករចរាចរណ៍បានធ្វើការវិភាគខ្លះ ហើយប្រហែល 90% នៃអ្នកចូលរួមស្ថិតនៅក្នុងវិសាលភាពនៃការសិក្សា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងមកទិញសំបុត្រមួយទៀត។
 វាត្រូវបានគេជឿថាប្រហែល 10 ភាគរយនៃប្រជាជននឹងងាកទៅរកច្រកទ្វារ។
 នេះ​គឺ​ពិត​ជា​លើក​ទី​មួយ​។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងជឿថា វាមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់ក្នុងការថែរក្សាផ្លូវពីរផ្លូវនេះ នៅពេលដែលបរិមាណចរាចរណ៍មានកម្រិតទាបជាង និងផ្តល់ឱកាសដើម្បីមិនត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Fells Way វិញ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលយើងគិត។</p>

 ខ្ញុំកំពុងកត់ចំណាំ។
 ដូច្នេះវាស្ថិតនៅជ្រុងពាយ័ព្យនៃច្រាំងថ្មចោទក្នុងអាគារ សូមអភ័យទោសប្រសិនបើមានការភាន់ច្រលំនៅទីនេះ។
 ពួកគេគឺជា
 ដំណើរការរចនាត្រូវបានបែងចែកជាពីរផ្នែកតាមវិធីជាច្រើន ដូច្នេះយើងផ្តោតជាពិសេសទៅលើយន្តហោះដី។ ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាមតិដែលអ្នកបានធ្វើ។ យើងជួសជុលផ្នែកលំនៅដ្ឋាននៃអគារដើម្បីឱ្យអគារខ្ពស់ជាងកម្រិតដី
 ផ្ទៃនៃអគារគឺដូចបានបង្ហាញក្នុងរូបភាពខាងលើ ជាមួយនឹងអគារដេកនៅលើខ្នងរបស់វា។
 ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែនិយាយថាបទចម្រៀងនេះត្រឡប់មកវិញ។
 នេះគឺជា chamfer មួយ។
 ដូច្នេះ វា​ស្រប​នឹង​ការបង្ហាញ​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ធ្វើ។
 មុននោះ ពីសវនាការដែលផ្តោតលើស្ថាបត្យកម្មពីមុនរបស់យើង និងការពិនិត្យឡើងវិញពីមិត្តភ័ក្តិពីមុន។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​មិន​បាន​ត្រឡប់​ទៅ​វិញ ហើយ​បំផ្លាញ​អគារ​នោះ​ទេ។
 វាគ្រាន់តែថាអ្នកកំពុងមើលផែនការជាន់។
 ដូច្នេះ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា​យើង​អាច​លុប​បំបាត់​ភាព​ច្របូកច្របល់។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងបន្ត សិល្បៈសាធារណៈនៅអារ៉ាប់រួម។
 ចំណាំខ្លាំងណាស់ ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបានលើកឡើងពីមុន ខ្ញុំគិតថាមានមតិយោបល់មួយទៀតលើបញ្ហានេះ។
 នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​គ្រោង​នឹង​ពិភាក្សា​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​ត្រួតពិនិត្យ​មិត្តភ័ក្តិ​បន្ទាប់។
 នេះគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងបានពិចារណានៅក្នុងការពិនិត្យស្ថាបត្យកម្មរបស់យើង ហើយយើងរីករាយក្នុងការទទួលបានទីតាំងដែលបានស្នើឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើនេះជាសិល្បៈសាធារណៈ?
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, អគារនៅលើផ្លូវខ្យល់, ឬអ្វីមួយអំពីអគារខ្លួនឯង។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងពិតជាបើកចំហចំពោះគំនិត យើងចង់ធ្វើឱ្យវាក្លាយជាសណ្ឋាគារស្វាគមន៍ដែលទីក្រុងអាចមានមោទនភាព ហើយសិល្បៈសាធារណៈដែលពាក់ព័ន្ធជាមួយវាគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងបើកចំហយ៉ាងខ្លាំង។
 ជាចុងក្រោយ អំពីបញ្ហាចំណត ខាងក្រោមនេះជាមតិយោបល់ដ៏មានប្រយោជន៍។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​យើង​ទទួល​បាន​មតិ​កែលម្អ​ច្រើន​នៅ​យប់​នេះ។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបានលើកឡើង រឿងតែមួយគត់ដែលខ្ញុំបានរៀនគឺថា ពួកយើងបានធ្វើកិច្ចការផ្ទះបន្ថែមទៀតលើរឿងនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនអាចយោងទៅលើគោលការណ៍ណែនាំបទប្បញ្ញត្តិជាក់លាក់ទាក់ទងនឹងការចតយានយន្តអគ្គិសនីបានទេ ប៉ុន្តែក្រុមរបស់យើងនឹងអាចយោងទៅវានៅពេលក្រោយដែលយើងជួបគ្នា។</p>

 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើអ្នកនៅក្នុងទស្សនិកជនចង់និយាយអំពីប្រធានបទវិស្វកម្មសំណង់ស៊ីវិល អ្នកអាចលើកដៃរបស់អ្នកដើម្បីពង្រីក បើកកាមេរ៉ារបស់អ្នក ហើយលើកដៃរបស់អ្នក អ្នកអាចសរសេរអ្វីមួយដូចនេះ។

 តាមពិតទៅ ខ្ញុំ​មាន​មតិ​ច្រើន ហើយ​មាន​លេខ​និង​សំណួរ​ជាច្រើន​។
 ខ្ញុំព្យាយាមរៀបចំឱ្យបានច្រើនតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 សម្រាប់ការចាប់ផ្តើម, ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំអាចជៀសវាងការទាំងអស់នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងរឿងមួយ ឬពីរអំពីចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងចាប់ផ្តើមនៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមានចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 តាមពិតវានៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃ Fellsway ។
 ដូច្នេះឥឡូវនេះ ក្មេងៗជាមូលដ្ឋានត្រូវទៅកន្លែងដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នៅ ហើយដើររហូតដល់ពួកគេឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ Fells ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ជា​ផ្លូវ​ល្អ។
 តាមពិតទៅ ឆ្លងកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវពីឃ្លាំងនៅលើផ្លូវ Fells Way គឺជាកន្លែងដែលក្មេងៗកំពុងរង់ចាំ។
 មានចំណតឡានក្រុងមួយទៀតនៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃ Myrtle ។
 ដោយសារតែម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាឧស្សាហកម្មមែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ គេ​មិន​នាំ​កូន​មក​ទី​នេះ​ទេ។
 តាមអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់ វានៅកាច់ជ្រុងផ្លូវ Myrtle និង Spring ប្រសិនបើវាអាចជួយបាន។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបើកឡានទៅទីនោះ។
 មតិមួយចំនួន។
 ជាដំបូង សូមអរគុណដល់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល និងជាការពិតណាស់ ដេវីត គ្រុប។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាស្គាល់ Pat ។
 វាជាវគ្គដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំសូមកោតសរសើរចំពោះពេលវេលា។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងមួយដែលត្រូវចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងមតិយោបល់៖
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាការយល់ច្រលំបន្តិច អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថា ជាពិសេសនៅដើមដំបូងនៃគម្រោង យើងបាននិយាយអំពីអ្វីដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នឹងមានរូបរាង អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងបានព្យាយាមប្តូរទិសចរាចរណ៍ ហើយយប់នេះខ្ញុំបានលឺថា អាសយដ្ឋានអចលនទ្រព្យនឹងស្ថិតនៅក្នុង Myrtle។
 ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំជឿថាមនុស្សនឹងដើរកាត់ Myrtle នៅពេលនេះ ហើយពិតជាប្រើច្រកចូល Fellsway នៅពេលចាំបាច់ ដែលវាពិបាកបន្តិច។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្តងទៀត នេះគ្រាន់តែជាមតិយោបល់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បាន​ឮ​អ្វី​ដែល​ខុស​ពី​យប់​នេះ​។
 ផ្នែកផ្សេងទៀតគឺថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងដើម្បីពង្រីកផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ធំ​បំផុត​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ច្បាស់​នោះ​គឺ​ថា​បើ​យើង​មិន​រើ​បង្គោល​ទេ អ្នក​ដែល​រស់​នៅ​តាម​ផ្លូវ​នោះ​នឹង​កត់​សម្គាល់​ឃើញ
 អស្ចារ្យខ្លះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​ច្រើន​ជាង​អ្វី​ដែល​បាន​បង្ហាញ​ក្នុង​រូបភាព​នេះ ហើយ​នោះ​ជា​វិធី​ល្អ​បំផុត​ក្នុង​ការ​ដាក់​វា។
 ដូច្នេះ ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​គុណ​ថា បើ​សសរ​មិន​រើ​ចូល​គ្នា​ទេ ផ្លូវ​ក៏​មិន​ទូលាយ​ដែរ។
 ច្បាស់ណាស់ ចំនុចប្រសព្វរវាង Fellsway និង Bernal មិនអាចពង្រីកបានទេ ដូចដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សានៅក្នុងបញ្ហានេះ និងនៅលើអចលនទ្រព្យ Walsh ។
 មិនមានដំណោះស្រាយពិតប្រាកដទេ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ការសង្កេតមួយទៀតគឺថា ខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តចំនួនកន្លែងចតរថយន្តដែលក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis Group កំពុងស្នើសុំ។
 ផងដែរ សួនឆ្កែគឺជាកង្វល់ចម្បងពីររបស់ខ្ញុំ គឺសម្រាប់តែកំណត់ត្រាប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 មិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែមនៅក្នុងតំបន់នេះទេ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 អំឡុងពេលមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិល មនុស្សប្រកួតប្រជែងគ្នាដើម្បីលំហរ ដូចអ្វីដែលពួកគេបានធ្វើនៅភាគនិរតី ជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំរស់នៅផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​ដូច​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​ធ្វើ​បែប​នោះ​ទាល់​តែ​សោះ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 វាក៏មានលទ្ធភាពដែលសត្វឆ្កែ 289 ក្បាលត្រូវបាននាំយកមកក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ខណៈពេលដែលខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះទីធ្លាបៃតង ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាសំខាន់ជាងក្នុងការផ្តោតលើកន្លែងសម្រាប់សត្វឆ្កែជាជាងសួនកុមារ ឬប្រភេទសួនកម្សាន្តផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា វា​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​ការ​ពេញ​និយម។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាពេញចិត្តក្នុងការវេចខ្ចប់នៅពេលចាំបាច់។
 មិនមានការលេចធ្លាយទេហើយខ្ញុំត្រូវចាកចេញពីយានដ្ឋានជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃ។
 នេះ​ជា​មតិ និង​ចម្ងល់​របស់​ខ្ញុំ ដើម្បី​កុំ​ឲ្យ​ខាត​ពេល​យូរ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាបញ្ហារបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាខ្ញុំមិនដឹងច្រើនអំពីផ្លូវ Warren ។
 វាមិនបង្ហាញក្នុងរូបភាពទាំងនេះទេ។
 នេះគឺជាផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់។
 វាជាផ្លូវមួយផ្លូវនៅ Myrtle ត្រង់ចំនុចប្រសព្វ Amarans ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសំណួររបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ៖ តើមានអ្វីផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវពិចារណា?
 ផ្លូវបំបែកនេះមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ឥឡូវនេះវាមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ជាមួយ​នឹង Davis Group និង​សូម្បី​តែ​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល​គឺ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​តែ​ពិចារណា។
 ទាក់​ទង​នឹង​សន្តិសុខ សំណួរ​ទី​ពីរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​បញ្ជាក់​សម្រាប់​ផ្ទះ​ក្នុង​ក្រុង វា​មិន​ច្បាស់​ទេ។
 តើមានវគ្គខ្លះទេ?
 ដោយផ្ទាល់នៅលើ Myrtle ឬនៅសណ្ឋាគារ។
 សំណួរទីបីរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអំពីការចតរថយន្តសម្រាប់អគារទាំងអស់នៅខាងក្រៅយានដ្ឋាន ជាពិសេសកន្លែងផ្ទុកខាងក្រោយ។
 វាហាក់ដូចជាច្បាស់។
 តើឡានដឹកទំនិញអាចចូលបានទេ?
 តើ​ឡាន​ដឹក​ជញ្ជូន និង​ផ្លូវ​ជម្រាល​មិន​អី​ទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចដើរចុះពីលើជម្រាលភ្នំបានទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចទាញយកវាដោយសុវត្ថិភាពបានទេ?
 ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាបានរស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះនេះមួយរយៈ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរជារៀងរាល់ឆ្នាំបន្ទាប់ពីបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សានៅមហាវិទ្យាល័យ។
 ពេល​នោះ​ខ្ញុំ​ចាំ​ថា​ការ​អាច​ធ្វើ​ចលនា​បាន​គឺ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ប្រឈម។
 នៅក្នុងអគារមួយមានចំណតរថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​រថយន្ត​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​អាច​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​បាន​ទេ។
 កង្វល់ពិតរបស់ខ្ញុំចំពោះសំណួរគឺ៖ តើអ្នកបានពិចារណាកន្លែងទំនេរនៅក្នុងឡានដឹកទំនិញដែលមានផ្លូវជម្រាលទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ច្រើន​ណាស់។
 អរគុណច្រើន។

 យើង​គិត​ថា​មាន​កន្លែង​គ្រប់គ្រាន់​ដើម្បី​ដោះស្រាយ​លក្ខខណ្ឌ​នៃ​ការ​ធ្វើ​ដំណើរ​កំពូល​មួយ​ចំនួន។
 យើងកំពុងស៊ើបអង្កេតបញ្ហានេះ ហើយនឹងបន្តធ្វើការជាមួយក្រុមប្រតិបត្តិការរបស់យើង ដើម្បីយល់ពីស្ថានភាពនេះ។
 សម្រាប់​ផ្ទះ​ក្នុង​ក្រុង​ត្រូវ​បញ្ជាក់​ឱ្យ​ច្បាស់​ថា​ច្រក​ចូល​និង​ចេញ​ទាំងអស់​គឺ​នៅ​ក្រោម​ដី។
 មិនមានចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ឬផ្លូវចូលទៅកាន់ Myrtle Street ទេ។
 ការចូលទៅកាន់ទីតាំងនេះគឺតាមរយៈច្រកចូលខាងក្នុងនៅខាងក្រោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា ប្រសិន​បើ​អ្នក​ចង់​បាន​ព័ត៌មាន​ថ្មីៗ​នៅ Florence Street ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​ថា​គាត់​កំពុង​មើល។</p>

 នេះគឺជាសំណួរទាន់ពេលវេលា ដូច្នេះចម្លើយជាទូទៅគឺបាទ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​ការ​លើ​បញ្ហា​នោះ​នៅ​ពេល​នេះ ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដឹង​ថា​តើ Jeff មក​ពី​បេតា​នឹង​ធ្វើ​អត្ថាធិប្បាយ​ខ្លះ​នៅ​ពេល​បញ្ចប់​សវនាការ​ឬ​អត់ ប៉ុន្តែ​យើង​បាន​ទទួល​មតិ​កែលម្អ​ច្រើន​ពី​បេតា​អំពី​ចរាចរណ៍ ហើយ​យើង​កំពុង​មើល​វា។
 ជាផ្នែកមួយនៃរឿងនេះមានច្រើន។
 បានស្នើវិធានការកាត់បន្ថយដែលយើងគួរពិចារណា និងចំណុចមួយចំនួនទៀតដែលយើងគួរពិចារណា។
 បើគ្មានរបាយការណ៍នៅចំពោះមុខខ្ញុំទេ ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាផ្លូវ Lawrence នឹងមានទេ ប៉ុន្តែជារួម ខ្ញុំគិតថាចរាចរណ៍ក្នុងតំបន់ និងការបន្ធូរបន្ថយនៃតំបន់នេះត្រូវបានគេពិចារណាជាទូទៅ មិនមែនត្រឹមតែ sycamore ឬ amaranth នោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា Lawrence ប្រហែលជានៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំគួរតែពិនិត្យមើលម្តងទៀត ប៉ុន្តែចម្លើយខ្លីចំពោះសំណួររបស់អ្នកគឺបាទ។
 យើងនឹងបន្តធ្វើការជាមួយក្រុមរបស់យើង និងក្រុមត្រួតពិនិត្យមិត្តភ័ក្តិ ដើម្បីបង្កើតជម្រើសកាត់បន្ថយចរាចរណ៍សម្រាប់តំបន់នេះ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5941.353s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Christina បានទិញផ្ទះមួយនៅផ្លូវ 30 Myrtle ។
 ជាបឋម ខ្ញុំលើកយកបញ្ហាមួយចំនួនជាមួយក្រុមប្រឹក្សានេះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកបានពិភាក្សាជាមួយសង្គមស៊ីវិល។
 តើយើងបានជូនដំណឹងដល់អ្នករស់នៅ Amaranth Apartments អំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំទាំងនេះទេ?
 ព្រោះ​នៅ​គ្រប់​ទីកន្លែង​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ទៅ​គឺ​មិន​មាន​មតិ​សាធារណៈ​ក្នុង​ទិសដៅ​នេះ​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា ប្រសិនបើពួកគេនៅក្នុងប្រអប់សាកល្បង ពួកគេនឹងទទួលបានអ៊ីមែល សម្ភារៈផ្សព្វផ្សាយជាដើម ដើម្បីអាចស្តាប់សំឡេងរបស់ពួកគេ។
 បន្ទាប់មកទីពីរគឺ
 ថ្ងៃនេះ និងក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំមុនៗ យើងបានឮលោក Pat និយាយច្រើនអំពីក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងដែលនឹងគ្រប់គ្រងអចលនទ្រព្យ។
 សំណួរជាច្រើនត្រូវបានសួរ៖ អញ្ចឹងក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយ។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលនឹងពិចារណាចូលរួមកិច្ចប្រជុំមួយក្នុងចំណោមកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះបន្ទាប់ពី Davis សាងសង់អាគារនោះ
 អ្នកស្រុកមានអារម្មណ៍សុវត្ថិភាពអំពីអ្នកដែលជាម្ចាស់ និងគ្រប់គ្រងបទពិសោធន៍ប្រចាំថ្ងៃ របៀបដែលពួកគេមានគម្រោងគ្រប់គ្រងអ្វីៗដូចជាឡានដឹកទំនិញ របៀបដែលពួកគេគ្រប់គ្រងគំនូរណាមួយដែលអាចលេចឡើងនៅលើការងារសិល្បៈ ឬសួនកុមារ និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេនឹងសម្អាតវា។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ច្រានចោល​នេះ​ជា​ការ​ណែនាំ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​បញ្ចេញ​យោបល់​លើ​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​បាន​វិភាគ​ខាង​លើ។
 ចំពោះកន្លែងចតរថយន្ត ខ្ញុំបានលឺថាឥឡូវនេះមានចំណត 300 ហ្វីតនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកយល់ នៅពេលអ្នកនិយាយជាមួយយើង ហើយប្រាប់យើង ចូរនិយាយថា អ្នកបង្កើនវាដល់ 370 អ្នកមិនបង្កើនចំនួនចំណតនៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ទេ។
 រវាងផ្លូវ Amaranth និងផ្លូវ Myrtle,
 អ្នកមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែម។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តទៀតទេនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ក្នុងនាមជាអ្នករស់នៅ Myrtle Street ខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភយ៉ាងខ្លាំងអំពីពេលដែលការភ្ជួររាស់នឹងត្រូវបញ្ចប់ ហើយនៅពេលណាដែលនឹងមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិលធ្លាក់ ព្រោះឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំត្រូវចតនៅ Amaranth ។
 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅតែម្នាក់ឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចូលចិត្ត​គំនិត​មក​ផ្ទះ​យប់​ជ្រៅ ហើយ​ឃើញ​មនុស្ស​ចូល​ចត​នៅ Myrtle ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចត​នៅ​ជ្រុង​ម្ខាង។
 ញ៉ាំ amaranth ហើយដើរទៅផ្ទះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវានឹងកើតឡើង ដោយសារតែក្រុមហ៊ុនទាំងអស់នេះ និងខុនដូប្រណិតៗទាំងអស់នេះ ដែលគិតថ្លៃអ្នកស្នាក់នៅសម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្ត ពួកគេនឹងដឹងថា Amaranth និង Myrtle គឺមិនគិតថ្លៃទេ ហើយពួកគេនឹងជំនួសកន្លែងរបស់យើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឱ្យអ្នកដឹងថា គម្រោងកែលម្អ $130,000 ទៅ $170,000 ដែលអ្នកបានស្នើសម្រាប់ Myrtle Street គឺពិតជាក្លែងក្លាយ ហើយអ្នកដឹងថាវា។
 ទីបំផុត ខ្ញុំពិតជាគិតថាយើងកំពុងចាប់ផ្តើមទៅកាន់កន្លែងដែលសំឡេងរបស់មនុស្សត្រូវបានឮ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានការខកចិត្តនៅពេលឮថាយើងមិនបានបង្វែរចរាចរណ៍ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដូច Allison ទើបនឹងនិយាយ។
 Cliff ក៏​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ថា​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​ចុង​ក្រោយ​នេះ​យើង​បាន​និយាយ​ថា​អ្នក​ស្រុក​នឹង​មិន​អាច​ធ្វើ​បាន​
 ចូលយានដ្ឋានពីផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 វា​ជា​ពពុះ​ដែល​ហូរ​ចូល និង​ចេញ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បង្ហាញពីការខកចិត្តរបស់ខ្ញុំ ដោយសារតែខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានឮត្រូវបានដកចេញពីខ្ញុំក្នុងការហៅទូរស័ព្ទពិសេសនេះ។

 ដូច្នេះអំពីប្រធានបទនេះ។

 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដឹង​ថា តើ​បេក្ខជន​មាន​ឆន្ទៈ​និយាយ​ពី​វា​ឬ​អត់​ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាអ្នកបានលើកឡើងពីមូលហេតុ។
 ដូច្នេះ យើងក៏នឹងទទួលបានមតិកែលម្អនៅក្នុងកំណែបែតាផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំសុំទោស។
 ហើមខួរក្បាល។
 បន្ទាប់មក វាបានធ្លាក់ព្រិល។
 អញ្ចឹង យើងមិនទាន់បានពិភាក្សាអំពីព្រិលនៅឡើយទេ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗដូចជាការដកព្រិលចេញ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមានចំណតរថយន្តគ្របដណ្តប់សម្រាប់អ្នករស់នៅ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថា វានឹងមានប្រយោជន៍សម្រាប់គណៈកម្មាធិការដើម្បីដឹងឥឡូវនេះ ឬនៅពេលសវនាការនាពេលអនាគតអំពីផែនការរបស់ពួកគេសម្រាប់ព្រឹត្តិការណ៍ព្រិល។
 ហើយបន្ទាប់មកគាត់បានបាញ់ផងដែរ។

 វាជាអាជីវកម្ម និងការគ្រប់គ្រង។
 អូបាទ។
 នៅក្នុង 40B ចុងក្រោយ យើងបានទទួលព័ត៌មានលម្អិតមួយចំនួនអំពីផែនការប្រតិបត្តិការ និងការគ្រប់គ្រងរបស់អគារ។

 ខ្ញុំទទួលបានវា។
 ដូច្នេះ គ្រីស្ទីណា ដើរថយក្រោយកន្លះជំហាន។
 ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​ចម្លើយ​មួយ​ចំនួន ចេតនា​គឺ​មិន​ផ្តល់​ចម្លើយ​ផ្ទាល់។

 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ ជាមួយនឹងការដកព្រិលចេញ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវានឹងក្លាយជាករណីមួយ ដោយផ្អែកលើបរិមាណព្រិល។

 នេះនឹងជាការវិភាគករណីនីមួយៗ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំចង់សង្ខេប,
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំអាចមើលកំណត់ត្រា និងស្វែងរកអ្វីដែលអ្នកដាក់ពាក្យមុន 40B បានផ្តល់ យើងអាចធ្វើកិច្ចការផ្ទះខ្លះ ហើយព្យាយាមផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានអំពីរបៀបដែលអគារនេះត្រូវបានដំណើរការ ដើម្បីទទួលបានព័ត៌មានបន្ថែម។
 ខ្ញុំមិនចង់ទេ។
 កុំឱ្យមនុស្សគិតថាយើងមិនមានតម្លាភាពអំពីវា។
 សង្ឃឹមថា នេះឆ្លើយយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ផ្នែកនៃសំណួរ។

 那么，晚安。
 回到那个和婴儿组。
 开展交通影响评估研究。
 为了开始这个过程，我们进行了实地考察，观察交通状况，审查了 Van Essen Associates 影响研究、Polar Engineering 项目计划，并审查了所有交通方式，不仅包括交通，还包括行人、自行车和公共交通。
 我们与土建工程也有一些重叠，因此您可以在场地规划、内部循环、装载和交付以及运输需求管理计划中看到一些内容。
 总体而言，交通研究是按照我们现有的国家和行业专业标准进行的，是一份综合报告。
 因此，我将总结我们的评论。
 有些评论要求提供更多信息，要求澄清。
 我们更多地谈论外部缺陷以及可能的改进。
 感谢您的介绍。
 亲爱的玩家，我认为我们提出的一些意见在今天的演示中得到了回答。
 所以我谢谢你。
 也许这有点多余。
 我们讨论了一些主题，所以这或多或少是按照流量影响研究的顺序进行的。
 因此，在研究区域内，对整个区域的交叉口进行了综合评估。
 这有点难以阅读。
 我想说的是，第一个正在考虑纳入的十字路口是您注意到的唯一一个未包括在内的十字路口，即第四街。
 嗯，这里看起来围栏很围，所以标有人行横道。
 所以那将是唯一的地方。
 我想你可以考虑看看。
 因此，在现有条件下，采集1月11日的流量。
 小马丁·路德·金
 假期是15号。
 我只是想得到一些答案，以及周一假期是否会对周四的计数产生任何预期影响。
 然后收集并汇总流量。
 我们想了解更多有关该网站现有使用所产生的行程的信息。
 所以，这里只是有关该地区行人现有状况的一些信息。
 我们自己根据刚刚写下的观察结果做了一个清单。
 中环街和春街交叉口没有行人信号灯，该路口是正在研究的交叉路口。
 该地区的几个十字路口没有可检测的人行横道和警告牌，而这些必须符合 ADA 标准，其中包括 Myrtle、Amaranth 和 Lawrence 街道的十字路口。
 这些只是一些观察和笔记。
 安全方面，该地区有多个路口曾发生过安全事故。
 正如我刚才提到的，Central 和 Spring 有 13 次失败。
 最重要的是，事故发生率超过了马萨诸塞州交通部第 4 区的平均水平和州平均水平，达到了令人担忧的程度。
 Fellsway 和 Riverside 五年内发生了 31 起事故。
 MassDOT 将其认定为高事故群体，使其有资格接受 2019 年进行的高速公路安全审计，并被认定为存在安全问题。
 Fellsway Central 和 Medford Street 五年内发生了 23 起事故。
 我们只是想更多地了解该地区发生的行人和自行车事故类型。
 停车，我们询问在现有条件下，是否有关于今天该地点街道和停车场占用情况的信息，您知道，这些空间在相邻街道和该地点本身占用的百分比，了解这些信息会很有用。
 未来的情况，所以我先讲一下出行生成和出行分配归因。
 因此，预计该项目将在工作日上午和下午高峰时段产生约 90 趟车次。
 我们认为这是一个合理的数字。
 我们希望获得更多关于卡车出行次数的信息，包括这个数字。
 行人、自行车和公共交通出行。
 因此，如果能够对它们进行分解和识别，将会很有帮助。
 计算中使用了未来 5% 的自行车比例。
 我们认为它可能有点高。
 我认为全市 Medford 模式的总体比例为 1%。
 所以我想知道如果计算时假设从自行车模式分裂到较低模式，这会对车辆的出行产生多大影响？
 Fells Way 上的许多行程都会在中央大街掉头返回该地点。
 我想知道是否有其他交通可以使用的替代路线，因为认识到此行进中存在一些延误和拥堵，尤其是在下午，例如河滨大道，左转进入河滨，甚至使用 I-93 作为替代路线。
 其中一些交通是否会使用 I-93 而不是 Fells Way？
 嗯，报告中有一个表格确定了该项目的流量增加情况，但事实并非如此。
 识别现场附近的道路，例如 Fellsway、Myrtle、Pinker、Lawrence 和 Spring。
 因此，我想量化有关该地点附近道路交通量增加的信息。
 一个已经被谈论了一点的停车项目，停车比例为1.14。
 我们只是想确保这个数字是正确且足够的，可以满足该地点的预期停车需求。
 你知道，请记住，我们希望确保我们做的每件事都是正确的。
 因此，如果有足够的停车位，就不会溢出到邻近的社区和道路。
 我们看到前面有 4 个访客空间，即送货区。
 我们认为它可能有点低。
 嗯，我们还想更多地了解游客空间本身。
 不仅是短期送货，而且如果人们拜访该综合体的居民，他们会在哪里停车，如果他们这样做几个小时？
 如果他们停车很长时间或停车过夜。
 所以一些关于这是如何运作的讨论。
 访客空间将由网站运营和管理。
 关于拟议的停车位，新的Amaranth停车位，只是这些停车位的意图，我知道它们是向公众开放的，但它们应该供现场访客使用吗？
 这些空间的用途是什么？
 进行了交叉口通行能力分析。
 交通工程师使用所谓的交叉口服务级别。
 它类似于成绩单，其中 A，表示条件极佳，几乎没有延误或拥堵。
 E和F不足。
 F 是最差的，或者因巨大的延迟、拥塞和排队而失败。
 所以，你知道，我们在那里看到了 Fellsway 上的拥堵情况，大部分是早上向南行，下午向北行。
 Fellsway、Central 以及 Fellsway 和 Riverside 交叉口目前以 F 服务级别运行，这意味着它们有一个或多个交通通常无法达到 F 服务级别。
 而项目未来的非施工条件和施工条件又使这些条件更加恶化。
 该项目将导致中环 Fellsway 的交通显着增加，而中央大道东行通道的延误将会增加。
 其中一些问题已经得到解决。
 就在今天晚上，我看到了这里右上角的空间。
 我想我们在仓库的 A 区。
 感谢您提供这个。
 此外，还可以进入建筑物和会场周围的空间，今晚也展示了这一点，所以这很棒。
 这里显示了与未来自行车道的联系。
 我想这一切都已经解决了。
 只是对街道空间、默特尔街和阿默斯特的新空间进行澄清。
 我知道它们向公众开放，但谁对这些空间拥有管辖权？
 它们真的是城市还是属于私人管辖？
 因此，对这些空间进行更多澄清。
 就其本身而言，我们谈论的是场地规划中更广阔的空间，即流通道路的宽度。
 抱歉，必须提供路边停车位。
 讨论居民和游客的自行车停放只是为了明确车位数量。
 现场必须标明储雪区域。
 我知道有人在谈论默特尔街，但我还需要知道那里的雪将储存在哪里。
 这就是制定运输需求管理计划的原因。
 这些计划的目标是减少汽车出行次数，尤其是单人车辆。
 我们还确定了该计划需要考虑的其他一些领域或措施。
 您可能早些时候已经谈到过这一点。
 停车费与停车费是分开的吗？
 今晚我没有听到，但也许会有更多的讨论。
 我知道对于网站来说最好的选择是需要权衡的。
 您可以考虑向居民提供交通补贴或蓝色自行车订阅，作为一项 TDM 措施。
 你展示了蓝色的自行车站，所以照顾好它真是太好了。
 并且您应该考虑现场是否有汽车共享空间，例如汽车共享拉链车。
 那么项目提出的外部改进，我们稍微谈了一下公交候车区。
 MBTA 巴士站附近的现有停车位将进行重新配置和景观美化，如今晚向我们展示的那样，以及新的停车位、扩大 Amaranth 街和 Myrtle 街的通行权，或者更好的是街道和人行道停车位。
 因此，我们确定了一些其他的措施，只是为了考虑和改进。
 这些大多是外部地点。
 其中许多位于我提到的十字路口，存在操作或安全缺陷。
 第一个是Fellsway Riverside Avenue。
 因此，我提到，已识别出在服务级别 F 上运行的高崩溃集群的交叉点。此次交通安全审计确定了对策和安全对策的改进，包括交通信号优化、增强左转阶段和通行时间。
 所以这些事情是可以考虑的。
 Avenida Central 和 Rua Primavera 的事故发生率很高。
 可以考虑升级旧的信号设备并安装现有的行人标志。
 Fellsway、Central 和 Medford Street 在两个高峰时段再次在 F 级服务条件下运行，可以看到并提供信号定时优化。
 北行左转车道多次被堵塞，特别是在晚高峰期间，因此车辆在车道畅通之前无法进入该车道。
 是否有可能拓宽 Fells Way 北行左转车道？
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle Street 相连，因此 Fellsway 有一条长长的人行横道。
 我们知道，交通流量大，车速高，可以考虑使用矩形快闪灯，这是对行人的安全措施，也能提高驾驶员的安全意识。
 我们只是想评估提供中间间隔是否可行，无论是在红绿灯处还是向北左转处。
 我知道这样做有利有弊，但这样做是否有足够的好处来考虑这种改变？</p>

 វឌ្ឍនភាពនៃគម្រោងនឹងបង្ហាញយ៉ាងច្បាស់ពីកន្លែងដែលអ្នករស់នៅ អ្នកទស្សនា និងបុគ្គលិកដឹកជញ្ជូននឹងចូល និងត្រឡប់ទៅទីតាំងវិញ។
 ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវនៅ Amherst ភាគខាងត្បូងនៃផ្លូវ Myrtle ស្ថិតក្នុងស្ថានភាពមិនល្អ។
 ដូច្នេះ ការ​ជួសជុល​ផ្លូវ​នេះ​គួរតែ​ចាត់ទុកជា​ផ្នែក​មួយ​នៃ​គម្រោង​។

 ការអត្ថាធិប្បាយចុងក្រោយគឺថាដោយសារតែការផ្លាស់ប្តូរធម្មជាតិនៃគម្រោង ការអនុញ្ញាតសាងសង់ត្រូវបានទាមទារដើម្បីបញ្ចូល DCR ។
 ការអនុញ្ញាត DCR តម្រូវឱ្យចូល និងចេញពី Fellsway ។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: បាទ អាស្រ័យលើរបៀបដែលទីក្រុងចង់កំណត់អាទិភាពផ្លូវនៅក្នុងយុត្តាធិការនោះ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ខុស​គ្នា​បន្តិច។
 ផ្លូវប្រសព្វដែលត្រូវបានគ្រប់គ្រងទាំងស្រុងដោយទីក្រុងគឺងាយស្រួលក្នុងការដោះស្រាយ។
 ដូច្នេះ អ្នកដឹងទេ កណ្តាល និងនិទាឃរដូវ ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹង។
 និងការពន្យារពេលប្រតិបត្តិការ និងការកកស្ទះក៏ប៉ះពាល់ដល់សុវត្ថិភាពផងដែរ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាទីក្រុងគួរតែកំណត់អាទិភាពដោយផ្អែកលើការកែលម្អដែលពួកគេមានអារម្មណ៍ថាសមហេតុផល និងទាក់ទងនឹងគម្រោង។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: បាទ ខ្ញុំ​បន្ទាប់។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាឆ្ងល់ថាតើចរាចរណ៍ពីរផ្លូវនេះសមហេតុផលនៅច្រកចូល Myrtle Street ដែរឬទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ឮ​ពី​កង្វល់​របស់​ប្រជាជន។
 ការ​កំណត់​រចនាសម្ព័ន្ធ​បច្ចុប្បន្ន​មាន​ការ​ធ្វើ​ដំណើរ​កាន់​តែ​ច្រើន ខណៈ​ដែល​គេ​យល់​ថា​ត្រូវ​បាន​យក​ចិត្ត​ទុក​ដាក់​យ៉ាង​ខ្លាំង​ដើម្បី​ជៀស​វាង​បញ្ហា​នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ថានេះចាំបាច់ត្រូវបើកដើម្បីប្រើច្រកចេញសង្គ្រោះបន្ទាន់។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ព័ត៌មាន​ដែល​ផ្តល់​ឲ្យ​មិន​បាន​ប្រាប់​ខ្ញុំ​ច្បាស់​ថា​តើ​បញ្ហា​នេះ​នឹង​ធ្វើ​ឲ្យ​សហគមន៍​មាន​បញ្ហា​កម្រិត​ណា​ទេ។
 បាទ មានការដឹកជញ្ជូន។
 ប្រសិនបើវាត្រូវបានបិទមួយផ្លូវ អ្នកប្រហែលជាត្រូវធ្វើដំណើរតាមផ្លូវមួយត្រឡប់ទៅ Myrtle វិញ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាដើម្បីសមហេតុផលនោះ ខ្ញុំពិតជាយល់ពីការពិចារណាលើការរចនា ប៉ុន្តែហាក់ដូចជាមានហានិភ័យនៅទីនេះ ដែលសម្រាប់ចរាចរណ៍ពីរផ្លូវ វាដូចជាការបើករបាំង ដែលជាជំហានថយក្រោយ។
 ព្យាយាមបន្ធូរបន្ថយការកកស្ទះចរាចរណ៍តាមទស្សនៈផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ខ្ញុំចង់ស្តាប់គំនិតរបស់អ្នកអំពីរឿងនេះ Jeff ។
 ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកមានពេលដើម្បីពិនិត្យមើលវាទាំងស្រុង ហើយសុខចិត្តចែករំលែកគំនិត និងយោបល់របស់អ្នកអំពីវា ឬប្រសិនបើអ្នកត្រូវការគិតបន្ថែមអំពីវា ប៉ុន្តែចង់ដឹងបន្ថែម។</p>

 ដូច្នេះអ្នកត្រូវគិតថាតើដំណើរកម្សាន្តទាំងនោះនឹងទៅជាយ៉ាងណា និងកន្លែងដែលពួកគេនឹងទៅ អ្នកដឹងថាតើពួកគេនឹងបញ្ចប់នៅ Myrtle ឬអ្នកដឹងថាតើពួកគេនឹងទៅ Fellsway ដែរឬទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​សំណួរ​ល្អ​។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ប្រហែលជាយើងត្រូវវាយតម្លៃបន្ថែមទៀត រួមបញ្ចូលគ្នារវាង Scott និង Varness ហើយគិតអំពីរឿងនេះ ហើយនោះ
 អ្នកដឹងទេ តើផលប៉ះពាល់អាចទៅជាយ៉ាងណា ប្រសិនបើវាជាផ្លូវមួយ ជំនួសឱ្យផ្លូវពីរ។
 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាប្រធានបទដ៏ល្អ។

 អ្នកដឹងទេនៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ផ្លូវបំបែកនៅ Fellsway និង Myrtle មិនមានភ្លើងចរាចរណ៍ ឬឧបករណ៍សុវត្ថិភាពសម្រាប់អ្នកថ្មើរជើងណាមួយក្រៅពីផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់ និងមធ្យមតូចមួយ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ វាច្បាស់ជាមើលទៅបែបនោះ។
 បាទ យើងនឹងមានអ្នករស់នៅកាន់តែច្រើននៅជ្រុងនេះ។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ អ្វីដែលសំខាន់បំផុតនោះគឺថាមានអ្វីមួយនៅចំនុចប្រសព្វនេះ។

 ដូច្នេះ អ្នកដឹងទេ អ្នកបានគិតអំពីវា។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: បាទ/ចាស នៅក្នុងស្លាយមួយរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំបាននិយាយអំពីការមើលពន្លឺខាងមុខចតុកោណ។
 នេះគឺជាសញ្ញាប៊ូតុងរុញសម្រាប់អ្នកថ្មើរជើង។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ផ្លូវ​ប្រសព្វ​ត្រូវ​ការ​ការ​កែ​លម្អ ជាពិសេស​ដោយសារ​មាន​ចំណត​រថយន្ត​ក្រុង​នៅ​សងខាង។
 ពេល​ខ្ញុំ​នៅ​ទីនោះ ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ឃើញ​មនុស្ស​ចេញ​ពី​ឡាន ហើយ​ដើរ​ឆ្លង​ផ្លូវ។

 រឿងល្អអំពីចំណតឡានក្រុងទាំងសងខាង។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើយើងមានអ្នកស្រុកធ្វើដំណើរតាមឡានក្រុង ពួកគេនឹងទំនងជាត្រូវបានគេនាំទៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃផ្លូវ Fells Way។
 ហើយរឿងមួយទៀត ខ្ញុំដឹងថា កត្តាមួយចំនួន ជាទូទៅពិបាកនឹងផ្លាស់ប្តូរណាស់ ពួកគេពិតជាមានមែន។

 ខ្ញុំគិតថាជាក់ស្តែងការឆ្លងកាត់ជាមួយ Amaranth, Lawrence, Myrtle គឺពិតជាគន្លឹះ។
 ខ្ញុំកំពុងប្រាប់អ្នកនៅពេលនេះ ខ្ញុំរស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះមួយនៅផ្លូវ Fells ក្នុងទីក្រុង Myrtle ហើយខ្ញុំត្រូវមើលច្រើនដងក្នុងមួយថ្ងៃ ដោយសារមាននរណាម្នាក់កំពុងបត់ជ្រុង ហើយចុះទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ។

 ប៉ុន្តែគាត់ពិតជាត្រូវទៅ Central, Kendall, Myrtle ដើម្បីទៅផ្ទះរបស់យើង បន្ទាប់មកទៅ Amarans ដើម្បីឆ្លងកាត់ការផ្ទេរនេះ។
 យើង​ត្រឡប់​មក​វិញ​នៅ​ផ្លូវ Fells ដើម្បី​ទៅ​ផ្ទះ។

 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ចង្អុលបង្ហាញថា តាមពិតការកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ខ្ញុំគិតថាលេខកូដ DCR ថ្មី ខ្ញុំគិតថាពួកគេត្រូវតែមើល ព្រោះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមានឡានធំនៅ Central និង Fellsway អ្នកក៏មិនអាចបត់ដែរ។

 ដូច្នេះ នេះ​មិន​ពាក់ព័ន្ធ​នឹង​ការពិត​ទេ បើ​មិន​ដូច្នេះ​ទេ​អ្នក​នឹង​បាន​ឮ
 ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលនឹងត្រូវកំណត់ពេលកិច្ចប្រជុំពិសេសមួយទៀត។
 បន្ទាប់មកនៅថ្ងៃទី 3 ខែមេសា ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាបានទទួលពាក្យសុំ និងស្នើសុំសវនាការនៅផ្លូវ Mystic ។
 40B, HAC ត្រឡប់ទៅក្រុមប្រឹក្សាវិញ។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងត្រូវការទស្សនិកជនថ្មីរៀងរាល់ 30 ថ្ងៃម្តង។
 ពេលខ្លះយើងត្រូវការវាដោយសារតែតម្រូវការជូនដំណឹង។
 ជាទូទៅសប្តាហ៍នៃថ្ងៃទី 29 ខែមេសា។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ពិនិត្យ​កាលបរិច្ឆេទ​ជាមួយ​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សា​នៃ​បេក្ខជន​ទាំង​ពីរ៖ ថ្ងៃទី ៣០ ខែ​មេសា និង​ថ្ងៃ​ទី ២ ខែ​ឧសភា។
 នេះ​នឹង​ជា​ការ​ប្រជុំ​ខ្លី​មួយ ហើយ​យើង​នឹង​មិន​ឮ​ទីបន្ទាល់​ទេ។
 ចូរយើងឆ្លងកាត់ជំហាននីតិវិធីមួយចំនួន ហើយបន្តទៅមុខទៀត។
 យើងអាចស្នើឱ្យបេក្ខជនណែនាំខ្លួន។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​ទទួល​បាន​ការ​ឆ្លើយ​តប ហើយ​វា​ហាក់​ដូច​ជា​មាន​ចន្លោះ​ពី​ថ្ងៃ​ទី ៤ ដល់​ទី ៣០។
 ដូច្នេះថ្ងៃទី 4 ដល់ថ្ងៃទី 30 នឹងក្លាយជាកាលបរិច្ឆេទសម្រាប់កិច្ចប្រជុំពិសេសនេះ។
 ធាតុតែមួយគត់នៅក្នុងរបៀបវារៈនឹងក្លាយជាករណី។
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបាននិយាយ នេះនឹងជាការប្រជុំតាមនីតិវិធី។
 ដូច្នេះ ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាក្រុងគួរតែពិចារណាផ្តល់សិទ្ធិឱ្យទីក្រុងជួលអ្នកប្រឹក្សាយោបល់ពីមិត្តភ័ក្តិ។
 ខ្ញុំមានន័យថា ការនិយាយអំពីទីប្រឹក្សា 40B ហើយជ្រើសរើសកាលបរិច្ឆេទដំណោះស្រាយសម្រាប់ការនេះនឹងអនុញ្ញាតឱ្យមានពេលវេលាដើម្បីជួលអ្នកប្រឹក្សាទាំងនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះបាទ។
 ខ្ញុំប៉ាន់ស្មានថាយើងអាចធ្វើវាបានក្នុងរយៈពេល 30 នាទី ឬតិចជាងនេះ។
 គ្មានអ្វីត្រូវបានសន្យាទេប៉ុន្តែកាលបរិច្ឆេទគឺថ្ងៃអង្គារទី 30 ខែមេសាវេលាម៉ោង 6:30 ល្ងាច។
