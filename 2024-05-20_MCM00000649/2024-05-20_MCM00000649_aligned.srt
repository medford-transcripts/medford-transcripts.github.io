1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:03,893
Hello, and welcome to this special meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,955
Recording stopped.

3
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:07,476
And then we're going to get started.

4
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:10,377
Recording in progress.

5
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,018
Jamie Thompson?

6
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:13,299
Present.

7
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,521
Jim Tarani?

8
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:17,882
Present.

9
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:21,704
Krista Tiavetta?

10
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:23,425
Present.

11
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:26,307
Andrea LaRue?

12
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:28,008
Present.

13
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,757
Is that the less present.

14
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:40,402
Mary Lee, I think is is absent, but plans to join us.

15
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:43,765
I don't see Mary Mike held their present.

16
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:46,847
So, we have 6 present.

17
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,969
So, we'll get started.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,190
Dennis, can you please kick us off?

19
00:00:53,267 --> 00:01:01,508
On March 29, 2023, Governor Haley signed into law a supplemental budget bill which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the Open Meeting Law to March 31, 2025.

20
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:12,290
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at the meeting location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:20,012
The language does not name substantive changes to the Open Meeting Law other than extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2025.

22
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:34,318
Thank you, and can you read the first matter, please?

23
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:37,999
970 Felsway, case number 40B-2023-01, continuing from March 26.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:53,006
The resumption of consideration of the petition of DIV Felsway LLC of the Davis Companies for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40B, for multifamily six-story apartment development located in approximately 3.4 acres of land at 970 Felsway, property ID 7-02-10.

25
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,264
This proposal will be developed as an approximately 289 units consisting of 278 units multifamily housing and 11 townhomes.

26
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:08,150
With 73, 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low or moderate income households.

27
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,951
All right, thank you, Dennis.

28
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:25,180
So folks, if you're unfamiliar with the comprehensive permit process, this is a multi-session hearing over the course of the past, I guess, five months.

29
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,202
We have been

30
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:31,817
hearing various matters relating to this case.

31
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:42,983
The focus agenda for this evening is civil engineering as well as peer review of the traffic study.

32
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,925
And so yeah, that's the intention for today.

33
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,967
We will be taking public comment on those matters.

34
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:55,750
I see we have Mr. Pat Noon for the applicant.

35
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,771
So please go ahead.

36
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,131
Welcome.

37
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:01,417
Hi, everybody.

38
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,618
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

39
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,880
Yes, so we are here.

40
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,803
We will be presenting and providing an update specifically on our civil design.

41
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:17,544
Members of our team are here.

42
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:21,126
I will ask Steve Majorano if he can

43
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:27,493
share the screen and he will be the slide master for this evening.

44
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:41,228
I will give a bit of a kickoff here just with an update from where we are from our last hearing and set the table for Steve and the team to take it over.

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,540
Thank you.

46
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:55,873
So jumping in, so a bit of an update just in terms of where we are from our previous hearing a few weeks ago.

47
00:03:57,214 --> 00:04:04,181
We have on the peer review front moved forward in several respects.

48
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:24,508
Mr. Chair, as you mentioned on the traffic, we received comments from Beda last week on the transportation impact analysis and are in the process of reviewing and digesting those and preparing formal responses.

49
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,409
We have Scott Thornton on the call this evening.

50
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:33,490
The response to those comments is not a part of this formal presentation.

51
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,651
but I see that members of the beta team are here and they may be able to speak to the comments directly themselves.

52
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:52,654
But we have received them and are in the process of reviewing and we'll be coordinating a follow-up peer review session with that team to discuss once we've had the chance to fully digest them.

53
00:04:54,074 --> 00:05:00,556
On the architectural side of things, we were given Cliff's comments.

54
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:05,034
Cliff Bowmer's comments from Davis Square Architects.

55
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:12,258
We were given his comments and have been in the process of reviewing those and preparing responses.

56
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,742
And we are coordinating a follow-up peer review session with Cliff for next week.

57
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:23,665
And we'll be prepared to go through his comments and continue to

58
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:33,173
incorporate them and work with him ahead of the ensuing hearings where we will be able to review and present on architecture again.

59
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:39,919
And then from a civil perspective, we received

60
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,730
a note from BEDA continuing to work through.

61
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:52,556
We have not formally received their comments yet, so this evening is not representative of peer review feedback.

62
00:05:53,576 --> 00:06:02,743
At this point, when we do get comments, depending on the level of comments and need to make any adjustments or address

63
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:19,762
We will certainly do that as soon as we get them and I won't speak again for the beta team that is on the call, but just from our perspective that is where we sit at the moment and look forward to the presentation this evening.

64
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:24,164
believe that this presentation will answer a lot of questions.

65
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:35,468
We've tried to really tailor it to focus on things that have been discussed at previous hearings, questions that have been raised previously, trying to provide as much clarification as possible.

66
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:40,750
So with that, if you want to go to the next slide, Steve, I will

67
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,036
turn it over to you in a moment, just with one last note in terms of attendance from my team.

68
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:55,141
Mr. Peter Tam from Goulston is not on this evening.

69
00:06:55,521 --> 00:07:04,008
Patrick Gallagher, who is also from Goulston and on the team, is not here at the moment.

70
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,650
He will be joining the call a bit later in the hearing.

71
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,652
So if there are any questions,

72
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:16,895
that are specific to the legal side of things and he is not on, I could defer to him until he is on.

73
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,596
He will be on a bit later this evening.

74
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:27,679
So just wanting to point that out for anybody who's corresponding with me or the legal team later on in the hearing.

75
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:35,041
With that, Steve, if you want to jump in and get the presentation going, that'd be great.

76
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:36,183
Great.

77
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:36,784
Thanks, Pat.

78
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:40,567
As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.

79
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:56,082
Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.

80
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:08,214
obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.

81
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:19,746
Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.

82
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:27,129
What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.

83
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:37,373
What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.

84
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:40,594
fire truck circulation, how that works.

85
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:49,379
And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.

86
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,762
And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.

87
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,303
So that's our agenda tonight.

88
00:08:56,463 --> 00:09:00,946
Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.

89
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,073
So this is the site plan as it stands today.

90
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:14,722
You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.

91
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:17,025
So that is the building to remain.

92
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:21,130
The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.

93
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,072
We have the two shaded colors.

94
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:23,733
Those are to

95
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:27,016
to indicate where the roof changes are.

96
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:37,006
The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.

97
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:45,714
Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.

98
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:50,617
around the property and access out to the Felsway and to Myrtle Street.

99
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:52,537
We'll get into the details there.

100
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:58,780
Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.

101
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:02,284
That was just a quick refresh.

102
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:11,887
This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.

103
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,709
So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.

104
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:24,011
And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.

105
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,972
But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.

106
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:40,312
A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.

107
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:54,732
In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.

108
00:10:56,132 --> 00:11:00,274
So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.

109
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:11,559
sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.

110
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:23,606
Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.

111
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:30,230
Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.

112
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,920
Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.

113
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,546
So this is the main entrance.

114
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:36,208
We do have

115
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,253
you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.

116
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:50,001
We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.

117
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:50,962
This is where they'll be.

118
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:56,427
If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.

119
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,871
So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.

120
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:07,636
So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.

121
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:22,987
We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that

122
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,732
as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.

123
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:36,765
But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.

124
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:39,583
We have another egress there.

125
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:46,807
Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.

126
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:58,013
On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.

127
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:06,964
This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.

128
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:17,170
We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.

129
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:25,776
So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.

130
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:36,159
That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.

131
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:46,561
And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.

132
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:51,042
This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.

133
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:54,943
But that would be a full access curb cut there.

134
00:13:56,743 --> 00:14:11,896
You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.

135
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:24,146
And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.

136
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:35,075
So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.

137
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:42,480
Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.

138
00:14:43,481 --> 00:15:04,955
And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.

139
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:21,956
This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.

140
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:33,442
right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.

141
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,523
It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.

142
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:46,667
So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.

143
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:49,650
So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.

144
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,035
There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.

145
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:59,983
It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.

146
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:05,349
So in the future, we want to really dress that up.

147
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,451
curve it like a regular road.

148
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:14,592
The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.

149
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:19,373
So you get some landscape bump outs in there.

150
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:29,275
We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.

151
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:36,761
And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.

152
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:39,343
But this really becomes a finished road.

153
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:46,129
Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.

154
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,391
It's a more traditional roadway.

155
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,894
This really finishes off this side of the road and provides

156
00:16:55,978 --> 00:17:05,009
180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.

157
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:11,797
And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.

158
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:26,688
It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.

159
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,593
Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.

160
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:38,357
We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?

161
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:43,461
It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.

162
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:46,484
But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.

163
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:50,567
When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes

164
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:54,910
about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?

165
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:00,152
So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.

166
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,774
It's about 330 feet of parking lane.

167
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:12,778
And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.

168
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:19,762
But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?

169
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,822
So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.

170
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:27,784
That's where the yellow was.

171
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,926
That is the parking lane today.

172
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:39,174
We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.

173
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:46,017
And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.

174
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:52,478
You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.

175
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:58,760
It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.

176
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,462
but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.

177
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:09,924
So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.

178
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:15,405
There are some elements that need to be in that zone.

179
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:27,009
So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.

180
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,290
They do want to project out.

181
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:56,663
um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so

182
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:05,950
The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.

183
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,673
When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.

184
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:13,756
So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.

185
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:25,184
in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.

186
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:35,031
We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.

187
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,332
We think it's a good approach to the roads.

188
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:55,817
It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.

189
00:20:56,717 --> 00:21:01,461
Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.

190
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:09,809
And then on the Felsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.

191
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:15,053
So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.

192
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,394
We're just relocating it.

193
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:21,979
And then we have a significant reduction overall.

194
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,483
There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.

195
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,924
It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.

196
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:39,528
There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.

197
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:46,712
And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.

198
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:52,475
So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.

199
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:58,977
This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.

200
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:02,019
But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.

201
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,440
So all the colors are different.

202
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,584
We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.

203
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:13,406
The pink are electric vehicles.

204
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,428
The blues and purples are accessible spaces.

205
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,370
The reds are short-term spaces.

206
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,313
And green are loading zones or loading spaces.

207
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:34,105
Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.

208
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:38,269
But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.

209
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:47,797
We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.

210
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:55,460
So how does that break down?

211
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:57,323
And just where are these spaces?

212
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:03,611
So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.

213
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:09,278
Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.

214
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:14,608
We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.

215
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:17,629
Those are to be at the elevator banks.

216
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:19,830
As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.

217
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,272
There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.

218
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,593
So we provide some accessible spaces back there.

219
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:37,178
The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.

220
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:37,898
So we have 14 on the left.

221
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:47,004
And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.

222
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:58,228
We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.

223
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:04,190
So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.

224
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,452
And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.

225
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:15,260
And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.

226
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:26,163
This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.

227
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:32,505
So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.

228
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:38,227
So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.

229
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,886
Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.

230
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:46,188
This is a pull up and drop somebody off.

231
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:49,529
Uber driver doing a quick pickup.

232
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,750
It's not a leave your vehicle there.

233
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,671
That's a live loading operation.

234
00:24:55,792 --> 00:25:11,686
The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.

235
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:17,551
And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.

236
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:27,602
the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.

237
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:35,710
That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.

238
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:40,654
Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.

239
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:45,438
And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.

240
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:48,180
So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.

241
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,261
They can wheel it right out, be picked up.

242
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:56,485
And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.

243
00:25:57,106 --> 00:26:00,769
So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.

244
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:05,152
And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.

245
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:23,036
And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Felsway-Myrtle intersection.

246
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:28,541
That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the

247
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:35,544
park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.

248
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:40,606
Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.

249
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,047
Then the green are the loading zones.

250
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:45,768
That's where the loading activities occur.

251
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:52,850
The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.

252
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,092
Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.

253
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:09,142
This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?

254
00:27:09,182 --> 00:27:11,103
Does the fire department have proper access?

255
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,324
Can they get around the building?

256
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:18,767
This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.

257
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:25,271
We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Felsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as

258
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:33,279
A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.

259
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:40,566
All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.

260
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:43,209
So we feel it gives them pretty good access.

261
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,051
We've met with the fire department.

262
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:48,554
They did not have any issues with our approach to access.

263
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:53,717
So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.

264
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,939
360 degrees is their ideal scenario.

265
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,442
So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.

266
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:09,546
Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.

267
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:22,148
And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.

268
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,990
We have some hydrant testing.

269
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:33,738
There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.

270
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:33,818
And

271
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,186
The fire department was happy to see that.

272
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:43,976
The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.

273
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:55,103
And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.

274
00:28:55,243 --> 00:29:00,168
It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.

275
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:05,453
If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.

276
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:10,738
So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.

277
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,390
Sewer, similar story.

278
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:21,676
So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.

279
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:24,419
They do not have known issues with capacity out here.

280
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,781
We've run some capacity analysis.

281
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:31,165
There's relatively good sized mains in the area.

282
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:36,232
So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.

283
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:45,444
And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.

284
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,265
So there's water in

285
00:29:48,007 --> 00:30:04,584
infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.

286
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:10,190
And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in

287
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,991
at a four to one ratio.

288
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:24,382
So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.

289
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:32,829
Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.

290
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:37,072
We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.

291
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,658
Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.

292
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:46,287
It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.

293
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:51,905
And my last slide is just stormwater.

294
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:56,809
A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?

295
00:30:56,949 --> 00:31:03,274
Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.

296
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:09,738
That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.

297
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:24,084
In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.

298
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:28,065
So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.

299
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:35,469
and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.

300
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:43,054
We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.

301
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:50,359
Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.

302
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,180
That's a super high level of drainage.

303
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:58,787
get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.

304
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:01,551
And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.

305
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:05,917
And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.

306
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:11,965
So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

307
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:17,353
Mr. Thank you.

308
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,914
Good evening, everyone.

309
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:22,915
So this is an overview of the landscape.

310
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:30,397
Most of it is similar to what was presented in previous hearings that I believe most of you have seen.

311
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:38,900
We, as Steve mentioned, the current site is

312
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:56,135
completely impervious and we're introducing a significant increase to pervious areas and open space that the majority of it is going to be accessible and usable for the public, including the

313
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:00,910
walkway and the playground that is adjacent to the building.

314
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:09,273
As you can see, number one is the drop-off area visitor entrance.

315
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,314
Two is a playground.

316
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:15,175
Number three is a dog park with synthetic turf.

317
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:30,878
All of these are surrounded by proposed trees and additional planting that's going to add both the aesthetic value and also improve the stormwater capacity of the site and create a better open space experience for the neighborhood.

318
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:40,700
Number four is the bike racks that is adjacent to the bike storage room and provides additional capacity for bike parking.

319
00:33:42,671 --> 00:34:02,610
Number 5, there are multiple fitness equipments that are included along that winding walkway that goes down to get to number 8, which is the future, a potential connection to the future rail trail.

320
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:35,980
Number six is that walkway that provides both a landscape green buffer on the west side of the building to both screen the ground level parking garage and provide a better blending with the neighborhood as the building steps down and then we create a softer edge with landscape and proposed trees and more shrubs and perennial planting.

321
00:34:37,570 --> 00:35:01,684
uh, and, uh, creates also an additional, uh, pathway other than the proposed sidewalk that Steve, uh, uh, uh, mentioned, uh, we're adding to Amarant that the additional walkway can be used for, uh, walking and running bikes and can in the future become part of that, uh, bike network that can connect the neighborhood to that rail trail.

322
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:26,118
And number 10 is where we're looking to potentially, after further coordination, include a blue bike station, which seems to be a good addition to this area next to the bus shelter and improve the transit capacity of the area.

323
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:33,181
And you can see the courtyards as well.

324
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:38,224
We have two courtyards with different programmings that are adjacent to the indoor amenity areas.

325
00:35:38,264 --> 00:35:47,851
We have a pool of more green areas and outdoor programs for residents to use on the second floor.

326
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:51,273
Next slide, please.

327
00:35:53,799 --> 00:36:12,196
And this is an overview of the lighting plan and our strategy to lighting which is going to be utilizing a combination of different fixtures from wall packs, pedestrian grade light poles, larger light poles for parking lot areas and bollards.

328
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:38,600
And we worked with lighting design to make sure all fixtures are LED and dark sky compliant and avoid the spillover to abutters while providing appropriate required levels of light for all outdoor spaces in terms of safety and being accessible for people who park around the building.

329
00:36:43,809 --> 00:37:00,808
These are just looking closer at those amenities and outdoor spaces and open space features that was shown in the overview with some additional precedent images and inspiration images to give you an idea of what that space will look like in terms of

330
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:07,265
how it looks and how it's going to function and the materials that potential is going to be used.

331
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:25,861
The front plaza is going to be an open, probably more clear, with pavers and additional planting that provides a good welcoming face to the building.

332
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:28,343
Next slide.

333
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:50,478
This is what very similar to what the playground is going to look like with addition of there's going to be proper fencing and probably additional seating and small play equipment that can be used by residents and neighbors.

334
00:37:54,973 --> 00:38:00,197
The dog park is, as you can see, number three.

335
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:15,727
We intentionally put the dog park away from the street and surrounded it with more planting trees to both filter any additional noise that could be

336
00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:28,260
produced by use of the dog park and also it is in a convenient distance for residents to use on an everyday basis.

337
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:41,847
Some present images of those fitness equipments and the bike racks that are going to be along that walkway going down on the west side of the building.

338
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:49,418
and what it can provide for people to use.

339
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:52,361
Next one.

340
00:38:57,595 --> 00:39:24,477
These are person images to show what that landscape buffer and the walkway is going to look like in terms of providing both seating space for people to run, bike, and also adding a green screen against the building and buffer both the walkway from the street and from parked cars and from the facade of the building.

341
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:40,962
some inspiration images of the courtyards and the amenities that it's gonna include for residents to use.

342
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:50,040
And this is the blue bike station that I mentioned.

343
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,581
There is room against that.

344
00:39:52,901 --> 00:40:15,272
We think that would be a proper location, but obviously have to be further looked into in terms of details when I'm working with blue bikes to fit that station in the best place possible for people to access and use.

345
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:18,978
I think that's the last slide.

346
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:21,581
Yeah, that is our last slide.

347
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:35,215
Yeah, the blue bike, just for a little context of why we picked the blue bike there, it's often they want it on the private property but adjacent to the public sidewalk in a highly visible spot so people learn that it's there.

348
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:40,620
So we picked this spot, but there's obviously some flexibility in the landscape of that corner.

349
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,941
Blue Bike thought differently.

350
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,424
We'll find a new home for it, but it makes a lot of sense.

351
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,445
It was right at the bus stop.

352
00:40:46,465 --> 00:40:54,452
People could take a Blue Bike to the bus and then park it there and get on the bus, or could take the bus and get off, get their Blue Bike and ride to their...

353
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,595
right closer to their house.

354
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,960
So it's a good spot.

355
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,582
We think it's a good add to the project.

356
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:04,667
But that does conclude our presentation.

357
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:08,633
Pat, I don't know if you have any closing marks or want to go to end.

358
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:24,582
Yeah, not specifically I can just wrap up a little bit, and closing out the blue bike thought specifically as well I have had a preliminary conversation with some folks on the blue like staff, just trying to understand their.

359
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,619
their opinion on feasibility at that location.

360
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:38,404
Generally, they agree it's a good location, not just in terms of its dimensions, but also just locations in proximity to other stations they think that it fits well.

361
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:47,669
So something that we're proposing and would be certainly open to adding and coordinating with the city and Bluebikes to get a station added there.

362
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,550
But just wrapping up the presentation in general,

363
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:59,113
Understanding we did bounce around a bit, I think just orienting everyone as we close out.

364
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:10,157
This was for us a bit of a summary of some of the ongoing civil efforts that we've been that we've been putting forward on on the civil engineering design and that's a.

365
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:20,980
That is a brief way of saying there's a coordination of site plan, landscaping, utilities, parking, a lot of the things that you saw.

366
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,781
So just to confirm for everybody, it wasn't sort of a random collection of things.

367
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:39,285
We were trying to respond to questions and also providing more detail on what was submitted formally by Bowler in the civil submission to the city and it being peer reviewed by

368
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:41,426
by beta.

369
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:47,392
So there are some things in here, as Steve mentioned earlier, happy to revisit or jump into or zoom into.

370
00:42:48,193 --> 00:43:03,568
We don't want anybody to feel like if any of the presentation was that there are questions there, as always, we want to make sure that we answer them, but also there will be an opportunity for us to get

371
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,331
responses from the peer review team and follow up there as well.

372
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:15,436
So just wanted to close the loop nicely on the presentation.

373
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:24,222
So it didn't feel hectic, hopefully for everybody, but just wanting to make sure that we touched on all the topics that we believed that we needed to.

374
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:31,668
So for that, I will close it up and open it up to questions.

375
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:38,191
Yeah, so my thought is we'll quickly go to beta.

376
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:52,461
I know that the peer review comments aren't ready yet, but I just want to kind of get general thoughts and an expectation about when we should anticipate those, and then we'll open it up to board questions.

377
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:57,204
So I see we have Jeff from the beta group.

378
00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:58,105
Please go ahead.

379
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:02,521
Yeah, good evening Mr chair members of the board.

380
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:06,124
So, let me just let you know what I have tonight.

381
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:06,885
So, I have.

382
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:15,111
PowerPoint presentation, I can summarize the transportation comments that we provide in our letter.

383
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:16,292
So I can show those.

384
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:22,857
I, I have some comments from Bill McGrath who's our civil engineer.

385
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:30,837
I'm reviewing this project and he's on vacation this week, but I do have a list from him in an email.

386
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:33,638
I signed in presentation form.

387
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:43,063
If you want, I can read the list, but I can't really answer the detailed questions if you had on it.

388
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:49,167
That's in my expertise, but if you want, I could read his initial comments.

389
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:58,986
Okay, well, so it sounds like Bill is still working on the comments, or is the list that you have the comments that is not?

390
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:01,949
Well, I don't want to speak for him.

391
00:45:02,129 --> 00:45:04,551
I would say it's his preliminary list.

392
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:07,794
It's probably not final, but we're working towards it.

393
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:15,241
I would say probably by next week, he'd probably, when he gets back from vacation, he'd probably wrap those up in a submittal letter.

394
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:17,904
Okay, sounds good.

395
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:23,328
So we'll plan to go over those in greater detail in our next hearing then.

396
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:34,596
And that will also give the applicant some time to get those comments and start working on their response.

397
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:36,598
So sounds like a plan.

398
00:45:36,678 --> 00:45:40,821
And so yeah, Jeff, I'll come back to you in a little bit on the traffic.

399
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:44,483
First, I'm just gonna go to the board for questions on the presentation.

400
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:44,923
Sound good?

401
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,404
Yeah, thank you.

402
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:47,165
Thanks.

403
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:48,606
All right.

404
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:52,168
Uh, questions and comments from the board would like to start.

405
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,373
Uh, Jamie, go ahead.

406
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:04,459
Yeah, I thought it was a great presentation.

407
00:46:04,499 --> 00:46:09,281
I appreciated the lighting overview as well as the dark sky compliance.

408
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:15,404
Thought it was very thorough for the requirements, the items we wanted to cover.

409
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:25,289
One question I did have when you were talking about the focal point for entry of the building and the front being that entry point on Myrtle Street.

410
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:46,017
I guess my one concern there is from an addressing perspective, is the building going to be addressed as 970 Felsway with no reference for a Myrtle Street address, just from a concern from Google Maps, Apple Maps, people that don't know the area, so they're brought to the Felsway entrance instead of the Myrtle Street entrance?

411
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,562
Yeah, I can answer that.

412
00:46:53,622 --> 00:47:04,430
If you choose, the property will be subdivided and the residential property will not have frontage on the Felsway, so it will not have a Felsway address.

413
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:10,235
The 970 will likely remain the self-storage address.

414
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,593
It's all on parcel today, which is why it's called 970.

415
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,513
But the existing building will retain that address.

416
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:24,154
The new building will have a, it can only have either a Myrtle or an Amaranth address.

417
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:27,635
And Myrtle seems to be the indication we're getting right now.

418
00:47:29,895 --> 00:47:30,275
Gotcha.

419
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:36,076
All right.

420
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:38,837
Other questions and comments from the board?

421
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,290
Andre, please go ahead.

422
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,292
Thanks for the presentation.

423
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:50,993
Super helpful information.

424
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:54,255
Just a couple of questions.

425
00:47:54,355 --> 00:48:09,684
One was, I know there's been some public comments a while back about the amenities, the landscaping, and I'm wondering if there's been any conversations with the neighbors about those features, particularly the playground.

426
00:48:11,025 --> 00:48:24,380
Also curious about whether you have any kind of conceptual thoughts about incorporating public art or historic information, amenities, anything like that.

427
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:29,494
Yeah, I can jump in.

428
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:43,044
Starting with the first question, I have met with a couple of the neighbors and had a broad discussion about the project.

429
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:52,612
One of the topics being just programming of the outdoor space, generally, and some of the neighbors that I have met with are on the call.

430
00:48:53,773 --> 00:49:10,850
I don't want to misrepresent anything that they've said, but generally the feedback that I've gotten is outdoor playground, outdoor workout equipment isn't something that is necessarily all that exciting to some of the neighbors.

431
00:49:13,235 --> 00:49:15,557
haven't necessarily envisioned that they would use it.

432
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:32,309
The conversations that we have had is that we want to be programming the outdoor space to be a benefit to the neighborhood, and that we are open to getting the feedback from them if there is something that they do want to see.

433
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,832
But generally speaking, that is the feedback that I've gotten to date.

434
00:49:38,693 --> 00:49:39,574
On the public art,

435
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:47,561
The answer to the question is yes, in terms of whether or not we are able to consider it.

436
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:48,824
We don't have a specific

437
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:52,378
a specific idea in mind.

438
00:49:52,438 --> 00:50:07,082
I think the way that we left the previous hearing, which was focused on architecture, is that that would be something that we would try to continue to consider under the umbrella of that peer review, if you will.

439
00:50:07,702 --> 00:50:15,385
Not to kick the can on it, but I think with an upcoming peer review session with Davis Square Architects and the exterior of the building,

440
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:21,048
and the incorporation of the landscape elements being part of that focus of that ongoing conversation.

441
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:24,029
That's something that we are trying to think a bit more about.

442
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:35,495
I don't know at the outcome if we can necessarily promise that we will have a very prescriptive design for public art.

443
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:49,700
It's a little bit TBD on it, but generally speaking, to answer the question, yes, we are certainly open to incorporating that as a part of the site in various areas of the site.

444
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:57,383
And if there are suggestions from the board or members of the neighborhood on how to do that or where to do that, we would love to hear that feedback.

445
00:50:57,803 --> 00:51:05,465
That would be helpful for us, frankly, as we are getting to the programming of the building and what it really looks like.

446
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:11,569
Thank you.

447
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:15,953
I see Director Hunt has her hand raised.

448
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:18,115
I just want to check in with Andre first.

449
00:51:18,295 --> 00:51:21,638
Was there anything else you were going to ask, Andre, or did that answer your question?

450
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:23,860
Yeah, that's fine on those questions.

451
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,603
I probably had a couple other comments, but happy to have Alicia jump in on it.

452
00:51:28,324 --> 00:51:29,285
Director Hunt, please go ahead.

453
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:30,386
Thank you.

454
00:51:30,446 --> 00:51:36,192
I just wanted to actually raise, sorry, a follow-up on what you had mentioned because

455
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:46,255
It is my impression, and I wanted to know if you thought this was true, that the abutters you've been talking to are all abutters with Myrtle Street addresses, so they're all houses and yards.

456
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:58,378
Have you had any conversations or heard from any of the residents of Amaranth Place, which are all condos, which appears to have no open space for yards associated with it?

457
00:51:58,598 --> 00:51:59,418
Because that's where

458
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,366
the office was thinking that some open space would be good for the neighborhood was around those condos.

459
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,088
I just wanted to clarify that point.

460
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:09,949
No, it's a great question.

461
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:13,873
I have not met with any residents of the Amaranth Place condos.

462
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:17,977
So the feedback that I represented did not come from them.

463
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:19,358
Great.

464
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:19,819
Thank you.

465
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:22,899
Thank you, Andre.

466
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:23,359
Back to you.

467
00:52:23,899 --> 00:52:24,760
Yeah, that's a great point.

468
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,160
Alicia.

469
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,320
Thanks for bringing that up.

470
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:27,221
Uh.

471
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:32,903
Just a couple of comments or questions about the circulation side of things.

472
00:52:33,924 --> 00:52:39,867
Um, 1 is on the kind of the straight away between the.

473
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:46,111
The proposed project and the self storage facility, it seems like that's kind of a long straight away.

474
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:53,296
I'm wondering whether you're considering some, like, speed bumps or other types of mitigation there.

475
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:58,480
And I'm also curious if you could just walk us through a little bit more.

476
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:06,225
Where, like, how moving trucks would come in and whether they'd be going into the garage, like, where would.

477
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:10,088
Where would folks be moving their furniture, et cetera.

478
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:16,246
Sure, I'll share the screen again just so we have some graphic to look at.

479
00:53:18,948 --> 00:53:22,730
Yeah, the straightaway is, it's a long straightaway.

480
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:27,173
The nice thing, the traffic calming is the head-in parking, right?

481
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:31,816
It's not going to feel like a city street that encourages high rates of speed.

482
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:35,899
We don't have any speed bumps or

483
00:53:38,638 --> 00:53:51,771
any raised crossings or anything like that proposed at this time, not saying we couldn't do it, but that those are usually a maintenance issue and they come with a different set of challenges.

484
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,515
But we'll definitely take a closer look at that.

485
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:59,838
We did purposely make this at the entrance here a 90 degree.

486
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:02,600
So people have to come and turn into it.

487
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,222
So it's not like a fast slip lane.

488
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:10,026
And obviously at the far end, it's also a 90 degree.

489
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:17,372
So there's only so long where folks are on a straightaway before they're coming to a 90 degree stop and turn.

490
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:24,878
So I think it's a reasonable distance, but definitely a great point for us to look at a little bit further.

491
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:34,670
As far as the loading goes, as we saw, we did fire truck studies so the ladder truck can make it all the way around the building.

492
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,494
Moving trucks tend to be on a project like this.

493
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:47,740
Think of like the large size U-Haul, which is quite a bit smaller than a, it could be a rider truck, doesn't have to be U-Haul.

494
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,102
But that type of single box truck,

495
00:54:53,678 --> 00:54:55,859
that turns a little bit better than the fire truck.

496
00:54:55,899 --> 00:55:04,681
So anywhere that we showed you a fire truck moving, a moving truck could go, but really they're going to be along this back edge of the building.

497
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:11,443
So they're trying to get to the back edge so that they could come in through Amaranth and pull up along the edge here.

498
00:55:11,483 --> 00:55:11,964
They could

499
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:19,488
If they're permitted, they can come through the Felsway and come into this side of the building.

500
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:24,533
And the loading operations happen in this door in the back here.

501
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:28,737
So this is loading and an elevator right there.

502
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:31,979
So loading operations really along this curb line, there's no parking on

503
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,902
on the building side of the street so they could pull up along the curb, unload, go right in that back door, and up the elevator to whatever floor they're on.

504
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:43,463
The trucks are not intended to go into the garage itself.

505
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:50,065
It'll be van-accessible heights to get into the garage, so for van-accessible parking in there.

506
00:55:51,406 --> 00:55:58,088
So if you're coming with a smaller moving van, you may be able to go in the garage, but not like a box truck.

507
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:02,746
Okay, thank you.

508
00:56:02,766 --> 00:56:04,947
I just want to qualify.

509
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:06,488
You said they could pull up on the curb.

510
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:07,708
That's the sidewalk, correct?

511
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:11,350
There is a sidewalk there to align the edge of the building.

512
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:18,213
So there's a curb, and then the sidewalk will be elevated so they could pull up along the edge of the roadway adjacent to the curb.

513
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:24,516
All right.

514
00:56:25,016 --> 00:56:27,337
Other questions from the board?

515
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:36,873
Kim, you're on mute.

516
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:53,326
On the bikes, how many bikes are you able to store our house?

517
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:00,430
I can jump in.

518
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:08,436
So as a part of the ongoing architectural design, that was one of the comments that we got back from the peer reviewer, Mr. Bomer.

519
00:57:09,837 --> 00:57:17,463
We are finalizing the size of that room where it's located on the site plan, the ground floor plan is remaining.

520
00:57:17,803 --> 00:57:22,845
finalizing the square footage of that room and then putting the conceptual design together is something that we're working on now.

521
00:57:24,386 --> 00:57:39,713
We're targeting as many bikes as possible and looking at different specs of bike racks and bike rack holders, whether they're floor mounted or wall mounted, trying to maximize the efficiency of that space.

522
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:58,934
So I don't have a specific answer for you in terms of quantity, but in terms of square footage of the room, we're trying to perfect that size now and should be able to at least put a rough number to it at our upcoming presentation that follows up on architectural comments.

523
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:01,517
Thank you.

524
00:58:03,402 --> 00:58:08,124
And sorry, that would be for bikes within the bike room in the building.

525
00:58:08,504 --> 00:58:16,248
We have shown the location just outside of the room where there are exterior mounted racks where bikes could be locked up against that as well.

526
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:20,690
I believe that there's a quantity that we would be able to specify for that also.

527
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:24,291
Okay, thank you.

528
00:58:25,572 --> 00:58:27,973
Other questions or comments from the board?

529
00:58:29,002 --> 00:58:32,683
Well, can I just follow up on that comment about the bike parking?

530
00:58:33,984 --> 00:58:41,546
One thing that we dealt a lot with in the last 40B project we reviewed was looking at the bike parking.

531
00:58:41,566 --> 00:58:50,709
So as you're thinking about designing that bike parking, now that electric scooters and electric bikes are more common than ever,

532
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:56,932
Um, you know, there have been some issues with occasional fires, which are difficult to put out with those things.

533
00:58:56,972 --> 00:59:02,375
So just want to take that into consideration, make sure it's a, it's kind of a well fire proofed.

534
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:05,657
Um, area.

535
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:17,973
Notice we have the ground floor where the bike storage room would be located, would be at the podium level, which would be non-combustible construction.

536
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:28,657
Something that we would be able to get into, obviously, as the design advances to that level of design documentation, construction documentation, and then submitted for code reviews.

537
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:35,720
But it's a great point to make sure that we are considering that as locating the run.

538
00:59:39,455 --> 00:59:39,716
Jim?

539
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:54,548
Yeah, on that same subject, I know that many places are not allowing electric bikes in the units themselves due to the hazard of fires.

540
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,251
Is that being considered?

541
01:00:01,675 --> 01:00:02,415
It's a good question.

542
01:00:04,284 --> 01:00:06,245
To date, we haven't had that conversation.

543
01:00:06,325 --> 01:00:15,669
We have been seeking input from various property management groups and our own internal asset management group within the Davis companies.

544
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:22,032
That is not a topic that has come up, so I don't have a specific answer for that question.

545
01:00:23,473 --> 01:00:31,216
It's something that we can certainly study and would be coordinated with the property management team and that, along with anything else,

546
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:38,122
would be spelled out for the residents of the building and the rules and regulations that they sign on to when they execute their lease.

547
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:40,804
So that's something that we can certainly look into further.

548
01:00:40,824 --> 01:00:42,786
Thank you.

549
01:00:47,971 --> 01:00:51,534
Actually, so related to that, I'm not remembering.

550
01:00:51,574 --> 01:00:53,315
I think it may have been mentioned in a prior

551
01:00:54,875 --> 01:01:03,340
hearing, but is this wood frame in the residential portion, or is it some other material?

552
01:01:06,182 --> 01:01:07,082
It's correct.

553
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:14,767
So the building as was initially submitted and the current design

554
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:19,239
is a podium construction.

555
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,442
This current configuration obviously has the step at the top level.

556
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:30,466
There is a five over one and a four over one element of the construction.

557
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:41,433
Over one being your non-combustible level, whether that's steel or concrete is not formally defined yet, but it would be wood frame over that non-combustible level.

558
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:42,734
Got it.

559
01:01:43,854 --> 01:01:44,375
The reason why I asked,

560
01:01:45,795 --> 01:02:02,104
One of the reasons we spent so much time on this in the prior 40B hearing was it was a similar construction and our building commissioner at the time had direct experience from Waltham about a big, in this case, it was a construction fire.

561
01:02:02,144 --> 01:02:05,485
But basically, this type of building is built

562
01:02:07,026 --> 01:02:11,352
elevated risk for fire in certain contexts.

563
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:15,176
And so just keep that in mind as you're consulting with other groups.

564
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:22,666
Guidance, especially from similar types of building, I think would probably be the best practice to use here.

565
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:27,629
Yeah, understood and point well taken.

566
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:39,292
In terms of completing the design, it would be done to full code compliance and obviously put through a review process.

567
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:52,716
And then through the construction process, the construction manager would work with Medford Fire Department, submit an NFPA 241 plan and follow all the rules and regulations that are associated with that as well.

568
01:02:55,377 --> 01:03:04,307
very much noted to the construction type related to wood frame and the risks that are associated with that.

569
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:06,689
Okay, thank you.

570
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,352
Other questions or comments from the board?

571
01:03:13,242 --> 01:03:14,823
Andre, go ahead.

572
01:03:15,043 --> 01:03:23,209
Could you just explain in a little bit more detail the electric vehicle charging infrastructure that you're talking about?

573
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,451
Because it doesn't look like there's that much.

574
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:30,835
I mean, we're talking about a rapid transition over the next five, 10 years with electric vehicles.

575
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:35,258
And one of the big barriers, obviously, is the availability of charging stations.

576
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:38,340
So if you could just elaborate on that a bit, that'd be great.

577
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:45,901
Yeah, Pat, you want me to?

578
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,362
I'll show you where they are.

579
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:51,186
I'll throw the picture on the screen again to show you what we're starting with.

580
01:03:51,406 --> 01:03:55,229
And then we'll talk about the opportunities in the building.

581
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:59,233
So just to zoom in a little bit here.

582
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:08,401
So again, these 14 spaces here, two more traditional spaces, and then two accessible spaces.

583
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:27,972
because it's difficult to come back later and install the infrastructure on the outside of the building, conduits, and get power and the mounting of the stations, we want to put all those in day one, so the infrastructure is there and ready to be used.

584
01:04:28,492 --> 01:04:34,316
The expansion option really comes into the garage, and we just haven't

585
01:04:36,574 --> 01:04:45,882
It's relatively easy to add inside the garage, assuming we plan ahead and put the right significant electrical infrastructure, right?

586
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:47,964
Transformers, switchgear, whatever.

587
01:04:48,324 --> 01:04:51,447
We need to be ready to up that power in the future.

588
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:53,609
We need to plan ahead and put that in.

589
01:04:54,649 --> 01:05:00,574
And we'll do that in coordination with the electric company as we get into the work order phase of design.

590
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:11,463
But once you have that major infrastructure, to add the equipment inside the garage is relatively easy because you can pipe up in the roof of the garage.

591
01:05:11,943 --> 01:05:16,806
and run it wherever you need to run it and add stations as they go.

592
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:24,490
That was how do we approach the site and get what's most difficulty on day one and then provide that flexibility.

593
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,852
As Anjanita said, it's expanding quickly.

594
01:05:27,912 --> 01:05:36,117
We don't know what the need is a couple of years from now, but it's pretty easy to add.

595
01:05:36,177 --> 01:05:39,039
Pat, I don't know if you had anything to add relative to the building.

596
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:44,602
That's my thinking on the electric vehicle expansion opportunity.

597
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:50,170
Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head.

598
01:05:50,510 --> 01:06:01,432
Our thought process was to have the EV chargers that are going to be installed as a part of the construction of the building along the exterior of the building.

599
01:06:01,813 --> 01:06:14,996
We have heard board members and other attendees of the hearings previously mentioned just wanting to see the EV chargers located outside of the building.

600
01:06:16,816 --> 01:06:42,075
And so we feel doing that out on the site is something that we can coordinate to with the expansion in the future, the ability to do that and be nimble sizing your electrical infrastructure properly, but being able to do that inside the podium level, that noncombustible level of construction, again, down at the garage level, being able to pipe in the ceiling and add EV charging stations.

601
01:06:42,475 --> 01:06:51,561
is something, frankly, that the Davis companies has had success with in other projects, being able to add them as they're needed or as that need grows.

602
01:06:52,282 --> 01:06:55,084
It's really a matter of coordinating your electrical infrastructure.

603
01:06:55,104 --> 01:07:11,755
So that's, you know, reiterating what Steve said, but hearing it directly from me, that is just as a part of how we laid the site out and thought about this conceptually, why you see them located outside the site and with the future growth noting being in the building.

604
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:19,764
Yeah, I'll just say, I mean, I'm glad you're, you're thinking about the, uh, the internal expansion.

605
01:07:20,185 --> 01:07:28,793
I just don't think for this number of parking spaces, like even on day one, this is going to be enough electric vehicle charging.

606
01:07:29,954 --> 01:07:33,958
And, uh, I would definitely suggest more.

607
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:40,981
It's something that we can definitely look into.

608
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:51,770
I don't have a specific response to quantify, but your suggestion is noted, and we can definitely take a look at it.

609
01:07:55,973 --> 01:07:57,194
Thank you.

610
01:07:57,214 --> 01:08:06,062
Just on a follow-up, are those expected to be fast-charging stations, or are those something that you'd expect somebody to be parked in and charging overnight?

611
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:08,557
It's a good question.

612
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:11,139
I think there's a couple of levels.

613
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:23,005
It comes down to a bit of coordination with the electrical infrastructure, how much power you can get and how large your switchgear needs to be to be able to provide the kind of power needed.

614
01:08:23,525 --> 01:08:28,248
I can say, I think that the rapid power charging stations really outsize what would be

615
01:08:28,928 --> 01:08:35,350
what would be considered typical or even atypical in an oversized sense for a building like this.

616
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:37,670
I don't have a specific answer.

617
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:58,535
I think we would want to make them as efficient as possible, but it would come for us a little down the line identifying which specific specification of the charging stations they would be once we're able to really quantify with an electrical engineer and work with the utility provider to confirm how much power can come to the site.

618
01:09:01,656 --> 01:09:15,320
And just to add, typically on these type of developments, we do just go with the traditional chargers because you're expecting these are residents that are coming home and they are going to be parking their car overnight.

619
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:21,802
So the overnight charges, it's not an impediment to how they, you know, the typical operations.

620
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:29,238
If it was more short term turnover, that's when you really need the rapid, more, more of the rapid charges.

621
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:30,258
Right.

622
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:32,079
Right.

623
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:43,265
But if those like 14 spaces are used overnight by the same 14 people and you have like over 300 marking spaces, then they're using that all the time.

624
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,081
Yeah, that's what I mean.

625
01:09:47,161 --> 01:09:47,721
That was my thought.

626
01:09:47,761 --> 01:10:04,235
Is it either these assigned spaces to the people that have EVs or would these be, you know, to Andre's point, if, if these were not dedicated and they were faster charge, we could have tenants that are assigned to space, use them to charge and then move their car in and becomes available to somebody else.

627
01:10:04,836 --> 01:10:07,278
Just speaking out loud, obviously just a thought.

628
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:12,339
Yeah, it's something that we would have to coordinate.

629
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,380
We would have to coordinate through the property management team.

630
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:29,084
I think in the conditions that you guys are referencing, as we finalize the quantity, if the need is immediately determined that there is to be more, I think what we do feel comfortable about is our ability to add to it fairly easily.

631
01:10:30,005 --> 01:10:39,708
So if residents are not able to charge their vehicles because they're constantly occupied, then we would be able to coordinate the addition of future charging stations.

632
01:10:44,893 --> 01:10:52,037
Yeah, so one thing I will mention on this thread, this is a cold weather environment.

633
01:10:52,157 --> 01:10:58,220
And so I think there is going to be a need for at least some indoor spaces for EVs.

634
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,542
So understood that it's easier to add

635
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:13,136
spaces after the fact, it sounds like you do need to do some upfront planning in terms of laying the infrastructure.

636
01:11:13,216 --> 01:11:30,965
So it'd be good in a future hearing for us to just get a sense of what are the plans there, like what you're thinking about doing, how much could this scale, and are you going to have some, like do you know today that you're going to have some dedicated spaces?

637
01:11:32,358 --> 01:11:39,256
inside the parking structure as well, or is it all going to be outside as it's currently laid out here?

638
01:11:44,051 --> 01:11:48,093
Right now, exterior is what is currently proposed to be installed.

639
01:11:49,814 --> 01:12:10,226
We can, as I said a few minutes ago, understanding that the feedback is for us to explore how many spaces, if what we're proposing currently doesn't feel like enough, we will do some research on that and be able to respond back to what we think the right number is.

640
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:14,899
and whether that includes more inside or more exterior.

641
01:12:15,299 --> 01:12:16,920
So we can certainly expand on that thought.

642
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,260
OK, thank you.

643
01:12:20,081 --> 01:12:21,901
Other questions or comments from the board?

644
01:12:28,983 --> 01:12:33,065
So one that I had that hasn't been asked about yet is,

645
01:12:35,235 --> 01:12:37,335
potential locations for school bus stops.

646
01:12:38,796 --> 01:12:53,539
So I don't know where the closest bus stop is today, but I know that this is currently in industrial use and there's potentially going to be a number of families that live in the new building.

647
01:12:53,599 --> 01:13:02,161
So yeah, where would or where could a school bus stop in proximity to this parcel?

648
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:14,239
I have personally not looked at the school bus stop and routes.

649
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:24,285
I don't know if they go on Myrtle Street or where the closest route would be, but we could definitely take a look at that with the traffic team and figure out where that location is.

650
01:13:24,825 --> 01:13:31,649
I think the widening of Myrtle presents some new opportunities, but we haven't explored that, but happy to take a look.

651
01:13:33,771 --> 01:13:34,451
Thank you.

652
01:13:37,797 --> 01:13:39,939
Other questions or comments from the board?

653
01:13:39,959 --> 01:13:47,244
I have one question and comment.

654
01:13:47,785 --> 01:13:48,185
It's Yvette.

655
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:58,778
In regards to the storage unit that's staying, and I apologize if you went over this and missed it, I did have slight internet problems for a moment there.

656
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:02,260
Is there any improvements that will be happening to that building?

657
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:12,946
I know we talked about public guard, and of course, maybe that could be a location for some of that, but they're next to a big, huge industrial lot.

658
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:16,788
So what's happening on that space to help improve the...

659
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:19,998
overall?

660
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:21,379
It's a great question.

661
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,301
And we did not touch on it.

662
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:32,307
There will be there will definitely there are definitely thoughts for us to go and improve that space.

663
01:14:33,808 --> 01:14:36,069
Maybe piecemealing the thought process for you.

664
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:40,652
There are two sort of main areas that we are looking at.

665
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:44,235
Steve, it may be helpful for you to pull the

666
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:47,697
just the general site plan back up just as a reference point.

667
01:14:48,918 --> 01:15:00,827
The first being just right off the Felsway, as you can see, just realigning the curb cut for the benefit of the overall property presents the opportunity to

668
01:15:03,048 --> 01:15:11,237
Modify the access points for that building and the loading for that building and just, you know, how trucks enter and exit over there.

669
01:15:11,317 --> 01:15:14,740
So this is obviously, I think, specific to your question.

670
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,904
This would be somewhat of a modification from what that existing condition is.

671
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:22,789
And then secondarily, I think.

672
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:43,498
What we are trying to wrap our heads around is the scope for, and this would be a bit of a zoom out, Steve, but once the buildings are, once the existing warehouse building is demolished, that obviously leaves a long exposed wall for the existing self-storage building.

673
01:15:44,759 --> 01:15:48,141
We would plan to finish that wall in some way.

674
01:15:49,362 --> 01:15:53,263
It is currently a CMU wall on the inside of that building.

675
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:57,744
There will be plans to go in and improve the exterior condition of that wall.

676
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:11,068
We'll obviously make sure that the demolition is done safely, but in terms of the aesthetics, just finishing that wall and making sure that all the tie downs for the roof and

677
01:16:12,228 --> 01:16:15,590
everything related to the waterproofing of that building is done properly.

678
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:28,316
So, there will be some improvements as a result, not only of the demolition of the existing building, but also of the site work that we're planning to do that will allow us to address the front entrance to that building a bit.

679
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:31,017
And I don't want to

680
01:16:32,638 --> 01:16:50,322
derail this the conversation that's specific to the residential property but we're in the process of working on some drawings for that that we would discuss with the city separately just to help understand the pathway for that building as it gets to the point where some of that work becomes accessible.

681
01:16:52,548 --> 01:16:55,531
And I don't know, again, how the building operates.

682
01:16:55,551 --> 01:17:00,875
So I will admit that I am naive or ignorant of like how this business operates.

683
01:17:01,595 --> 01:17:04,798
But I just think of my own experience and where I had grown up.

684
01:17:04,858 --> 01:17:16,607
And I recall like industrial buildings, you know, the workers would step outside and they'd have spaces to congregate outside, you know, with smoke breaks and lunch breaks and things of that nature.

685
01:17:17,528 --> 01:17:20,151
Is this the type of place that needs those things?

686
01:17:20,231 --> 01:17:22,553
And if they do, where does that happen?

687
01:17:22,573 --> 01:17:26,737
And will that be interacting with the neighborhood?

688
01:17:27,478 --> 01:17:31,642
Because now it's no longer enclosed.

689
01:17:31,722 --> 01:17:33,644
It's commercial.

690
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:34,845
It's a neighborhood.

691
01:17:35,866 --> 01:17:36,527
Sure.

692
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,834
No, it's a helpful question.

693
01:17:41,094 --> 01:17:57,198
So the existing use of that building is as a self-storage site, which for us means that it's fairly low maintenance in terms of on-site workers.

694
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:02,439
It's not production work going on, more just general management and oversight of

695
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:06,963
of people, the ins and outs of people that are accessing their private storage cages.

696
01:18:07,503 --> 01:18:19,375
So, it's a pretty low intensity in terms of on-site workers and, you know, the requirement of any off-site

697
01:18:19,855 --> 01:18:24,900
congregation areas for them isn't something that we think is necessary inside the building.

698
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:31,046
There's an office and a break room and things of that nature, a management office.

699
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:42,116
So generally speaking, we feel like with the type of use that that building presents and the type of oversight that you have with the few number of employees that are there,

700
01:18:43,858 --> 01:18:50,162
I wouldn't expect the situation that you mentioned to be something that occurs.

701
01:18:52,384 --> 01:18:52,784
Thank you.

702
01:18:52,804 --> 01:18:54,766
I don't have any other questions or comments.

703
01:18:54,786 --> 01:18:57,107
All right.

704
01:18:57,307 --> 01:18:57,688
Thank you.

705
01:18:58,408 --> 01:19:01,050
Other questions or comments from the board?

706
01:19:06,114 --> 01:19:16,899
Seeing none, I think what makes the most sense organizationally is we're going to vote to open public comment on the civil presentation.

707
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:26,824
And then after public comment on civil, we'll go to beta for the traffic peer review.

708
01:19:27,644 --> 01:19:32,827
So chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the traffic

709
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,631
the civil engineering presentation.

710
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:38,112
So moved.

711
01:19:38,132 --> 01:19:39,492
Do I have a second?

712
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:43,814
Second.

713
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:44,775
Second.

714
01:19:45,255 --> 01:19:45,795
Great.

715
01:19:46,055 --> 01:19:47,136
And we'll take a roll call.

716
01:19:47,576 --> 01:19:47,796
Yep.

717
01:19:48,776 --> 01:19:49,117
Yvette?

718
01:19:53,178 --> 01:19:53,378
Aye.

719
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:54,519
Andre?

720
01:19:55,179 --> 01:19:55,339
Aye.

721
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:56,380
Jim?

722
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:57,440
Aye.

723
01:19:58,181 --> 01:19:58,621
Jamie?

724
01:19:59,681 --> 01:19:59,881
Aye.

725
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:00,862
Mike?

726
01:20:01,302 --> 01:20:01,442
Aye.

727
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:07,610
All right, folks, we're now taking public comment on the civil engineering update we received today.

728
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:10,072
Oh, yeah.

729
01:20:11,032 --> 01:20:11,773
Cliff, please go ahead.

730
01:20:13,254 --> 01:20:13,934
Hi, everybody.

731
01:20:13,954 --> 01:20:15,595
I'm Cliff Bomer.

732
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:21,239
I'm the architectural peer reviewer, and thank you very much for the presentation.

733
01:20:21,299 --> 01:20:25,861
I did have a couple questions that could come up.

734
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:27,883
I know that we're looking at another

735
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:33,338
working session, which I think is terrific and really look forward to that.

736
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:39,163
I just have a couple of civil questions, maybe back into it.

737
01:20:39,223 --> 01:20:55,055
I think on the EV parking, I actually don't remember where Medford is as far as adopting the opt-in code, but do take note that the

738
01:20:55,898 --> 01:21:06,444
The opt-in code has very specific requirements for EV parking spaces, and they're very different.

739
01:21:08,105 --> 01:21:13,188
It's kind of a big leap from where the rest of the codes have been.

740
01:21:13,909 --> 01:21:24,815
I believe that what the opt-in code does require is that 20% of the parking spaces have to be wired, I think is the term,

741
01:21:25,585 --> 01:21:28,027
for EV parking.

742
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:46,401
So I don't want to represent myself as an authority on the specialized code, but do look into it because if that is adopted by the city before you're into the permitting process, that could become a very real issue.

743
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:50,704
The other, two other, three other comments.

744
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,145
One is I appreciate the

745
01:21:52,913 --> 01:22:08,038
The circulation diagrams and knowing that I think what's on the agenda for the next working session are some of the topics that came up as far as articulation of the building facades.

746
01:22:10,219 --> 01:22:11,500
And I do see the.

747
01:22:13,557 --> 01:22:25,266
Secondary entries as good opportunities for areas to create a little more volumetric interest in the facades of the building.

748
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:29,249
So I've just put that out there as an opportunity.

749
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:35,333
Potentially even, I think, Andre's points about public artwork.

750
01:22:37,043 --> 01:22:58,808
There is that long facade that is open to the parking level, the long amaranth, which is a great opportunity for mural space, I think, along there, which could really enrich what I think is a really nice idea for the landscaping plan along that side of the building.

751
01:22:58,888 --> 01:23:02,569
I think there's great opportunities there.

752
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:04,350
Two other quick comments.

753
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,110
One is that,

754
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:16,721
I don't think any of the plans we looked at tonight reflected the idea that I know we have discussed about trimming the northwest corner of the building.

755
01:23:18,322 --> 01:23:29,131
We have looked at volumetric studies that I think were really effective at kind of chopping that northwest corner off so it's not quite as prominent.

756
01:23:32,192 --> 01:23:33,773
So I'll just put that out there.

757
01:23:33,793 --> 01:23:41,440
I don't know if that was intentional or just a coordination issue with between civil and architectural at this point.

758
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:58,315
And then the last one is I'm not a traffic guy and I could be behind on a presentation or maybe even two, but I thought there was discussion about the entry

759
01:23:58,935 --> 01:24:27,598
where the drop-off is on the north side of the building, there was some discussion about making the road that separates the existing building from the new building, making that first 100 feet of it or so one way northbound so that people wouldn't pull in off Myrtle into the drop-off area and then proceed to the parking garage entry on the east side of the building from there.

760
01:24:28,598 --> 01:24:42,831
I apologize if I missed other conversations about that, and I want to emphasize I'm not a traffic person, so I don't know that there's any concern at all relative to the volume of cars that could use that as an entry point.

761
01:24:44,273 --> 01:24:50,819
But otherwise, that was all I picked up on from a civil perspective, and I really do look forward

762
01:24:51,467 --> 01:25:04,416
to another working session and appreciate the applicant's willingness to keep pushing into the architecture of the building that's going to link in with the landscape and civil plans.

763
01:25:06,377 --> 01:25:06,918
Thank you, Cliff.

764
01:25:08,519 --> 01:25:20,467
So since there are a couple items there that were more clarifying questions about some ongoing discussions in the working groups, is there someone who wants to speak to that?

765
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:37,136
Pat, if you want me to start, I'll go in reverse order and hit more of the circulation question that Cliff just raised, really on the ceremonial entrance.

766
01:25:37,176 --> 01:25:42,441
I'll share my screen again, just again, so I can point and make sure we're all on the same page here.

767
01:25:45,850 --> 01:26:00,800
I believe what the comment was is this section of roadway, did that want to be one way, one direction or the other, or at least inbound towards the entrance, I think was the conversation.

768
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,661
And we went back and forth on this.

769
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:06,904
And ultimately, we believe that should be a two-way section.

770
01:26:07,064 --> 01:26:12,967
And the reason being is if a car comes in to drop off, say,

771
01:26:14,101 --> 01:26:17,825
drop off or pick somebody up, it would be more a drop off situation.

772
01:26:17,905 --> 01:26:24,031
Somebody's got grocery bags, they drop them off at the main entrance, it's raining, they run in the front door, and then

773
01:26:25,323 --> 01:26:36,291
The drop-off person could then come around and go anywhere down behind the building and find their parking space and go in whatever other door, depends on what parking was available.

774
01:26:36,331 --> 01:26:42,415
So we think it's an opportunity to come in, whether it's into the garage, if they're going to the garage, they're probably not dropping off.

775
01:26:42,515 --> 01:26:51,562
But if they were parking on the outside, it gives the opportunity for somebody not to go back out on Myrtle Street, take a ride on the Felsway and come back in a different entrance.

776
01:26:52,062 --> 01:27:10,898
So we think it's an important feature, especially if it's a short-term visitor, somebody coming to view the property and those four drop-off spaces, say those were all occupied, that person would then have to leave and come around to the Felsway to come in and find

777
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:19,823
another space somewhere on the property and we thought those are unnecessary trips on those adjacent roads and keep those internal to the site.

778
01:27:19,843 --> 01:27:34,453
So we did, it was discussed, you're not misremembering that, but as we went through the iterations and the traffic engineers did some analysis and about 90% to somewhere in that range of their study

779
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,655
would come in other entrances.

780
01:27:36,775 --> 01:27:40,680
They think it's somewhere around 10% would come to this entrance.

781
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,622
It really is those first-time visitors.

782
01:27:42,662 --> 01:27:49,931
So we think based on a low volume and creating the opportunity to not go back out on the Fells Way was important to keep that two-way.

783
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:51,493
So that was our thinking.

784
01:27:51,853 --> 01:27:52,514
Thanks for that.

785
01:27:54,586 --> 01:28:00,475
Yeah, yeah, I can jump in just quickly on I'll continue to work in in reverse order.

786
01:28:00,495 --> 01:28:02,037
I was taking notes.

787
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:09,368
So, the corner of the, the, the Northwest corner of the building cliff, just sorry if there's any confusion here.

788
01:28:09,428 --> 01:28:09,709
We are.

789
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:26,571
bifurcating the design process in a way so we are looking specifically at the ground level plan i think this is the comment that you're making we have made the modification to the to the residential portion of the building so at the ground level the building

790
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:33,381
the building footprint is as represented, and then above that level, the building steps back.

791
01:28:34,302 --> 01:28:35,924
That corner steps back, I should say.

792
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:37,687
It's an inverted corner.

793
01:28:37,727 --> 01:28:42,994
So that is consistent with the presentation that we made

794
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:49,822
previously at our previous architecturally focused hearing and in our previous peer review.

795
01:28:49,862 --> 01:28:54,006
So we haven't walked that backwards and brought the building back out.

796
01:28:54,066 --> 01:28:56,128
It's just you're just looking at the ground floor plan.

797
01:28:56,148 --> 01:29:01,252
So that's the hopefully the confusion that we're able to clear up there.

798
01:29:07,102 --> 01:29:09,504
I'll keep going, public art along Emirates.

799
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:14,927
Very, very much noted, as I mentioned earlier, I think there was another comment to that.

800
01:29:16,468 --> 01:29:19,550
That's something that we intend to talk through at the upcoming peer review session.

801
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:25,994
That was something that we sort of thought of in the architectural peer review umbrella and happy to have the suggested locations.

802
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,835
I think whether it's public art.

803
01:29:28,475 --> 01:29:33,199
Um, structures along the winding pathway, or it's something along the building itself.

804
01:29:33,219 --> 01:29:44,909
You know, I think we're definitely open to ideas and want to make this a welcoming property and something that that the city is proud of and public art related to that is something that we're open to.

805
01:29:44,929 --> 01:29:50,214
And then, lastly, on the parking, that's a helpful commentary cliff.

806
01:29:50,534 --> 01:29:53,957
I think we definitely got a lot of feedback on that tonight and.

807
01:29:56,519 --> 01:30:00,244
As I mentioned, just the takeaway for me was for us to do a bit more homework on that.

808
01:30:01,725 --> 01:30:12,357
I can't reference the specific code directive for EV parking, but by the time we meet next, our team will be able to do that.

809
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:14,039
Great.

810
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:14,620
Thank you.

811
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:15,881
Yes.

812
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:16,362
Thank you.

813
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:17,347
All right.

814
01:30:17,968 --> 01:30:20,329
So folks, we are open for public comment.

815
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:32,978
So if you're a member of the public who would like to speak on civil engineering matters, you can raise your hand on zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, you can type something like that.

816
01:30:33,758 --> 01:30:38,501
You can also email Dennis D. McDougal at Medford dash ma.gov.

817
01:30:39,382 --> 01:30:43,965
I see we have an Allison D. Please go ahead, state your name and address for the record.

818
01:30:47,956 --> 01:30:49,877
Hi everybody, Allison D'Agostino.

819
01:30:49,897 --> 01:30:54,459
I represent 1022-1024 Felsway of the D'Agostino Family Trust.

820
01:30:58,658 --> 01:30:59,159
Thank you all.

821
01:30:59,179 --> 01:31:03,903
I actually have a lot of comments right by a lot of labeled number them and questions.

822
01:31:03,983 --> 01:31:06,045
I'm going to try and just be as organized as possible.

823
01:31:06,526 --> 01:31:08,268
Just to start off, if I can help it all.

824
01:31:08,908 --> 01:31:11,351
I do know a little bit about the bus stop situation.

825
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:12,592
So I'm just going to start there.

826
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:16,176
My understanding there is a bus stop location.

827
01:31:16,316 --> 01:31:18,077
It's actually on the other side of the Felsway.

828
01:31:18,698 --> 01:31:25,082
So right now, children have to cross basically where Myrtle Street is, walk all the way across the Fells Way.

829
01:31:25,122 --> 01:31:26,703
So that is quite a busy road.

830
01:31:28,244 --> 01:31:38,451
And pretty much directly across where the current curb cut is on the Fells Way for the storage property, that's where children wait.

831
01:31:38,752 --> 01:31:42,694
And then there's also another bus stop location all the way at the end of Myrtle.

832
01:31:43,094 --> 01:31:44,756
Because again, this is industrial, right?

833
01:31:44,776 --> 01:31:46,277
So there's no kids being picked up here.

834
01:31:47,638 --> 01:31:51,421
My understanding, it's at the corner of Myrtle and Spring Street, if that's helpful.

835
01:31:51,662 --> 01:31:52,703
So just leading up there.

836
01:31:53,523 --> 01:31:55,065
A few comments.

837
01:31:55,105 --> 01:31:58,629
So first off, thank you to the board and obviously Davis Company.

838
01:31:58,669 --> 01:32:01,692
I was actually someone who met with Pat.

839
01:32:02,152 --> 01:32:04,274
It was a great meeting and I do appreciate the time.

840
01:32:06,556 --> 01:32:10,120
So one thing just leading off comment-wise,

841
01:32:10,703 --> 01:32:23,430
I think it's a bit misleading that, you know, I think, especially at the beginning of the project, we discussed how Myrtle Street would be kind of, you know, we're trying to drive traffic away, hearing tonight that the, you know, the address of the property will be at Myrtle.

842
01:32:24,411 --> 01:32:35,698
And, you know, it's a little bit far-fetched for me to believe that folks will drive past Myrtle then and actually utilize the Felsway entrance as prescribed.

843
01:32:37,539 --> 01:32:38,639
But again, that's just a comment.

844
01:32:40,617 --> 01:32:41,958
I wish I heard different tonight.

845
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:49,965
The other piece was I really appreciated the, you know, attempt to enlarge Myrtle Street.

846
01:32:50,065 --> 01:33:02,196
I think the biggest point that I still am unclear about is if we're not relocating the utility poles, anybody who lives off of that street can tell, you know, they're

847
01:33:04,116 --> 01:33:05,717
Large, there's quite a few.

848
01:33:05,737 --> 01:33:10,799
There's more than is illustrated on that illustration, I guess is the best way to put it.

849
01:33:10,879 --> 01:33:18,643
So while I appreciate it, if the utility poles are not moved in conjunction, you're not enlarging that street sufficiently.

850
01:33:18,683 --> 01:33:24,686
And obviously the intersection at Felsway and Bernal cannot be enlarged because we've already discussed with the Walsh property.

851
01:33:26,207 --> 01:33:27,308
Not really a solution there.

852
01:33:28,609 --> 01:33:33,672
The other comment, though, I really appreciated Davis company coming with the amount of parking spaces.

853
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:37,554
Also, the dog park for me, those are my top 2 concerns just for public record.

854
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:41,916
There is already no spillover parking in this area.

855
01:33:41,936 --> 01:33:43,918
It's heavily congested.

856
01:33:43,938 --> 01:33:50,044
In snow emergencies, folks are fighting over spaces, much like Southie, which I also used to live in.

857
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:53,288
So not that I used to do that by any means.

858
01:33:53,508 --> 01:33:55,851
So very heavily congested.

859
01:33:56,051 --> 01:34:00,115
Also, the potential of having 289 dogs introduced into the area.

860
01:34:01,036 --> 01:34:12,861
While I appreciate green space, I think focusing more on dog space or that is much more high priority to me than a playground or a park of a different form.

861
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:15,462
So I just want that to be common.

862
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:20,704
I'm very appreciative that they are trying to over park based on requirements because it's needed.

863
01:34:20,804 --> 01:34:24,245
There is no spillover and I need to be able to get out of my driveway every day.

864
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:30,452
So those are my comments, my questions, just so I don't take too much time.

865
01:34:30,472 --> 01:34:35,272
I do think that my question was, it was a little unclear with Warren Street.

866
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:37,853
It doesn't seem to be included in these illustrations.

867
01:34:37,913 --> 01:34:39,993
That is a crossing traffic road.

868
01:34:40,093 --> 01:34:45,814
So it's a one-way street, crosses into Myrtle, right at that intersection of Amaranth.

869
01:34:45,954 --> 01:34:50,095
I do think that is, my question really is, is that something still under consideration?

870
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:53,556
That intersection to me is very dangerous.

871
01:34:53,616 --> 01:34:54,396
It's dangerous now.

872
01:34:55,476 --> 01:35:00,143
So, my question to the Davis company, or even to the board, it's just is that something we're still considering.

873
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:07,893
As far as safety concerns, my 2nd question was just a clarification on the townhomes a little unclear.

874
01:35:08,134 --> 01:35:08,975
Are there driveways.

875
01:35:09,736 --> 01:35:12,380
Directly onto myrtle or internal to the property.

876
01:35:13,535 --> 01:35:21,719
And my third question was just the parking spaces around the whole building exterior outside the garage, but specific to the back loading areas.

877
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:23,740
It seems unclear.

878
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,921
Could a truck pull in?

879
01:35:25,001 --> 01:35:27,882
Could a truck, you haul truck with a ramp?

880
01:35:27,942 --> 01:35:28,963
Could you pull the ramp down?

881
01:35:28,983 --> 01:35:30,483
Could you unload safely?

882
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:37,267
I may have lived here in this home for a while, but I used to move every year outside of college.

883
01:35:37,307 --> 01:35:41,849
So I remember that being a challenge, being able to move.

884
01:35:42,689 --> 01:35:44,350
into buildings with parking lots.

885
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:47,070
So these trucks cannot access the garage.

886
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:53,392
My concern and question is really, have you accounted for the amount of length of space for a moving truck with a ramp?

887
01:35:54,293 --> 01:35:55,593
So that was a lot.

888
01:35:55,653 --> 01:35:56,373
Thank you very much.

889
01:35:58,934 --> 01:36:00,734
And again, thank you always for the time.

890
01:36:03,815 --> 01:36:04,195
Thank you.

891
01:36:06,515 --> 01:36:09,116
Yeah, so there were a few questions.

892
01:36:09,156 --> 01:36:12,918
There was a question about the moving trucks, about Lawrence.

893
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:15,479
Would the applicant like to speak to that?

894
01:36:15,499 --> 01:36:19,841
Yeah.

895
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:22,203
Do you want to go, Pat?

896
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:28,556
moving trucks and parking.

897
01:36:28,936 --> 01:36:34,358
The moving trucks, there is that whole length along the back of the building.

898
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:36,819
You can fit quite a few trucks back there.

899
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:41,780
We don't expect it to be a lot of trucks back there because property management really will

900
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,262
we'll manage the moves, move in, move out.

901
01:36:45,502 --> 01:36:50,564
And we think there's more than sufficient space to handle some of those peak moving conditions.

902
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:55,307
So, we have been looking at that and we'll continue to work with the operations team to understand that.

903
01:36:56,793 --> 01:37:01,295
For the townhomes, just to clarify, all the driveways are internal to the site.

904
01:37:01,495 --> 01:37:07,398
There's no driveway curb cuts or access out onto Myrtle Street.

905
01:37:07,418 --> 01:37:12,561
It's all from the backside, the internal site driveways.

906
01:37:15,662 --> 01:37:19,444
Then I think that if you want to give an update on Florence Street, I know that's being looked at.

907
01:37:21,227 --> 01:37:22,808
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

908
01:37:24,409 --> 01:37:27,710
It's a timely question that, so generally the answer is yes.

909
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:44,959
I think we, so we are in the process now, and I don't know if Jeff from Beta will conclude the hearing with some of his comments, but we received a bunch of comments back from Beta on the traffic and are reviewing those.

910
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:46,740
And as a part of that, there are a number of

911
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:54,942
recommended mitigations that we are being asked to consider and some additional things that we're asked to study.

912
01:37:56,182 --> 01:38:06,925
I don't know off the top of my head without the report in front of me if Lawrence Street is on there, but generally, I think traffic in the area and mitigation for the area is considered broadly, not just for Myrtle or Amaranth.

913
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:09,586
I would think that Lawrence might be on there.

914
01:38:09,606 --> 01:38:13,667
I would have to double-check, but the short answer to your question is yes.

915
01:38:15,507 --> 01:38:23,070
The mitigation packages for traffic in the area are something that we're continuing to work through with our team and the peer review team.

916
01:38:24,591 --> 01:38:26,512
And thank you for the bus stop feedback.

917
01:38:26,572 --> 01:38:27,292
I appreciate that.

918
01:38:28,352 --> 01:38:28,893
You're welcome.

919
01:38:28,953 --> 01:38:30,633
I mean, it's as accurate as I know.

920
01:38:30,693 --> 01:38:33,234
My neighbor has a couple of kids, so I see them go every day.

921
01:38:33,354 --> 01:38:38,957
So and thank you very much for the clarification and comments.

922
01:38:39,297 --> 01:38:39,897
Thanks, everybody.

923
01:38:40,557 --> 01:38:40,858
Thank you.

924
01:38:42,952 --> 01:38:48,518
Other comments from members of the public on civil engineering matters.

925
01:38:49,259 --> 01:38:53,724
Uh, yes, we have, uh, Christina catch.

926
01:38:54,505 --> 01:38:55,286
Yes.

927
01:38:55,446 --> 01:38:59,831
I think second time in a row getting it right.

928
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:03,435
Christina catch one 30 Myrtle street.

929
01:39:04,297 --> 01:39:10,143
I have questions for the board first and then some questions about what was discussed with civil.

930
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:17,289
Have we informed the Amaranth condo individuals of these meetings?

931
01:39:17,369 --> 01:39:25,197
Because for all the ones I've been in, no public commentary has ever come from that address.

932
01:39:25,953 --> 01:39:35,456
So I want to make sure if they're in the splash zone for this thing, that they've been given the emails, the flyers, what have you, to have their voice heard.

933
01:39:35,476 --> 01:39:46,580
And then second was

934
01:39:47,705 --> 01:39:55,772
We've been hearing a lot from Pat today as well as past meetings about this management company that's going to be managing the property.

935
01:39:55,792 --> 01:40:03,958
A lot of the questions have been deflected to, well, the management company will handle that, the management company will handle that, the management company will handle that.

936
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:09,003
I'd like to see the board maybe consider bringing them in for one of the sessions.

937
01:40:09,363 --> 01:40:12,786
So after Davis has erected the building,

938
01:40:13,787 --> 01:40:30,379
The residents have some form of comfort from the people that are going to be owning it and managing it day to day of their experience, how they're planning to handle things like the moving truck, how they're going to handle any possible graffiti that's showing up on the artwork or in the playground, and how they're going to clean it.

939
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,221
So I just wanted to throw that out as a suggestion.

940
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:38,405
And then my comments for what we reviewed earlier

941
01:40:39,907 --> 01:40:49,469
What I heard for parking is that there is currently, on Myrtle Street, 330 feet of parking space.

942
01:40:53,929 --> 01:41:04,691
So you understand that when you're speaking to us and telling us that you've, quote, increased it to 370, you have not increased parking on Myrtle Street.

943
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:08,692
Between Amaranth and Myrtle Street,

944
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:10,602
you have increased parking.

945
01:41:11,402 --> 01:41:13,543
But you have not increased parking on Myrtle Street.

946
01:41:14,103 --> 01:41:27,369
And as a Myrtle Street resident, I'm very concerned about when plowing is happening and we have snow emergencies, because now I'm going to have to park over around on Amaranth.

947
01:41:27,569 --> 01:41:28,229
I live alone.

948
01:41:28,569 --> 01:41:37,053
I don't love the thought of coming home late at night seeing that the residents have taken up the parking on Myrtle, and I have to park around the corner

949
01:41:37,777 --> 01:41:39,358
at Amaranth and walk home.

950
01:41:40,459 --> 01:41:54,447
And I assume that you will be, because all of these companies and all of these luxury apartments do charge for parking for their residents, they will figure out Amaranth and Myrtle is free, and they will take our spots.

951
01:41:55,488 --> 01:42:02,532
So I just want to let you know that the $130,000 to $170,000 improvement that you were pitching for Myrtle Street was really misleading, and it caught on to it.

952
01:42:03,795 --> 01:42:08,639
And then finally, I really thought we were starting to get to a place where you were listening to the residents.

953
01:42:08,659 --> 01:42:16,186
So I'm very disappointed to hear that we are no longer diverting traffic away from Myrtle Street, which Allison just commented on.

954
01:42:17,246 --> 01:42:24,893
And what Cliff also mentioned was we were informed in a prior meeting that residents were not going to be able to

955
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:28,975
access the garage from Myrtle Street.

956
01:42:29,295 --> 01:42:33,596
That was a little cul-de-sac roundabout for drop in, drop off, pull back out.

957
01:42:34,576 --> 01:42:41,939
So I just wanted to express my disappointment that things I felt were being listened to were backtracked in this particular call.

958
01:42:42,659 --> 01:42:42,979
Thank you.

959
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:46,861
Thank you.

960
01:42:48,081 --> 01:42:50,282
Yeah, so on the topic of the

961
01:42:51,397 --> 01:42:56,359
The access, I think that's something we're going to be covering in the update from peer review.

962
01:42:56,739 --> 01:43:00,200
So I don't know if the applicant wants to speak to that at all.

963
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:03,701
I know you already kind of mentioned the rationale for that.

964
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:07,642
So it's something we'll get feedback from beta on as well.

965
01:43:09,783 --> 01:43:11,563
And then on the, sorry.

966
01:43:16,942 --> 01:43:17,762
getting a brain fart.

967
01:43:17,802 --> 01:43:20,503
So there was the, oh, snow.

968
01:43:20,783 --> 01:43:22,544
Yeah, we haven't really talked about snow.

969
01:43:22,664 --> 01:43:27,266
So snow removal and things of that nature.

970
01:43:27,426 --> 01:43:31,127
And I know there's some covered parking for the residents.

971
01:43:31,187 --> 01:43:40,091
But what is the, I think it would be helpful for the board to understand now or in a future hearing, what is the plan for snow events?

972
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:46,053
And then also the, shoot.

973
01:43:50,569 --> 01:43:53,132
Sorry, Christina, what was the third one I missed?

974
01:43:55,053 --> 01:44:05,943
If you're talking about the parking, it was the snow, then my assumption, because all these luxury apartments do it, they're going to charge for parking.

975
01:44:06,736 --> 01:44:10,799
And I'm sure the covered spaces will be more, and the lot will be less.

976
01:44:10,859 --> 01:44:14,581
But eventually, the residents will figure out Amaranth and Myrtle is free.

977
01:44:15,102 --> 01:44:15,802
Yeah, that's right.

978
01:44:16,102 --> 01:44:17,523
So not that one.

979
01:44:17,783 --> 01:44:20,585
So that one I understood and got.

980
01:44:21,106 --> 01:44:24,788
It was the operation and management.

981
01:44:24,848 --> 01:44:25,349
Oh, yes.

982
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:33,274
The last 40B, we did get some details on the operation and management plan for the building.

983
01:44:34,995 --> 01:44:38,236
My understanding is that Davis Companies does intend to operate this.

984
01:44:38,256 --> 01:44:39,277
Is that correct?

985
01:44:39,337 --> 01:44:41,037
Or did I misunderstand that?

986
01:44:41,057 --> 01:44:50,901
So the Davis Companies has a property management function, but it does not extend to residential properties.

987
01:44:51,381 --> 01:44:51,661
I see.

988
01:44:52,302 --> 01:45:00,785
So we're, as a part of this, and Christina, this is just to maybe take a half a step back,

989
01:45:02,933 --> 01:45:08,776
In providing some of the responses, the intent is not to punt on giving a straight answer.

990
01:45:08,816 --> 01:45:13,278
It's trying to give the best answer that I can in the moment.

991
01:45:13,878 --> 01:45:27,204
I think some of the work that I've been able to do on a project at this stage, at this level of design, consulting with our property management team internally and asset management team that really focuses a little more on residential,

992
01:45:27,704 --> 01:45:37,369
but also having conversations with property management groups that we do engage with in the operation of some of our residential properties.

993
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:50,056
We have not executed any contracts with property managers for this project yet, so I don't have a specific team that I could bring on board and ask to present at this time.

994
01:45:50,076 --> 01:45:52,718
Mr. Chair, if there's a

995
01:45:57,962 --> 01:46:15,003
I will look into your reference for your previous 4DB project for what was provided, and if there's something similar that we can provide, we will certainly do that to try to answer as many operationally focused questions as honestly and with as much information as possible.

996
01:46:17,764 --> 01:46:22,427
Some of the questions are challenging for me to give a concrete answer for.

997
01:46:22,988 --> 01:46:30,933
So for snow removal, for example, I think it would be a case-by-case situation depending on the amount of snow.

998
01:46:31,233 --> 01:46:36,977
There are green spaces along the site that snow could be moved to and located to in a storm.

999
01:46:37,318 --> 01:46:39,900
And then if there are storms of a significant amount of snow,

1000
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:46,425
In speaking to the property management company, what does happen is they coordinate the snow to be taken off site.

1001
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:53,390
So I can't specifically say what that threshold is or how frequently that would happen.

1002
01:46:53,731 --> 01:46:55,392
It would be somewhat case by case.

1003
01:46:56,293 --> 01:46:57,534
So I guess to summarize,

1004
01:46:59,315 --> 01:47:16,320
If I can take a look at and go through the records and find what was provided by the applicant of the previous 40B, we can do some homework and try to provide some information on how the building could be operated so there's more information there.

1005
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,541
I'm not trying to be

1006
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:26,847
not trying to be in a position where people feel like we're not being transparent about that.

1007
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:30,191
So hopefully that answers at least some of the question.

1008
01:47:30,251 --> 01:47:40,282
And I'm sorry if you felt like the reference to the property management group is a punt on our part.

1009
01:47:40,322 --> 01:47:41,884
That's certainly not the intent.

1010
01:47:43,915 --> 01:47:59,955
Thank you yeah if you could review the what we received in the prior application and just check what details you are able to provide I understand it's a different circumstance because in that case it was a situation where the.

1011
01:48:01,222 --> 01:48:04,964
The applicant did intend to operate the building itself.

1012
01:48:05,164 --> 01:48:12,427
But yeah, these details were helpful both to the board as well as to the residents.

1013
01:48:12,607 --> 01:48:18,589
And so yeah, if there are things you know now that are a similar level of detail, that would certainly be helpful.

1014
01:48:19,310 --> 01:48:20,310
We can absolutely do that.

1015
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:22,151
OK, thank you.

1016
01:48:26,507 --> 01:48:27,548
comments from members of the public.

1017
01:48:27,588 --> 01:48:29,289
I see someone named Brendan.

1018
01:48:29,349 --> 01:48:31,029
Please state your name and address for the record.

1019
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:38,513
Hi, this is, well, there's three of us, Maureen, Brendan, and Paul, all at 132 Myrtle Street.

1020
01:48:38,533 --> 01:48:41,695
Could you also state your last names for the record?

1021
01:48:42,655 --> 01:48:43,215
Terenzi.

1022
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:44,496
Okay, thank you.

1023
01:48:46,232 --> 01:48:56,155
And I want to elaborate on something that I think Andrew mentioned earlier in terms of the e-bikes and the electric, the parking for electric vehicles.

1024
01:48:56,695 --> 01:49:02,077
I mean, there is a similar concern for the electric vehicles and fire as there is for the e-bikes.

1025
01:49:03,217 --> 01:49:14,220
As of right now, like you say, a lot of towns, and I know this is not unique to Medford or this property that we're talking about, but you know, regular fire,

1026
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:20,765
departments and fire trucks do not put out an electric car fire.

1027
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,889
So a lot of times they have to go to like Massport to get it.

1028
01:49:24,969 --> 01:49:31,154
So I just want to put that out there as a concern as well as we're talking about how many electric spots are required.

1029
01:49:32,161 --> 01:49:44,225
And I think the other one that I want to call out, which has been said by Christina, and it's been said by Allison, but is the concern regarding the parking and the ability to pull out of our driveways.

1030
01:49:45,505 --> 01:49:53,728
I know it's been mentioned, but I just want to state it again for the record that if the traffic is increasing on Myrtle Street with Myrtle Street being the address.

1031
01:49:54,348 --> 01:50:02,631
And even having the drop-off and pickup area on Myrtle Street, you have that many residents, how many Uber Eats drivers?

1032
01:50:02,651 --> 01:50:07,073
You're going to have multiple people at a time, not just one or two pulling in.

1033
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:12,734
And that's just, you can see it from other friends I visited apartments I've been to.

1034
01:50:12,795 --> 01:50:14,595
I mean, in these units, that happens.

1035
01:50:15,095 --> 01:50:22,318
And I don't want to see Myrtle Street, because that is the drop-off and pickup area, become a parking lot as people are waiting to get into that spot.

1036
01:50:23,202 --> 01:50:25,844
then now you're blocking traffic on the road.

1037
01:50:30,268 --> 01:50:31,369
So those are my thoughts.

1038
01:50:31,389 --> 01:50:35,633
OK.

1039
01:50:36,413 --> 01:50:37,634
So you mentioned three names.

1040
01:50:37,654 --> 01:50:40,137
Did anyone else sitting with you want to speak?

1041
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:42,931
Oh, I'm speaking on behalf.

1042
01:50:44,272 --> 01:50:45,994
Actually, Paul had one other comment too.

1043
01:50:46,054 --> 01:50:57,643
He was saying that at one time we were talking about really the Myrtle Street exit or entrance being more like of an emergency type exit only and not so much as a front facing.

1044
01:50:58,123 --> 01:51:06,310
And if it's really just a requirement for the fire department, you can actually close that and have, you know, direct the traffic to the Fellsway.

1045
01:51:09,151 --> 01:51:14,076
Just so I'm clear, when you say close it, do you mean physically or by traffic?

1046
01:51:14,116 --> 01:51:22,987
Something like that, that they have access to, so that it's really not an entrance to the property and you really are forcing traffic to use the Felsway.

1047
01:51:24,448 --> 01:51:24,749
I see.

1048
01:51:25,009 --> 01:51:25,289
Okay.

1049
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:25,910
Thank you.

1050
01:51:35,723 --> 01:51:40,607
All right, do we have other members of the public who would like to speak on this matter?

1051
01:51:47,932 --> 01:51:57,640
Seeing none, the chair awaits a motion to close public comment on this civil engineering presentation.

1052
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,521
So moved.

1053
01:52:00,722 --> 01:52:01,703
Second.

1054
01:52:01,923 --> 01:52:02,864
I see a hand.

1055
01:52:03,813 --> 01:52:05,695
from the planning department?

1056
01:52:05,735 --> 01:52:07,196
Yes, Dennis.

1057
01:52:08,697 --> 01:52:09,177
Sorry, that's me.

1058
01:52:09,217 --> 01:52:11,279
I forgot I had my camera off.

1059
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:26,091
Just one of the comments that Christine made earlier about notification, everyone within 300 feet of the property, so that includes everybody on those, you know, the condos on Amaranth, they were all notified at the beginning of this project.

1060
01:52:27,492 --> 01:52:31,916
So that's pretty much what the notification is that, you know, that we do.

1061
01:52:31,996 --> 01:52:33,017
And so if

1062
01:52:34,113 --> 01:52:39,054
We can't really say why none of them have been coming to these meetings, but they were all notified at the start of the project.

1063
01:52:41,895 --> 01:52:42,555
Thank you, Dennis.

1064
01:52:43,255 --> 01:52:43,836
All right.

1065
01:52:43,876 --> 01:52:49,157
So we have a motion currently without a second to close the public portion.

1066
01:52:49,177 --> 01:52:51,298
OK.

1067
01:52:51,358 --> 01:52:53,998
Looks like we have a second from Jim.

1068
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:56,559
We're going to take a roll call.

1069
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:58,119
Jamie?

1070
01:52:58,139 --> 01:52:58,199
Aye.

1071
01:52:59,160 --> 01:52:59,320
Jim?

1072
01:53:03,386 --> 01:53:06,067
You're on mute, Jim, but I saw you say hi.

1073
01:53:07,608 --> 01:53:07,808
OK.

1074
01:53:08,488 --> 01:53:08,888
Andre?

1075
01:53:08,908 --> 01:53:09,609
Hi.

1076
01:53:10,189 --> 01:53:10,429
Zet?

1077
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:12,110
Hi.

1078
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:13,510
Mike, hi.

1079
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:14,651
OK, great.

1080
01:53:15,591 --> 01:53:18,352
So now, thank you, Jeff, for waiting.

1081
01:53:19,093 --> 01:53:21,193
Let's get to the traffic peer review.

1082
01:53:21,213 --> 01:53:24,335
OK.

1083
01:53:24,475 --> 01:53:25,855
Is it OK if I share my screen?

1084
01:53:27,016 --> 01:53:27,576
Please go ahead.

1085
01:53:29,032 --> 01:53:29,372
Okay.

1086
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:34,716
And I apologize if my connection gets a little unstable.

1087
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:37,157
Can you see that?

1088
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:40,380
Yes.

1089
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:41,340
Okay.

1090
01:53:42,401 --> 01:53:43,141
So, good evening.

1091
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:47,885
Just back to this and baby group.

1092
01:53:48,565 --> 01:53:52,348
Perform the evaluation of the traffic impact study.

1093
01:53:53,640 --> 01:54:19,025
And to start the process, we conducted site visits to observe transportation traffic conditions, reviewed the impact study by Van Essen Associates, the project plans by Polar Engineering, and we reviewed all modes of transportation, not just traffic, but pedestrians, bicycles, transit.

1094
01:54:21,427 --> 01:54:32,413
We also have some overlap with the site civil, so you see some things here on the site plan, internal circulation, loading and deliveries, and the transportation demand management plan.

1095
01:54:33,353 --> 01:54:46,400
And overall, the traffic study was done according to the state and industry professional standards that we have, and it was a comprehensive report.

1096
01:54:48,688 --> 01:54:52,732
So I'll be summarizing the comments that we had.

1097
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:57,779
Several of the comments ask for additional information, ask for clarifications.

1098
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:03,045
We talk more about off-site deficiencies, potential improvements.

1099
01:55:04,006 --> 01:55:06,569
And I appreciate the presentation.

1100
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:14,413
By bowler, so several of the comments that we made, I think we're answered actually in that presentation today.

1101
01:55:14,453 --> 01:55:15,254
So I appreciate that.

1102
01:55:15,334 --> 01:55:17,655
So maybe a little redundant.

1103
01:55:18,675 --> 01:55:26,179
Some of the issues we talk about, so then this goes in the pretty much the order of the traffic impact study.

1104
01:55:27,467 --> 01:55:34,412
So study area, there's comprehensive assessment of intersections across the area.

1105
01:55:34,432 --> 01:55:36,294
And that's a little hard to read.

1106
01:55:37,675 --> 01:55:45,301
The 1 intersection, I would say, consider for inclusion is the only 1 that signalized that wasn't included, which is 4th street.

1107
01:55:46,338 --> 01:55:53,006
Um, it feels way circled here, so it's it is signalized with pedestrian crossing.

1108
01:55:53,086 --> 01:55:55,649
So that would be the only location.

1109
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:58,152
I think you might want to consider looking at.

1110
01:55:59,935 --> 01:56:05,141
So, for existing conditions, the traffic volumes were collected on January 11th.

1111
01:56:07,162 --> 01:56:08,944
Martin Luther King Jr.

1112
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,504
holiday was the 15th.

1113
01:56:12,045 --> 01:56:22,271
Just like to get some response and if there was any expected impact of that Monday holiday from the Thursday counts.

1114
01:56:23,972 --> 01:56:28,515
Then traffic was collected and summarized.

1115
01:56:29,436 --> 01:56:34,779
We'd like to get some more information on the trips that are generated by the existing site uses.

1116
01:56:37,259 --> 01:56:43,141
So, just some information on the existing conditions for pedestrians in the area.

1117
01:56:43,201 --> 01:56:49,143
We did do an inventory ourselves observations just noted.

1118
01:56:49,203 --> 01:56:56,385
There's no pedestrian signals at the signal as intersection of central and spring street, which is a study intersection.

1119
01:56:57,605 --> 01:57:12,502
Several of the intersections in the area are missing crosswalks and detectable warning panels, which are required to be ADA compliant, including the intersection of Myrtle, Amaranth, and Lawrence Street.

1120
01:57:13,644 --> 01:57:16,127
So those are just some observations and notes.

1121
01:57:17,951 --> 01:57:25,638
On the safety side, there are several intersections that have safety crash histories in the area.

1122
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:31,462
As I just mentioned, Central and Spring has 13 crashes.

1123
01:57:33,404 --> 01:57:41,291
More importantly, the crash rate exceeds the MassDOT District 4 and statewide average, which raises it to a level of concern.

1124
01:57:42,568 --> 01:57:46,130
Felsway and Riverside have 31 crashes in five years.

1125
01:57:46,150 --> 01:57:58,658
It's been identified by MassDOT as a high crash cluster, which makes it eligible for a road safety audit, which was conducted in 2019 and is identified as a safety issue.

1126
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:09,522
Fellsway Central and Medford Street has 23 crashes in five years.

1127
01:58:10,623 --> 01:58:20,147
And we'd just like some more information on the crash types in the area on pedestrian and bicycles in these areas.

1128
01:58:23,389 --> 01:58:40,892
Parking, we're asking if there's information on on-street and on-site parking occupancy today for existing conditions, you know, percent those spaces are occupied on the adjacent streets and on the site itself would be helpful to know that information.

1129
01:58:42,637 --> 01:58:51,006
Future conditions, so let me 1st, talk about trip generation and the distribution assignment of trips.

1130
01:58:52,187 --> 01:59:00,756
So, about 90 vehicle trips were estimated to be generated by the project and both the weekday morning and afternoon commuter peak hours.

1131
01:59:02,558 --> 01:59:03,879
We think that's a reasonable number.

1132
01:59:05,448 --> 01:59:09,989
We'd like a little more information on number of truck trips, including that number.

1133
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:13,470
Pedestrian trips, bicycles and transit.

1134
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:17,472
So, if those can be broken out and identified, that would be useful.

1135
01:59:17,492 --> 01:59:27,294
A 5% future bicycle split was used for calculations.

1136
01:59:27,314 --> 01:59:29,075
We think that might be a little high.

1137
01:59:30,188 --> 01:59:33,589
The overall Medford mode split, I think, citywide is 1%.

1138
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:44,234
So I'd like to know if a lower mode bicycle mode split was assumed for calculations, how much would that change the vehicle trip generation?

1139
01:59:44,254 --> 01:59:52,117
A lot of trips are shown on Fells Way making a U-turn at Central Avenue to come back to the site.

1140
01:59:55,042 --> 02:00:14,959
I'd like to know if there's alternative routes that traffic may use instead of that, recognizing there's some delay and congestion on that movement, particularly in the afternoon, such as Riverside Avenue, a left onto Riverside, or even using I-93 as an alternative route.

1141
02:00:16,201 --> 02:00:19,383
And would some of that traffic use I-93 instead of using Fells Way?

1142
02:00:22,525 --> 02:00:28,248
Um, there's a table shown in the report identifies project traffic increases, but it doesn't.

1143
02:00:29,229 --> 02:00:35,932
Identify the roadways close into the site, such as Felsway, Myrtle, Pinker, Lawrence and spring.

1144
02:00:35,972 --> 02:00:45,237
So I'd like to have that information quantified on the traffic volume increases on those roadways adjacent to the site.

1145
02:00:47,785 --> 02:00:54,108
A project parking that's been discussed a little bit with the parking ratio of 1.14.

1146
02:00:54,148 --> 02:01:02,411
We just want to make sure that this is the right number and it's adequate to meet the anticipated parking demand of the site.

1147
02:01:03,352 --> 02:01:06,213
You know, noting that, you know, we want to make sure we get it right.

1148
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:14,577
So if there's, you know, if there's enough parking and so it doesn't spill over, you know, into the neighborhoods and adjacent roadways.

1149
02:01:16,456 --> 02:01:21,807
We saw the 4 visitor spaces in the front, the drop off area.

1150
02:01:22,068 --> 02:01:23,290
We think that might be a little low.

1151
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:29,803
Um, so we'd also like some information more on visitor spaces themselves.

1152
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:39,267
Not just the short term drop off, but if people are visiting residents in the complex, where are they going to park if they're parking for several hours?

1153
02:01:40,488 --> 02:01:43,489
If they're parking long term, or they're actually parking overnight.

1154
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:47,331
So, like, some discussion about how those.

1155
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:52,374
Visitor spaces will operate and be managed by the site.

1156
02:01:54,830 --> 02:02:12,514
In the proposed parking spaces, the new spaces on Amaranth, just the intention of those spaces, I know they're available for the public, but are those supposed to be used by visitors of the site?

1157
02:02:13,354 --> 02:02:16,895
So kind of what the use of those spaces is intended for.

1158
02:02:19,533 --> 02:02:23,515
Intersection capacity analysis was performed.

1159
02:02:24,716 --> 02:02:28,858
Traffic engineers use what's called level of service for intersections.

1160
02:02:28,978 --> 02:02:36,862
It's similar to a report card, which A, is excellent conditions with little delay or congestion.

1161
02:02:36,882 --> 02:02:39,644
E and F are deficient.

1162
02:02:39,844 --> 02:02:45,407
F is the worst or failure with long delays, congestion and queuing.

1163
02:02:46,807 --> 02:02:54,713
So, you know, we were out there, we saw congestion on the Felsway, primarily southbound in the morning, northbound in the afternoon.

1164
02:02:55,953 --> 02:03:08,842
The intersections of Felsway, Central and Felsway and Riverside currently operate at level service F, meaning they have one or more movements that are failing overall at level service F.

1165
02:03:10,177 --> 02:03:16,883
And those conditions are exacerbated for the no-build future condition and build condition with the project.

1166
02:03:17,744 --> 02:03:27,913
The project will have some notable increase at Felsway at Central with the delays increasing on the Central Avenue eastbound approach.

1167
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:35,171
Some of these things have been addressed.

1168
02:03:35,411 --> 02:03:39,792
Even tonight, I saw the spaces up in the right-hand corner here.

1169
02:03:39,812 --> 02:03:42,892
I think we're for lot A for the storage facility.

1170
02:03:42,992 --> 02:03:44,352
Thank you for providing that.

1171
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:53,034
Also, the access to the building and the spaces around the site, and that was shown tonight too, so that was great.

1172
02:03:53,054 --> 02:03:57,735
The connection to the future bike trail path here was shown.

1173
02:03:57,775 --> 02:03:59,175
I think those are all taken care of.

1174
02:04:01,355 --> 02:04:08,041
And just a clarification on the on-street spaces, the new spaces on Myrtle Street and Amherst.

1175
02:04:09,182 --> 02:04:13,886
I know they're available to the public, but who would have jurisdiction over those spaces?

1176
02:04:13,966 --> 02:04:19,431
Would they actually be the city or would those be under private jurisdiction?

1177
02:04:19,491 --> 02:04:23,614
So just a little more clarification on those spaces.

1178
02:04:34,265 --> 02:04:41,113
In itself, we talked to wider on the site plans, the widths of travel lanes.

1179
02:04:42,034 --> 02:04:45,298
And on street parking should be provided excuse me.

1180
02:04:47,323 --> 02:04:55,712
Bicycle parking for residents and visitors was talking about just to clarify the number of parking spaces.

1181
02:04:57,854 --> 02:05:02,198
Snow storage areas should be shown for the site itself.

1182
02:05:02,258 --> 02:05:10,387
I know someone's talking about Myrtle Street, but also need to know where snow is going to be stored within the site.

1183
02:05:12,925 --> 02:05:16,927
So a transportation demand management program was developed.

1184
02:05:17,707 --> 02:05:29,732
And these programs, the focus is to reduce the number of travel by automobiles, particularly single occupant vehicles.

1185
02:05:30,673 --> 02:05:36,115
And we've identified a few other areas to consider or measures of this program.

1186
02:05:38,147 --> 02:05:40,370
You might have talked about this a little before.

1187
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:44,534
Will the cost of parking be unbundled from the cost of the lease of parking?

1188
02:05:44,615 --> 02:05:51,302
So I didn't hear that tonight, but maybe there's further discussions on that.

1189
02:05:51,322 --> 02:05:54,726
I know there's tradeoffs on which may be better for the site.

1190
02:05:56,377 --> 02:06:05,725
May want to consider providing transit subsidies or blue bike membership to residents as a TDM measure.

1191
02:06:06,987 --> 02:06:11,170
You showed the blue bike station, so that's great taking care of that.

1192
02:06:12,291 --> 02:06:21,420
And a consideration given to, should any car share spaces be provided on site, such as a zip car for car sharing.

1193
02:06:24,253 --> 02:06:30,398
So offsite improvements as proposed by the project, we talked a little bit about the bus waiting area.

1194
02:06:31,939 --> 02:06:52,094
The existing onsite parking spaces near the MBTA bus stop would be reconfigured and landscaping as we were shown tonight, as well as the new parking spaces, the widening of the right-of-way on Amaranth and Myrtle Street, or better, on-street parking and sidewalks.

1195
02:06:53,503 --> 02:07:00,070
So we identified some other measures just for consideration for improvements.

1196
02:07:00,230 --> 02:07:05,175
And these are primarily off-site locations.

1197
02:07:05,455 --> 02:07:13,924
And many of them are at the intersections that I talked about that experience either safety or operational deficiencies.

1198
02:07:14,424 --> 02:07:16,386
First is Felsway Riverside Ave.

1199
02:07:17,345 --> 02:07:36,001
So I mentioned it's identified a high crash cluster intersection operates at level service F. There were countermeasure, safety countermeasure improvements identified as part of that road safety audit, including signal optimization, advanced left turn phasing and clearance time.

1200
02:07:36,081 --> 02:07:37,543
So those things can be considered.

1201
02:07:38,363 --> 02:07:41,806
Central Avenue and Spring Street has a high crash rate.

1202
02:07:43,608 --> 02:07:52,197
Consideration can be given to upgrading the signal equipment, which is old and providing pedestrian signals, which are are provided today.

1203
02:07:53,760 --> 02:08:05,590
Felsway and Central and Medford Street, again, operates at level service F conditions in both peak periods, can look at, provide signal timing optimization.

1204
02:08:07,052 --> 02:08:17,761
The northbound left turn line gets blocked a lot of times, particularly during the afternoon peak hour, so vehicles can't get into that lane until the through movement clears.

1205
02:08:19,684 --> 02:08:24,800
Is there any feasibility for extending that northbound left turn lane on the Fells Way?

1206
02:08:28,085 --> 02:08:34,866
Felsway and Myrtle Street, so there's a long crosswalk across the Felsway.

1207
02:08:36,647 --> 02:08:50,690
As we know, there's a lot of traffic and high speeds, so consideration can be given to rectangular rapid flashing beacon, which is a pedestrian safety measures and makes motorists more aware.

1208
02:08:52,868 --> 02:09:01,492
We just want to evaluate, is it feasible, you know, to provide a break in the median in either a traffic signal or northbound left turnpocket?

1209
02:09:01,552 --> 02:09:12,796
I know there's trade-offs with this, you know, plus and minus in doing that, but is there any type of, enough of a benefit to even consider this type of measure here?

1210
02:09:14,877 --> 02:09:16,538
Myrtle, Amherst, and Lawrence

1211
02:09:22,287 --> 02:09:27,149
Street right at the project, the configuration is awkward.

1212
02:09:27,889 --> 02:09:34,191
The arrangement of streets in 1 way, and it's confusing for motorists as well as pedestrians.

1213
02:09:35,831 --> 02:09:40,473
I know the project has proposed a couple of extensions and crosswalks.

1214
02:09:42,278 --> 02:09:45,759
I think it may deserve a little more attention to this intersection.

1215
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:48,860
I know Lawrence was mentioned also.

1216
02:09:50,621 --> 02:09:55,903
Additional curb extension potentially on the southwest corner or maybe even raising the intersection.

1217
02:09:55,963 --> 02:10:03,865
I think it's an important gateway adjacent to the project and then the neighborhood.

1218
02:10:05,306 --> 02:10:09,107
It's an opportunity to provide traffic calming,

1219
02:10:10,087 --> 02:10:17,050
slow vehicles down and improve pedestrian circulation and safety in this area.

1220
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:21,151
Just a few other comments.

1221
02:10:22,892 --> 02:10:29,854
The existing bus shelter on Fells Way in southbound direction adjacent to the site, it's just really in fair condition.

1222
02:10:30,014 --> 02:10:32,235
It's really rudimentary shelter.

1223
02:10:32,255 --> 02:10:37,677
I think there should be consideration given to improving that bus shelter.

1224
02:10:38,823 --> 02:10:41,908
Um, wayfinding signage plan should be developed.

1225
02:10:43,770 --> 02:10:52,363
The project progresses to show clearly where residents, visitors and deliveries will access and regress the site.

1226
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:59,071
The pavement condition on Amherst, south of Myrtle Street is in poor condition.

1227
02:10:59,812 --> 02:11:06,394
So that street should be considered for repaving as part of the project.

1228
02:11:06,494 --> 02:11:18,297
Traffic management plan for construction will really have to be developed, showing the impacts on the neighborhood.

1229
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:29,876
And the last comment is an access construction permit will be required from DCR because the project is changing in nature.

1230
02:11:30,857 --> 02:11:38,801
And the access and egress onto Fellsway will require a permit from DCR.

1231
02:11:40,562 --> 02:11:43,524
So that's a summary of our comments.

1232
02:11:43,604 --> 02:11:47,706
There's more, and some of them are small, but in detail.

1233
02:11:49,407 --> 02:11:51,089
in the review letter that we provided.

1234
02:11:51,569 --> 02:11:53,190
And so thank you very much.

1235
02:11:53,311 --> 02:11:55,132
And I can answer any questions that you have.

1236
02:11:57,434 --> 02:11:57,855
Thank you.

1237
02:11:59,416 --> 02:12:04,701
So before we go to board questions, I just want to double check my understanding with Pat Newton.

1238
02:12:04,721 --> 02:12:14,730
So Pat, in general, were any of these items you wanted to speak to today or these updates we'll get in a future session of the year?

1239
02:12:16,758 --> 02:12:19,659
Yeah, we did not plan on addressing these comments this evening.

1240
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:25,222
So we would we will have a more formal response to be to provide in the future.

1241
02:12:25,762 --> 02:12:26,102
Sounds great.

1242
02:12:26,122 --> 02:12:27,383
All right.

1243
02:12:27,503 --> 02:12:31,124
In that case, I will open it up to questions from the board.

1244
02:12:34,386 --> 02:12:37,647
On the peer review feedback for traffic.

1245
02:12:48,193 --> 02:12:50,335
Yeah, I see Chris, please go ahead.

1246
02:12:53,238 --> 02:12:54,258
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1247
02:12:54,559 --> 02:12:57,041
I'm not sure I've been having some medical problems.

1248
02:12:57,201 --> 02:12:57,721
Can you hear me?

1249
02:12:57,962 --> 02:12:58,242
Okay.

1250
02:12:58,622 --> 02:12:59,883
Yes, we can hear you.

1251
02:12:59,903 --> 02:13:01,465
Okay, thank you.

1252
02:13:01,625 --> 02:13:11,914
Yeah, I'm looking at the site plan earlier, just in the circulation of the whole site.

1253
02:13:12,054 --> 02:13:12,814
I guess it's similar.

1254
02:13:19,975 --> 02:13:24,356
traffic into those three areas that are in your video.

1255
02:13:25,476 --> 02:13:28,297
Yeah, it's cutting out midway through your sentence.

1256
02:13:29,678 --> 02:13:29,798
Oh.

1257
02:13:32,018 --> 02:13:32,178
OK.

1258
02:13:32,798 --> 02:13:33,458
Is that any better?

1259
02:13:33,979 --> 02:13:34,259
Yes.

1260
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:35,359
All right.

1261
02:13:35,659 --> 02:13:42,821
Yeah, I was just thinking about the circulation in general as with the plan.

1262
02:13:48,352 --> 02:13:53,694
have the least resistance when they're going to the garage.

1263
02:13:53,774 --> 02:14:04,958
And so, the bottom line is that, you know, the ambulance is going to attract the most people to the garage when they're coming out.

1264
02:14:05,018 --> 02:14:13,981
Hey, Chris, I think we need to put you on pause and ask you to put it in the chat, because I personally could not hear that.

1265
02:14:14,802 --> 02:14:15,882
I don't know how others felt.

1266
02:14:17,796 --> 02:14:19,539
Yeah, we're still cutting in and out a little bit.

1267
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:20,060
Okay.

1268
02:14:20,541 --> 02:14:20,862
Okay.

1269
02:14:22,064 --> 02:14:22,746
All right.

1270
02:14:23,006 --> 02:14:23,527
I will do that.

1271
02:14:23,547 --> 02:14:24,950
I'll put it in the chat.

1272
02:14:29,759 --> 02:14:30,140
Okay.

1273
02:14:42,747 --> 02:14:49,209
I'm, I'm like, I'm just wondering, um, in terms of a, of a question for, for Jeff.

1274
02:14:49,669 --> 02:14:54,891
So we've heard some comments tonight about this concern with the address being on Myrtle Ave.

1275
02:14:55,711 --> 02:15:07,915
Um, and I'm wondering whether, you know, you'd have recommendations specifically, I know you said wayfinding, like what kind of signage might be able to be on the Felsway entrance to, you know,

1276
02:15:10,678 --> 02:15:13,060
make sure that that's the main entrance to the project.

1277
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:14,741
I don't know if you have any thoughts about that.

1278
02:15:16,863 --> 02:15:17,703
Yeah.

1279
02:15:18,124 --> 02:15:29,913
So we'd be looking for a signage plan that would direct residents and visitors and deliveries to and from the site.

1280
02:15:30,774 --> 02:15:35,517
Of course, the residents, once they're there, they're going to know how to get in and out.

1281
02:15:37,150 --> 02:15:53,945
You know, a lot of where we're going to direct visitors, you know, to, you know, the park from so it's probably a combination of different types of signs could be monument signs could be other other signs, but it would show, you know, particularly access.

1282
02:15:54,825 --> 02:15:58,589
Into the site and where where to park, depending on.

1283
02:15:59,229 --> 02:16:05,594
who you are and then exit where we want to direct those trips out of the site.

1284
02:16:05,614 --> 02:16:13,420
I think Fells Way will be the major entrance, but I think it was a good point about the address.

1285
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:27,410
If someone types the address into Waze and they're not familiar with the site, it's going to route them to Myrtle Street, may not be the place that we want them to go.

1286
02:16:34,189 --> 02:16:35,209
Okay, thank you.

1287
02:16:36,110 --> 02:16:39,811
I see Chris's comment is now in the chat, so I'm going to verbalize it.

1288
02:16:40,651 --> 02:16:47,954
Does anyone have any idea of what percentage of exiting or entering traffic will use the Amaranth side of the garage?

1289
02:16:49,135 --> 02:16:52,556
I agree with the consultant that the confluence of streets is a problem.

1290
02:16:55,746 --> 02:17:02,588
So I think I saw in the transportation demand management plan that there were some percentages.

1291
02:17:02,608 --> 02:17:04,729
I know we've got Scott on.

1292
02:17:05,269 --> 02:17:13,532
I don't know if they reflect the latest updates to the, it's a different part of the property, but it's a two-way traffic.

1293
02:17:13,632 --> 02:17:15,793
But yeah, maybe you could speak to that, Scott.

1294
02:17:16,272 --> 02:17:16,953
Yeah, sure.

1295
02:17:17,133 --> 02:17:18,273
Thanks Mr. Chair.

1296
02:17:18,314 --> 02:17:20,215
Scott Thornton with Vanessa Associates.

1297
02:17:20,955 --> 02:17:38,928
So we did have an estimate of about 30, between 30 and 40 percent of the traffic would use the Amaranth Ave access and the idea behind that was just based on the proximity of the parking spaces to that location.

1298
02:17:40,329 --> 02:17:45,033
Also, there's likely to be some traffic that wants to

1299
02:17:45,793 --> 02:17:56,018
head to the west and could access points to get to 93, for instance.

1300
02:17:56,438 --> 02:18:06,222
Some of those areas providing regional access to the area, depending on the time of day, could be more

1301
02:18:08,303 --> 02:18:20,235
easily or quickly accessed headed through Amaranth and then returning, whether it's Myrtle Street or Lawrence Street out to Spring Street.

1302
02:18:20,956 --> 02:18:24,960
But yeah, so somewhere in between 30 and 40 percent was the initial estimate.

1303
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:33,203
And I think that still holds with the latest plans that have been presented here tonight.

1304
02:18:33,664 --> 02:18:38,526
We're not anticipating a major change from that distribution.

1305
02:18:42,547 --> 02:18:42,707
OK.

1306
02:18:42,747 --> 02:18:43,147
Thank you.

1307
02:18:44,568 --> 02:18:48,990
Chris, did you have follow-ups or additional questions?

1308
02:18:53,162 --> 02:18:55,623
Can I just follow up on that point that Chris made?

1309
02:18:56,524 --> 02:18:56,724
Sure.

1310
02:18:57,384 --> 02:19:14,572
So, you know, just looking at the circulation of the streets, I mean, I understand how a percentage of the traffic might exit on Amaranth and head west, but it's almost impossible, it seems, to approach the site from the west.

1311
02:19:15,012 --> 02:19:19,474
And it seems like almost all of the traffic will have to come off of the Fellsway.

1312
02:19:21,383 --> 02:19:37,168
Yeah, I mean, we did, you know, the distribution was really based on, you know, where we think people are, or where census data indicates people work that live in the area.

1313
02:19:38,009 --> 02:19:44,691
And that with the combination of the existing travel patterns is where we got the distribution.

1314
02:19:45,071 --> 02:19:46,732
I do agree that at some times,

1315
02:19:48,872 --> 02:19:58,495
It's going to be more efficient for people to use Felsway if they're coming from the west or from the south.

1316
02:19:58,655 --> 02:20:02,276
But that's not going to be the case during all periods of the day.

1317
02:20:02,316 --> 02:20:06,497
So that's what the distribution is intended to address.

1318
02:20:07,977 --> 02:20:22,865
it fits the likely, what we expect to be the pattern of the assignment, excuse me, the assignment of the traffic during all the time periods involved.

1319
02:20:22,885 --> 02:20:34,151
Okay, thank you.

1320
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:36,352
Andre, did you have any

1321
02:20:36,795 --> 02:20:37,937
Follow ups on that one.

1322
02:20:37,957 --> 02:20:42,727
Not really.

1323
02:20:42,747 --> 02:20:43,288
I mean,

1324
02:20:45,866 --> 02:20:47,827
again, approaching the project from that way.

1325
02:20:47,867 --> 02:21:10,173
I mean, it seems like the only way you can get to that entrance, you know, off of Amaranth is to come down Lawrence, wind your way through Amaranth place and the condo project, and then into the project off of Amaranth, which seems really circuitous and almost impossible for anybody not super familiar with that.

1326
02:21:15,658 --> 02:21:16,439
OK, thank you.

1327
02:21:19,862 --> 02:21:23,785
Other questions from the board?

1328
02:21:25,526 --> 02:21:27,408
Jamie.

1329
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:42,220
On the intersection work, I guess my question is from the recommendations for improvement on lights, crosswalks that the beta brought up.

1330
02:21:43,434 --> 02:21:45,314
How do we, where does that go?

1331
02:21:45,534 --> 02:21:47,035
Is that something that goes to the city?

1332
02:21:47,115 --> 02:21:52,176
Is that something that we partner with the applicant on to scope?

1333
02:21:56,037 --> 02:21:58,617
I completely agree that all those intersections need work.

1334
02:21:59,257 --> 02:22:01,278
I just don't know how we can attribute it.

1335
02:22:06,799 --> 02:22:10,480
So my understanding is it depends a little bit on the intersection.

1336
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,220
So I think the,

1337
02:22:13,438 --> 02:22:21,941
the applicant could, in their response, indicate the intention to make some or all of those improvements.

1338
02:22:21,981 --> 02:22:26,702
And in some cases, it would just require permission from the city.

1339
02:22:27,962 --> 02:22:33,584
In other cases, it might be from the state, which is a little bit more complicated.

1340
02:22:33,604 --> 02:22:42,647
Yeah, the Spring Street Central intersection, I work over there, and that's a constant problem.

1341
02:22:43,833 --> 02:22:49,899
And especially if you're talking pedestrians, there's a blue bike station up in Haines Square, so people might be using that.

1342
02:22:50,039 --> 02:22:53,982
If the blue bike station's installed at the property, they obviously may come down that way.

1343
02:22:54,723 --> 02:23:01,509
But if there's pedestrians walking through, if there's additional pedestrian traffic, that intersection's absolutely a concern.

1344
02:23:06,534 --> 02:23:09,497
And they call it out, you know, lack of crosswalks, things like that.

1345
02:23:10,201 --> 02:23:15,166
Yeah, it's definitely something I hadn't thought about, but obviously comes out with this study.

1346
02:23:15,186 --> 02:23:18,529
Thanks, Jamie.

1347
02:23:18,709 --> 02:23:19,710
Jeff, do you have thoughts on that?

1348
02:23:22,162 --> 02:23:30,085
Um, yeah, it depends on how the city wants to prioritize those, of course, fells ways under jurisdiction.

1349
02:23:30,145 --> 02:23:31,405
So that's a little bit different.

1350
02:23:32,566 --> 02:23:38,848
The intersections completely under city control are going to be easier for you to address.

1351
02:23:39,768 --> 02:23:50,132
So, you know, central and spring, but, you know.

1352
02:23:54,827 --> 02:24:04,690
and operations and delay congestion, which may affect safety also.

1353
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:16,995
But I think it's up to the city to determine what their priorities are in terms of what improvements they think are reasonable and has a nexus to the project.

1354
02:24:22,117 --> 02:24:22,577
Thank you.

1355
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:27,122
Um, I'll, I'll go next.

1356
02:24:27,362 --> 02:24:44,215
So I would really like to get to the bottom of whether this two way traffic, um, on the entrance on, um, on Myrtle street does or doesn't make sense.

1357
02:24:44,275 --> 02:24:51,421
So I hear the resident concerns, uh, about.

1358
02:24:53,302 --> 02:25:05,293
The current setup resulting in a lot of additional trips where before there was the understanding that great care was being taken to avoid that.

1359
02:25:05,934 --> 02:25:11,979
I understand that there's a need for this to be open for fire access.

1360
02:25:14,772 --> 02:25:24,055
But I'm just not clear from the information provided just how much of a problem this is going to be for the neighborhood.

1361
02:25:25,315 --> 02:25:29,797
So yes, someone doing a drop-off.

1362
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:37,973
if it were closed off in some way, you may have to get back onto Myrtle in the one-way flow.

1363
02:25:38,974 --> 02:25:55,522
And so I think streamlining for that, I certainly understand the design considerations there, but then it does seem like there's a risk here that with the two-way traffic, it's kind of opening the floodgate and kind of it's a step backwards from a

1364
02:25:56,602 --> 02:26:00,746
trying to mitigate traffic on Myrtle Street standpoint.

1365
02:26:00,906 --> 02:26:03,548
I would love to get thoughts on that, Jeff.

1366
02:26:03,608 --> 02:26:16,738
I don't know if you've had the time to fully review that and have thoughts and comments ready to share on that or if that's something you need to think about more, but I would like to learn more about that.

1367
02:26:18,533 --> 02:26:32,571
You haven't have to think about that a little bit if the, you know, if the focus is to limit the number of trips on Myrtle street, you know, if you make it 1 way or, you know, make it 1 way in or.

1368
02:26:34,497 --> 02:26:45,323
then you have to think about how those trips will circulate, you know, within the site and where they're going to, you know, whether they'll end up on Myrtle, you know, anyways, or, you know, if they're going to do Fellsway.

1369
02:26:45,383 --> 02:26:48,124
So I think it's a good question.

1370
02:26:48,544 --> 02:26:59,950
Probably have to do a little more evaluation, you know, in combination with, you know, Scott and Vaness and think about this and what the,

1371
02:27:01,619 --> 02:27:06,842
What the impacts may be to, you know, if it's, you know, one way rather than two way.

1372
02:27:06,902 --> 02:27:08,924
So again, it's a good issue.

1373
02:27:09,004 --> 02:27:12,046
I think we'll need a little more discussion and evaluation of that.

1374
02:27:14,447 --> 02:27:15,308
Okay, thank you.

1375
02:27:16,668 --> 02:27:19,030
Other questions or comments from the board?

1376
02:27:21,325 --> 02:27:22,005
Yeah.

1377
02:27:22,605 --> 02:27:28,308
And I'm sorry, Jeff, if I'm not remembering this and what you talked about, but.

1378
02:27:29,548 --> 02:27:30,468
You know, the.

1379
02:27:31,689 --> 02:27:46,975
The pedestrian crossing there at Felsway and Myrtle, I mean, there's no, you know, there's no lights or any kind of pedestrian safety features there, except for a crosswalk and a very small median strip.

1380
02:27:47,035 --> 02:27:50,036
And, you know, and it seems like.

1381
02:27:51,136 --> 02:27:54,520
If we're going to have a lot more residents living on that corner.

1382
02:27:54,540 --> 02:28:01,006
Uh, it's more important for there to be some kind of something there at that intersection to.

1383
02:28:01,747 --> 02:28:04,990
To slow folks down or have, like, at least a pedestrian signal.

1384
02:28:06,812 --> 02:28:08,754
So, you know, did you think about that and.

1385
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:25,367
Yeah, so, um, in 1 of my slides, I talked about, um, considering a rectangular rapid flashing beacon.

1386
02:28:25,387 --> 02:28:30,411
Which is a pedestrian push button signal.

1387
02:28:32,373 --> 02:28:40,318
So yeah, I think some enhancement of that crossing is needed, especially since there's bus stops on both sides.

1388
02:28:40,718 --> 02:28:46,122
When I was out there, I saw people getting off the bus and crossing.

1389
02:28:48,443 --> 02:28:55,748
So I think that's kind of the base level, rectangular rapid flashing beacon.

1390
02:28:58,030 --> 02:29:03,473
To go further would be a full traffic signal, like they have at 4th Street.

1391
02:29:05,374 --> 02:29:12,138
But I do think some level of enhancement is required for safety at that crosswalk.

1392
02:29:19,722 --> 02:29:20,002
Thanks.

1393
02:29:20,182 --> 02:29:21,103
Sorry if I missed that.

1394
02:29:22,498 --> 02:29:27,842
Yeah, I share the concerns about pedestrian safety at that crosswalk.

1395
02:29:29,224 --> 02:29:32,466
Good point on the bus stops on both sides.

1396
02:29:32,486 --> 02:29:42,354
So if we do have residents that are taking the bus in on their commute, presumably they'll be getting off the bus on the other side of Fells Way.

1397
02:29:43,695 --> 02:29:51,262
And then the other thing, and I understand that there's elements of this that may just be hard to change in general, I do really

1398
02:29:52,687 --> 02:30:07,982
worry about this expectation in the evening commute that the residents are going to drive up Fells Way, pass the project, do a U-turn.

1399
02:30:08,002 --> 02:30:09,884
It's just going to be

1400
02:30:12,705 --> 02:30:19,688
I could be wrong, but all the indications are getting seemed it to point to that this, this could be a problem.

1401
02:30:19,728 --> 02:30:24,469
And so I, I just, I would love to know what can be done there.

1402
02:30:24,549 --> 02:30:28,651
I understand it needs ECR permission, but you know, I, I am concerned about that.

1403
02:30:38,718 --> 02:30:42,419
Other questions or comments from the board?

1404
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,580
Just I agree with what you're saying, Mike.

1405
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:58,382
I mean, I understand the butters concerns about increased traffic on Myrtle Street, but I think it's actually.

1406
02:30:59,522 --> 02:31:03,683
Far more dangerous to have everybody do a U turn.

1407
02:31:07,528 --> 02:31:25,993
Well, I actually view the two as somewhat separate, because as I understand it, if you're heading north, which I think would be the most common mode, if you had to guess where people are going to work, it's probably somewhere in the urban core, I think you still have to do the U-turn.

1408
02:31:26,113 --> 02:31:29,634
Or you have to do multiple side streets.

1409
02:31:30,034 --> 02:31:34,275
So I think the Myrtle versus not,

1410
02:31:36,343 --> 02:31:41,471
could impact a little bit more the departure from the property.

1411
02:31:41,511 --> 02:31:48,642
But I think coming back, if you're heading north, a lot of folks, that U-turn is going to be their best option, even if it's two-way.

1412
02:32:01,407 --> 02:32:07,896
Robert Parkhurst, PB – He, Him, His): All right, well I'm not seeing other members of the board that would like to speak on this matter.

1413
02:32:07,916 --> 02:32:08,858
Robert Parkhurst, PB – He, Him, His.:

1414
02:32:08,858 --> 02:32:11,021
: And so the

1415
02:32:15,859 --> 02:32:19,501
To be safe, I think we should reopen public comment.

1416
02:32:19,541 --> 02:32:25,063
I know we've had public comment on traffic before, but there's some new content we've discussed.

1417
02:32:25,624 --> 02:32:30,726
I believe some of the members of the public who showed up here already shared their comments on the traffic.

1418
02:32:30,866 --> 02:32:33,928
But yeah, I want to make sure we don't

1419
02:32:35,786 --> 02:32:38,567
leave anyone out who was waiting to speak on this matter.

1420
02:32:38,667 --> 02:32:46,648
So chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the traffic peer review.

1421
02:32:46,668 --> 02:32:50,009
Do I have a second?

1422
02:32:50,809 --> 02:32:51,049
Second.

1423
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:54,430
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1424
02:32:54,450 --> 02:32:55,670
Yvette?

1425
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,971
Aye.

1426
02:32:57,631 --> 02:32:58,111
Andre?

1427
02:32:58,131 --> 02:32:58,191
Aye.

1428
02:33:00,491 --> 02:33:00,991
Jamie?

1429
02:33:02,072 --> 02:33:02,192
Aye.

1430
02:33:02,812 --> 02:33:03,152
Jim?

1431
02:33:03,912 --> 02:33:04,092
Aye.

1432
02:33:04,796 --> 02:33:05,416
Mike, aye.

1433
02:33:05,436 --> 02:33:12,060
All right, public comment is now open on the traffic peer review comments.

1434
02:33:13,621 --> 02:33:25,507
If you'd like to speak on this matter, please raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, and type in the chat, or you can email dennisdmcdougallatmitford-ma.gov.

1435
02:33:26,187 --> 02:33:30,910
I see we have Allison D. again, so please state your name and address for the record.

1436
02:33:33,514 --> 02:33:33,914
Thank you.

1437
02:33:34,014 --> 02:33:36,035
Hi, Alison D'Agostino.

1438
02:33:36,335 --> 02:33:39,997
I am representing 1022-1024 Pillsbury.

1439
02:33:41,198 --> 02:33:42,278
Excuse me, I have a cold.

1440
02:33:43,379 --> 02:33:47,241
But thank you for opening this back up.

1441
02:33:47,521 --> 02:33:52,884
I just want to first comment, thank you for this peer review.

1442
02:33:54,304 --> 02:33:58,486
The fact that all these intersections have been declared this F rating is,

1443
02:33:59,815 --> 02:34:06,378
eye opening, and also seems very on point with what I experienced day to day.

1444
02:34:06,538 --> 02:34:12,801
So one comment I just want to say, and thank you very much for raising it.

1445
02:34:13,682 --> 02:34:19,585
I think obviously the intersection with Amaranth, Lawrence, Myrtle, very critical.

1446
02:34:20,465 --> 02:34:28,569
And I'll tell you right now, I live one house in off the Fells Way to Myrtle,

1447
02:34:29,242 --> 02:34:39,046
I have to, on a daily basis, look multiple times because someone's whipping around the corner to come down Myrtle Street.

1448
02:34:40,066 --> 02:34:44,688
I've almost personally been hit by a car living here at least three or four times.

1449
02:34:45,068 --> 02:34:57,112
So to me, the critical areas that I really would respect the board and others to look at, Davis Company, it's Myrtle and Felsway,

1450
02:34:58,841 --> 02:35:04,864
100% the turnaround with Myrtle and, excuse me, the Felsway and Central.

1451
02:35:05,584 --> 02:35:15,049
With the Felsway and DCR, they created these new like kind of pop-outs for walkways, which is great for pedestrians.

1452
02:35:15,209 --> 02:35:20,871
But what it has caused is that that U-turn is not really accessible for larger vehicles.

1453
02:35:21,091 --> 02:35:22,332
So I just wanted to raise that.

1454
02:35:23,032 --> 02:35:24,172
as well as a concern.

1455
02:35:25,133 --> 02:35:31,635
My husband, it's funny, in the presentation, his truck was the one that you guys saw, the Dodge Ram there.

1456
02:35:32,636 --> 02:35:43,080
But he has to actually go down Central, down Kendall, down Myrtle to be able to come to our home, then down Amaranth with that little turnaround.

1457
02:35:44,233 --> 02:35:46,274
back on the Fells Way to come to our home.

1458
02:35:46,695 --> 02:35:58,041
So if any of these occupants of this building will have pickup trucks, larger vehicles, they cannot do the U-turn at the Fells Way and Central.

1459
02:35:59,102 --> 02:36:01,623
I think you definitely need to consider that in your assessment.

1460
02:36:04,167 --> 02:36:16,746
Anyways, my, my final comment is just thank you for even bringing this up, I really appreciate this about the board and and the Davis company I watched also extend they have been very.

1461
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:23,083
you know, vocal and helpful in trying to have these conversations.

1462
02:36:23,143 --> 02:36:25,865
So I don't think that's come across this meeting.

1463
02:36:26,005 --> 02:36:38,613
But from my opinion, as someone as a long term resident representing by a two year old mother in law who's owned this house for 50 plus years, you know, it really has been great.

1464
02:36:39,634 --> 02:36:43,617
But to see that the traffic assessment is being taken very seriously at this point,

1465
02:36:44,097 --> 02:36:49,139
especially Lawrence and Myrtle, Felsway, I thank you very much.

1466
02:36:50,619 --> 02:37:07,004
But just wanted to point that out, really the curb cutouts, the new, I guess, DCR code, I think needs to be considered because you can't even make a U-turn if you have a large vehicle at Central and Felsway.

1467
02:37:07,304 --> 02:37:09,605
So I'll stop there.

1468
02:37:09,885 --> 02:37:10,185
Thank you.

1469
02:37:17,128 --> 02:37:19,629
Christina Katch, name and address for the record, please.

1470
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:22,470
Christina Katch, 130 Myrtle Street.

1471
02:37:23,991 --> 02:37:42,058
I haven't said anything about this previously because I never thought we'd actually get to a point where we considered crosswalks and stop signs and the current state of driving in this neighborhood, including that U-turn at Central, Lawrence,

1472
02:37:43,777 --> 02:37:46,558
We have a number of one-way streets in this neighborhood.

1473
02:37:46,578 --> 02:37:48,458
You can only go up and down them in a certain way.

1474
02:37:50,419 --> 02:37:59,262
As a long-term resident that has run literally thousands of miles on these streets, Allison, I'm going to start waving to you when I run by your house now.

1475
02:38:00,862 --> 02:38:03,323
People do not stop at the stop signs.

1476
02:38:03,383 --> 02:38:12,966
People do not stop at those flashing triangle crosswalks when I'm standing in them, when I take the bus

1477
02:38:13,676 --> 02:38:18,457
to the train station, people do not stop on the Fells Way to let you cross.

1478
02:38:21,598 --> 02:38:29,921
There's a couple of stop signs in the neighborhood, or excuse me, streetlights in the neighborhood that don't have pedestrian signals at all.

1479
02:38:30,461 --> 02:38:36,323
You just kind of got a time when the red light is happening and when nobody's turning right so you don't get hit.

1480
02:38:37,658 --> 02:38:47,346
So I'm glad that the conversation is coming up about pedestrian safety because it's rough out there in those streets for pedestrians.

1481
02:38:48,007 --> 02:38:53,091
Not to mention the sidewalks are not great, but that's the town of Bedford.

1482
02:38:57,494 --> 02:38:57,854
Thank you.

1483
02:38:57,874 --> 02:39:04,760
Do we have other members of the public that would like to speak on this matter?

1484
02:39:10,511 --> 02:39:19,458
Seeing none, chair awaits a motion to close public comment on the traffic peer review letter.

1485
02:39:20,579 --> 02:39:21,820
So moved.

1486
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,181
Second?

1487
02:39:23,402 --> 02:39:23,762
Second.

1488
02:39:24,683 --> 02:39:25,844
Take a roll call.

1489
02:39:26,804 --> 02:39:27,345
Jamie?

1490
02:39:28,466 --> 02:39:28,566
Aye.

1491
02:39:29,346 --> 02:39:29,707
Jim?

1492
02:39:30,688 --> 02:39:30,828
Aye.

1493
02:39:31,448 --> 02:39:31,728
Beth?

1494
02:39:32,889 --> 02:39:33,130
Aye.

1495
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:34,471
Andre?

1496
02:39:34,491 --> 02:39:35,371
Aye.

1497
02:39:36,152 --> 02:39:36,432
Mike?

1498
02:39:36,953 --> 02:39:37,093
Aye.

1499
02:39:38,474 --> 02:39:38,754
All right.

1500
02:39:40,340 --> 02:39:42,921
public comment on this matter is now closed.

1501
02:39:43,762 --> 02:39:48,825
Okay, so that brings us to the end of our planned items for tonight.

1502
02:39:50,086 --> 02:40:00,752
And so I do just want to take a brief moment to level set on expectations for our next meeting.

1503
02:40:01,232 --> 02:40:05,454
So let's see, I'm just gonna pull it back up.

1504
02:40:14,827 --> 02:40:24,272
All right.

1505
02:40:24,513 --> 02:40:25,693
Sorry, it's just taking a minute.

1506
02:40:25,733 --> 02:40:27,034
I should have had it open already.

1507
02:40:40,161 --> 02:40:42,803
OK, here we go.

1508
02:40:45,580 --> 02:41:03,732
So in terms of the schedule we originally aligned on, we've talked about the architecture and initial peer review comments on that.

1509
02:41:03,772 --> 02:41:08,575
We've talked about civil, but we don't have the initial peer review comments on that.

1510
02:41:09,216 --> 02:41:11,978
We've now talked about traffic and the initial peer review

1511
02:41:12,942 --> 02:41:13,682
comments on that.

1512
02:41:14,062 --> 02:41:18,744
We've done multiple iterations on the architectural plans.

1513
02:41:21,204 --> 02:41:26,106
So we still need to do the peer review comments on engineering.

1514
02:41:26,866 --> 02:41:36,749
We need the updates to the architectural plans and the engineering to be reflected.

1515
02:41:36,929 --> 02:41:39,750
And then the board needs to get to

1516
02:41:41,703 --> 02:41:43,824
the requested waivers and proposed conditions.

1517
02:41:43,864 --> 02:41:45,984
So there's a lot we need to do and not a lot of time.

1518
02:41:46,144 --> 02:41:51,966
And so our next scheduled session is on April 22nd.

1519
02:41:52,146 --> 02:42:03,608
My understanding is by then, we're going to have so that we will have the peer review feedback on civil.

1520
02:42:04,169 --> 02:42:09,050
It sounds like before that meeting, but it's a little unclear how much before that meeting.

1521
02:42:10,183 --> 02:42:16,245
The applicant will have had some time to review it, but may not have full responses ready.

1522
02:42:16,945 --> 02:42:29,508
So it'll mostly be the applicant responses to the traffic peer review, the civil peer review, and maybe just general project updates.

1523
02:42:30,148 --> 02:42:32,589
So I want to check in with Mr. Noon.

1524
02:42:32,629 --> 02:42:37,610
Is that consistent with your plan and understanding?

1525
02:42:40,153 --> 02:42:52,666
Um, I think so, um, so, uh, as we have been thinking about the next hearing, we've been putting some effort into prepare.

1526
02:42:53,427 --> 02:42:56,670
For an architectural update, just having received those comments.

1527
02:42:57,491 --> 02:42:57,591
Um.

1528
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:05,485
And scheduling a peer review session with with Mister bomber for for next week.

1529
02:43:07,587 --> 02:43:14,513
Personally, I wasn't aware that the beta would be presenting this evening on the on the traffic items.

1530
02:43:14,693 --> 02:43:18,817
So I think it does make sense for us having those comments to.

1531
02:43:20,138 --> 02:43:29,523
Just with it fresh in everyone's mind to to, um, focus some attention in the in this in the hearing on the 20, I believe it's the 23rd, Mr chair, just to confirm that as well.

1532
02:43:29,583 --> 02:43:30,844
It's the 2 Tuesday.

1533
02:43:30,864 --> 02:43:31,884
The Tuesday.

1534
02:43:31,944 --> 02:43:34,846
Yeah, that's Tuesday is the 23rd.

1535
02:43:34,866 --> 02:43:36,547
Then I misspoke.

1536
02:43:36,627 --> 02:43:36,987
So, yeah.

1537
02:43:38,083 --> 02:44:02,746
uh... so at the i think at that hearing we uh... it would be our intention to try to have some response to the traffic i don't want to speak for scott i know that he's working through it and frankly we haven't had the chance to connect on uh... where he is in that process think we got those comments late friday evening last week uh... so a couple days into the review process so and if i may suggest uh...

1538
02:44:04,347 --> 02:44:10,449
That we follow up with some sort of intended agenda if that's okay with the board.

1539
02:44:10,489 --> 02:44:18,831
I think the idea would be to respond in some fashion to traffic and in some fashion to architectural architectural comments.

1540
02:44:20,151 --> 02:44:24,032
Not having the civil comments, it's really hard to say if we could be ready for the 23rd for that.

1541
02:44:24,072 --> 02:44:28,973
So some combination of traffic and architecture, I think would be the goal for us.

1542
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:33,691
Okay, that sounds reasonable to me.

1543
02:44:33,771 --> 02:44:39,996
And yes, if you wanna follow up and confirm the agenda, that's much appreciated.

1544
02:44:40,456 --> 02:44:56,347
Main thing I want us to be on the same page about is we're really gonna need all of the responses and plan updates to coalesce by that May 9th meeting to have any

1545
02:44:58,736 --> 02:45:03,677
realistic shot of sticking to the May 21st closure.

1546
02:45:03,697 --> 02:45:17,841
So, you know, if, as you discuss the schedule and get back to us, if it seems like we're getting into the territory where it may just not be feasible to provide all the requested

1547
02:45:19,076 --> 02:45:45,133
information within the previously aligned timeline, certainly be willing to explore a very short extension beyond May 21st if that's the preference, but I'm just letting it be known now that to really stick to this May 21st date, we need the

1548
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:52,315
everything converged, and we're just talking about waivers and proposing by that May 9th date.

1549
02:45:55,037 --> 02:45:55,697
Yeah, I'm understood.

1550
02:45:55,758 --> 02:46:12,490
I think with peer review comments in hand for two of the three disciplines, if we can get civil soon, our team will certainly be diligent about making sure that we get submitted with responses and can provide information at the upcoming hearings to address comments and questions.

1551
02:46:13,271 --> 02:46:13,531
Okay.

1552
02:46:14,432 --> 02:46:14,672
Great.

1553
02:46:15,052 --> 02:46:15,473
Sounds good.

1554
02:46:15,513 --> 02:46:15,773
Thank you.

1555
02:46:17,558 --> 02:46:22,244
So that's all I had for logistical items.

1556
02:46:22,645 --> 02:46:30,676
So if there's nothing else, we can move on to some of the administrative items on the agenda.

1557
02:46:31,922 --> 02:46:34,323
So actually, before we do that, we've got to continue.

1558
02:46:34,363 --> 02:46:47,828
So a chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to Tuesday, April 23rd at 6.30 PM.

1559
02:46:49,809 --> 02:46:52,009
Do I have a second?

1560
02:46:52,029 --> 02:46:53,010
Second.

1561
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:55,311
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1562
02:46:55,391 --> 02:46:55,891
Jamie?

1563
02:46:55,911 --> 02:46:57,151
Aye.

1564
02:46:57,812 --> 02:46:58,212
Jim?

1565
02:46:58,992 --> 02:46:59,212
Aye.

1566
02:46:59,712 --> 02:47:00,092
Yvette?

1567
02:47:01,333 --> 02:47:01,473
Aye.

1568
02:47:02,487 --> 02:47:02,907
Andre?

1569
02:47:02,927 --> 02:47:03,908
Aye.

1570
02:47:04,869 --> 02:47:05,149
Mike?

1571
02:47:05,689 --> 02:47:05,809
Aye.

1572
02:47:06,350 --> 02:47:06,690
All right.

1573
02:47:06,930 --> 02:47:08,111
Uh, this matter is continued.

1574
02:47:08,351 --> 02:47:09,172
Uh, thanks folks.

1575
02:47:09,212 --> 02:47:11,613
We appreciate the update and the responses.

1576
02:47:13,855 --> 02:47:14,095
All right.

1577
02:47:14,255 --> 02:47:18,098
Uh, Dennis, could you please move on to the next item on the agenda?

1578
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:21,280
Sure.

1579
02:47:22,101 --> 02:47:22,341
Sorry.

1580
02:47:22,881 --> 02:47:30,827
When I restarted my computer, I had to, a lot of things kind of went off and I'm just realizing things are not up that were up before.

1581
02:47:36,097 --> 02:47:45,967
But we have the administrative updates, so I think, since we have everyone on, do we want to sort of just discuss the timing for the other meeting?

1582
02:47:45,987 --> 02:47:48,389
The email you sent out earlier?

1583
02:47:48,429 --> 02:47:48,970
Yeah, sure.

1584
02:47:49,130 --> 02:47:51,833
So I did get some responses.

1585
02:47:52,694 --> 02:47:59,440
So there's, this is unrelated to the current, or you'll be hearing the

1586
02:48:00,592 --> 02:48:05,736
The board does need to schedule an additional special meeting.

1587
02:48:05,836 --> 02:48:23,109
So on April 3rd, the board received an application and a request for a hearing on the Mystic Ave

1588
02:48:26,342 --> 02:48:32,104
40B, which that one was remanded back to the board by the HAC.

1589
02:48:32,904 --> 02:48:38,586
And so we need to reopen the hearing within 30 days.

1590
02:48:39,547 --> 02:48:46,389
And due to the notice requirements, we're going to have to have that sometime

1591
02:48:50,173 --> 02:48:53,735
basically the week of April 29th.

1592
02:48:54,775 --> 02:49:03,819
And so I checked with the board on two candidate dates, April 30th and May 2nd.

1593
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:09,762
This would be a short meeting where we're not going to hear testimony.

1594
02:49:09,782 --> 02:49:12,763
We're going to take some procedural steps and then continue.

1595
02:49:12,783 --> 02:49:17,105
We might let the applicant introduce themselves.

1596
02:49:19,297 --> 02:49:33,161
But so I heard back, and it looks like the availability is there on 4-30.

1597
02:49:33,882 --> 02:49:36,743
So 4-30 will be the date for that special meeting.

1598
02:49:38,603 --> 02:49:42,284
The only agenda item will be that case.

1599
02:49:45,790 --> 02:49:47,891
Like I said, it will be a procedural meeting.

1600
02:49:48,091 --> 02:49:55,452
So the board needs to consider whether to authorize the city to retain peer review consultants.

1601
02:49:55,692 --> 02:50:07,015
I mean, talk about a 40B consultant and pick a date to continue the matter so that there's time to retain those consultants.

1602
02:50:07,735 --> 02:50:09,576
So yeah.

1603
02:50:11,296 --> 02:50:14,077
My estimate is we'll be able to do that in 30 minutes or less.

1604
02:50:15,285 --> 02:50:24,047
but no promises, but Tuesday, April 30th, 6.30 is the chosen date.

1605
02:50:24,067 --> 02:50:26,308
Does that sound good, Dennis?

1606
02:50:28,228 --> 02:50:28,528
Perfect.

1607
02:50:29,028 --> 02:50:31,469
I will get the notice out to the paper tomorrow.

1608
02:50:32,989 --> 02:50:33,369
Wonderful.

1609
02:50:33,509 --> 02:50:33,869
Thank you.

1610
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:36,050
All right.

1611
02:50:39,491 --> 02:50:40,731
Other administrative updates?

1612
02:50:45,316 --> 02:50:46,937
I don't think there's anything else on my end.

1613
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:52,740
All right.

1614
02:50:53,981 --> 02:50:57,322
Well, in that case, what's the next item on the agenda?

1615
02:51:02,405 --> 02:51:06,147
Just the approval of meeting minutes, which I believe I sent out.

1616
02:51:08,128 --> 02:51:08,548
Yeah.

1617
02:51:08,828 --> 02:51:11,470
The Google Drive where they are with the ones in the draft folder.

1618
02:51:12,628 --> 02:51:13,208
as I have them.

1619
02:51:13,268 --> 02:51:15,690
So that was the way I decided to approach it this time.

1620
02:51:15,730 --> 02:51:21,733
So right now in the draft folder, there are the meeting minutes for 1-11-24 and 2-15-24.

1621
02:51:21,953 --> 02:51:24,035
Yes.

1622
02:51:24,275 --> 02:51:26,516
Yeah, that's consistent with my understanding.

1623
02:51:26,596 --> 02:51:29,478
So I have had a chance to review them.

1624
02:51:29,578 --> 02:51:36,702
Others, have you had a chance to review the meeting minutes for the 40B for January 11th and February 15th?

1625
02:51:44,820 --> 02:51:47,421
I found the meeting minutes to be in order.

1626
02:51:47,441 --> 02:51:55,405
I prefer not to be the one making a motion from the chair and get away with it.

1627
02:51:59,967 --> 02:52:05,529
Motion to approve the minutes for January 14th, no, January 20th.

1628
02:52:05,549 --> 02:52:05,689
Sorry.

1629
02:52:05,729 --> 02:52:07,450
January 11th and February 15th.

1630
02:52:14,728 --> 02:52:18,511
Motion to approve the meeting minutes for January 11th and February 15th.

1631
02:52:18,531 --> 02:52:21,294
Do I have a second?

1632
02:52:21,314 --> 02:52:22,334
Second.

1633
02:52:22,394 --> 02:52:25,577
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1634
02:52:26,418 --> 02:52:26,858
Yvette?

1635
02:52:28,239 --> 02:52:28,379
Aye.

1636
02:52:29,160 --> 02:52:29,620
Andre?

1637
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:31,282
Aye.

1638
02:52:33,363 --> 02:52:33,703
Jim?

1639
02:52:34,464 --> 02:52:34,584
Aye.

1640
02:52:35,345 --> 02:52:35,725
Jamie?

1641
02:52:36,806 --> 02:52:36,926
Aye.

1642
02:52:37,587 --> 02:52:37,787
Mike?

1643
02:52:38,087 --> 02:52:38,207
Aye.

1644
02:52:38,507 --> 02:52:40,449
All right, the meeting minutes are approved.

1645
02:52:42,058 --> 02:52:45,279
Thank you, Rachel and Dennis for that.

1646
02:52:46,979 --> 02:52:47,319
All right.

1647
02:52:47,519 --> 02:52:50,680
I think that brings us to the end of our agenda, correct?

1648
02:52:52,961 --> 02:52:53,241
Correct.

1649
02:52:53,741 --> 02:52:54,081
All right.

1650
02:52:55,121 --> 02:52:57,022
Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

1651
02:52:59,262 --> 02:52:59,822
Motion to adjourn.

1652
02:52:59,842 --> 02:53:01,263
Do we have a second?

1653
02:53:01,283 --> 02:53:02,123
Second.

1654
02:53:03,123 --> 02:53:03,443
All right.

1655
02:53:03,463 --> 02:53:05,143
We're going to take a roll call.

1656
02:53:06,044 --> 02:53:06,544
Jamie?

1657
02:53:07,564 --> 02:53:07,664
Aye.

1658
02:53:08,444 --> 02:53:08,904
Andre?

1659
02:53:08,924 --> 02:53:09,664
Aye.

1660
02:53:10,365 --> 02:53:10,725
Jim?

1661
02:53:11,245 --> 02:53:11,745
Aye.

1662
02:53:12,710 --> 02:53:19,995
That I always forget if I'm supposed to call everyone.

1663
02:53:20,035 --> 02:53:21,275
So we're just going to do it, Chris.

1664
02:53:22,376 --> 02:53:23,857
Hi, Mary.

1665
02:53:23,877 --> 02:53:26,639
Hi, Mike.

1666
02:53:26,659 --> 02:53:27,019
Hi.

1667
02:53:27,259 --> 02:53:28,420
All right, you're adjourned.
