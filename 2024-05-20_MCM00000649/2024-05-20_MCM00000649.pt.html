 Pessoal, se vocês não estão familiarizados com o processo abrangente de licenciamento, presumo que esta seja uma audiência com várias sessões nos últimos cinco meses.
 nós estivemos
 aprender vários assuntos relacionados a este caso.
 A agenda central desta tarde é a engenharia civil, bem como a revisão por pares do estudo de tráfego.
 E sim, essa é a intenção para hoje.
 Aceitaremos comentários públicos sobre esses assuntos.
 Vejo que temos o Sr. Pat Noon como candidato.
 Então vá em frente, por favor.
 Bem-vindo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=180.897s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Olá pessoal.
 Obrigado, senhor presidente, membros do conselho.
 Sim, então estamos aqui.
 Apresentaremos e forneceremos uma atualização especificamente sobre nosso projeto civil.
 Os membros da nossa equipe estão aqui.
 Vou perguntar a Steve Majorano se ele pode.
 compartilhe a tela e ele será o slide mestre esta noite.
 Vou começar aqui simplesmente atualizando onde estamos desde nossa última audiência e preparando a mesa para Steve e sua equipe assumirem.
 Obrigado.
 Então, vamos começar, uma pequena atualização em termos de onde estamos desde nossa audiência anterior, há algumas semanas.
 No que diz respeito à revisão pelos pares, registámos progressos em vários aspectos.
 Senhor Presidente, como você mencionou sobre o trânsito, na semana passada recebemos comentários de Beda sobre a análise de impacto do transporte e estamos em processo de revisão e assimilação deles e de preparação de respostas formais.
 Temos Scott Thornton na ligação esta noite.
 A resposta a esses comentários não faz parte desta apresentação formal.
 mas vejo que os membros da equipe beta estão aqui e podem falar diretamente com os comentários.
 Mas nós os recebemos e estamos em processo de revisão e organizaremos uma sessão de acompanhamento de revisão por pares com essa equipe para discuti-los assim que tivermos a oportunidade de digeri-los completamente.
 Do lado arquitetônico, recebemos comentários de Cliff.
 Comentários de Cliff Bowmer da Davis Square Architects.
 Agradecemos seus comentários e estamos no processo de revisá-los e preparar respostas.
 E estamos coordenando uma sessão de acompanhamento de revisão por pares com Cliff para a próxima semana.
 E estaremos preparados para ler seus comentários e continuar
 incorporá-los e trabalhar com ele antes das próximas audiências onde poderemos revisar e apresentar arquitetura novamente.
 E então, de uma perspectiva civil, recebemos
 uma nota de BEDA que continua trabalhando.
 Ainda não recebemos formalmente o seu feedback, portanto esta noite não representa o feedback da revisão por pares.
 Neste ponto, quando recebemos feedback, dependendo do nível de feedback e da necessidade de fazer quaisquer ajustes ou abordar
 Certamente faremos isso assim que os tivermos e não falarei novamente pela equipe beta que está na chamada, mas da nossa perspectiva, é onde estamos sentados agora e ansiosos pela apresentação desta noite.
 Acho que esta apresentação responderá a muitas perguntas.
 Tentamos adaptá-lo para focar em coisas que foram discutidas em audiências anteriores, questões que foram levantadas antes, tentando dar o máximo de esclarecimento possível.
 Com isso, se você quiser passar para o próximo slide, Steve, eu farei isso por você.
 Passarei para vocês em um momento, apenas com uma última nota em termos de assistência da minha equipe.
 O Sr. Peter Tam de Goulston não está aqui esta noite.
 Patrick Gallagher, que também é de Goulston e está no time, não está aqui no momento.
 Ele participará da convocação um pouco mais tarde na audiência.
 Então, se houver alguma dúvida,
 que são específicos do lado legal das coisas e ele não está lá, eu poderia adiar até que ele estivesse.
 Ele chegará um pouco mais tarde esta noite.
 Só quero ressaltar isso para qualquer pessoa que entrar em contato comigo ou com a equipe jurídica posteriormente na audiência.
 Dito isto, Steve, se você quiser começar a apresentação, seria ótimo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=455.983s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  Great.
 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=1935.873s">[MCM00000650_SPEAKER_12]</a>: Senhor, obrigado.
 Boa noite a todos.
 Esta é, então, uma visão geral da paisagem.
 A maior parte é semelhante ao que foi apresentado em audiências anteriores que acho que a maioria de vocês já viu.
 Nós, como Steve mencionou, o site atual é
 completamente impermeáveis e estamos a introduzir um aumento significativo de áreas permeáveis e espaços abertos, a maioria dos quais serão acessíveis e utilizáveis ao público, incluindo o
 corredor e o parque infantil que fica ao lado do edifício.
 Como você pode ver, o número um é a entrada de visitantes da área de entrega.
 Dois é um playground.
 O número três é um parque para cães com grama sintética.
 Todos eles são cercados por árvores propostas e plantações adicionais que agregarão valor estético e também melhorarão a capacidade de águas pluviais do local e criarão uma melhor experiência de espaço aberto para o bairro.
 O número quatro são os bicicletários que ficam localizados ao lado do depósito de bicicletas e oferecem capacidade adicional de estacionamento para bicicletas.
 No número 5, existem vários equipamentos de fitness incluídos ao longo daquele sinuoso passadiço que desce até chegar ao número 8, que é o futuro, uma potencial ligação à futura linha ferroviária.
 O número seis é aquela passarela que proporciona uma área verde ajardinada no lado oeste do edifício para proteger o estacionamento no nível do solo e proporcionar uma melhor integração com o bairro à medida que o edifício é rebaixado e então criamos uma borda mais suave com o paisagismo proposto e árvores e mais arbustos e plantações perenes.
 uh, e, uh, também cria um caminho adicional, além da calçada proposta que Steve, uh, uh, uh, mencionou, uh, estamos adicionando a Amarant que a passarela adicional pode ser usada para, uh, caminhar e andar de bicicleta e pode no futuro se tornar parte dessa, uh, rede de bicicletas que pode conectar o bairro a essa linha ferroviária.
 E o número 10 é onde pretendemos potencialmente, após uma maior coordenação, incluir uma estação de bicicletas azul, o que parece ser uma boa adição a esta área junto à paragem de autocarro e melhorar a capacidade de trânsito da área.
 E você também pode ver os pátios.
 Dispomos de dois pátios com programação diferenciada que ficam contíguos às áreas de serviço interiores.
 Temos piscina, além de áreas verdes e programas ao ar livre para uso dos moradores no segundo andar.
 Próximo slide, por favor.
 E esta é uma visão geral do plano de iluminação e da nossa estratégia de iluminação, que utilizará uma combinação de diferentes luminárias, desde conjuntos de parede, postes de iluminação para pedestres, postes de iluminação maiores para áreas de estacionamento e postes de amarração.
 E trabalhámos com o design de iluminação para garantir que todas as luminárias são compatíveis com LED e Dark Sky e evitam repercussões nas áreas adjacentes, ao mesmo tempo que fornecem os níveis de luz adequados necessários para todos os espaços exteriores em termos de segurança e acessibilidade para as pessoas que estacionam em redor do edifício.
 Estas são apenas uma visão mais detalhada das comodidades, espaços ao ar livre e recursos de espaço aberto que foram mostrados na visão geral com algumas imagens anteriores adicionais e imagens de inspiração para lhe dar uma ideia de como será esse espaço em termos de
 sua aparência e como funcionará e os materiais que serão usados nesse potencial.
 A praça frontal será aberta, provavelmente mais leve, com paralelepípedos e plantas adicionais que darão um aspecto agradável e acolhedor ao edifício.
 Próximo slide.
 Isto é muito semelhante ao aspecto do parque infantil, com a adição de cercas adequadas e provavelmente assentos adicionais e pequenos equipamentos lúdicos que podem ser usados ​​pelos residentes e vizinhos.
 O parque canino é, como você pode ver, o número três.
 Nós intencionalmente afastamos o parque para cães da rua e o cercamos com mais árvores plantadas para filtrar qualquer ruído adicional que pudesse ser causado.
 produzido pelo uso do parque para cães e também está a uma distância conveniente para os residentes usarem todos os dias.
 Alguns apresentam imagens dos equipamentos de ginástica e dos bicicletários que ficarão ao longo da passarela que leva ao lado oeste do prédio.
 e o que ele pode fornecer para as pessoas usá-lo.
 O próximo.
 Estas são fotos de pessoas para mostrar como será o paisagismo e a passarela em termos de fornecer espaço para as pessoas correrem, andarem de bicicleta e também adicionar uma tela verde contra o edifício e proteger a passarela da rua e dos carros estacionados e a fachada do edifício.
 Algumas imagens inspiradoras dos pátios e das comodidades que eles incluirão para uso dos moradores.
 E esta é a estação de bicicletas azul que mencionei.
 Há espaço contra isso.
 Achamos que seria um local adequado, mas obviamente você tem que olhar mais detalhadamente quando estiver trabalhando com bicicletas azuis para colocar essa estação no melhor lugar possível para as pessoas acessarem e usarem.
 Acho que esse é o último slide.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2419.579s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sim, esse é o nosso último slide.
 Sim, a bicicleta azul, só para contextualizar o motivo pelo qual escolhemos a bicicleta azul lá, muitas vezes eles a querem em propriedade privada, mas adjacente à calçada pública em um local bem visível para que as pessoas saibam que ela está lá.
 Então escolhemos este local, mas obviamente há alguma flexibilidade na paisagem daquele recanto.
 A Blue Bike pensava diferente.
 Encontraremos um novo lar para ele, mas faz muito sentido.
 Foi bem no ponto de ônibus.
 As pessoas poderiam pegar uma bicicleta azul até o ônibus e depois estacioná-la lá e entrar no ônibus, ou poderiam pegar o ônibus e descer, pegar sua bicicleta azul e ir até seu...
 apenas mais perto de sua casa.
 Então é um bom lugar.
 Achamos que é uma boa adição ao projeto.
 Mas isso conclui nossa apresentação.
 Pat, não sei se você tem alguma nota final ou quer chegar ao final.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2470.844s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, não especificamente, só posso terminar um pouco, e fechando a bicicleta azul também pensei especificamente. Tive uma conversa preliminar com algumas pessoas da equipe azul, apenas tentando entendê-las.
 sua opinião sobre a viabilidade naquele local.
 Em geral, concordam que é uma boa localização, não só em termos de dimensões, mas também em locais próximos de outras estações que consideram adequadas.
 Então, algo que estamos propondo e certamente estaríamos abertos para adicionar e coordenar com a cidade e a Bluebikes para adicionar uma estação lá.
 Mas terminando com a apresentação em geral,
 Entendendo que oscilamos um pouco, acho que vamos apenas orientar a todos enquanto encerramos.
 Este foi para nós um pequeno resumo de alguns dos esforços civis em andamento que temos feito em projetos de engenharia civil e pronto.
 Essa é uma forma resumida de dizer que há uma coordenação da planta do local, do paisagismo, dos serviços públicos, do estacionamento e de muitas coisas que você viu.
 Então, para confirmar para todos, não foi uma coleção aleatória de coisas.
 Estávamos tentando responder perguntas e também fornecer mais detalhes sobre o que Bowler apresentou formalmente no processo civil à cidade e que estava sendo revisado por pares por
 por beta.
 Portanto, há algumas coisas aqui, como Steve mencionou anteriormente, que teremos prazer em revisitar, abordar ou expandir.
 Não queremos que ninguém sinta que, se houver perguntas na apresentação, como sempre, queremos ter certeza de que as responderemos, mas também haverá uma oportunidade para obtermos
 respostas da equipe de revisão por pares e acompanhamento também.
 Então, eu só queria fechar o círculo da apresentação.
 Portanto, não pareceu agitado, espero que para todos, mas apenas querendo ter certeza de que abordamos todos os tópicos que achamos que precisávamos.
 Então vou fechar e abrir para perguntas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2612.827s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, então meu pensamento é que passaremos rapidamente para a versão beta.
 Sei que os comentários da revisão por pares ainda não estão prontos, mas só quero ter ideias gerais e uma expectativa de quando devemos antecipá-los e então abriremos para perguntas do conselho.
 Vejo que temos Jeff do grupo beta.
 Por favor, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2639.459s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, boa noite, senhor presidente, membros do conselho.
 Então, deixe-me contar o que tenho esta noite.
 Então eu tenho isso.
 Apresentação em PowerPoint, posso resumir os comentários sobre transporte que fornecemos em nossa carta.
 Então posso mostrá-los para você.
 Tenho alguns comentários de Bill McGrath, nosso engenheiro civil.
 Estou revisando esse projeto e ele está de férias esta semana, mas tenho uma lista dele por e-mail.
 Assinei em forma de apresentação.
 Posso ler a lista se você quiser, mas não posso responder às perguntas detalhadas se você as tiver.
 Essa é a minha experiência, mas se você quiser, posso ler seus comentários iniciais.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2690.178s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ok, bem, parece que Bill ainda está trabalhando nos comentários ou a lista que você tem de comentários não é comentário?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2700.087s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Bem, não quero falar por ele.
 Eu diria que é a lista preliminar deles.
 Provavelmente não é definitivo, mas estamos trabalhando para isso.
 Eu diria que provavelmente na próxima semana, quando eu voltar das férias, provavelmente irei embrulhá-los em uma carta de apresentação.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2716.223s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Ok, parece bom.
 Portanto, planejaremos analisá-los com mais detalhes em nossa próxima audiência.
 E isso também dará ao solicitante algum tempo para receber o feedback e começar a trabalhar na resposta.
 Parece um plano.
 E sim, Jeff, voltarei a falar com você em um momento sobre o trânsito.
 Primeiro, irei ao quadro branco para fazer perguntas sobre a apresentação.
 Parece bom?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2745.784s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, obrigado.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2747.785s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Perguntas e comentários do conselho gostariam de começar.
 Jamie, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2762.478s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim, achei que foi uma ótima apresentação.
 Apreciei a visão geral da iluminação, bem como a conformidade do céu escuro.
 Achei que era muito abrangente para os requisitos, os elementos que queríamos cobrir.
 Uma pergunta que tive quando você falava sobre o ponto focal para a entrada do prédio e a frente como ponto de entrada na Myrtle Street.
 Acho que minha única preocupação é do ponto de vista do endereçamento: o prédio se chamará 970 Fellsway sem referência a um endereço da Myrtle Street, apenas por uma preocupação do Google Maps, Apple Maps, pessoas que não conhecem a área, então são levadas para a entrada da Fellsway em vez da entrada da Myrtle Street?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2809.941s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sim, posso responder a isso.
 Se desejar, o imóvel será subdividido e o imóvel residencial não terá fachada em Fellsway, portanto não terá endereço em Fellsway.
 É provável que 970 continue sendo o endereço de armazenamento.
 Hoje está tudo no pacote, por isso se chama 970.
 Mas o edifício existente manterá esse endereço.
 O novo prédio terá endereço, só poderá ter endereço de Murta ou Amaranto.
 E Myrtle parece ser a indicação que estamos recebendo agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2849.895s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: É um desastre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2855.676s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Outras perguntas e comentários do conselho?
 André, por favor, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2866.31s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Obrigado pela apresentação.
 Informações super úteis.
 Apenas algumas perguntas.
 Uma delas foi, eu sei que houve algum comentário público há algum tempo sobre as comodidades, o paisagismo, e estou me perguntando se houve alguma conversa com os vizinhos sobre essas características, especialmente o playground.
 Também estou curioso para saber se você tem algum tipo de ideia conceitual sobre a incorporação de arte pública, informações ou serviços históricos ou algo assim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2908.533s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, eu posso pular.
 Começando pela primeira pergunta, encontrei-me com alguns vizinhos e tive uma ampla discussão sobre o projeto.
 Um dos problemas é apenas a programação de espaços ao ar livre, em geral, e alguns dos vizinhos que conheci estão de plantão.
 Não quero deturpar nada do que foi dito, mas em geral os comentários que recebi são jogos ao ar livre, equipamentos de ginástica ao ar livre não são algo necessariamente emocionante para alguns vizinhos.
 Eles não necessariamente imaginaram que iriam usá-lo.
 As conversas que tivemos é que queremos programar o espaço ao ar livre para ser um benefício para a vizinhança e estamos abertos ao feedback deles se houver algo que queiram ver.
 Mas de modo geral, essa é a resposta que recebi até agora.
 Sobre arte pública,
 A resposta à pergunta é sim, em termos de saber se somos ou não capazes de considerá-la.
 Não temos um específico
 uma ideia específica em mente.
 Acho que a forma como saímos da audiência anterior, que foi focada na arquitetura, é que isso seria algo que tentaríamos continuar a considerar sob a égide dessa revisão por pares, por assim dizer.
 Não quero jogar a toalha, mas acho que com a próxima sessão de revisão por pares com Davis Square Architects e o exterior do edifício,
 e incorporando elementos da paisagem como parte do foco dessa conversa contínua.
 Isso é algo em que estamos tentando pensar um pouco mais.
 Não sei se no final podemos necessariamente prometer que teremos um design muito prescritivo para a arte pública.
 É um pouco a definir, mas de modo geral, para responder à pergunta, sim, certamente estamos abertos a incorporá-lo como parte do site em diversas áreas do site.
 E se houver sugestões do conselho ou dos membros da vizinhança sobre como fazer ou onde fazer, adoraríamos ouvir esse feedback.
 Francamente, isso seria útil para nós à medida que avançamos na programação do edifício e na sua aparência real.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3071.088s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Vejo que a Diretora Hunt está com a mão levantada.
 Só quero falar com o Andre primeiro.
 Você ia perguntar mais alguma coisa, André, ou isso respondeu à sua pergunta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3082.759s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim, tudo bem nessas questões.
 Provavelmente fiz mais alguns comentários, mas estou feliz que Alicia intervenha.
 Diretor Hunt, entre, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3090.006s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Obrigado.
 Na verdade, eu só queria levantar, desculpe, um acompanhamento do que você mencionou porque
 Tenho a impressão, e queria saber se você acha que isso é verdade, que os vizinhos com quem você conversou são todos vizinhos com endereços na Myrtle Street, então são todos casas e quintais.
 Você já conversou ou ouviu de algum dos moradores do Amaranth Place, que são todos condomínios, que eles parecem não ter pátios abertos associados a eles?
 porque é aí que
 O escritório estava pensando que algum espaço aberto seria bom para a vizinhança desses condomínios.
 Eu só queria esclarecer esse ponto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3128.948s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Não, é uma ótima pergunta.
 Não conheci nenhum morador dos condomínios Amaranth Place.
 Portanto, os comentários que representei não vieram deles.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3139.158s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Excelente.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3141.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado, André.
 De volta para você.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3143.899s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim, esse é um ótimo ponto.
 Alice.
 Obrigado por mencionar isso.
 Oh.
 Apenas alguns comentários ou perguntas sobre o aspecto da circulação.
 Hum, 1 está no tipo de linha reta entre o.
 O projeto proposto e as instalações de armazenamento, parece que é um longo trecho imediatamente.
 Eu me pergunto se eles estão considerando alguns obstáculos ou outros tipos de mitigação.
 E também estou curioso para saber se você poderia explicar um pouco mais.
 Onde, como entrariam os caminhões de mudança e se iriam para a garagem, onde fariam.
 Para onde as pessoas moveriam seus móveis, etc.?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3191.623s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Claro, compartilharei a tela novamente para que possamos ver alguns gráficos.
 Sim, a reta é uma reta longa.
 O bom é que acalmar o trânsito é estacionar na frente, né?
 Não parecerá uma rua urbana que incentiva altas velocidades.
 Não temos lombadas ou
 qualquer sobrevôo ou algo parecido proposto agora, não estou dizendo que não podemos fazer isso, mas geralmente são um problema de manutenção e trazem um conjunto diferente de desafios.
 Mas com certeza vamos dar uma olhada mais de perto.
 Fizemos isso propositalmente na entrada aqui em um ângulo de 90 graus.
 Então as pessoas têm que vir e se tornar isso.
 Portanto, não é como uma via rápida.
 E obviamente na outra extremidade também há um ângulo de 90 graus.
 Portanto, há um certo tempo para as pessoas permanecerem em linha reta antes de pararem e virarem 90 graus.
 Então acho que é uma distância razoável, mas com certeza é um ótimo ponto para olharmos um pouco mais longe.
 Em relação ao carregamento, como vimos, fizemos estudos do caminhão de bombeiros para que o caminhão escada pudesse percorrer todo o prédio.
 Caminhões de mudança geralmente estão em projetos como este.
 Pense no U-Haul superdimensionado, que é um pouco menor que um caminhão de passageiros, não precisa ser U-Haul.
 Mas esse tipo de caminhão baú único,
 Isso funciona um pouco melhor do que o caminhão de bombeiros.
 Então, em qualquer lugar que mostrarmos um caminhão de bombeiros em movimento, um caminhão em movimento poderia ir, mas na verdade eles estarão na parte de trás do prédio.
 Então eles estão tentando chegar à borda de trás para que possam passar por Amaranth e subir pela borda aqui.
 eles poderiam
 Se permitido, eles podem passar por Fellsway e entrar por este lado do edifício.
 E as operações de carregamento acontecem nesta porta aqui atrás.
 Então isso é carga e um elevador ali.
 Então, as operações de carregamento são realmente ao longo desta linha de calçada, não há estacionamento na
 do lado da rua do prédio para que pudessem parar na calçada, descarregar, entrar pela porta dos fundos e pegar o elevador até o andar em que estivessem.
 Os caminhões não devem entrar na garagem.
 Haverá alturas acessíveis para vans para entrar na garagem, portanto haverá estacionamento acessível para vans.
 Portanto, se você vier com uma van de mudança menor, poderá entrar na garagem, mas não como um caminhão baú.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3362.226s">[Unidentified]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 Eu só quero avaliar.
 Você disse que eles poderiam parar na calçada.
 Essa é a calçada, correto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3368.909s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Há uma calçada ali para delimitar a borda do prédio.
 Então tem uma calçada, e então a calçada será elevada para que eles possam estacionar na beira da estrada adjacente à calçada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3383.955s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Outras perguntas do conselho?
 Kim, você está em silêncio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3406.901s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: Quanto às bicicletas, quantas bicicletas você pode guardar em nossa casa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3419.029s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Eu posso pular.
 Como parte do projeto arquitetônico em andamento, esse foi um dos comentários que recebemos do revisor, Sr. Bomer.
 Estamos finalizando o tamanho daquela sala onde está localizada na planta do local, permanece a planta do térreo.
 finalizar a metragem quadrada daquela sala e depois montar o projeto conceitual é algo em que estamos trabalhando agora.
 Nós nos concentramos no maior número possível de bicicletas e analisamos diferentes especificações de bicicletários e suportes de rack, sejam montados no chão ou na parede, tentando maximizar a eficiência desse espaço.
 Portanto, não tenho uma resposta específica para você em termos de quantidade, mas em termos de metragem quadrada da sala, estamos tentando refinar esse tamanho agora e devemos ser capazes de fornecer pelo menos um número aproximado em nossa próxima apresentação após os comentários arquitetônicos.
 Obrigado.
 E desculpe, isso seria para bicicletas dentro da sala de bicicletas do prédio.
 Mostramos o local fora da sala, onde há racks montados do lado de fora, onde as bicicletas também podem ser armazenadas.
 Acho que há uma quantia que poderíamos especificar para isso também.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3500.71s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3509.002s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bem, posso continuar com aquele comentário sobre estacionamento de bicicletas?
 Uma coisa com que lidamos muito no último projeto 40B que analisamos foi o estacionamento de bicicletas.
 Então, ao pensar em projetar aquele bicicletário, agora que as scooters e as bicicletas elétricas são mais comuns do que nunca,
 Hum, você sabe, tem havido alguns problemas com incêndios ocasionais, que são difíceis de apagar com essas coisas.
 Então, eu só quero levar isso em consideração, ter certeza de que é um local à prova de fogo.
 Hum, área.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3548.73s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Note-se que temos o rés-do-chão onde estaria localizada a arrecadação para bicicletas, seria ao nível do pódio, o que seria uma construção incombustível.
 Algo em que poderíamos entrar, obviamente, à medida que o projeto avança para esse nível de documentação de projeto, documentação de construção e, em seguida, enviá-lo para revisões de código.
 Mas é bom ter certeza de que o consideramos como o local da corrida.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3579.455s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: Jim?
 Sim, sobre o mesmo assunto, sei que muitos locais não permitem bicicletas elétricas nas unidades devido ao perigo de incêndio.
 Isso está sendo considerado?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3601.675s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: É uma boa pergunta.
 Até hoje não tivemos essa conversa.
 Temos buscado informações de vários grupos de gestão de propriedades e de nosso próprio grupo interno de gestão de ativos nas empresas Davis.
 Esse não é um tópico que surgiu, então não tenho uma resposta específica para essa pergunta.
 É algo que certamente podemos analisar e coordenar com a equipe de gestão de propriedades e que, juntamente com qualquer outra coisa,
 seriam detalhados para os moradores do prédio e as regras e regulamentos que eles assinam no momento da execução do contrato de locação.
 Isso é algo que certamente podemos investigar mais detalhadamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3640.824s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3647.971s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Na verdade, tão relacionado a isso que não me lembro.
 Acho que pode ter sido mencionado em um anterior.
 público, mas essa moldura é de madeira na parte residencial ou é de algum outro material?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3666.182s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Está certo.
 Assim, o edifício tal como foi apresentado inicialmente e o projeto atual
 É uma construção de pódio.
 Esta configuração atual obviamente tem a etapa de nível superior.
 Existe um elemento de construção de cinco sobre um e quatro sobre um.
 Mais de um é o seu nível incombustível, seja aço ou concreto ainda não está formalmente definido, mas seria uma moldura de madeira acima desse nível incombustível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3702.173s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Eu entendo.
 A razão pela qual perguntei,
 Uma das razões pelas quais passamos tanto tempo nisso na audiência anterior do 40B foi que se tratava de uma construção semelhante e nosso comissário de construção na época tinha experiência direta de Waltham com um grande incêndio, neste caso um incêndio em construção.
 Mas basicamente este tipo de edifício é construído
 alto risco de incêndio em determinados contextos.
 Portanto, tenha isso em mente ao consultar outros grupos.
 Penso que a orientação, especialmente de tipos semelhantes de edifícios, seria provavelmente a melhor prática a utilizar aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3745.348s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, entendido e ponto bem entendido.
 Em termos de conclusão do design, isso seria feito para estar totalmente compatível com o código e obviamente passaria por um processo de revisão.
 E então, durante o processo de construção, o gerente de construção trabalharia com o Corpo de Bombeiros de Medford, apresentaria um plano NFPA 241 e também seguiria todas as regras e regulamentos associados a ele.
 É dada muita consideração ao tipo de construção envolvida na moldura de madeira e aos riscos associados a ela.
 Bem obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3787.53s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?
 André, vá em frente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3795.043s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Você poderia explicar com um pouco mais de detalhes a infraestrutura de carregamento de veículos elétricos de que está falando?
 Porque não parece haver muito.
 Quero dizer, estamos falando de uma transição rápida nos próximos cinco a dez anos com veículos elétricos.
 E uma das grandes barreiras, obviamente, é a disponibilidade de estações de carregamento.
 Então, se você pudesse nos explicar isso um pouco mais, seria ótimo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3822.498s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sim, Pat, você quer que eu faça isso?
 Vou te mostrar onde eles estão.
 Vou trazer a imagem de volta à tela para mostrar com o que estamos começando.
 E depois falaremos sobre as oportunidades no prédio.
 Então, só para ampliar um pouco aqui.
 Novamente, esses 14 espaços aqui, dois espaços mais tradicionais e depois dois espaços acessíveis.
 Porque é difícil voltar mais tarde e instalar a infraestrutura no exterior do edifício, as condutas e obter energia e montar as estações, queremos colocar tudo isso desde o primeiro dia, para que a infraestrutura esteja lá e pronta para ser usada.
 A opção de expansão realmente vai para a garagem, e simplesmente não a temos
 É relativamente fácil colocá-lo dentro da garagem, desde que planejemos com antecedência e instalemos a infraestrutura elétrica adequada, certo?
 Transformadores, quadros de distribuição, o que quer que seja.
 Precisamos estar preparados para aumentar esse poder no futuro.
 Precisamos planejar com antecedência e implementar isso.
 E faremos isso em coordenação com a companhia elétrica à medida que entrarmos na fase de concepção da ordem de serviço.
 Mas depois de ter essa infraestrutura importante, adicionar o equipamento dentro da garagem é relativamente fácil porque você pode instalar uma tubulação no telhado da garagem.
 e execute-o onde for necessário e adicione estações conforme você avança.
 É assim que abordamos o site e descobrimos o que é mais difícil desde o primeiro dia e depois proporcionamos essa flexibilidade.
 Como disse Anjanita, está em rápida expansão.
 Não sabemos qual será a necessidade daqui a alguns anos, mas é muito fácil de adicionar.
 Pat, não sei se você tem algo a acrescentar em relação ao prédio.
 Essa é a minha opinião sobre a oportunidade de expansão dos veículos elétricos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, acho que você acertou em cheio.
 Nosso processo de pensamento foi instalar os carregadores de veículos elétricos como parte da construção do edifício ao longo do exterior do edifício.
 Ouvimos dos membros do conselho e de outras pessoas presentes nas audiências mencionadas acima que eles queriam apenas ver os carregadores de veículos elétricos localizados fora do prédio.
 E então pensamos que fazer isso no local é algo que podemos coordenar com a expansão no futuro, a capacidade de fazer isso e ser ágil no dimensionamento adequado da sua infraestrutura elétrica, mas ser capaz de fazê-lo no nível do pódio, aquele nível de construção não combustível, novamente, até o nível da garagem, sendo capaz de instalar encanamento no telhado e adicionar estações de carregamento de veículos elétricos.
 É algo, francamente, que as empresas Davis tiveram sucesso em outros projetos, podendo adicioná-los conforme necessário ou conforme a necessidade aumenta.
 É realmente uma questão de coordenar sua infraestrutura elétrica.
 Então, você sabe, reiterar o que Steve disse, mas ouvir diretamente de mim, é apenas uma parte de como projetamos o local e pensamos sobre isso conceitualmente, por que você os vê localizados fora do local e com crescimento futuro no edifício.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim, direi apenas, quero dizer, estou feliz que você esteja pensando em expansão interna.
 Só não creio que para esta quantidade de lugares de estacionamento, mesmo no primeiro dia, carregar veículos eléctricos seja suficiente.
 E eu definitivamente sugeriria mais.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: É algo que definitivamente podemos investigar.
 Não tenho uma resposta específica para quantificar, mas tomamos nota da sua sugestão e com certeza podemos dar uma olhada nela.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4075.973s">[Unidentified]</a>: Obrigado.
 Apenas como acompanhamento, espera-se que sejam estações de carregamento rápido ou é algo onde você esperaria que alguém estacionasse e carregasse durante a noite?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: É uma boa pergunta.
 Acho que existem alguns níveis.
 Tudo se resume a um pouco de coordenação com a infraestrutura elétrica, quanta energia você pode obter e qual o tamanho que a caixa precisa ter para poder fornecer o tipo de energia necessária.
 Posso dizer que acho que as estações de carregamento rápido realmente superam o que seriam
 o que seria considerado típico ou mesmo atípico no sentido de grande dimensão para um edifício como este.
 Não tenho uma resposta específica.
 Acho que gostaríamos de torná-los o mais eficientes possível, mas caberia a nós, um pouco mais tarde, identificar quais seriam as especificações específicas das estações de carregamento, uma vez que possamos realmente quantificar com um engenheiro elétrico e trabalhar com o fornecedor de serviços públicos para confirmar quanta energia pode chegar ao local.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: E só para acrescentar, normalmente neste tipo de empreendimentos, utilizamos apenas os carregadores tradicionais porque são esperados que sejam moradores que chegam a casa e estacionam o carro durante a noite.
 Portanto, as tarifas noturnas não são um impedimento para a realização de operações típicas.
 Se esta fosse uma rotação mais de curto prazo, é quando você realmente precisa de cobranças mais rápidas.
 Bom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4170.979s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Bom.
 Mas se esses 14 espaços forem usados ​​​​durante a noite pelas mismas 14 pessoas e você tiver mais de 300 espaços para marcar, então os usará durante todo o tempo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4186.36s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim, é isso que quero dizer.
 Esse foi o meu pensamento.
 Essas vagas são destinadas a pessoas que possuem veículos elétricos ou seriam, você sabe, na opinião do André, se não fossem dedicadas e carregadas mais rápido, poderíamos ter inquilinos alocados nas vagas, usá-los para carregar e depois deslocar o carro e disponibilizá-lo para outra pessoa?
 Falando em voz alta, obviamente é apenas um pensamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, é algo que teríamos que coordenar.
 Precisaríamos coordenar através da equipe de gerenciamento de propriedade.
 Acho que nas condições que você está falando, à medida que finalizamos a quantidade, se a necessidade de mais for imediatamente determinada, acho que estamos confortáveis ​​com a nossa capacidade de adicionar mais facilmente.
 Portanto, se os residentes não conseguirem carregar os seus veículos porque estão constantemente ocupados, seremos capazes de coordenar a adição de futuras estações de carregamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, uma coisa que mencionarei neste tópico é que este é um ambiente de clima frio.
 É por isso que penso que pelo menos alguns espaços interiores serão necessários para os VE.
 Assim entendido que é mais fácil somar.
 espaços após o facto, parece que é necessário um pré-planeamento em termos de instalação da infra-estrutura.
 Então, seria bom a gente numa audiência futura ter uma ideia de quais são os planos aí, por exemplo, o que eles estão pensando em fazer, quanto isso poderia escalar e se eles vão ter alguns, por exemplo, vocês sabem hoje que eles vão ter alguns espaços dedicados?
 Também dentro da estrutura de estacionamento, ou tudo ficará do lado de fora como está atualmente organizado aqui?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4304.051s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Neste momento, o exterior é o que se propõe instalar.
 Podemos, como disse há poucos minutos, entender que o feedback serve para explorarmos quantas vagas, se o que estamos propondo atualmente não parece suficiente, faremos algumas pesquisas sobre isso e poderemos responder ao que achamos ser o número certo.
 e se isso inclui mais interior ou mais exterior.
 Portanto, certamente podemos expandir esse pensamento.
 Tudo bem, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4340.081s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?
 Um que eu tive e ainda não fui questionado é:
 Possíveis locais para paradas de ônibus escolar.
 Portanto, não sei onde fica o ponto de ônibus mais próximo hoje, mas sei que atualmente é de uso industrial e potencialmente haverá várias famílias morando no novo prédio.
 Então, sim, onde um ônibus escolar pararia ou poderia parar perto deste pacote?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4387.755s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Pessoalmente, não olhei o ponto ou as rotas do ônibus escolar.
 Não sei se eles estão indo pela Myrtle Street ou qual seria o caminho mais próximo, mas definitivamente poderíamos dar uma olhada com a equipe de trânsito e descobrir onde fica esse local.
 Acho que a expansão do Myrtle apresenta algumas novas oportunidades, mas não as exploramos, mas estamos felizes em dar uma olhada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4413.771s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4417.797s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4419.959s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Eu tenho uma pergunta e um comentário.
 É Yvette.
 Em relação à unidade de armazenamento que resta, e peço desculpas se você verificou e perdeu, tive alguns problemas com a internet por um momento.
 Haverá alguma melhoria a ser feita nesse prédio?
 Eu sei que estamos falando de guarda pública e é claro que talvez aquele possa ser um lugar para isso, mas eles ficam próximos a um enorme parque industrial.
 Então, o que está acontecendo nesse espaço para ajudar a melhorar...?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4459.498s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: em geral?
 É uma ótima pergunta.
 E não tocamos nisso.
 Definitivamente haverá ideias para melhorarmos esse espaço.
 Talvez divida o processo de pensamento para você.
 Existem dois tipos principais de áreas que estamos analisando.
 Steve, você pode achar útil retirar o
 apenas a planta geral do local como ponto de referência.
 A primeira fica bem ao lado de Fellsway, como você pode ver, o simples realinhamento do corte do meio-fio em benefício da propriedade como um todo apresenta a oportunidade de
 Modifique os pontos de acesso a esse edifício e o carregamento desse edifício e, você sabe, como os caminhões entram e saem de lá.
 Acho que isso é obviamente específico para sua pergunta.
 Isso seria uma espécie de modificação daquilo que é a condição existente.
 E então, em segundo lugar, eu acho.
 O que estamos tentando entender é o escopo, e isso seria um pouco exagerado, Steve, mas uma vez que os edifícios estão lá, uma vez que o armazém existente é demolido, isso obviamente deixa uma longa parede exposta para o edifício de autoarmazenamento existente.
 Planejaríamos terminar aquela parede de alguma forma.
 Atualmente é uma parede da CMU dentro daquele prédio.
 Haverá planos para entrar e melhorar o estado exterior daquela parede.
 Obviamente vamos garantir que a demolição seja feita com segurança, mas em termos estéticos, apenas terminar aquela parede e garantir todas as amarrações para o telhado e
 tudo relacionado à impermeabilização daquela edificação é feito corretamente.
 Portanto, haverá algumas melhorias em consequência, não só da demolição do edifício existente, mas também das obras de obra que estamos a planear fazer e que nos permitirão abordar um pouco a entrada principal daquele edifício.
 e eu não quero
 inviabilizar esta conversa que é específica para imóveis residenciais, mas estamos no processo de trabalhar em alguns desenhos para isso que discutiríamos com a cidade separadamente apenas para ajudar a entender o caminho para esse edifício à medida que chega ao ponto em que parte desse trabalho se torna acessível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: E não sei, repito, como funciona o edifício.
 Portanto, admito que sou ingênuo ou ignoro como funciona esse negócio.
 Mas só penso na minha própria experiência e no lugar onde cresci.
 E eu me lembro que em prédios industriais, você sabe, os trabalhadores saíam e tinham espaços para se reunir do lado de fora, você sabe, com pausas para fumar e para almoçar e coisas dessa natureza.
 Este é o tipo de lugar que precisa dessas coisas?
 E se o fizerem, onde isso acontece?
 E isso significará interagir com a vizinhança?
 Porque agora não está mais fechado.
 É comercial.
 É um bairro.
 Claro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Não, é uma pergunta útil.
 Portanto, o uso atual desse prédio é como local de autoarmazenamento, o que para nós significa que a manutenção é bastante baixa em termos de trabalhadores no local.
 Isto não é trabalho de produção, mas simplesmente gestão geral e supervisão de
 de pessoas, os meandros das pessoas que acessam suas gaiolas de armazenamento privadas.
 Portanto, a intensidade é muito baixa em termos de trabalhadores no local e, você sabe, a exigência de qualquer trabalho externo.
 áreas de congregação para eles não é algo que acreditamos ser necessário dentro do edifício.
 Tem um escritório e uma sala de descanso e coisas dessa natureza, um escritório administrativo.
 Então, em termos gerais, sentimos que com o tipo de utilização que aquele edifício apresenta e o tipo de fiscalização que se tem com o reduzido número de funcionários que aí se encontram,
 Eu não esperaria que a situação que você mencionou fosse algo que acontecesse.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4732.384s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Obrigado.
 Não tenho outras perguntas ou comentários.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4734.786s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Obrigado.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?
 Não vendo nenhum, acho que o que faz mais sentido organizacionalmente é que vamos votar para abrir comentários públicos sobre o processo civil.
 E então, após comentários públicos sobre questões civis, passaremos para a versão beta para revisão por pares de tráfego.
 Em seguida, o presidente aguarda uma moção para abrir comentários públicos sobre o trânsito.
 A apresentação da engenharia civil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4776.651s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Muito emocionado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4813.254s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Olá pessoal.
 Meu nome é Cliff Bomer.
 Sou o revisor de arquitetura e muito obrigado pela apresentação.
 Eu tinha algumas perguntas que poderiam surgir.
 Eu sei que estamos olhando para outro
 sessão de trabalho, que considero fantástica e estou ansioso por isso.
 Só tenho algumas perguntas civis, talvez voltando ao assunto.
 Acho que no estacionamento de veículos elétricos, na verdade não me lembro onde está Medford no que diz respeito à adoção do código de participação, mas tenha em mente que o
 O código de participação tem requisitos muito específicos para vagas de estacionamento de veículos elétricos e são muito diferentes.
 É um grande salto em relação ao resto dos códigos.
 Acho que o que o código de participação exige é que 20% das vagas de estacionamento sejam conectadas, acho que esse é o termo,
 para estacionar veículos elétricos.
 Portanto, não quero me apresentar como uma autoridade em códigos especializados, mas por favor, analise-os porque se a cidade o adotar antes de iniciar o processo de licenciamento, isso poderá se tornar um problema muito real.
 O outro, outros dois, outros três comentários.
 Uma é que eu aprecio o
 Os diagramas de circulação e saber o que penso que está na ordem do dia para a próxima sessão de trabalho são alguns dos temas que surgiram ao nível da articulação das fachadas do edifício.
 E eu vejo o.
 As entradas secundárias são boas oportunidades para que as áreas criem um pouco mais de interesse volumétrico nas fachadas dos edifícios.
 Então apresentei isso como uma oportunidade.
 Acho que até mesmo os pontos de Andre sobre obras de arte públicas.
 Tem aquela fachada comprida que dá para o nível do estacionamento, o longo amaranto, que acho que é uma ótima oportunidade para um espaço mural, que poderia realmente enriquecer o que considero uma ideia muito boa para o plano paisagístico daquela lateral do prédio.
 Acho que há grandes oportunidades aí.
 Mais dois comentários rápidos.
 Uma é que,
 Não creio que nenhum dos planos que vimos esta noite refletisse a ideia que sei que discutimos sobre cortar o canto noroeste do edifício.
 Analisamos estudos volumétricos que considero realmente eficazes no corte daquele canto noroeste, para que não seja tão proeminente.
 Então vou deixar aí.
 Não sei se isso foi intencional ou apenas uma questão de coordenação entre o civil e o arquitetônico neste momento.
 E a última é que não sou um cara do trânsito e posso estar atrasado em uma apresentação ou talvez até duas, mas achei que havia discussão sobre a entrada.
 onde o desembarque fica no lado norte do edifício, houve alguma discussão sobre como fazer o caminho que separa o edifício existente do novo edifício, fazendo os primeiros 30 metros ou mais em direção ao norte para que as pessoas não parassem de Myrtle até a área de desembarque e depois seguissem para a entrada do estacionamento no lado leste do edifício a partir daí.
 Peço desculpas se perdi alguma outra conversa sobre isso e quero enfatizar que não sou um trânsito, então não sei se há alguma preocupação em relação ao volume de carros que podem usar isso como porta de entrada.
 Mas por outro lado, isso foi tudo que aprendi do ponto de vista civil, e estou realmente ansioso
 para mais uma sessão de trabalho e agradeço a disponibilidade do candidato em continuar avançando na arquitetura do edifício que estará ligada aos planos paisagístico e civil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5106.377s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado, penhasco.
 Então, como há alguns pontos que são questões mais esclarecedoras sobre algumas discussões em andamento nos grupos de trabalho, há alguém que queira falar sobre isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Pat, se você quiser que eu comece, irei na ordem inversa e abordarei mais questões de circulação que Cliff acabou de levantar, na verdade, na entrada cerimonial.
 Compartilharei minha tela novamente, só mais uma vez, para poder apontar e ter certeza de que estamos todos na mesma página aqui.
 Acho que o comentário foi sobre esse trecho da estrada, se queria ser de um lado, de um sentido ou de outro, ou pelo menos no sentido da entrada, acho que foi essa a conversa.
 E nós conversamos sobre isso.
 E, em última análise, achamos que deveria ser uma seção de mão dupla.
 E a razão é que se um carro vier te deixar, digamos,
 deixando ou pegando alguém, seria mais uma situação de entrega.
 Alguém está com sacolas de compras, deixa na entrada, está chovendo, corre até a porta da frente e depois
 A pessoa que o deixar poderá então se virar e ir para qualquer lugar atrás do prédio e encontrar sua vaga de estacionamento e entrar por qualquer outra porta, dependendo do estacionamento disponível.
 Então achamos que é uma oportunidade de entrar, seja na garagem, se eles forem na garagem provavelmente não vão sair.
 Mas se eles estivessem estacionando do lado de fora, alguém teria a oportunidade de não voltar para a Myrtle Street, dar um passeio pela Fellsway e retornar por uma entrada diferente.
 Então achamos que é uma característica importante, especialmente se for um visitante de curta duração, alguém vindo para ver a propriedade e aqueles quatro horários de entrega, digamos que estavam todos ocupados, essa pessoa teria então que sair e vir para Fellsway para entrar e encontrar
 outro espaço em algum lugar da propriedade e pensamos que eram viagens desnecessárias nas estradas adjacentes e as mantivemos internas ao local.
 Então fizemos isso, foi discutido, você não vai se lembrar mal, mas conforme passamos pelas iterações e os engenheiros de tráfego fizeram algumas análises e cerca de 90% chegaram a algum lugar nessa faixa de estudo.
 Eu viria buscar outros ingressos.
 Eles acreditam que cerca de 10% viriam para esta entrada.
 Realmente são aqueles que visitam pela primeira vez.
 Então sentimos que, com base no volume baixo e na criação da oportunidade de não voltar ao Fells Way, era importante manter essa via de mão dupla.
 Então esse foi o nosso pensamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5271.853s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Obrigado por isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5274.586s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, sim, posso intervir rapidamente e continuarei trabalhando na ordem inversa.
 Eu estava tomando notas.
 Então, o canto noroeste do penhasco do edifício, desculpe se há alguma confusão aqui.
 São.
 bifurcando o processo de design de algumas maneiras, por isso estamos olhando especificamente para o plano térreo. Acho que esse é o comentário que você está fazendo. Fizemos a modificação na parte residencial do edifício, para que ao nível do solo o edifício
 a pegada do edifício é como representada e, acima desse nível, o edifício recua.
 Esse canto volta, devo dizer.
 É um canto invertido.
 Então isso é consistente com a apresentação que fizemos.
 anteriormente em nossa audiência anterior com foco em arquitetura e em nossa revisão por pares anterior.
 Então não voltamos e destruímos o prédio.
 É que você está olhando a planta do térreo.
 Então, espero que essa seja a confusão que possamos esclarecer aí.
 Vou em frente, arte pública em todos os Emirados.
 Muito, muito notado, como mencionei antes, acho que houve outro comentário sobre isso.
 Isso é algo sobre o qual pretendemos falar na próxima sessão de revisão por pares.
 Isso foi algo que pensamos como parte da revisão por pares de arquitetura e ficamos felizes em ter os locais sugeridos.
 Eu me pergunto se é arte pública.
 Hum, estruturas ao longo do caminho sinuoso ou é algo ao longo do próprio edifício.
 Você sabe, acho que estamos definitivamente abertos a ideias e queremos fazer desta uma propriedade acolhedora e algo de que a cidade se orgulhe e a arte pública relacionada a isso é algo a que estamos abertos.
 E finalmente, sobre estacionamento, esse é um comentário útil.
 Acho que definitivamente recebemos muito feedback sobre isso esta noite e.
 Como mencionei, a única coisa que tirei foi que fizemos um pouco mais de lição de casa sobre isso.
 Não posso fazer referência à diretiva de código específica para estacionamento de veículos elétricos, mas quando nos encontrarmos na próxima vez, nossa equipe poderá fazê-lo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5413.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Excelente.
 Obrigado.
 Sim, obrigado.
 Tudo bem.
 Amigos, estamos abertos a comentários públicos.
 Então se você é um público que gostaria de falar sobre temas de engenharia civil, pode levantar a mão no zoom, ligar a câmera e levantar a mão, pode escrever algo assim.
 Você também pode enviar um e-mail para Dennis D. McDougal em Medford dash ma.gov.
 Vejo que temos uma Allison D. Por favor, vá em frente e liste o nome e endereço dela para registro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5447.956s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: Olá a todos, Allison D'Agostino.
 Represento 1022-1024 Fellsway do D'Agostino Family Trust.
 Obrigado a todos.
 Na verdade, tenho muitos comentários junto com muitos números e perguntas marcadas.
 Vou tentar ser o mais organizado possível.
 Só para começar, se eu puder evitar tudo.
 Conheço um pouco sobre a situação do ponto de ônibus.
 Então vou começar por aí.
 Eu entendo que há um ponto de ônibus.
 Na verdade, fica do outro lado de Fellsway.
 Então, agora, as crianças basicamente têm que atravessar onde fica a Myrtle Street, caminhar até cruzar a Fells Way.
 Então esse é um caminho bastante percorrido.
 E praticamente em frente ao local onde fica o atual corte do meio-fio na Fells Way para a propriedade de armazenamento, é onde as crianças esperam.
 E também há outro ponto de ônibus no final da Myrtle.
 Porque repito, isso é industrial, né?
 Então eles não pegam nenhuma criança aqui.
 Pelo que entendi, fica na esquina da Myrtle com a Spring Street, se isso ajuda.
 Então nós apenas dirigimos até lá.
 Alguns comentários.
 Em primeiro lugar, obrigado ao conselho de administração e, obviamente, à Davis Company.
 Na verdade, eu era alguém que conhecia Pat.
 Foi uma ótima reunião e agradeço o tempo.
 Então, uma coisa que começa em termos de comentários:
 Eu acho um pouco enganador que, você sabe, eu acho, especialmente no início do projeto, discutimos como seria a Myrtle Street, você sabe, estamos tentando desviar o tráfego, ouvindo hoje à noite que, você sabe, o endereço da propriedade será na Myrtle.
 E, você sabe, é um pouco rebuscado da minha parte acreditar que as pessoas passarão por Myrtle naquela época e realmente usarão a entrada de Fellsway conforme prescrito.
 Mas, novamente, isso é apenas um comentário.
 Eu gostaria de ter ouvido algo diferente esta noite.
 A outra parte é que gostei muito da tentativa de alargar a Myrtle Street.
 Acho que o maior ponto que ainda não estou claro é que se não realocarmos os postes, qualquer pessoa que more naquela rua vai perceber, sabe, eles estão
 Grandes, existem alguns.
 Há mais do que está ilustrado nessa ilustração, acho que é a melhor maneira de colocar isso.
 Então, embora eu aprecie isso, se os postes não forem movidos juntos, você não estará alargando a rua o suficiente.
 E obviamente a intersecção de Fellsway e Bernal não pode ser ampliada porque já discutimos isso com a propriedade Walsh.
 Realmente não há solução aí.
 O outro comentário, porém, é que gostei muito que a empresa Davis tenha vindo com o número de vagas de estacionamento.
 Além disso, o parque para cães para mim, essas são minhas duas principais preocupações, apenas para registro.
 Não há mais estacionamento adicional nesta área.
 Está muito congestionado.
 Em emergências de neve, as pessoas lutam por espaço, como em Southie, onde também morei.
 Então não é como se eu tivesse feito isso de forma alguma.
 Muito congestionado.
 Além disso, há potencial para introduzir 289 cães na área.
 Embora aprecie espaços verdes, acho que focar mais em espaços para cães é uma prioridade muito maior para mim do que em um playground ou outro tipo de parque.
 Então, eu só quero que isso seja comum.
 Eu realmente aprecio que eles estejam tentando estacionar de acordo com os requisitos, porque é necessário.
 Não há derramamentos e preciso sair da minha garagem todos os dias.
 Então esses são os meus comentários, as minhas perguntas, para não perder muito tempo.
 Acho que minha pergunta foi que não fui um pouco claro com Warren Street.
 Não parece estar incluído nessas ilustrações.
 Essa é uma rota de tráfego que atravessa.
 É uma rua de mão única, atravessa a Myrtle, bem no cruzamento de Amaranth.
 Acho que minha pergunta é: ainda há algo sendo considerado?
 Esse cruzamento para mim é muito perigoso.
 É perigoso agora.
 Então, minha pergunta à empresa Davis, ou mesmo ao conselho de administração, é algo que ainda estamos considerando.
 Em relação às questões de segurança, a minha segunda pergunta foi apenas um esclarecimento sobre os sobrados que não ficou claro.
 Existem estradas de acesso?
 Diretamente na murta ou dentro da propriedade.
 E a minha terceira pergunta foi apenas sobre os lugares de estacionamento em todo o edifício exterior fora da garagem, mas específicos para as áreas de carga traseiras.
 Parece pouco claro.
 Um caminhão poderia entrar?
 Poderia um caminhão, um caminhão de transporte com rampa?
 Você poderia descer a rampa?
 Você conseguiu baixar com segurança?
 Posso ter morado aqui nesta casa por um tempo, mas costumava me mudar todos os anos depois da faculdade.
 Aí eu lembro que foi um desafio conseguir me movimentar.
 em edifícios com estacionamento.
 Então esses caminhões não têm acesso à garagem.
 Minha preocupação e pergunta é mesmo: você levou em consideração a quantidade de espaço de um caminhão de mudança com rampa?
 Então isso foi muito.
 Muito obrigado.
 E mais uma vez, obrigado sempre pelo tempo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5763.815s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado.
 Sim, houve algumas perguntas.
 Houve uma pergunta sobre a mudança de caminhões, sobre Lawrence.
 O candidato gostaria de falar sobre isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5775.499s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sim.
 Você quer ir, Pat?
 caminhão em movimento e estacionamento.
 Os caminhões de mudança ficam ao longo de toda a parte traseira do prédio.
 Há espaço para alguns caminhões lá.
 Não esperamos que haja muitos caminhões lá porque a administração da propriedade realmente terá.
 Gerenciaremos os movimentos, entraremos e sairemos.
 E achamos que há espaço mais que suficiente para lidar com algumas dessas condições de pico de movimentação.
 Estamos analisando isso e continuaremos trabalhando com a equipe de operações para entender isso.
 Para moradias geminadas, só para esclarecer, todo o acesso é interno ao terreno.
 Não há cortes no meio-fio ou acesso à Myrtle Street.
 É tudo pelos fundos, entradas internas de acesso ao local.
 Então acho que se você quiser dar uma atualização sobre Florence Street, sei que está sendo analisada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5841.227s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Sim, sim, absolutamente.
 É uma pergunta oportuna, então geralmente a resposta é sim.
 Acho que estamos no processo agora e não sei se Jeff do Beta concluirá a audiência com alguns de seus comentários, mas recebemos muitos comentários do Beta sobre tráfego e estamos analisando-os.
 E como parte disso, há uma série de
 mitigações recomendadas que devemos considerar e algumas coisas adicionais que devemos estudar.
 Não sei de imediato, sem o relatório à minha frente, se Lawrence Street existe, mas no geral penso que o tráfego na área e a mitigação para a área são considerados de forma ampla, não apenas para Myrtle ou Amaranth.
 Eu acho que Lawrence pode estar lá.
 Eu teria que verificar novamente, mas a resposta curta à sua pergunta é sim.
 Pacotes de mitigação para o tráfego na área são algo em que continuamos a trabalhar com a nossa equipa e a equipa de revisão por pares.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5904.591s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: E obrigado pelos comentários sobre o ponto de ônibus.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5908.352s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: De nada.
 Quero dizer, é tão preciso quanto eu sei.
 Meu vizinho tem dois filhos, então eu os vejo partir todos os dias.
 Então, muito obrigado pelos esclarecimentos e comentários.

 Sim, temos Christina presa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5935.446s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Acho que é a segunda vez consecutiva que me saio bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5941.353s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Christina compra um na 30 Myrtle Street.
 Primeiro tenho perguntas para a diretoria e depois algumas perguntas sobre o que foi discutido com a sociedade civil.
 Informamos os moradores do condomínio Amaranth dessas reuniões?
 Porque em todos os que estive, nenhum comentário público veio dessa direção.
 Então, quero ter certeza de que, se eles estiverem na área de apresentação disso, receberão os e-mails, os folhetos, o que for, para que sua voz seja ouvida.
 E então o segundo foi
 Ouvimos muito de Pat hoje, bem como em reuniões anteriores, sobre esta sociedade gestora que irá gerir a propriedade.
 Muitas das questões direcionaram-se para: bem, a sociedade gestora cuidará disso, a sociedade gestora cuidará disso, a sociedade gestora cuidará disso.
 Gostaria que o conselho considerasse trazê-los para uma das sessões.
 Então, depois que Davis construiu o prédio,
 Os residentes têm algum conforto com as pessoas que serão proprietárias e administrarão o dia-a-dia de sua experiência, como planejam lidar com coisas como o caminhão de mudança, como lidarão com qualquer graffiti potencial que apareça na obra de arte ou no playground e como irão limpá-lo.
 Então, eu só queria descartar isso como uma sugestão.
 E então meus comentários sobre o que analisamos acima.
 O que ouvi sobre estacionamento é que atualmente há, na Myrtle Street, 330 pés de espaço para estacionamento.
 Então você entende que quando fala conosco e nos diz que, digamos, você aumentou para 370, você não aumentou o estacionamento na Myrtle Street.
 Entre Amaranth e Myrtle Street,
 Você tem mais estacionamento.
 Mas o estacionamento na Myrtle Street não aumentou.
 E como morador da Myrtle Street, estou muito preocupado com quando acontecerá a aragem e quando teremos emergências de neve, porque agora terei que estacionar em Amaranth.
 Eu moro sozinho.
 Não gosto da ideia de chegar em casa tarde da noite e ver que os moradores ocuparam o estacionamento da Myrtle e tenho que estacionar na esquina.
 em Amaranth e caminhar para casa.
 E acho que será, porque todas essas empresas e todos esses apartamentos de luxo estão cobrando dos moradores pelo estacionamento, eles vão perceber que Amaranth e Myrtle são gratuitos e vão ocupar nossos lugares.
 Então, só quero que você saiba que o upgrade de US$ 130.000 para US$ 170.000 que você estava propondo para Myrtle Street era realmente enganoso e você percebeu isso.
 E finalmente, pensei realmente que estávamos começando a chegar a um lugar onde os moradores estavam sendo ouvidos.
 Portanto, estou muito desapontado ao saber que não iremos mais desviar o tráfego da Myrtle Street, algo que Allison acabou de mencionar.
 E o que o Cliff também mencionou foi que numa reunião anterior fomos informados que os moradores não conseguiriam
 Acesse a garagem pela Myrtle Street.
 Era uma pequena rotunda num beco sem saída para entrar, sair e sair.
 Então, eu só queria expressar minha decepção porque as coisas que senti que estavam sendo ouvidas foram retiradas nesta ligação em particular.

 Depois houve a, ah, neve.
 Sim, ainda não falamos sobre neve.
 Então, remoção de neve e coisas dessa natureza.
 E sei que há estacionamento coberto para moradores.
 Mas acho que seria útil que o conselho entendesse agora ou em uma audiência futura qual é o plano para eventos de neve.
 E então ele também atira.
 Desculpe Christina, qual foi o terceiro que perdi?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6235.053s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Se você está falando sobre estacionamento, estava nevando, então meu palpite é que, como fazem todos esses apartamentos de luxo, eles cobrarão pelo estacionamento.
 E tenho certeza que os espaços cobertos serão maiores e o lote será menor.
 Mas eventualmente, os residentes descobrirão que Amaranth e Myrtle estão livres.</p>

 Al proporcionar algunas de las respuestas, la intención no es dar una respuesta directa.
 Está tratando de dar la mejor respuesta que puedo en este momento.
 Creo que parte del trabajo que he podido hacer en un proyecto en esta etapa, en este nivel de diseño, consultando internamente con nuestro equipo de administración de propiedades y el equipo de administración de activos que realmente se enfoca un poco más en residencial,
 pero también tener conversaciones con grupos de administración de propiedades con los que colaboramos en la operación de algunas de nuestras propiedades residenciales.
 Aún no hemos ejecutado ningún contrato con administradores de propiedades para este proyecto, por lo que no tengo un equipo específico al que pueda incorporar y pedir que presente en este momento.

 Algunas de las preguntas me resultan difíciles de dar una respuesta concreta.
 Entonces, para la remoción de nieve, por ejemplo, creo que sería una situación caso por caso dependiendo de la cantidad de nieve.
 Hay espacios verdes a lo largo del sitio a los que se podría trasladar y ubicar la nieve en caso de tormenta.
 Y luego, si hay tormentas con una cantidad importante de nieve,
 Al hablar con la empresa administradora de la propiedad, lo que sucede es que coordinan la retirada de la nieve del lugar.
 Así que no puedo decir específicamente cuál es ese umbral o con qué frecuencia sucedería.
 Sería un poco caso por caso.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6523.916s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6526.232s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: E quero me aprofundar em algo que acho que Andrew mencionou anteriormente em termos de e-bikes e estacionamento elétrico para veículos elétricos.
 Quero dizer, há uma preocupação semelhante com veículos elétricos e incêndios, assim como com bicicletas elétricas.
 A partir de agora, como você disse, em muitas cidades, e eu sei que isso não é exclusivo de Medford ou desta propriedade de que estamos falando, mas você sabe, um incêndio normal,
 Corpos de bombeiros e caminhões não apagam incêndio em carros elétricos.
 Muitas vezes eles têm que ir a Massport para conseguir.
 Então, eu só quero levantar isso como uma preocupação e também estamos falando sobre quantos pontos elétricos são necessários.
 E acho que o outro que quero mencionar, que foi levantado por Christina e Allison, é a preocupação com o estacionamento e a possibilidade de sair de nossas garagens.
 Eu sei que isso foi mencionado, mas só quero deixar registrado novamente que se o tráfego estiver aumentando na Myrtle Street, Myrtle Street é o endereço.
 E mesmo tendo a área de entrega e retirada na Myrtle Street, você tem tantos moradores, quantos motoristas do Uber Eats?
 Você terá várias pessoas ao mesmo tempo, não apenas uma ou duas.
 E isso é só, você pode ver em outros amigos que visitei apartamentos que já estive.
 Quer dizer, nessas unidades isso acontece.
 E não quero que a Myrtle Street, porque é a zona de embarque e desembarque, se torne um estacionamento enquanto as pessoas esperam para entrar naquele lugar.
 Então agora você está bloqueando o tráfego na estrada.
 Então esses são meus pensamentos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6631.389s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: OK.
 Então você mencionou três nomes.
 Alguém mais sentado com você quer conversar?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6641.51s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Ah, estou falando em nome.
 Na verdade, Paulo também fez outro comentário.
 Eu estava dizendo que a certa altura estávamos conversando sobre como a saída ou entrada da Myrtle Street era na verdade mais uma saída de emergência e não tanto uma saída frontal.
 E se for realmente apenas uma exigência do corpo de bombeiros, você pode fechá-lo e, você sabe, direcionar o tráfego para Fellsway.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6669.151s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Para ser claro, quando você diz fechar, você quer dizer fisicamente ou por causa do trânsito?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6674.116s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Algo assim, ao qual eles têm acesso, então não é realmente uma entrada para a propriedade e você está realmente forçando o tráfego a usar Fellsway.</p>

 Então, boa noite.
 De volta a isso e ao grupo de bebês.
 Realizar a avaliação do estudo de impacto no trânsito.
 E para iniciar o processo, realizamos visitas ao local para observar as condições do tráfego de transporte, revisamos o estudo de impacto da Van Essen Associates, os planos de projeto da Polar Engineering e revisamos todos os modos de transporte, não apenas o tráfego, mas também os pedestres, as bicicletas e o transporte público.
 A gente também tem alguma sobreposição com a obra civil, então vocês veem algumas coisas aqui na planta do canteiro, na circulação interna, no carregamento e nas entregas, e no plano de gerenciamento da demanda de transporte.
 E, no geral, o estudo de tráfego foi feito de acordo com os padrões profissionais estaduais e industriais que temos, e foi um relatório abrangente.
 Então vou resumir os comentários que tivemos.
 Vários dos comentários pedem informações adicionais, pedem esclarecimentos.
 Falamos mais sobre deficiências externas, sobre possíveis melhorias.
 E agradeço a apresentação.
 Caro jogador, acho que vários dos comentários que fizemos foram respondidos naquela apresentação de hoje.
 Então eu agradeço.
 Talvez seja um pouco redundante.
 Alguns dos tópicos que falamos, então isso vai mais ou menos na ordem do estudo de impacto no tráfego.
 Assim, na área de estudo, há uma avaliação abrangente das interseções em toda a área.
 E isso é um pouco difícil de ler.
 O primeiro cruzamento que eu diria que está sendo considerado para inclusão é o único que você observou que não foi incluído, que é a 4th Street.
 Hum, parece muito cercado aqui, então está marcado com uma faixa de pedestres.
 Então esse seria o único local.
 Acho que você pode considerar procurar.
 Assim, para as condições existentes, os volumes de tráfego foram recolhidos no dia 11 de janeiro.
 Martin Luther King Jr.
 O feriado foi dia 15.
 Gostaria apenas de obter algumas respostas e se houve algum impacto esperado desse feriado de segunda-feira nas contagens de quinta-feira.
 O tráfego foi então coletado e resumido.
 Gostaríamos de saber mais sobre as viagens geradas pelos usos existentes do site.
 Assim, apenas algumas informações sobre as condições existentes para os peões na zona.
 Nós mesmos fizemos um inventário com as observações que acabamos de anotar.
 Não há sinalização para pedestres no cruzamento da Central com a Spring Street, que é um cruzamento em estudo.
 Vários cruzamentos na área não possuem faixas de pedestres e painéis de alerta detectáveis, que devem ser compatíveis com a ADA, incluindo o cruzamento das ruas Myrtle, Amaranth e Lawrence.
 Estas são apenas algumas observações e notas.
 Quanto à segurança, existem vários cruzamentos com histórico de acidentes de segurança na área.
 Como acabei de mencionar, Central e Spring têm 13 falhas.
 Mais importante ainda, a taxa de acidentes excede a média do Distrito 4 do MassDOT e a média do estado, elevando-a a um nível de preocupação.
 Fellsway e Riverside tiveram 31 acidentes em cinco anos.
 O MassDOT identificou-o como um grupo de alta sinistralidade, tornando-o elegível para uma auditoria de segurança rodoviária, que foi realizada em 2019 e é identificada como um problema de segurança.
 Fellsway Central e Medford Street tiveram 23 acidentes em cinco anos.
 E gostaríamos apenas de saber mais sobre os tipos de acidentes ocorridos na região com pedestres e bicicletas nessas áreas.
 Estacionamento, a gente está perguntando se existe informação sobre a ocupação das ruas e dos estacionamentos no local hoje para as condições existentes, sabe, o percentual dessas vagas estão ocupadas nas ruas adjacentes e no próprio local seria útil saber essa informação.
 Condições futuras, então deixe-me falar primeiro sobre geração de viagens e atribuição de distribuição de viagens.
 Portanto, estimou-se que o projeto geraria cerca de 90 viagens de veículos e horários de pico nas manhãs e tardes dos dias úteis.
 Achamos que é um número razoável.
 Gostaríamos de ter um pouco mais de informação sobre o número de viagens de caminhão, incluindo esse número.
 Viagens de pedestres, bicicletas e transporte público.
 Portanto, se eles puderem ser divididos e identificados, seria útil.
 Uma divisão futura de bicicletas de 5% foi usada para os cálculos.
 Achamos que pode ser um pouco alto.
 Acho que a divisão geral do modo Medford em toda a cidade é de 1%.
 Então, eu gostaria de saber se uma divisão do modo bicicleta em modo inferior foi assumida para os cálculos, quanto isso mudaria a geração de viagens do veículo?
 Muitas viagens na Fells Way são mostradas fazendo meia-volta na Avenida Central para retornar ao local.
 Gostaria de saber se existem percursos alternativos que o trânsito possa utilizar em vez disso, reconhecendo que existe algum atraso e congestionamento nesse movimento, nomeadamente no período da tarde, como a Avenida Riverside, virando à esquerda na Riverside, ou mesmo utilizando a I-93 como percurso alternativo.
 E parte desse tráfego usaria a I-93 em vez da Fells Way?
 Hum, tem uma tabela no relatório que identifica o aumento de tráfego do projeto, mas não é o caso.
 Identifique estradas próximas ao local, como Fellsway, Myrtle, Pinker, Lawrence e Spring.
 Portanto, gostaria de quantificar essas informações sobre o aumento do volume de tráfego nas estradas adjacentes ao local.
 Um projeto de estacionamento que já se falou um pouco com relação de estacionamento de 1,14.
 Queremos apenas ter certeza de que este é o número correto e adequado para atender à demanda prevista de estacionamento para o local.
 Você sabe, tendo em mente que queremos ter certeza de que faremos tudo certo.
 Portanto, se houver estacionamento suficiente para que ele não se espalhe para bairros e estradas adjacentes.
 Vimos os 4 espaços para visitantes na frente, a área de entrega.
 Achamos que pode ser um pouco baixo.
 Hum, também gostaríamos de saber mais sobre os próprios espaços para visitantes.
 Não apenas entregas de curto prazo, mas se as pessoas estiverem visitando moradores do complexo, onde irão estacionar se fizerem isso por várias horas?
 Se estacionarem por um longo período ou se estacionarem durante a noite.
 Então, alguma discussão sobre como isso funciona.
 Os espaços para visitantes serão operados e gerenciados pelo site.
 Sobre as vagas de estacionamento propostas, as novas vagas do Amaranth, só a intenção dessas vagas, sei que estão à disposição do público, mas devem ser utilizadas pelos visitantes do local?
 Para que se destina a utilização destes espaços?
 Uma análise de capacidade de interseção foi realizada.
 Os engenheiros de tráfego usam o que é chamado de nível de serviço para interseções.
 É semelhante a um boletim escolar, que A, são condições excelentes com pouco atraso ou congestionamento.
 E e F são deficientes.
 F é o pior ou falha com grandes atrasos, congestionamentos e filas.
 Então, você sabe, estávamos lá e vimos congestionamento em Fellsway, principalmente no sentido sul pela manhã e no sentido norte à tarde.
 As intersecções Fellsway, Central e Fellsway e Riverside estão actualmente a operar no nível de serviço F, o que significa que têm um ou mais movimentos que geralmente falham no nível de serviço F.
 E essas condições são agravadas pela futura condição de não construção e pela condição de construção do projeto.
 O projeto verá um aumento notável em Fellsway na Central e os atrasos aumentarão na abordagem da Avenida Central no sentido leste.
 Algumas dessas coisas foram abordadas.
 Ainda esta noite, vi os espaços no canto direito aqui.
 Acho que estamos no lote A do depósito.
 Obrigado por fornecer isso.
 Além disso, o acesso ao prédio e aos espaços ao redor do local, e isso também foi mostrado esta noite, então foi ótimo.
 Aqui foi mostrada a ligação com a futura ciclovia.
 Acho que tudo isso está resolvido.
 E só um esclarecimento sobre os espaços das ruas, os novos espaços na Myrtle Street e Amherst.
 Eu sei que eles estão disponíveis ao público, mas quem teria jurisdição sobre esses espaços?
 Seriam realmente a cidade ou estariam sob jurisdição privada?
 Então, um pouco mais de esclarecimento sobre esses espaços.
 Em si, estamos falando de espaços mais amplos nas plantas do local, da largura das vias de circulação.
 E estacionamento na rua deve ser fornecido, desculpe.
 O estacionamento de bicicletas para moradores e visitantes foi discutido apenas para esclarecer o número de vagas.
 As áreas de armazenamento de neve devem ser indicadas no próprio local.
 Sei que alguém está falando sobre Myrtle Street, mas também preciso saber onde a neve será armazenada no local.
 É por isso que foi desenvolvido um programa de gestão da demanda de transporte.
 E o objetivo desses programas é reduzir o número de viagens de carro, principalmente em veículos com um único ocupante.
 E identificamos algumas outras áreas a considerar ou medidas deste programa.
 Você pode ter falado sobre isso um pouco antes.
 O custo do estacionamento será separado do custo do aluguel do estacionamento?
 Não ouvi isso esta noite, mas talvez haja mais discussão sobre isso.
 Eu sei que há compensações sobre o que pode ser melhor para o site.
 Você pode considerar fornecer subsídios de trânsito ou assinaturas de bicicletas azuis aos residentes como uma medida TDM.
 Você mostrou a estação de bicicletas azul, então é ótimo cuidar disso.
 E deve-se considerar se há espaços para compartilhamento de carros no local, como um zip car para compartilhamento de carros.
 Então as melhorias externas propostas pelo projeto, falamos um pouco sobre a área de espera dos ônibus.
 As vagas de estacionamento existentes perto do ponto de ônibus MBTA seriam reconfiguradas e paisagísticas como nos foi mostrado esta noite, bem como novas vagas de estacionamento, faixa de domínio ampliada em Amaranth e Myrtle Street, ou melhor ainda, estacionamento nas ruas e calçadas.
 Portanto, identificamos algumas outras medidas apenas para considerar e melhorar.
 E estes são principalmente locais externos.
 E muitos deles estão nos cruzamentos de que falei e apresentam deficiências operacionais ou de segurança.
 A primeira é a Avenida Fellsway Riverside.
 Por isso, mencionei que foi identificado um cruzamento com um cluster de alto índice de acidentes que opera no nível de serviço F. Contramedidas e melhorias nas contramedidas de segurança foram identificadas como parte dessa auditoria de segurança no trânsito, incluindo otimização de semáforos, fases avançadas de conversão à esquerda e tempo de liberação.
 Então essas coisas podem ser consideradas.
 A Avenida Central e a Rua Primavera apresentam alto índice de acidentes.
 Poderá considerar-se a modernização do equipamento de sinalização antigo e a instalação de sinalização para peões tal como existe atualmente.
 Fellsway e Central e Medford Street, operando novamente sob condições de nível de serviço F em ambos os períodos de pico, podem ser vistas e fornecem otimização de tempo de sinal.
 A faixa de conversão à esquerda no sentido norte é bloqueada muitas vezes, principalmente durante a hora do rush noturno, de modo que os veículos não podem entrar nessa faixa até que o movimento seja liberado.
 Existe alguma possibilidade de alargar a faixa de conversão à esquerda no sentido norte na Fells Way?
 Fellsway e Myrtle Street, portanto há uma longa travessia de pedestres em Fellsway.
 Como sabemos, há muito trânsito e altas velocidades, por isso pode-se considerar o farol de flash rápido retangular, que é uma medida de segurança para os pedestres e conscientiza os motoristas.
 Queremos apenas avaliar se é viável fornecer uma separação no canteiro central, seja em um semáforo ou em uma curva à esquerda no sentido norte.
 Eu sei que há prós e contras nisso, você sabe, prós e contras em fazer isso, mas há algum tipo de benefício suficiente para considerar esse tipo de mudança aqui?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7754.877s">[Unidentified]</a>: Myrtle, Amherst e Lawrence</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7762.287s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Rua logo no projeto, a configuração é estranha.
 O traçado da rua de mão única confunde motoristas e pedestres.
 Eu sei que o projeto propôs algumas extensões e faixas de pedestres.
 Acho que esse cruzamento merece um pouco mais de atenção.
 Eu sei que eles mencionaram Lawrence também.
 Extensão adicional da calçada potencialmente no canto sudoeste ou talvez até mesmo elevando o cruzamento.
 Acho que é uma porta de entrada importante adjacente ao projeto e depois para o bairro.
 É uma oportunidade para acalmar o trânsito,
 reduzir a velocidade dos veículos e melhorar a circulação e a segurança dos pedestres nesta área.
 Só mais alguns comentários.
 A parada de ônibus existente na Fells Way no sentido sul, adjacente ao local, está em boas condições.
 É um abrigo realmente rudimentar.
 Acho que a modernização desse ponto de ônibus deveria ser considerada.
 Hum, um plano de sinalização de orientação precisa ser desenvolvido.
 O projeto avança para mostrar claramente onde moradores, visitantes e entregadores acessarão e retornarão ao local.
 A calçada em Amherst, ao sul da Myrtle Street, está em más condições.
 Portanto, a repavimentação daquela rua deverá ser considerada como parte do projeto.
 Na verdade, será necessário desenvolver um plano de gestão de tráfego para a construção, mostrando os impactos no bairro.
 E o último comentário é que será necessária uma licença de construção de acesso ao DCR porque a natureza do projecto está a mudar.
 E o acesso e saída para Fellsway exigirão uma licença do DCR.
 Esse é um resumo dos nossos comentários.
 Existem mais, e alguns deles são pequenos, mas detalhados.
 na carta de revisão que fornecemos a você.
 E muito obrigado.

 Ouvimos alguns comentários esta noite sobre esta preocupação com o endereço na Myrtle Ave.
 Hum, e estou me perguntando se você teria recomendações específicas, eu sei que você disse orientação, como que tipo de sinalização pode haver na entrada de Fellsway, você sabe,
 certifique-se de que essa seja a entrada principal do projeto.
 Não sei se você tem alguma ideia sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8116.863s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim.
 Estaríamos, portanto, analisando um esquema de sinalização direcionando residentes e visitantes e entregas de e para o local.
 É claro que os moradores, uma vez lá, saberão como entrar e sair.
 Você sabe, muitos dos lugares onde vamos direcionar os visitantes, você sabe, para o parque, então é provavelmente uma combinação de diferentes tipos de placas, poderiam ser placas de monumentos, poderiam ser outras placas, mas mostrariam, você sabe, principalmente o acesso.
 Indique o local e onde estacionar, dependendo.
 quem você é e depois ir para onde queremos direcionar essas viagens externas.
 Acho que Fells Way será a entrada principal, mas acho que o endereço foi um bom ponto.
 Se alguém digitar o endereço no Waze e não estiver familiarizado com o site, ele o direcionará para Myrtle Street, que pode não ser o lugar para onde queremos que vá.</p>

 Vejo que o comentário do Chris está agora no chat, então vou verbalizá-lo.
 Alguém tem alguma ideia de qual porcentagem do tráfego de entrada ou saída usará o lado Amaranth da garagem?
 Concordo com o consultor que a confluência de ruas é um problema.
 Então acho que vi no plano de gestão da demanda de transporte que havia alguns percentuais.
 Eu sei que temos Scott.
 Não sei se refletem as atualizações mais recentes, é uma parte diferente da propriedade, mas é um tráfego de mão dupla.
 Mas sim, talvez você possa falar sobre isso, Scott.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8236.272s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sim claro.
 Obrigado, Sr. Presidente.
 Scott Thornton com Vanessa Associates.
 Portanto, tínhamos uma estimativa de que cerca de 30, 30 a 40 por cento do tráfego usaria o acesso da Avenida Amaranth e a ideia por trás disso baseava-se simplesmente na proximidade das vagas de estacionamento daquele local.
 Além disso, provavelmente há algum tráfego que deseja
 siga para oeste e você poderá acessar pontos para chegar a 93, por exemplo.
 Algumas dessas áreas que fornecem acesso regional à área, dependendo da hora do dia, poderiam ser mais
 Ele pode ser acessado fácil ou rapidamente via Amaranth e depois retornar pela Myrtle Street ou Lawrence Street para Spring Street.
 Mas sim, a estimativa inicial estava entre 30 e 40 por cento.
 E penso que isso ainda se aplica aos planos mais recentes que foram apresentados aqui esta noite.
 Não prevemos uma grande mudança nessa distribuição.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8322.547s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: OK.
 Obrigado.
 Chris, você teve algum acompanhamento ou perguntas adicionais?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8333.162s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Posso continuar com o que Chris disse?
 Então, você sabe, só de olhar para a circulação nas ruas, quero dizer, eu entendo como uma porcentagem do tráfego poderia sair de Amaranth e seguir para oeste, mas parece quase impossível abordar o local pelo oeste.
 E parece que quase todo o tráfego terá que sair de Fellsway.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8361.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sim, quero dizer, nós fizemos, você sabe, a distribuição foi realmente baseada em, você sabe, onde pensamos que as pessoas estão, ou onde os dados do censo indicam que as pessoas trabalham e vivem na área.
 E foi aí que, com a combinação dos padrões de viagens existentes, obtivemos a distribuição.
 Eu concordo que às vezes
 Será mais eficiente para as pessoas usarem Fellsway se vierem do oeste ou do sul.
 Mas esse não será o caso durante todos os períodos do dia.
 É isso que a distribuição pretende abordar.
 Está em conformidade com o que é provável, com o que esperamos que seja o padrão de atribuição, desculpe-me, a atribuição de tráfego ao longo de todos os períodos de tempo envolvidos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8422.885s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 André, você tinha algum?
 Acompanhe isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8437.957s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Não precisamente.
 Quero dizer,
 Novamente, abordando o projeto dessa forma.
 Quero dizer, parece que a única maneira de chegar àquela entrada, você sabe, de Amaranth é descendo Lawrence, passando por Amaranth Place e o projeto do condomínio, e depois entrando no projeto Amaranth, o que parece muito tortuoso e quase impossível para quem não está muito familiarizado com ele.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8475.658s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Tudo bem, obrigado.
 Outras perguntas do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8485.526s">[Unidentified]</a>: Jaime.
 Quanto ao trabalho em cruzamentos, acho que minha pergunta vem das recomendações para melhorar semáforos e faixas de pedestres que foram levantadas no beta.
 Tipo, para onde isso vai?
 Isso é algo que vai para a cidade?
 É algo em que fazemos parceria com o candidato em termos de escopo?
 Concordo plenamente que todos esses cruzamentos precisam de obras.
 Só não sei como podemos atribuir isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8526.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Pelo que entendi, depende um pouco do cruzamento.
 Então eu acho que,
 o requerente poderia, na sua resposta, indicar a intenção de introduzir algumas ou todas essas melhorias.
 E em alguns casos, seria necessária apenas permissão da cidade.
 Em outros casos pode ser do Estado, o que é um pouco mais complicado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8553.604s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim, no cruzamento da Spring Street Central eu trabalho lá e isso é um problema constante.
 E especialmente se estamos falando de pedestres, há uma estação de bicicletas azul na Haines Square, então as pessoas poderiam usá-la.
 Se a estação de bicicletas azul estiver instalada na propriedade, obviamente você poderá descer por lá.
 Mas se houver pedestres caminhando, se houver tráfego adicional de pedestres, esse cruzamento é absolutamente preocupante.
 E eles chamam isso, você sabe, de falta de faixa de pedestres, coisas assim.
 Sim, é definitivamente algo em que não tinha pensado, mas obviamente vem à tona com este estudo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8595.186s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Obrigado, Jaime.
 Jeff, você tem alguma opinião sobre isso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Hum, sim, depende de como a cidade deseja priorizar essas, é claro, estradas sob jurisdição.
 Então isso é um pouco diferente.
 Os cruzamentos completamente sob controle da cidade serão mais fáceis de resolver.
 Então, você sabe, central e primavera, mas, você sabe.
 e operações e atrasar o congestionamento, o que também pode afetar a segurança.
 Mas acho que cabe à cidade determinar quais são as suas prioridades em termos de quais melhorias consideram razoáveis ​​e que têm ligação com o projeto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8662.117s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Hum, eu serei o próximo.
 Então, eu realmente gostaria de descobrir se esse tráfego de mão dupla, hum, na entrada de, hum, na Myrtle Street, faz sentido ou não.
 Então, ouço as preocupações dos residentes.
 A configuração atual resultou em muitas viagens extras, enquanto antes se entendia que muito cuidado estava sendo tomado para evitar isso.
 Entendo que isso precisa estar aberto para acesso de fogo.
 Mas as informações fornecidas não me deixam claro até que ponto isso será um problema para o bairro.
 Então, sim, alguém fazendo uma entrega.
 Se ele foi fechado de alguma forma, talvez você precise retornar para Myrtle no fluxo unilateral.
 Então, acho que racionalizando isso, certamente entendo as considerações de projeto, mas parece que há um risco aqui de que, com o tráfego de mão dupla, seja como abrir a comporta e seja um passo atrás em relação a um
 tentando mitigar o tráfego do ponto de vista da Myrtle Street.
 Eu adoraria ouvir sua opinião sobre isso, Jeff.
 Não sei se você teve tempo para revisá-lo completamente e tem ideias e comentários prontos para compartilhar sobre ele ou se é algo que você precisa pensar mais, mas gostaria de saber mais sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8778.533s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Você não precisa pensar nem um pouco se, você sabe, se o objetivo é limitar o número de viagens na Myrtle Street, você sabe, se você fizer de 1 ida ou, você sabe, se você fizer de 1 ida ou.
 aí você tem que pensar em como essas viagens vão circular, sabe, dentro do local e para onde vão, sabe, se vão acabar em Myrtle, de qualquer maneira, ou, sabe, se vão fazer Fellsway.
 Então acho que é uma boa pergunta.
 Provavelmente precisaremos fazer uma avaliação um pouco mais, você sabe, em combinação com, você sabe, Scott e Vaness e pensar sobre isso e o que,
 Quais podem ser os impactos, você sabe, se for unilateral em vez de bidirecional.
 Novamente, é um bom tópico.
 Acho que precisaremos de um pouco mais de discussão e avaliação sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8834.447s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8841.325s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Sim.
 E me desculpe, Jeff, se não me lembro disso e do que você falou, mas.
 Você sabe, o.
 A faixa de pedestres lá em Fellsway e Myrtle, quero dizer, não há, você sabe, não há semáforos ou qualquer tipo de dispositivo de segurança para pedestres lá, exceto uma faixa de pedestres e uma faixa central muito pequena.
 E você sabe, e parece que sim.
 Sim, teremos muito mais moradores morando naquela esquina.
 Uh, é mais importante que haja algum tipo de coisa naquele cruzamento.
 Para diminuir a velocidade das pessoas ou ter pelo menos um sinal para os pedestres.
 Então, você sabe, você pensou sobre isso e.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, em um dos meus slides, falei sobre considerar um farol retangular de flash rápido.
 Que é um sinal de botão para pedestres.
 Então sim, acho que a travessia precisa ser melhorada, principalmente porque há pontos de ônibus dos dois lados.
 Quando estive lá vi gente descendo do ônibus e atravessando.
 Então eu acho que é uma espécie de farol retangular de flash rápido de nível básico.
 Para ir mais longe seria um semáforo completo, como o que tem na 4th Street.
 Mas penso que é necessário algum nível de melhoria para a segurança dessa passadeira.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8959.722s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Obrigado.
 Desculpe se perdi isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8962.498s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Sim, compartilho das preocupações sobre a segurança dos pedestres naquela faixa de pedestres.
 Bom ponto sobre os pontos de ônibus em ambos os lados.
 Portanto, se tivermos residentes pegando ônibus em sua viagem, eles provavelmente descerão do ônibus do outro lado de Fells Way.
 E então a outra coisa, e eu entendo que há elementos nisso que podem ser difíceis de mudar em geral, realmente
 Preocupando-se com essa expectativa no trajeto noturno de que os moradores dirigirão pela Fells Way, passarão pelo projeto e farão meia-volta.

 Posso estar errado, mas todos os sinais parecem indicar que isso pode ser um problema.
 E eu adoraria saber o que pode ser feito lá.
 Entendo que você precisa da permissão do ECR, mas isso me preocupa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9038.718s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Alguma outra pergunta ou comentário do conselho?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9048.76s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Eu apenas concordo com o que você está dizendo, Mike.
 Quer dizer, eu entendo as preocupações de Butters sobre o aumento do tráfego na Myrtle Street, mas acho que realmente é.
 É muito mais perigoso para todos fazer meia-volta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9067.528s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Bem, na verdade eu vejo os dois como separados, porque pelo que entendi, se você estiver indo para o norte, que eu acho que seria o caminho mais comum, se você tivesse que adivinhar onde as pessoas vão trabalhar, provavelmente é em algum lugar no centro urbano, acho que ainda tem que fazer o retorno.
 Ou você tem que fazer várias ruas laterais.
 Então eu acho que Myrtle versus não,
 Poderia impactar um pouco mais a saída do imóvel.
 Mas acho que voltando, se eles estão indo para o norte, para muitas pessoas, essa inversão de marcha será a melhor opção, mesmo que seja nos dois sentidos.

 Por segurança, acho que deveríamos reabrir os comentários públicos.

 Acho que alguns membros do público que apareceram aqui já compartilharam seus comentários sobre o trânsito.

 Olá, Alison D'Agostino.
 Represento 1022-1024 Pillsbury.
 Com licença, estou resfriado.
 Mas obrigado por abrir isso novamente.
 Quero apenas fazer um primeiro comentário, obrigado por esta revisão por pares.
 O fato de todas essas interseções terem sido declaradas com classificação F é,
 Abriu meus olhos e também parece muito alinhado com o que vivi no dia a dia.
 Quero apenas fazer um comentário e muito obrigado por abordá-lo.
 Acho que obviamente a intersecção com Amaranth, Lawrence, Myrtle é muito crítica.
 E vou te dizer agora, moro em uma casa perto de Fells Way to Myrtle,
 Tenho que olhar várias vezes ao dia porque alguém está virando a esquina para descer a Myrtle Street.
 Quase pessoalmente fui atropelado por um carro que morava aqui pelo menos três ou quatro vezes.
 Então, para mim, as áreas críticas que eu realmente respeitaria o conselho e outros a considerar, Davis Company, são Myrtle e Fellsway,
 Recuperação de 100% com Myrtle e, com licença, Fellsway e Central.
 Com Fellsway e DCR, eles criaram este novo tipo de passarela pop-up, ideal para pedestres.
 Mas o que causou é que esta mudança de direção não é realmente acessível para veículos maiores.
 Então, eu só queria trazer isso à tona.
 bem como uma preocupação.
 Meu marido, é engraçado, na apresentação a caminhonete dele foi essa que você viu, o Dodge Ram ali.
 Mas na verdade ele tem que descer a Central, descer a Kendall, descer a Myrtle para chegar à nossa casa e depois descer a Amaranth com aquele troco.
 Voltamos para Fells Way para chegar em nossa casa.
 Portanto, se algum dos ocupantes deste edifício tiver vans ou veículos maiores, não poderá fazer o retorno em Fells Way e Central.
 Acho que você definitivamente deveria considerar isso em sua avaliação.
 De qualquer forma, meu comentário final é simplesmente um agradecimento por mencionar isso. Eu realmente aprecio isso no conselho de administração e na empresa Davis que conheci, e eles também foram muito receptivos.
 você sabe, vocal e útil na tentativa de ter essas conversas.
 Então eu não acho que isso foi encontrado nesta reunião.
 Mas na minha opinião, como residente de longa duração representado por uma sogra de dois anos que é proprietária desta casa há mais de 50 anos, tem sido realmente fantástico.
 Mas ver que a avaliação do tráfego está a ser levada muito a sério neste momento,
 Especialmente Lawrence e Myrtle, Fellsway, muito obrigado.
 Mas eu só queria ressaltar que, na verdade, os cortes no meio-fio, o novo, eu acho, código DCR, acho que precisa ser considerado porque você não pode nem fazer meia-volta se tiver um veículo grande na Central e Fellsway.
 Então vou parar por aí.
 Obrigado.</p>

 Eu não disse nada sobre isso antes porque nunca pensei que chegaríamos a um ponto em que consideraríamos faixas de pedestres e sinais de parada e o estado atual da direção neste bairro, incluindo o retorno em Central, Lawrence,
 Temos várias ruas de mão única neste bairro.
 Você só pode aumentá-los e abaixá-los de uma determinada maneira.
 Como residente de longa data que correu literalmente milhares de quilômetros nessas ruas, Allison, vou começar a acenar para você quando passar pela sua casa agora.
 As pessoas não param nos sinais de stop.
 As pessoas não param naquelas faixas de pedestres triangulares quando estou parado nelas, quando pego o ônibus.
 para a estação de trem, as pessoas não param na Fells Way para deixar você atravessar.
 Há alguns sinais de parada no bairro, ou, com licença, postes de luz no bairro que não têm sinalização de pedestres.
 Você só tem um momento em que o semáforo está vermelho e ninguém vira à direita para não ser atingido.
 Fico feliz que tenha surgido uma conversa sobre segurança de pedestres, porque essas ruas são difíceis para os pedestres.
 Sem falar que as calçadas não são muito boas, mas essa é a cidade de Bedford.</p>
