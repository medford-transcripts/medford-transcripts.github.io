    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=455.983s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  Great.
 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2419.579s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Итак, это наш последний слайд.
 Да, синие велосипеды просто хотят рассказать вам, почему мы часто выбираем синие велосипеды, которые хотят поставить на частной территории, но на хорошо видном месте рядом с общественным тротуаром, чтобы люди знали, что они там есть.
 Поэтому мы выбрали это место, но, очевидно, здесь есть некоторая гибкость, если смотреть под этим углом.
 Синее колесо думает иначе.
 Мы найдём новый дом, но это имеет смысл.
 На автобусной остановке.
 Люди могут доехать на синем велосипеде до припаркованного автобуса и встать, или они могут сесть в автобус и сойти с синего велосипеда…
 Ближе к дому.
 Так что это хорошее место.
 Мы считаем, что это хорошее дополнение к проекту.
 На этом наше шоу заканчивается.
 Пэт, я не знаю, есть ли у тебя последняя заметка или ты хочешь закончить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2470.844s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, Эл, для меня это звучит довольно дерьмово. Похоже, BT тоже не для меня. Сначала я поговорил с какой-то синей командой, чтобы познакомиться с ними.
 Ваш отзыв о целесообразности размещения.
 В целом они сошлись во мнении, что это хорошее место не только по размеру, но и по близости к другим станциям, которые они считали подходящими.
 Поэтому мы предлагаем и обязательно хотели бы добавить координацию с городом и Bluebikes, чтобы добавить там станции.
 Но в конце общего представления
 Я знаю, что мы проявим некоторую гибкость, поэтому думаю, что в конце мы дадим вам несколько советов.
 Вот краткое описание некоторых строительных работ, которые мы выполняем в рамках нашего проекта гражданского строительства, не более того.
 Проще говоря, планировка, ландшафтный дизайн, удобства, парковка и все остальное, что вы видите, работает вместе.
 Просто чтобы подтвердить всем: это не случайная коллекция.
 Мы работаем над тем, чтобы ответить на вопросы и предоставить более подробную информацию о том, что Боулер просит город сделать в гражданском иске и что рассматривают коллеги.
 Прошел бета-версию.
 Итак, как Стив упоминал ранее, это некоторые из вещей, которые мы хотим рассмотреть, решить или расширить.
 Мы не хотим, чтобы у кого-то были проблемы с шоу, поскольку мы всегда хотим быть уверены, что можем ответить на эти вопросы, но у нас также есть возможность
 То же самое касается экспертных оценок и последующих комментариев.
 Поэтому я просто хочу закончить свою речь.
 Так что, надеюсь, мы не слишком заняты для всех, а просто хотим убедиться, что мы охватываем все темы, которые считаем необходимыми.
 Поэтому я закрою его и открою для вопросов.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2612.827s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, я думаю, скоро у нас будет бета-версия.
 Я знаю, что отзывы от друзей еще не готовы, но я просто хочу иметь общее представление о том, когда нам их ожидать и тогда мы будем принимать вопросы от доски.
 Я вижу, у вас есть Джефф в тестовой команде.
 Пожалуйста, продолжайте.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2639.459s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Здравствуйте, Председатель Совета.
 Итак, позвольте мне рассказать вам, что у меня сегодня на ужин.
 Итак, у меня есть это.
 Презентация Используя PowerPoint, я смог обобщить комментарии о трафике, который мы получили по почте.
 Тогда я смогу показать это вам.
 У меня есть несколько предложений от Билла МакГрата, нашего инженера-строителя.
 Я ищу этот проект, на этой неделе он в отпуске, но у меня есть для него список адресов электронной почты.
 Я подписал презентацию.
 Если хотите, я могу прочитать список, но если у вас есть подробные вопросы, я не смогу на них ответить.
 Это мой опыт, но если хотите, я могу прочитать ваши первоначальные комментарии.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2690.178s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, похоже, Билл все еще работает над разделом комментариев, верно? Или у вас есть список комментариев, которые вы еще не прокомментировали?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2700.087s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: О, я не хочу говорить за него.
 Я имею в виду, это примерный список.
 Возможно, это еще не точно, но мы работаем над этим.
 Могу сказать, что, возможно, на следующей неделе, когда вернусь из отпуска, смогу обернуть их сопроводительными письмами.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2716.223s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, выглядит хорошо.
 Поэтому мы намерены рассмотреть более подробно на следующих слушаниях.
 Это также даст вам время попросить обратную связь и начать отвечать.
 Звуковой план.
 Да, Джефф, я вернусь к твоим вопросам о доставке позже.
 Сначала я подошел к доске и задал вопросы по презентации.
 Это выглядит красиво?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2745.784s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, спасибо.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2747.785s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Вопросы и комментарии на панели начнутся прямо сейчас.
 Джейми продолжает.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2762.478s">[Unidentified]</a>: Да, я думаю, это было великолепное шоу.
 Я ценю пейзаж при общем освещении и то, как оно сочетается с темным небом.
 Я думаю, что это очень широкое понятие с точки зрения потребностей и факторов, которые мы хотим охватить.
 У меня вопрос, где вы говорите о пересечении входа в здание и фасада - это вход со стороны Миртл-стрит.
 Я думаю, что меня беспокоит только адресная точка зрения: должно ли это здание называться 970 Fellsway, не говоря уже об адресе на Миртл-стрит, просто учитывая, что Google Maps, Apple Maps и незнакомцы должны указывать на вход Fellsway, а не на вход на Myrtle Street?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2809.941s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Да, я могу ответить.
 При необходимости недвижимость будет разделена, и жилая недвижимость не будет иметь фасада Fellsway, поэтому не будет адреса Fellsway.
 970, скорее всего, останется адресом хранилища.
 Сегодня это все в одной упаковке, поэтому и называется 970.
 Но нынешнее здание сохранит этот адрес.
 Новое здание будет иметь адрес, оно может иметь адрес только в Мурте или Амаранто.
 Миртл, кажется, наш нынешний кандидат.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2849.895s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Это катастрофа.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2855.676s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?
 Андрей, давай.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2866.31s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Спасибо за совет.
 Отличная полезная информация.
 Всего несколько вопросов.
 Во-первых, я понял, что вскоре появилось определенное общественное мнение по поводу удобств и ландшафтного дизайна, и мне стало интересно, обсуждались ли с соседями эти особенности, особенно игровая площадка.
 Я также хотел бы знать, есть ли у вас какие-либо идеи по включению паблик-арта, исторической информации или услуг или чего-то в этом роде.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2908.533s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, я умею танцевать.
 Начиная с первого вопроса, я встретился с соседями и много обсуждал проект.
 Одной из проблем является обустройство открытого пространства, и обычно я встречаюсь с некоторыми соседями, когда звоню.
 Не хочу искажать сказанное, но в целом у меня сложилось такое мнение, что играть вне физического оборудования некоторым соседям не очень-то весело.
 Им не нужно представлять, что они его используют.
 Мы говорим о том, что мы хотим, чтобы запланированное открытое пространство приносило пользу сообществу, и мы открыты для их отзывов, если они хотят что-то увидеть.
 Вот общие ответы, которые я получил на данный момент.
 Относится к паблик-арту.
 Ответ на этот вопрос — да, это зависит от того, способны ли мы к размышлению или нет.
 У нас нет конкретной информации.
 Имейте в виду конкретную идею.
 Я считаю, что из последнего аудита, ориентированного на архитектуру, мы узнали, что мы продолжим рассматривать этот вопрос в рамках коллегиальной проверки.
 Я не хочу сдаваться, но думаю, что при следующей встрече архитекторов Дэвис Сквер и экстерьера здания элементы ландшафта выдвинут на первый план текущего разговора.
 Это то, о чем мы пытаемся больше думать.
 Я не знаю, сможем ли мы наконец гарантировать, что у нас будет формальный дизайн паблик-арта.
 Это немного подлежит уточнению, но, как правило, чтобы ответить на вопрос «да», мы определенно готовы включить его в различные области сайта как часть сайта.
 Если у члена правления или члена сообщества есть какие-либо предложения о том, что и где делать, мы будем рады услышать ваше мнение.
 Честно говоря, он очень помог нам, когда мы обсудили планы здания и то, как оно будет выглядеть.</p>

 На самом деле, я просто хочу извиниться за то, что последовал вашим словам, потому что
 Меня интересует (и мне интересно, считаете ли вы это правдой) то, что все соседи, с которыми вы говорили, были соседями Миртл-стрит, то есть все они были домами и дворами.
 Вы когда-нибудь говорили с жителем Amaranth Place о квартире, рядом с которой, кажется, нет большого двора?
 Потому что это то место
 В офисе считают, что для этих многоквартирных домов будет полезно некоторое свободное пространство.

 Ох
 Просто некоторые комментарии или вопросы о трафике.
 Ну, 1 — это центральная линия.
 Предлагаемые проекты и место для немедленного хранения могут показаться долгими.
 Интересно, ищут ли они какой-то барьер или какую-то другую форму релаксации?
 Я также хотел бы знать, можете ли вы объяснить немного больше.
 Куда едут грузовики, как они выбираются из гаража и где они это делают?
 Куда люди будут переносить свою мебель?</p>

 Я просто хочу выразить себя.
 Вы сказали, что они могут припарковаться на тротуаре.
 Это тротуар?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3368.909s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Есть проходы, которые определяют углы здания.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3406.901s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: Что касается велосипедов, сколько велосипедов мы оставляем дома?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3419.029s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Я могу танцевать.
 Это мнение мы получили от оценщика Бомера в рамках выполняемого архитектурного проекта.
 Размеры этой комнаты дорисовываем согласно плану, план этажа остается прежним.
 Сейчас мы работаем над определением площади этой комнаты, а затем придумываем идею.
 Мы максимально сосредоточились на велосипедах и изучили шкафы для велосипедов и подставки для часов разных размеров, расположенные как наверху, так и на стене, пытаясь максимизировать эффективность этого пространства.
 Итак, у меня нет однозначного ответа относительно количества, но что касается квадратного изображения в комнате, мы улучшаем этот ответ сейчас и, возможно, по крайней мере один в следующей презентации, после того как мы посмотрим на здание.
 Спасибо
 К сожалению, это касается велосипедов, находящихся в велоотсеке здания.
 Нам показали территорию за пределами зала, где были размещены ракетки для хранения велосипедов.
 Я думаю, мы тоже можем дать на это немного денег.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3500.71s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3509.002s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Хорошо, могу я продолжить свое мнение о парковке?
 В последнем проекте 40B мы рассмотрели одну из проблем, с которой нам часто приходилось сталкиваться, — это парковка.
 Поэтому в контексте, когда мотоциклы и электрические велосипеды более популярны, чем когда-либо, при рассмотрении конструкции велосипедных сидений.
 Знаете, иногда случаются пожары, которые трудно потушить этими вещами.
 Поэтому я просто хочу принять это во внимание и убедиться, что это пожаробезопасное место.
 Да, район.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3548.73s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Обратите внимание, что помещение для хранения велосипедов находится на первом этаже, на уровне платформы, и это негорючее здание.
 Очевидно, мы можем выяснить эти вещи, когда проект достигнет уровня проектной документации, строительной документации, а затем отправить его на проверку кода.
 Но лучше убедиться, что мы считаем это игровой площадкой.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3579.455s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: Джим?
 Да, по той же теме, я знаю много мест, где запрещено пользоваться электровелосипедами из-за опасности возгорания.
 Будет ли это учтено?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3601.675s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Это хороший вопрос.
 По сей день мы до сих пор не общаемся.
 Мы обратились за помощью к нескольким командам по управлению активами, а также к компании Davis Internal Asset Management.
 Это не заданная тема, поэтому однозначного ответа на этот вопрос у меня нет.
 Мы определенно можем провести расследование и скоординировать действия с командой управления недвижимостью и, среди прочего,
 Подробности, а также подписанные правила и положения жители здания узнают при подаче заявления на аренду.
 Мы определенно можем проверить это дальше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3640.824s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3647.971s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: На самом деле, это настолько важно, что я не могу этого запомнить.
 Думаю, об этом уже говорилось в предыдущем посте.
 Публичный, а этот каркас в жилом помещении из дерева или другого материала?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3666.182s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Это правда.
 Так как же выглядит это здание и каков текущий проект?
 Это здание-платформа.
 Текущая конфигурация достигла своего пика.
 Пять строительных элементов в одном и четыре в одном.
 Еще один момент – это ваш уровень огнестойкости, будь то сталь или бетон официально не установлен, но выше уровня огнестойкости должен быть деревянный каркас.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3702.173s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: я вижу
 Причина, по которой я спрашиваю,
 Одна из причин, по которой мы потратили так много времени на обсуждение этого вопроса на предыдущих слушаниях по делу 40B, заключалась в том, что это было похожее здание, и наш комиссар по строительству в то время имел непосредственный опыт работы с пожаром в Уолтеме, в данном случае со структурным пожаром.
 Но в основном это тот тип здания, который построен
 Высокий риск возгорания в определенных ситуациях.
 Так что имейте это в виду, наблюдая за другими группами.
 Я думаю, что ориентация, особенно для зданий одного и того же типа, вероятно, лучший способ добраться сюда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3745.348s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, понятно и хороший момент.
 Что касается завершения, проект будет полностью соответствовать требованиям кодекса и обязательно пройдет процесс проверки.
 Затем, во время строительства, управляющий зданием будет работать с пожарной службой Медфорда над разработкой плана NFPA 241 и соблюдением всех применимых законов и правил.
 Мы полностью рассматриваем виды деревянных каркасных конструкций и риски, связанные с ними.
 Хорошо, спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3787.53s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?
 Андрей, продолжение.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3795.043s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Можете ли вы более подробно объяснить инфраструктуру зарядки электромобилей, о которой вы говорите?
 Потому что это выглядит не очень.
 Я имею в виду, что речь идет о быстром переходе на электромобили в ближайшие 5–10 лет.
 Очевидно, что одним из самых больших препятствий является наличие зарядных станций.
 Было бы здорово, если бы вы объяснили нам немного больше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3822.498s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Да, Пэт хочет, чтобы я это сделал?
 Я скажу вам, где они.
 Я верну изображение на экран, чтобы показать, с чего мы начали.
 Затем мы поговорим о возможностях в здании.
 Так что просто увеличьте немного масштаб здесь.
 Опять же, мест 14, два древних и два доступных.
 Поскольку потом сложно установить сантехническую и монтажную инфраструктуру снаружи здания, мы хотим подготовить все с самого первого дня, чтобы инфраструктура была готова и готова.
 Варианты пристройки позволяют получить доступ к гаражу, но у нас его нет.
 Поставить его в гараж легко, если мы заранее спланируем и установим подходящую электрическую инфраструктуру, не так ли?
 Трансформатор, распределительный щит и так далее.
 Нам нужно подготовиться к наращиванию этой силы в будущем.
 Нам необходимо планировать заранее и реализовывать этот план.
 Когда мы вступим в этап проектирования последовательности, мы будем координировать эту работу с энергетической компанией.
 Однако, когда у вас есть эта жизненно важная инфраструктура, добавить оборудование в ваш гараж станет немного проще, поскольку вы можете установить трубы на крыше гаража.
 Запускайте его там, где хотите, и добавляйте станции в любое время.
 Вот как мы добираемся до сайта, находя самые сложные вещи с первого дня и обеспечивая гибкость.
 Как сказала Анжанита, он быстро расширяется.
 Мы не знаем, каким будет спрос в ближайшие годы, но его легко удовлетворить.
 Пэт, интересно, что еще ты можешь сказать об этом здании?
 Это мой взгляд на возможности расширения электромобилей.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Так что я думаю, что вы попали в самую точку.
 Наш мыслительный процесс состоит в том, чтобы установить зарядное устройство для электромобилей снаружи здания как часть конструкции здания.
 Мы слышали, как члены совета и другие лица, присутствовавшие на слушаниях, говорили, что хотели бы видеть зарядное устройство возле здания.
 Поэтому мы считаем, что работы на месте — это то, что мы можем сделать с будущим расширением, мощные и гибкие с точки зрения нужного размера электрической инфраструктуры, но они могут делать это на уровне платформы, на уровне здания противопожарной защиты, вплоть до уровня гаража, где они могут установить трубы на крыше и добавить зарядные станции для электромобилей.
 Честно говоря, Дэвис добился успеха в других проектах и ​​может добавить больше по мере роста спроса или спроса.
 На самом деле это вопрос координации вашей электрической инфраструктуры.
 Итак, вы знаете, повторяя то, что сказал Стив, но слушая это непосредственно от меня, это всего лишь часть того, как мы разрабатываем веб-сайт и думаем об этом с идеей, почему вы видите, что они сидят на веб-сайте и меняются по мере роста здания в будущем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Да, я просто хочу сказать, что я рад, что вы заинтересованы во внутреннем расширении.
 Я просто думаю, что при большом количестве парковок даже первого дня хватит, чтобы зарядить электромобиль.
 Я определенно рекомендую больше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Это то, что мы действительно можем рассмотреть.
 Конкретного ответа по количественной оценке у меня нет, но мы обращаем внимание на Ваше указание и обязательно учтём его.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4075.973s">[Unidentified]</a>: Спасибо
 Тогда где же эти станции быстрой зарядки или где вы хотите, чтобы люди парковались и заряжались на ночь?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Это хороший вопрос.
 Я думаю, что есть много уровней.
 Все требует некоторой координации с вашей энергетической инфраструктурой: сколько энергии вы можете получить и какой размер коробки вам нужен для распределения нужного вам типа энергии.
 Могу сказать, что мне кажется, что станций быстрой зарядки больше.
 Для такого здания это можно считать нормальным, даже нетипичным, учитывая его большие размеры.
 У меня нет однозначного ответа.
 Я думаю, мы хотим сделать их максимально эффективными, но нам придется рассчитать характеристики зарядной станции позже, когда мы сможем рассчитать количество с инженером-электриком и работать с поставщиком коммунальных услуг, чтобы подтвердить, какой объем энергии может достичь этого места.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Примечательно, что в этом типе застройки мы используем только обычные зарядные устройства, потому что люди собираются пойти домой и припарковать машину на ночь.
 Таким образом, ставка овернайт не станет препятствием для нормальной деятельности бизнеса.
 Если это более короткое вращение, на этом этапе вам действительно нужна более быстрая загрузка.
 Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4170.979s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ок
 Однако если те же 14 человек используют эти 14 мест ночью, а вам нужно проверить более 300 мест, вы все равно будете ими пользоваться.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4186.36s">[Unidentified]</a>: Да, это то, что я имею в виду.
 Вот что я думаю.
 Предназначены ли эти места для пользователей электромобилей? Или, знаете, по мнению Эндрю, если бы они не были прилежными и не заряжались быстрее, смогли бы мы отдать эти помещения арендаторам, использовать их для зарядки аккумуляторов, а затем переместить машину и сделать их доступными для других?
 Кстати, понятно, что это всего лишь идея.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, это то, что нам придется пойти на компромисс.
 Нам нужна координация между командами по управлению недвижимостью.
 Я считаю, что в условиях, о которых вы говорите, когда мы блокируем номер, если сразу определяется, что требуется больше, я считаю, что мы чувствуем себя комфортно, имея возможность легко добавлять.
 Таким образом, если люди не смогут зарядить свои машины из-за занятости на работе, в будущем мы сможем разместить больше зарядных станций.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Что ж, в этой статье я скажу одно: это холодный климат.
 Вот почему я думаю, что электромобилям нужно хотя бы немного внутреннего пространства.
 Так понимание проще.
 Не забывайте о планировании перед установкой инфраструктуры.
 Так что нашим будущим зрителям было бы полезно знать их планы, что они ищут, насколько они могут расшириться и будет ли у них какое-то пространство, например, знаете ли вы, где у них будет место сегодня?
 А как насчет парковки или при нынешнем расположении все снаружи?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4304.051s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Обозначается рекомендуемой точкой формы для установки.
 Как я сказал в течение нескольких минут, мы поняли обратную связь, мы выясним, сколько места доступно, и если то, что мы предлагаем сегодня, окажется недостаточным, мы проведем небольшое исследование по этому вопросу, а затем сможем ответить тем, что мы считаем хорошим.
 А если так, то никакого дополнительного интерьера или экстерьера вы не получите.
 Вот почему пример нашего времени уникален в этом понятии а.

 Вопросы, которые мне задали, но я не задал:
 Возможное расположение парковки школьного автобуса.
 Так что на данный момент я не знаю ближайшей автобусной остановки, но знаю, что сейчас она используется в промышленных парках и, возможно, некоторые семьи живут в новых зданиях.
 Так где же школьный автобус останавливается рядом с этим объектом размещения?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4387.755s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Лично я не смотрю на остановки и дороги.
 Я не знаю, идут ли они на Миртл-Роуд или на ближайшую дорогу, но мы определенно можем связаться с командой доставки и узнать, где это.
 Я думаю, что расширение Мирта открывает некоторые новые возможности, которые мы еще не изучили, но хотим рассмотреть.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4459.498s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: А как насчет вообще?
 Это очень хороший вопрос.
 Мы его не трогаем.
 Действительно есть идеи по улучшению этого места.
 Может нарушить ваш мыслительный процесс.
 Мы рассматриваем два основных типа полей.
 Стив, ты можешь удалить это
 Просто весь план участка как ориентир.
 Первый находится в Феллсуэй и, как видите, дает возможность отреагировать, просто перерезав тротуар на благо всего объекта.
 Измените точку доступа к зданию и ее емкость, а также порядок въезда и выезда грузовиков из здания.
 Я думаю, это очень специфично для вашего вопроса.
 Это будет модификация существующих условий.
 Во-вторых, я думаю.
 Что мы хотим понять, так это масштабы, и это немного сложно, Стив, но когда здание было там, когда существующий склад был снесен, для существующего автономного здания должна была остаться длинная стена.
 Как мы планируем закончить эту стену?
 Сейчас это стена КМУ в здании.
 Будут планы войти и улучшить внешнее состояние стены.
 Разумеется, мы позаботимся о том, чтобы демонтаж был произведен безопасно, но его эстетика – это всего лишь вопрос отделки этой стены и сохранности всех соединений с крышей.
 Все, что касается гидроизоляции здания, было сделано правильно.
 Таким образом, не только снос существующего здания, но и работа, которую мы планируем провести, также будет иметь некоторые улучшения, которые позволят нам решить проблему главного входа в часть здания.
 Я не хочу.
 Разговоры об этом жилом объекте утихли, но мы готовим несколько демонстраций, которые мы обсудим в частном порядке с городскими властями, чтобы помочь найти путь к дальнейшему развитию здания, когда некоторые работы над ним будут иметь смысл.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Повторяю, я не знаю, как устроено это здание.
 Так что признаюсь, что я неосведомлен или неосведомлен о том, как работает этот бизнес.
 Но я просто думаю о своем личном опыте и о том, где я вырос.
 Помню, в промышленном здании рабочие выходили на улицу и устраивали место для встреч, ну и, знаете, бросали курить, делали перерывы на обед и так далее.
 Здесь нужны эти вещи?
 Если бы это произошло, то где бы это произошло?
 Означает взаимодействие с соседями?
 Потому что он больше не закрыт.
 Это торговля.
 Это район.
 Конечно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Нет, это полезный вопрос.
 Таким образом, в настоящее время здание используется для самостоятельного хранения, что означает минимальные затраты на техническое обслуживание для нас и рабочих на объекте.
 Это не производственная работа, а просто общее руководство и контроль.
 Человеческая сложность Сложность тех, кто имеет доступ к личным клеткам.
 Поэтому интенсивность труда рабочих на объекте и условия для выездных работ очень низкие.
 Мы считаем, что нет необходимости предоставлять им место сбора внутри здания.
 Есть офисы, комнаты отдыха и тому подобное, офисы руководителей.
 Итак, в целом мы думаем о качестве использования этого здания и качестве проверок, проводимых за счет сокращения количества персонала.
 Я не ожидал, что произойдет то, что вы сказали.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4732.384s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Спасибо
 Больше вопросов и комментариев у меня нет.</p>

 Спасибо
 Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?
 Нет, я думаю, что наиболее разумно было бы проголосовать за публичное обсуждение гражданского процесса.
 Затем, после общественного обсуждения вопросов граждан, мы пройдем период регулирования дорожного движения.
 Затем президента ждет публичная петиция по вопросам дорожного движения.
 Введение в гражданское строительство.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4813.254s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: សួស្តីលោក
 ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះ Cliff Bomer ។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នករិះគន់ស្ថាបត្យកម្ម ហើយអរគុណអ្នកខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ការនិយាយរបស់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំមានសំណួរមួយចំនួនដែលអាចកើតឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងមើលគ្នាទៅវិញទៅមក
 វគ្គនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាអស្ចារ្យណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​មាន​រឿង​រដ្ឋប្បវេណី​មួយ​ចំនួន​ប្រហែល​ជា​ត្រឡប់​មក​លើ​ប្រធាន​បទ​វិញ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតអំពីកន្លែងចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនចាំកន្លែងដែល Medford អនុវត្តលេខកូដចូលរួមនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែត្រូវចាំ។
 លេខកូដចូលរួមមានតម្រូវការជាក់លាក់សម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ហើយវាប្រែប្រួលយ៉ាងទូលំទូលាយ។
 នេះគឺជាការលោតផ្លោះដ៏ធំបើប្រៀបធៀបទៅនឹងលេខកូដផ្សេងទៀត។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាច្បាប់អន្តរប្រតិបត្តិការទាមទារ 20% នៃចំណតរថយន្តដើម្បីភ្ជាប់បណ្តាញ ខ្ញុំគិតថាមកពី
 សម្រាប់ចំណតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​បង្ហាញ​ខ្លួន​ឯង​ជា​អាជ្ញាធរ​លើ​បទប្បញ្ញត្តិ​ជាក់លាក់​នោះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​សូម​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​វា​ឡើង​វិញ ព្រោះ​វា​អាច​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ពិត​ប្រាកដ ប្រសិន​បើ​ទីក្រុង​ឆ្លងកាត់​វា​មុន​ដំណើរការ​អនុញ្ញាត​ចាប់ផ្តើម។
 ក៏មានមតិពីរឬបីទៀត។
 ជាដំបូងខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍យ៉ាងខ្លាំង
 ដ្យាក្រាមរង្វង់ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាមាននៅក្នុងរបៀបវារៈសម្រាប់វគ្គបន្ទាប់ គឺជាប្រធានបទមួយចំនួនដែលបានលេចឡើងទាក់ទងនឹងការបំភ្លឺនៃអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំបានឃើញវា។
 ច្រកចូលចំហៀងគឺជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អមួយដើម្បីបន្ថែមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍បរិមាណដល់ facade អាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មើល​ឃើញ​ថា​វា​ជា​ឱកាស។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចស្រដៀងគ្នារបស់ Andrew អំពីសិល្បៈសាធារណៈគឺត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 វាមានផ្នែកខាងមុខវែងដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងចំណតរថយន្ត ពណ៍ amaranth វែង ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ទីធ្លាជញ្ជាំងដែលពិតជាអាចបង្កើននូវអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាជាគំនិតដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ផែនការចំហៀងរបស់អាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមានឱកាសដ៏អស្ចារ្យនៅទីនោះ។
 យោបល់រហ័សពីរទៀត។
 មួយគឺ,
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​ផែនការ​ណា​មួយ​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ឃើញ​នៅ​យប់​នេះ​ឆ្លុះ​បញ្ចាំង​ពី​គំនិត​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​អំពី​ការ​កាត់​ជ្រុង​ភាគ​ពាយព្យ​នៃ​អគារ​នោះ​ទេ។
 យើង​បាន​មើល​ទៅ​លើ​ការ​សិក្សា​បរិមាណ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មាន​ប្រសិទ្ធិ​ភាព​ខ្លាំង​ក្នុង​ការ​កាត់​ចេញ​ជ្រុង​ពាយ័ព្យ ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​សូវ​សំខាន់​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងទុកវាចោល។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថានេះជាចេតនា ឬគ្រាន់តែជាបញ្ហាសម្របសម្រួលរវាងការងារសំណង់ និងសំណង់។
 ចំណុចសំខាន់គឺ ខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាអ្នកធ្វើដំណើរទេ ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាយឺតពេលទៅសន្និសីទ ប្រហែលជាពីរដង ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថានឹងមានជម្លោះលើការចូលរៀន។
 ដោយសារតំបន់មកដល់គឺនៅផ្នែកខាងជើងនៃអគារ មានការពិភាក្សាខ្លះអំពីរបៀបបង្កើតផ្លូវដើរដែលបំបែកអគារដែលមានស្រាប់ពីអគារថ្មី ដោយផ្លាស់ទីចម្ងាយ 100 ហ្វីតដំបូងទៅភាគខាងជើង ដើម្បីកុំឱ្យមនុស្សទៅពី Myrtle ទៅតំបន់មកដល់ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកចេញពីច្រកចូលចំណតនៅផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃអាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំសូមអភ័យទោសប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំខកខានការសន្ទនាផ្សេងទៀតអំពីបញ្ហានេះ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់បញ្ជាក់ថាខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាមនុស្សឆ្លងកាត់ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីចំនួនយានជំនិះដែលអាចប្រើវាជាច្រកទ្វារ។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្យ៉ាងវិញទៀត នេះជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានរៀនពីទស្សនៈស៊ីវិល ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 សម័យប្រជុំការងារត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងម្តងទៀត ហើយខ្ញុំបានថ្លែងអំណរគុណដល់បេក្ខជនចំពោះឆន្ទៈរបស់ពួកគេក្នុងការបន្តអភិវឌ្ឍស្ថាបត្យកម្មរបស់អគារ ដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវភ្ជាប់ជាមួយផែនការទេសភាព និងសំណង់ស៊ីវិល។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5106.377s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо, Клифф.
 Итак, поскольку в некоторых обсуждениях в команде есть некоторые моменты, которые могут немного прояснить историю, хочет ли кто-нибудь это сказать?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ផាត ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ឱ្យខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើម ខ្ញុំនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងលំដាប់បញ្ច្រាស និងគ្របដណ្តប់បន្ថែមទៀតនៃបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ដែល Cliff ទើបតែបានលើកឡើង តាមពិតនៅដើមពិធី។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចែករំលែករូបថតអេក្រង់របស់ខ្ញុំម្តងទៀត តែមួយដងទៀតប៉ុណ្ណោះ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំអាចបង្ហាញវាចេញ ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាយល់ព្រម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមតិទាំងអស់គឺអំពីប្រវែងនៃផ្លូវនេះ ប្រសិនបើវាចង់នៅម្ខាង ទិសមួយ ឬផ្លូវផ្សេងទៀត ឬយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ក្នុងទិសដៅនៃច្រកចូល ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាការសន្ទនា។
 យើងបានពិភាក្សាវា។
 ទីបំផុត​យើង​បាន​សម្រេច​ថា នេះ​ជា​ផ្នែក​ពីរ​ផ្លូវ។
 ហេតុផលគឺប្រសិនបើឡានមកយកអ្នកឧទាហរណ៍
 ការទម្លាក់នរណាម្នាក់ចេញ ឬរើសនរណាម្នាក់ឡើង នេះគឺដូចជាស្ថានភាពរើស និងទម្លាក់ចោល។
 អ្នកខ្លះកាន់កាបូបដើរទិញឥវ៉ាន់ ហើយទុកវានៅមុខទ្វារ។ ពេល​ភ្លៀង គេ​យក​កាបូប​រត់​ចេញ​តាម​ទ្វារ។
 អ្នក​ដែល​បើក​អ្នក​ចុះ​ពី​ផ្ទះ​អាច​បត់​ចូល​ទៅ​ណា​ក៏​បាន​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រោយ​អគារ រក​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត​របស់​គេ និង​ចូល​តាម​ទ្វារ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដើម្បី​ចូល ទោះ​បី​វា​នៅ​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​ក៏​ដោយ ហើយ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួកគេ​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន ពួកគេ​ប្រាកដ​ជា​មិន​ចេញ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើពួកគេចតនៅខាងក្រៅ វាមានឱកាសដែលនរណាម្នាក់នឹងត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដើរចុះក្រោម Fellsway ហើយបន្ទាប់មកត្រលប់មកវិញតាមច្រកចូលមួយទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងគិតថា នោះជាលក្ខណៈពិសេសមួយដ៏សំខាន់ ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើវាជាអ្នកមកទស្សនារយៈពេលខ្លី ហើយមាននរណាម្នាក់មកមើលអចលនទ្រព្យនោះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកដាក់ប្រាក់បញ្ញើទាំងបួននេះ ដោយសន្មត់ថាពួកគេត្រូវបានកាន់កាប់ទាំងអស់ បន្ទាប់មកបុគ្គលនេះត្រូវតែចាកចេញ ហើយទៅកាន់ Fellsway ដើម្បីចូលមកមើល។
 កន្លែងផ្សេងទៀតនៅកន្លែងណាមួយក្នុងតំបន់ យើងចាត់ទុកការធ្វើដំណើរទាំងនេះថាមិនសំខាន់ពីផ្លូវដែលនៅជាប់គ្នា ហើយរក្សាវានៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបានធ្វើវា មានការពិភាក្សា ហើយអ្នកនឹងមិនចាំខុស ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលយើងនិយាយម្តងទៀត វិស្វករចរាចរណ៍បានធ្វើការវិភាគខ្លះ ហើយប្រហែល 90% នៃអ្នកចូលរួមស្ថិតនៅក្នុងវិសាលភាពនៃការសិក្សា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងមកទិញសំបុត្រមួយទៀត។
 វាត្រូវបានគេជឿថាប្រហែល 10 ភាគរយនៃប្រជាជននឹងងាកទៅរកច្រកទ្វារ។
 នេះ​គឺ​ពិត​ជា​លើក​ទី​មួយ​។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងជឿថា វាមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់ក្នុងការថែរក្សាផ្លូវពីរផ្លូវនេះ នៅពេលដែលបរិមាណចរាចរណ៍មានកម្រិតទាបជាង និងផ្តល់ឱកាសដើម្បីមិនត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Fells Way វិញ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលយើងគិត។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5271.853s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: Спасибо</p>

 Я делаю заметки.
 Итак, он находится на северо-западном углу утеса в здании, извините, если здесь возникла какая-то путаница.
 Они
 Процесс проектирования во многих отношениях разделен на две части, поэтому мы уделяем особое внимание плоскости заземления. Я думаю, что это ваше мнение. Ремонтируем жилую часть здания так, чтобы здание было над уровнем земли.
 Поверхность здания такая, как показано на рисунке выше: здание лежит на спине.
 Я должен сказать, что эта песня вернулась.
 Это фаска.
 Так что это соответствует тому шоу, которое мы сделали.
 До этого на основе слухов о нашей предыдущей архитектуре и отзывов предыдущих друзей.
 Поэтому мы не вернулись и не разрушили здание.
 Просто вы смотрите на план этажа.
 Так что, надеюсь, мы сможем устранить хаос.
 Я продолжу паблик-арт в Объединенных Арабских Эмиратах.
 Примечание. Как я уже упоминал ранее, я думаю, что по этому вопросу есть еще один комментарий.
 Это то, что мы планируем обсудить на следующем совещании по экспертной оценке.
 Это то, что мы учли в нашем архитектурном обзоре, и мы рады получить предложенное место.
 Интересно, это паблик-арт?
 Ну, здание на воздушной трассе, или что-то в самом здании.
 Знаете, я думаю, что мы действительно открыты для этой идеи, мы хотим сделать его гостеприимным отелем, которым город сможет гордиться, и связанное с ним паблик-арт — это то, о чем мы очень открыто говорим.
 Наконец, что касается проблем с парковкой, вот несколько полезных комментариев.
 Думаю, сегодня вечером мы получили много отзывов.
 Как я уже упоминал, единственное, что я узнал, это то, что мы проделали больше домашней работы по этому вопросу.
 Я не могу ссылаться на конкретные нормативные положения, касающиеся парковки электромобилей, но наша команда сможет сослаться на них позже, когда мы встретимся.</p>

 ខ្ញុំតំណាងឱ្យ D'Agostino Family Trust នៅ 1022-1024 Fellsway ។
 អរគុណអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នា។
 តាមពិតទៅ ខ្ញុំ​មាន​មតិ​ច្រើន ហើយ​មាន​លេខ​និង​សំណួរ​ជាច្រើន​។
 ខ្ញុំព្យាយាមរៀបចំឱ្យបានច្រើនតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 សម្រាប់ការចាប់ផ្តើម, ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំអាចជៀសវាងការទាំងអស់នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងរឿងមួយ ឬពីរអំពីចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងចាប់ផ្តើមនៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមានចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 តាមពិតវានៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃ Fellsway ។
 ដូច្នេះឥឡូវនេះ ក្មេងៗជាមូលដ្ឋានត្រូវទៅកន្លែងដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នៅ ហើយដើររហូតដល់ពួកគេឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ Fells ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ជា​ផ្លូវ​ល្អ។
 តាមពិតទៅ ឆ្លងកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវពីឃ្លាំងនៅលើផ្លូវ Fells Way គឺជាកន្លែងដែលក្មេងៗកំពុងរង់ចាំ។
 មានចំណតឡានក្រុងមួយទៀតនៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃ Myrtle ។
 ដោយសារតែម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាឧស្សាហកម្មមែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ គេ​មិន​នាំ​កូន​មក​ទី​នេះ​ទេ។
 តាមអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់ វានៅកាច់ជ្រុងផ្លូវ Myrtle និង Spring ប្រសិនបើវាអាចជួយបាន។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបើកឡានទៅទីនោះ។
 មតិមួយចំនួន។
 ជាដំបូង សូមអរគុណដល់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល និងជាការពិតណាស់ ដេវីត គ្រុប។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាស្គាល់ Pat ។
 វាជាវគ្គដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំសូមកោតសរសើរចំពោះពេលវេលា។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងមួយដែលត្រូវចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងមតិយោបល់៖
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាការយល់ច្រលំបន្តិច អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថា ជាពិសេសនៅដើមដំបូងនៃគម្រោង យើងបាននិយាយអំពីអ្វីដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នឹងមានរូបរាង អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងបានព្យាយាមប្តូរទិសចរាចរណ៍ ហើយយប់នេះខ្ញុំបានលឺថា អាសយដ្ឋានអចលនទ្រព្យនឹងស្ថិតនៅក្នុង Myrtle។
 ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំជឿថាមនុស្សនឹងដើរកាត់ Myrtle នៅពេលនេះ ហើយពិតជាប្រើច្រកចូល Fellsway នៅពេលចាំបាច់ ដែលវាពិបាកបន្តិច។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្តងទៀត នេះគ្រាន់តែជាមតិយោបល់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បាន​ឮ​អ្វី​ដែល​ខុស​ពី​យប់​នេះ​។
 ផ្នែកផ្សេងទៀតគឺថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងដើម្បីពង្រីកផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ធំ​បំផុត​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ច្បាស់​នោះ​គឺ​ថា​បើ​យើង​មិន​រើ​បង្គោល​ទេ អ្នក​ដែល​រស់​នៅ​តាម​ផ្លូវ​នោះ​នឹង​កត់​សម្គាល់​ឃើញ
 អស្ចារ្យខ្លះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​ច្រើន​ជាង​អ្វី​ដែល​បាន​បង្ហាញ​ក្នុង​រូបភាព​នេះ ហើយ​នោះ​ជា​វិធី​ល្អ​បំផុត​ក្នុង​ការ​ដាក់​វា។
 ដូច្នេះ ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​គុណ​ថា បើ​សសរ​មិន​រើ​ចូល​គ្នា​ទេ ផ្លូវ​ក៏​មិន​ទូលាយ​ដែរ។
 ច្បាស់ណាស់ ចំនុចប្រសព្វរវាង Fellsway និង Bernal មិនអាចពង្រីកបានទេ ដូចដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សានៅក្នុងបញ្ហានេះ និងនៅលើអចលនទ្រព្យ Walsh ។
 មិនមានដំណោះស្រាយពិតប្រាកដទេ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ការសង្កេតមួយទៀតគឺថា ខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តចំនួនកន្លែងចតរថយន្តដែលក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis Group កំពុងស្នើសុំ។
 ផងដែរ សួនឆ្កែគឺជាកង្វល់ចម្បងពីររបស់ខ្ញុំ គឺសម្រាប់តែកំណត់ត្រាប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 មិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែមនៅក្នុងតំបន់នេះទេ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 អំឡុងពេលមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិល មនុស្សប្រកួតប្រជែងគ្នាដើម្បីលំហរ ដូចអ្វីដែលពួកគេបានធ្វើនៅភាគនិរតី ជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំរស់នៅផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​ដូច​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​ធ្វើ​បែប​នោះ​ទាល់​តែ​សោះ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 វាក៏មានលទ្ធភាពដែលសត្វឆ្កែ 289 ក្បាលត្រូវបាននាំយកមកក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ខណៈពេលដែលខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះទីធ្លាបៃតង ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាសំខាន់ជាងក្នុងការផ្តោតលើកន្លែងសម្រាប់សត្វឆ្កែជាជាងសួនកុមារ ឬប្រភេទសួនកម្សាន្តផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា វា​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​ការ​ពេញ​និយម។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាពេញចិត្តក្នុងការវេចខ្ចប់នៅពេលចាំបាច់។
 មិនមានការលេចធ្លាយទេហើយខ្ញុំត្រូវចាកចេញពីយានដ្ឋានជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃ។
 នេះ​ជា​មតិ និង​ចម្ងល់​របស់​ខ្ញុំ ដើម្បី​កុំ​ឲ្យ​ខាត​ពេល​យូរ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាបញ្ហារបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាខ្ញុំមិនដឹងច្រើនអំពីផ្លូវ Warren ។
 វាមិនបង្ហាញក្នុងរូបភាពទាំងនេះទេ។
 នេះគឺជាផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់។
 វាជាផ្លូវមួយផ្លូវនៅ Myrtle ត្រង់ចំនុចប្រសព្វ Amarans ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសំណួររបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ៖ តើមានអ្វីផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវពិចារណា?
 ផ្លូវបំបែកនេះមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ឥឡូវនេះវាមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ជាមួយ​នឹង Davis Group និង​សូម្បី​តែ​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល​គឺ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​តែ​ពិចារណា។
 ទាក់​ទង​នឹង​សន្តិសុខ សំណួរ​ទី​ពីរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​បញ្ជាក់​សម្រាប់​ផ្ទះ​ក្នុង​ក្រុង វា​មិន​ច្បាស់​ទេ។
 តើមានវគ្គខ្លះទេ?
 ដោយផ្ទាល់នៅលើ Myrtle ឬនៅសណ្ឋាគារ។
 សំណួរទីបីរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអំពីការចតរថយន្តសម្រាប់អគារទាំងអស់នៅខាងក្រៅយានដ្ឋាន ជាពិសេសកន្លែងផ្ទុកខាងក្រោយ។
 វាហាក់ដូចជាច្បាស់។
 តើឡានដឹកទំនិញអាចចូលបានទេ?
 តើ​ឡាន​ដឹក​ជញ្ជូន និង​ផ្លូវ​ជម្រាល​មិន​អី​ទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចដើរចុះពីលើជម្រាលភ្នំបានទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចទាញយកវាដោយសុវត្ថិភាពបានទេ?
 ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាបានរស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះនេះមួយរយៈ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរជារៀងរាល់ឆ្នាំបន្ទាប់ពីបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សានៅមហាវិទ្យាល័យ។
 ពេល​នោះ​ខ្ញុំ​ចាំ​ថា​ការ​អាច​ធ្វើ​ចលនា​បាន​គឺ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ប្រឈម។
 នៅក្នុងអគារមួយមានចំណតរថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​រថយន្ត​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​អាច​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​បាន​ទេ។
 កង្វល់ពិតរបស់ខ្ញុំចំពោះសំណួរគឺ៖ តើអ្នកបានពិចារណាកន្លែងទំនេរនៅក្នុងឡានដឹកទំនិញដែលមានផ្លូវជម្រាលទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ច្រើន​ណាស់។
 អរគុណច្រើន។
 សូមអរគុណម្តងទៀតសម្រាប់ពេលវេលារបស់អ្នក។</p>

 Да, есть некоторые проблемы.
 Встал вопрос по поводу переезда машин в Лоуренсе.
 Кандидаты хотят об этом поговорить?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5775.499s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Это верно.
 Хочешь пойти, Пэт?
 Грузовые автомобили и парковка.
 Грузовики расположены в задней части здания.
 Там есть место для нескольких грузовиков.
 Мы не ожидаем там большего количества грузовиков, потому что управление активами действительно продолжается.
 Мы будем управлять как внутренней, так и внешней деятельностью.
 Мы считаем, что здесь достаточно места, чтобы справиться с некоторыми из самых сложных условий путешествия.
 Мы расследуем этот вопрос и продолжим работать с нашей оперативной командой, чтобы разобраться в ситуации.
 В таунхаусах убедитесь, что все входы и выходы находятся под землей.
 На Миртл-стрит нет тротуаров или подъездных дорог.
 Доступ к этому месту осуществляется через внутренний вход сзади.
 Так что, я думаю, если вам нужны последние новости с Флоренс-стрит, я знаю, что он смотрит.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5841.227s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, да, действительно.
 Это своевременный вопрос, поэтому общий ответ – да.
 Я думаю, что мы работаем над этим прямо сейчас, и я не знаю, сделает ли Джефф из бета-версии какие-либо комментарии по окончании пробного периода, но мы получили много отзывов от бета-версии о трафике и рассматриваем это.
 Частично это очень много.
 Предлагаемые меры по смягчению последствий, которые нам следует рассмотреть, и некоторые моменты, которые нам следует учитывать.
 Без отчета, лежащего передо мной, я не знаю, какой была бы Лоуренс-роуд, но в целом я думаю, что местное движение и облегчение местности обычно считаются не просто платаном или амарантом.
 Я думаю, что Лоуренс, вероятно, был там.
 Мне следует проверить еще раз, но краткий ответ на ваш вопрос — да.
 Мы продолжим работать с нашей командой и группой экспертной оценки над разработкой вариантов сокращения трафика в этой области.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5904.591s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: Спасибо за ваш комментарий об автовокзале.

 ជាបឋម ខ្ញុំលើកយកបញ្ហាមួយចំនួនជាមួយក្រុមប្រឹក្សានេះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកបានពិភាក្សាជាមួយសង្គមស៊ីវិល។
 តើយើងបានជូនដំណឹងដល់អ្នករស់នៅ Amaranth Apartments អំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំទាំងនេះទេ?
 ព្រោះ​នៅ​គ្រប់​ទីកន្លែង​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ទៅ​គឺ​មិន​មាន​មតិ​សាធារណៈ​ក្នុង​ទិសដៅ​នេះ​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា ប្រសិនបើពួកគេនៅក្នុងប្រអប់សាកល្បង ពួកគេនឹងទទួលបានអ៊ីមែល សម្ភារៈផ្សព្វផ្សាយជាដើម ដើម្បីអាចស្តាប់សំឡេងរបស់ពួកគេ។
 បន្ទាប់មកទីពីរគឺ
 ថ្ងៃនេះ និងក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំមុនៗ យើងបានឮលោក Pat និយាយច្រើនអំពីក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងដែលនឹងគ្រប់គ្រងអចលនទ្រព្យ។
 សំណួរជាច្រើនត្រូវបានសួរ៖ អញ្ចឹងក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយ។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលនឹងពិចារណាចូលរួមកិច្ចប្រជុំមួយក្នុងចំណោមកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះបន្ទាប់ពី Davis សាងសង់អាគារនោះ
 អ្នកស្រុកមានអារម្មណ៍សុវត្ថិភាពអំពីអ្នកដែលជាម្ចាស់ និងគ្រប់គ្រងបទពិសោធន៍ប្រចាំថ្ងៃ របៀបដែលពួកគេមានគម្រោងគ្រប់គ្រងអ្វីៗដូចជាឡានដឹកទំនិញ របៀបដែលពួកគេគ្រប់គ្រងគំនូរណាមួយដែលអាចលេចឡើងនៅលើការងារសិល្បៈ ឬសួនកុមារ និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេនឹងសម្អាតវា។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ច្រានចោល​នេះ​ជា​ការ​ណែនាំ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​បញ្ចេញ​យោបល់​លើ​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​បាន​វិភាគ​ខាង​លើ។
 ចំពោះកន្លែងចតរថយន្ត ខ្ញុំបានលឺថាឥឡូវនេះមានចំណត 300 ហ្វីតនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកយល់ នៅពេលអ្នកនិយាយជាមួយយើង ហើយប្រាប់យើង ចូរនិយាយថា អ្នកបង្កើនវាដល់ 370 អ្នកមិនបង្កើនចំនួនចំណតនៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ទេ។
 រវាងផ្លូវ Amaranth និងផ្លូវ Myrtle,
 អ្នកមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែម។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តទៀតទេនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ក្នុងនាមជាអ្នករស់នៅ Myrtle Street ខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភយ៉ាងខ្លាំងអំពីពេលដែលការភ្ជួររាស់នឹងត្រូវបញ្ចប់ ហើយនៅពេលណាដែលនឹងមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិលធ្លាក់ ព្រោះឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំត្រូវចតនៅ Amaranth ។
 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅតែម្នាក់ឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចូលចិត្ត​គំនិត​មក​ផ្ទះ​យប់​ជ្រៅ ហើយ​ឃើញ​មនុស្ស​ចូល​ចត​នៅ Myrtle ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចត​នៅ​ជ្រុង​ម្ខាង។
 ញ៉ាំ amaranth ហើយដើរទៅផ្ទះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវានឹងកើតឡើង ដោយសារតែក្រុមហ៊ុនទាំងអស់នេះ និងខុនដូប្រណិតៗទាំងអស់នេះ ដែលគិតថ្លៃអ្នកស្នាក់នៅសម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្ត ពួកគេនឹងដឹងថា Amaranth និង Myrtle គឺមិនគិតថ្លៃទេ ហើយពួកគេនឹងជំនួសកន្លែងរបស់យើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឱ្យអ្នកដឹងថា គម្រោងកែលម្អ $130,000 ទៅ $170,000 ដែលអ្នកបានស្នើសម្រាប់ Myrtle Street គឺពិតជាក្លែងក្លាយ ហើយអ្នកដឹងថាវា។
 ទីបំផុត ខ្ញុំពិតជាគិតថាយើងកំពុងចាប់ផ្តើមទៅកាន់កន្លែងដែលសំឡេងរបស់មនុស្សត្រូវបានឮ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានការខកចិត្តនៅពេលឮថាយើងមិនបានបង្វែរចរាចរណ៍ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដូច Allison ទើបនឹងនិយាយ។
 Cliff ក៏​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ថា​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​ចុង​ក្រោយ​នេះ​យើង​បាន​និយាយ​ថា​អ្នក​ស្រុក​នឹង​មិន​អាច​ធ្វើ​បាន​
 ចូលយានដ្ឋានពីផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 វា​ជា​ពពុះ​ដែល​ហូរ​ចូល និង​ចេញ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បង្ហាញពីការខកចិត្តរបស់ខ្ញុំ ដោយសារតែខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានឮត្រូវបានដកចេញពីខ្ញុំក្នុងការហៅទូរស័ព្ទពិសេសនេះ។

 Итак об этой теме.
 Я думаю, что удобство использования — это то, чем мы будем заниматься в обновлениях экспертной оценки.
 Поэтому я не знаю, готов ли кандидат говорить об этом или нет.
 Я знаю, ты упомянул, почему.
 Так что мы также получим обратную связь в бета-версии.
 Поэтому я прошу прощения.
 Отек головного мозга.
 Потом пошел снег.
 Ну, снег мы еще не обсуждали.
 Итак, такие вещи, как уборка снега.
 Я знаю, что для жильцов есть крытая парковка.
 Но я думаю, что комитету было бы полезно узнать сейчас или на будущих слушаниях об их планах относительно снежного мероприятия.
 А потом он тоже выстрелил.
 Прости, Кристина, чего мне не хватает в третьем?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6235.053s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Если говорить о парковке, то идет снег, поэтому я думаю, что, как и во всех этих роскошных апартаментах, за парковку взимается плата.
 Я уверен, что размер покрытия будет больше и меньше.
 Но со временем местные жители обнаружат, что жасмин и жасмин бесплатны.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6255.102s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, это так.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6526.232s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: Я хочу узнать, что ранее говорил Эндрю о парковке электровелосипедов и электромобилей.
 Я имею в виду, что электромобили и электромобили вызывают те же проблемы, что и электрические велосипеды.
 Пока, как вы говорите, во многих городах, и я знаю, что это происходит не просто в Медфорде или районе, о котором мы говорим, а, знаете ли, обычный пожар.
 Пожарная часть и автомобиль не сжигают электромобиль.
 Обычно им приходится идти в Масспорт, чтобы получить его.
 Итак, я просто хочу подчеркнуть: мы также обсуждаем количество энергии, которое нам нужно.
 Я думаю, что другие вопросы, которые я хотел бы поднять Кристине и Элисон, — это проблемы с парковкой и доступом в гараж.
 Я знаю, что об этом упоминалось, но я просто хочу еще раз заявить, что если движение на Миртл-стрит увеличится, адресом будет Миртл-стрит.
 Даже если у вас есть зона доставки в Миртле, сколько там водителей Uber Eats, когда у вас много жителей?
 У вас будет много людей одновременно, а не один или два.
 Правильно, и вы можете увидеть квартиру, в которой я остановился с другими друзьями.
 Я имею в виду, именно это и происходит в этих подразделениях.
 Я не хочу, чтобы Миртл-роуд (потому что это точка посадки и высадки) была парковкой, пока люди ждут входа.
 Итак, теперь вы сошли с дороги.
 Вот что я думаю.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6631.389s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ок

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6641.51s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: О, я только что упомянул имя.
 На самом деле Павел сделал другое наблюдение.
 Я сказал, что когда мы говорим о выходе или входе на Миртл-роуд, на самом деле это запасной выход, а не главный выход.
 Если это всего лишь запрос пожарной части, вы можете отключить ее и направить движение на Феллсуэй.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6669.151s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Чтобы внести ясность: когда вы говорите «выключить», вы имеете в виду физическую цель или средство передвижения?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6674.116s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: К таким вещам они могут получить доступ, поэтому это не вход на территорию, вы заставляете движение двигаться по Fellsway.</p>

 那么，晚安。
 回到那个和婴儿组。
 开展交通影响评估研究。
 为了开始这个过程，我们进行了实地考察，观察交通状况，审查了 Van Essen Associates 影响研究、Polar Engineering 项目计划，并审查了所有交通方式，不仅包括交通，还包括行人、自行车和公共交通。
 我们与土建工程也有一些重叠，因此您可以在场地规划、内部循环、装载和交付以及运输需求管理计划中看到一些内容。
 总体而言，交通研究是按照我们现有的国家和行业专业标准进行的，是一份综合报告。
 因此，我将总结我们的评论。
 有些评论要求提供更多信息，要求澄清。
 我们更多地谈论外部缺陷以及可能的改进。
 感谢您的介绍。
 亲爱的玩家，我认为我们提出的一些意见在今天的演示中得到了回答。
 所以我谢谢你。
 也许这有点多余。
 我们讨论了一些主题，所以这或多或少是按照流量影响研究的顺序进行的。
 因此，在研究区域内，对整个区域的交叉口进行了综合评估。
 这有点难以阅读。
 我想说的是，第一个正在考虑纳入的十字路口是您注意到的唯一一个未包括在内的十字路口，即第四街。
 嗯，这里看起来围栏很围，所以标有人行横道。
 所以那将是唯一的地方。
 我想你可以考虑看看。
 因此，在现有条件下，采集1月11日的流量。
 小马丁·路德·金
 假期是15号。
 我只是想得到一些答案，以及周一假期是否会对周四的计数产生任何预期影响。
 然后收集并汇总流量。
 我们想了解更多有关该网站现有使用所产生的行程的信息。
 所以，这里只是有关该地区行人现有状况的一些信息。
 我们自己根据刚刚写下的观察结果做了一个清单。
 中环街和春街交叉口没有行人信号灯，该路口是正在研究的交叉路口。
 该地区的几个十字路口没有可检测的人行横道和警告牌，而这些必须符合 ADA 标准，其中包括 Myrtle、Amaranth 和 Lawrence 街道的十字路口。
 这些只是一些观察和笔记。
 安全方面，该地区有多个路口曾发生过安全事故。
 正如我刚才提到的，Central 和 Spring 有 13 次失败。
 最重要的是，事故发生率超过了马萨诸塞州交通部第 4 区的平均水平和州平均水平，达到了令人担忧的程度。
 Fellsway 和 Riverside 五年内发生了 31 起事故。
 MassDOT 将其认定为高事故群体，使其有资格接受 2019 年进行的高速公路安全审计，并被认定为存在安全问题。
 Fellsway Central 和 Medford Street 五年内发生了 23 起事故。
 我们只是想更多地了解该地区发生的行人和自行车事故类型。
 停车，我们询问在现有条件下，是否有关于今天该地点街道和停车场占用情况的信息，您知道，这些空间在相邻街道和该地点本身占用的百分比，了解这些信息会很有用。
 未来的情况，所以我先讲一下出行生成和出行分配归因。
 因此，预计该项目将在工作日上午和下午高峰时段产生约 90 趟车次。
 我们认为这是一个合理的数字。
 我们希望获得更多关于卡车出行次数的信息，包括这个数字。
 行人、自行车和公共交通出行。
 因此，如果能够对它们进行分解和识别，将会很有帮助。
 计算中使用了未来 5% 的自行车比例。
 我们认为它可能有点高。
 我认为全市 Medford 模式的总体比例为 1%。
 所以我想知道如果计算时假设从自行车模式分裂到较低模式，这会对车辆的出行产生多大影响？
 Fells Way 上的许多行程都会在中央大街掉头返回该地点。
 我想知道是否有其他交通可以使用的替代路线，因为认识到此行进中存在一些延误和拥堵，尤其是在下午，例如河滨大道，左转进入河滨，甚至使用 I-93 作为替代路线。
 其中一些交通是否会使用 I-93 而不是 Fells Way？
 嗯，报告中有一个表格确定了该项目的流量增加情况，但事实并非如此。
 识别现场附近的道路，例如 Fellsway、Myrtle、Pinker、Lawrence 和 Spring。
 因此，我想量化有关该地点附近道路交通量增加的信息。
 一个已经被谈论了一点的停车项目，停车比例为1.14。
 我们只是想确保这个数字是正确且足够的，可以满足该地点的预期停车需求。
 你知道，请记住，我们希望确保我们做的每件事都是正确的。
 因此，如果有足够的停车位，就不会溢出到邻近的社区和道路。
 我们看到前面有 4 个访客空间，即送货区。
 我们认为它可能有点低。
 嗯，我们还想更多地了解游客空间本身。
 不仅是短期送货，而且如果人们拜访该综合体的居民，他们会在哪里停车，如果他们这样做几个小时？
 如果他们停车很长时间或停车过夜。
 所以一些关于这是如何运作的讨论。
 访客空间将由网站运营和管理。
 关于拟议的停车位，新的Amaranth停车位，只是这些停车位的意图，我知道它们是向公众开放的，但它们应该供现场访客使用吗？
 这些空间的用途是什么？
 进行了交叉口通行能力分析。
 交通工程师使用所谓的交叉口服务级别。
 它类似于成绩单，其中 A，表示条件极佳，几乎没有延误或拥堵。
 E和F不足。
 F 是最差的，或者因巨大的延迟、拥塞和排队而失败。
 所以，你知道，我们在那里看到了 Fellsway 上的拥堵情况，大部分是早上向南行，下午向北行。
 Fellsway、Central 以及 Fellsway 和 Riverside 交叉口目前以 F 服务级别运行，这意味着它们有一个或多个交通通常无法达到 F 服务级别。
 而项目未来的非施工条件和施工条件又使这些条件更加恶化。
 该项目将导致中环 Fellsway 的交通显着增加，而中央大道东行通道的延误将会增加。
 其中一些问题已经得到解决。
 就在今天晚上，我看到了这里右上角的空间。
 我想我们在仓库的 A 区。
 感谢您提供这个。
 此外，还可以进入建筑物和会场周围的空间，今晚也展示了这一点，所以这很棒。
 这里显示了与未来自行车道的联系。
 我想这一切都已经解决了。
 只是对街道空间、默特尔街和阿默斯特的新空间进行澄清。
 我知道它们向公众开放，但谁对这些空间拥有管辖权？
 它们真的是城市还是属于私人管辖？
 因此，对这些空间进行更多澄清。
 就其本身而言，我们谈论的是场地规划中更广阔的空间，即流通道路的宽度。
 抱歉，必须提供路边停车位。
 讨论居民和游客的自行车停放只是为了明确车位数量。
 现场必须标明储雪区域。
 我知道有人在谈论默特尔街，但我还需要知道那里的雪将储存在哪里。
 这就是制定运输需求管理计划的原因。
 这些计划的目标是减少汽车出行次数，尤其是单人车辆。
 我们还确定了该计划需要考虑的其他一些领域或措施。
 您可能早些时候已经谈到过这一点。
 停车费与停车费是分开的吗？
 今晚我没有听到，但也许会有更多的讨论。
 我知道对于网站来说最好的选择是需要权衡的。
 您可以考虑向居民提供交通补贴或蓝色自行车订阅，作为一项 TDM 措施。
 你展示了蓝色的自行车站，所以照顾好它真是太好了。
 并且您应该考虑现场是否有汽车共享空间，例如汽车共享拉链车。
 那么项目提出的外部改进，我们稍微谈了一下公交候车区。
 MBTA 巴士站附近的现有停车位将进行重新配置和景观美化，如今晚向我们展示的那样，以及新的停车位、扩大 Amaranth 街和 Myrtle 街的通行权，或者更好的是街道和人行道停车位。
 因此，我们确定了一些其他的措施，只是为了考虑和改进。
 这些大多是外部地点。
 其中许多位于我提到的十字路口，存在操作或安全缺陷。
 第一个是Fellsway Riverside Avenue。
 因此，我提到，已识别出在服务级别 F 上运行的高崩溃集群的交叉点。此次交通安全审计确定了对策和安全对策的改进，包括交通信号优化、增强左转阶段和通行时间。
 所以这些事情是可以考虑的。
 Avenida Central 和 Rua Primavera 的事故发生率很高。
 可以考虑升级旧的信号设备并安装现有的行人标志。
 Fellsway、Central 和 Medford Street 在两个高峰时段再次在 F 级服务条件下运行，可以看到并提供信号定时优化。
 北行左转车道多次被堵塞，特别是在晚高峰期间，因此车辆在车道畅通之前无法进入该车道。
 是否有可能拓宽 Fells Way 北行左转车道？
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle Street 相连，因此 Fellsway 有一条长长的人行横道。
 我们知道，交通流量大，车速高，可以考虑使用矩形快闪灯，这是对行人的安全措施，也能提高驾驶员的安全意识。
 我们只是想评估提供中间间隔是否可行，无论是在红绿灯处还是向北左转处。
 我知道这样做有利有弊，但这样做是否有足够的好处来考虑这种改变？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7754.877s">[Unidentified]</a>: Амхерст и Лоуренс Миртл</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7762.287s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Проект расположен на правой стороне дороги и имеет очень странную конфигурацию.
 Расположение полос сбивает с толку водителей и пешеходов.
 Я знаю, что этот проект предполагает расширение и создание транзитного маршрута.
 Я считаю, что этот кроссовер заслуживает большего внимания.
 Я знаю, что они говорили и о Лоуренсе.
 Другие расширения тротуара могут располагаться в юго-западном углу или даже увеличивать перекресток.
 Я думаю, что это важный путь для проекта и сообщества.
 Это возможность облегчить движение
 Снизьте скорость транспортного средства и улучшите пешеходный поток и местную безопасность.
 Еще несколько комментариев.
 Существующая автобусная остановка на улице Саут-Феллс-Уэй находится по соседству и находится в хорошем состоянии.
 Это древнее убежище.
 Я считаю, что следует подумать о модернизации этого автовокзала.
 Да, необходимо разработать план дорожных знаков.
 Ход реализации проекта будет четко показывать, куда жильцы, посетители и транспортный персонал будут входить и возвращаться в это место.
 Тротуар в Амхерсте, к югу от Миртл-стрит, находится в плохом состоянии.
 Поэтому ремонт этой дороги следует рассматривать как часть проекта.
 Конечно, необходимо создать план управления дорожным движением для проекта, чтобы показать влияние на сообщество.
 И последнее замечание: из-за естественных изменений проекта для включения DCR требуется разрешение на строительство.
 Для входа и выхода из Fellsway требуется разрешение DCR.
 Ниже приводится краткое изложение нашего обзора.
 Их гораздо больше, некоторые небольшие, но подробные.
 В нашем обзорном письме к вам.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8082.747s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Я как будто только что думал о Джеффе.
 Сегодня вечером мы услышали некоторые комментарии по поводу адреса на Миртл-авеню.
 Ну, мне интересно, есть ли у вас какие-то конкретные инструкции, и я знаю, что вы говорите о советах, например, какой знак может быть у входа в Феллсуэй, понимаете?
 Убедитесь, что это важный аспект проекта.
 Интересно, что ты думаешь об этом</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8116.863s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Это верно.
 Поэтому мы рассмотрим создание проекта указателей, которые будут направлять жителей и гостей, а также транспортировку к месту проведения мероприятия и обратно.
 Конечно, местные жители будут знать, как туда войти и выйти.
 Знаете, мы познакомим посетителей со многими местами в парке, так что это может быть комбинация разных типов знаков, это может быть памятник, это могут быть другие знаки, но вы знаете, это будет показывать большую часть пути.
 Укажите места и места парковок исходя из конкретных условий.
 Кто вы и куда хотите отправиться, будет руководить этими поездками на свежем воздухе.
 Я думаю, что Феллс-стрит будет главным входом, но этот адрес мне кажется подходящим местом.
 Если кто-то введет адрес в Waze и не знает этого сайта, он перенесется на Миртл-стрит, а это, вероятно, не то место, куда мы хотим.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8194.189s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Я увидел комментарий Криса в чате, поэтому опубликую его.
 Кто-нибудь знает, какой процент входящего и исходящего трафика будет использовать боковой гараж Амаранта?
 Я согласен с консультантом, что доступ к дорогам является проблемой.
 Поэтому я думаю, что вижу определенную часть плана управления спросом на перевозки.
 Я знаю, что у нас есть Скотт.
 Я не знаю, отражают ли они последнее обновление, это другая часть отеля, но там две полосы движения.
 Но да, возможно, ты сможешь поговорить об этом, Скотт.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8236.272s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Да, конечно.
 Спасибо, господин Президент.
 Скотт Торнтон и его партнерша Ванесса.
 Таким образом, по нашим оценкам, около 30, 30–40 процентов трафика будет использовать въезд на Амарант-авеню, и идея, лежащая в основе этого, основана только на расстоянии парковки от этого места.
 Кроме того, может быть некоторый желаемый трафик
 Например, на западе вы можете посетить место, ведущее к шоссе 93.
 Некоторые из этих областей предлагают доступ к местам, которые могут быть проще в зависимости от времени суток.
 До него можно легко и быстро добраться через Амарант, а затем вернуться на Спринг-стрит через Миртл-стрит или Лоуренс-стрит.
 Однако первоначальная оценка составляет от 30 до 40%.
 Я думаю, что это по-прежнему применимо к последнему плану, представленному здесь сегодня вечером.
 Мы не ожидаем каких-либо существенных изменений в этом распределении.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8322.547s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ок
 Спасибо
 Крис. Есть ли у тебя какие-либо вопросы или опасения?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8333.162s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Могу я продолжить то, что сказал Крис?
 Итак, вы знаете, просто глядя на движение на дороге, я имею в виду, что понимаю, что определенный процент движения, вероятно, покинет Амаранс и пойдет на запад, но приблизиться с запада кажется невозможным.
 Похоже, что почти весь трафик уйдет из Феллсуэя.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8361.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: Да, я имею в виду, вы знаете, распределение действительно основано на том, где, по нашему мнению, находятся люди или где данные переписи населения показывают, что люди работают и живут в этом районе.
 Здесь мы предлагаем комбинацию существующих туристических моделей.
 Я согласен иногда
 Если люди с запада или юга, эффективнее использовать Fellsway.
 Но это не так в любое время суток.
 Это проблема, которую призван решить данный дистрибутив.
 К сожалению, это соответствует ожидаемой нами атрибутной модели, которая представляет собой распределение трафика по всему соответствующему периоду.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8422.885s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Андрей, оно у тебя есть?
 Пожалуйста, следуйте этому.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8437.957s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Не совсем.
 Я имею в виду
 Опять ближе к такому проекту.
 Я имею в виду, что кажется, что единственный способ добраться до входа в Амарант — это пройти по Лоуренсу, пересечь Амарант-плейс и многоквартирный дом, а затем попасть в проект Амарант, который для непосвященных кажется круглым и почти невозможным.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8475.658s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Есть ли у совета еще вопросы?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8485.526s">[Unidentified]</a>: Джейме.
 Что касается работы на перекрестках, я думаю, мой вопрос связан с предложением, сделанным в бета-версии, по улучшению светофоров и пешеходных переходов.
 Куда это идет?
 Это что-то, что можно взять с собой в город?
 Это то, с чем мы работаем с кандидатами с точки зрения объема?
 Я полностью согласен, что все эти перекрестки нуждаются в благоустройстве.
 Я просто не знаю, как это настроить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8526.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Насколько я понимаю, это немного зависит от перекрестка.
 Так что я думаю
 Заявитель может заявить о своем намерении внести некоторые или все улучшения в свой ответ.
 В некоторых случаях требуется только разрешение города.
 В других случаях оно может исходить из несколько более сложного состояния.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8553.604s">[Unidentified]</a>: Да, я работаю в Spring Street Center Crossing, и это постоянная проблема.
 Что касается пешеходов, в Haynes Plaza есть синяя велосипедная станция для жителей.
 Если на месте есть синяя велостанция, оттуда обязательно можно выбраться.
 Но если есть пешеходы, если пешеходов много, то этот перекресток однозначно актуален.
 Знаете, они называют это отсутствием транзита и тому подобное.
 Что ж, это именно то, чего я не ожидал, но это исследование ясно показывает.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8595.186s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо, Джейме.
 Джефф, у тебя есть какие-нибудь комментарии по этому поводу?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, в зависимости от того, как город хочет расставить приоритеты в отношении дорог в пределах своей юрисдикции.
 Так что это немного другое.
 С перекрёстком, который полностью контролируется городом, легко справиться.
 Так вы знаете, середина и весна, но сами понимаете.
 Задержки в работе и перегруженность также влияют на безопасность.
 Но я думаю, что городам следует расставлять приоритеты на основе улучшений, которые, по их мнению, являются разумными и связанными с проектами.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8662.117s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, я следующий.
 Поэтому мне действительно интересно, имеет ли смысл такое двустороннее движение на въезде на Миртл-стрит.
 Поэтому я слышу обеспокоенность людей.
 Текущая конфигурация имеет больший ход, поскольку считается, что она очень осторожна, чтобы избежать этой проблемы.
 Я понимаю, что его нужно открыть, чтобы воспользоваться запасным выходом.
 Но предоставленная информация не говорит мне точно, насколько это повлияет на сообщество.
 Да, есть доставка.
 Если он закрыт в одну сторону, возможно, вам придется вернуться в Миртл в одну сторону.
 Поэтому я думаю, что это разумно, я действительно понимаю соображения проектирования, но, похоже, здесь есть риск, что для двустороннего движения это похоже на открытие барьера, что является шагом назад.
 Попробуйте уменьшить пробки на дорогах с помощью Myrtle Street View.
 Я хочу услышать твое мнение по этому поводу, Джефф.
 Интересно, есть ли у вас время, чтобы полностью ознакомиться с ним и поделиться своими мыслями и идеями по этому поводу, или вам нужно больше об этом подумать, но вы хотите узнать больше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8778.533s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Вам вообще не нужно думать, если цель состоит в том, чтобы ограничить количество поездок по Миртл-Роуд, вы знаете, идете ли вы в одну сторону или знаете, идете ли вы в ту или иную сторону.
 Так что вам придется подумать о том, какими будут эти поездки и куда они пройдут, вы знаете, окажутся ли они в Миртле или вы знаете, отправятся ли они в Феллсуэй.
 Так что я думаю, что это хороший вопрос.
 Знаете, возможно, нам нужно переоценить комбинацию Скотта и Варнесса и подумать о том и о сем.
 Вы знаете, какими могли бы быть последствия, если бы это было одностороннее движение, а не два.
 Опять же, это хорошая тема.
 Я думаю, нам нужно больше обсуждать и оценивать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8834.447s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8841.325s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Это верно.
 Джефф, но мне жаль, если я не помню, что с тобой случилось.
 Знаешь, там.
 Я имею в виду, что на перекрестке Феллсуэй и Миртл нет ни светофора, ни устройств безопасности пешеходов, кроме пешеходного перехода и небольшой проезжей части.
 Знаете, это определенно так выглядит.
 Да, в этом углу у нас будет больше жителей.
 Ну и самое главное, что на этом перекрестке что-то есть.
 Снизьте скорость для пешеходов или хотя бы подайте сигнал пешеходам.
 Итак, вы знаете, вы подумали об этом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, на одном из слайдов я говорил о прямоугольном переднем свете.
 Это кнопочный знак для пешеходов.
 Поэтому я считаю, что перекрёсток нужно благоустроить, тем более, что автобусные остановки есть с обеих сторон.
 Когда я был там, я видел, как люди выходили из машин и переходили улицу.
 Так что я предполагаю, что это прямоугольная фара с уровнем светового элемента.
 Более того, это будет полноценный светофор, как на четвёртой полосе.
 Но я считаю, что безопасность этого ковра необходимо улучшить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8959.722s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Спасибо
 Извините, если я пропустил.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8962.498s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, меня тоже беспокоит безопасность пешеходов на перекрестках.
 Хорошо, что автобусные остановки с обеих сторон.
 Так что, если бы местные жители путешествовали на автобусе, их, скорее всего, отвезли бы на другую сторону Феллс-Уэй.
 И еще: я знаю, что некоторые факторы вообще очень сложно изменить, это действительно так.
 Чтобы подготовиться к сегодняшней поездке, местные жители проедут по Феллс-Уэй, пересекут проект и развернутся.
 Будет просто
 Возможно, я ошибаюсь, но все признаки указывают на то, что это возможная проблема.
 Я хочу знать, что там делать.
 Я знаю, что тебе нужно разрешение ECR, но это не обо мне.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9038.718s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Есть ли у Правления какие-либо вопросы или комментарии?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9048.76s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: Я просто согласен с тем, что ты сказал, Майк.
 Я имею в виду, я понимаю беспокойство Баттерса по поводу увеличения трафика на Миртл-роуд, но я думаю, что это так.
 Людям вращаться опаснее.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9067.528s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: На самом деле, я думаю, что эти две дороги разделены, потому что, насколько я понимаю, если вы пойдете на север, я думаю, что самый популярный маршрут — если вы угадаете, куда люди ходят на работу, то это, вероятно, где-то в центре города, и я думаю, что вы всегда возвращаетесь.
 Или вам придется идти по улице.
 Так что я думаю, что Миртл закончилась.
 Это может быть более действенным средством, чем покинуть собственность.
 Но я думаю, что для многих людей, если они пойдут на север, возвращение назад будет лучшим вариантом, даже если это будет обе стороны.
 Роберт Паркхерст (ПБ) – Ан Ан Ан: Ну, я не вижу других членов совета, желающих говорить об этом.

 Я думаю, ради безопасности нам следует вновь открыть общественное мнение.
 Я знаю, что у нас и раньше были публичные комментарии по поводу дорожного движения, но мы обсуждали и новые вещи.

 Но да, я хочу убедиться, что этого не произойдет.

 Я не говорил этого раньше, потому что никогда не думал, что мы будем смотреть на пересечение знаков остановки и реальные условия движения в этом районе, включая разворот в Сентрал, Лоуренс,
 В нашем районе много дорог.
 Поднимать и опускать их можно только определенными способами.
 Эллисон, давний житель, проехавший тысячи миль по этим улицам, проходя мимо твоего дома, я начал махать тебе рукой.
 Люди не останавливаются у знака «стоп».
 Когда я стою на этих треугольных полосах, когда сажусь в автобус, люди не останавливаются на этих треугольных полосах.
 Когда вы доберетесь до вокзала, люди не останавливаются на Феллс-роуд, чтобы вы могли перейти дорогу.
 Рядом есть знак остановки или немного грустно, на уличных фонарях нет пешеходных знаков.
 Вы можете избежать удара, если только никто не повернет направо на красный свет.
 Мне нравится обсуждать безопасность пешеходов, потому что эти дороги очень трудны для пешеходов.
 Не говоря уже о том, что улицы не очень чистые, но это центр Бедфорда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9537.494s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Спасибо

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9576.152s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Микро?
 Да, окей.
 Общественное мнение по этому вопросу закрыто.
 Что ж, на этом запланированный на сегодня запуск завершен.
 Вот почему я хочу воспользоваться моментом, чтобы выразить свои ожидания от нашей следующей встречи.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9601.232s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Так что посмотрим, смогу ли я вернуть его.
 Все хорошо.
 Извините за минуту.
 Мне следует включить его сейчас.
 Хорошо, давайте начнем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9645.58s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Итак, что касается первоначальных сроков, мы сначала обсуждаем архитектуру и экспертную оценку.
 Мы обсудили гражданские вопросы, но предварительного понимания по этому вопросу пока нет.
 Теперь обсуждаем трафик и чеки от основных друзей.
 Прокомментируйте это.
 Мы много раз сталкивались с архитектурными проектами.
 Таким образом, нам все еще нужны методы экспертной оценки.
 Нам нужна самая свежая информация для отражения строительных и инженерных проектов.
 Тогда запрос должен произойти
 Запрос на освобождение и предлагаемые условия.
 Итак, у нас есть много времени, чтобы сделать, но не так много времени.
 Поэтому следующая наша встреча запланирована на 22 апреля.
 Насколько я знаю, до этого мы получим обратную связь от гражданских экспертов.
 Вроде до встречи, но не ясно, сколько времени осталось до встречи.
 У кандидатов будет время проверить, но они могут быть не готовы дать полный ответ.
 Так что это в первую очередь ответ кандидата на транспортную проверку, гражданскую проверку и, может быть, просто общую информацию о проекте.
 Итак, я хочу поговорить с г-ном Нуоном.
 Соответствует ли это вашему плану и пониманию?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9760.153s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Я думаю, когда мы думаем о будущей аудитории, мы пытаемся ее организовать.
 Чтобы обновить схему, я только что получил комментарии ниже.
 Хм
 И запланируйте обзорную встречу с Бомбером на следующей неделе.
 Я лично не знаю, выйдет ли сегодня днём бета-версия в разделе доставки.
 Поэтому я думаю, что эти мнения имеют смысл.
 Теперь это у всех свежо в памяти, нам нужно уделить немного больше внимания слушаниям 20-го числа, я думаю, 23-го, господин Президент просто хочет подтвердить.
 Сейчас 2 часа ночи, вторник.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9810.864s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: вторник
 Да, сегодня 23-й вторник.
 Так что я ошибался.
 Так что да.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9818.083s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Ох... так что я думаю, что на этом слушании мы попытаемся найти некоторые ответы на проблемы с дорожным движением. Я не хочу говорить за Скотта. Я знаю, что он над этим работает, и, честно говоря, у нас нет возможности связаться… там, где он работает. Я думаю, что мы получили эти комментарии в прошлую пятницу днем, э-э… так что прошло несколько дней, и с момента процесса, проверьте, могу ли я дать предложения, э…
 Если Правление согласится, мы продолжим работу над некоторыми повестками дня.
 Я думаю, что идея состоит в том, чтобы каким-то образом реагировать на трафик и каким-то образом реагировать на конструктивную обратную связь.
 Без комментариев мирных жителей сложно сказать, будем ли мы готовы 23-го числа.
 Поэтому я думаю, что наша цель — сочетание транспорта и архитектуры.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9870.349s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, мне это кажется разумным.
 Да, мы будем признательны, если вы примете меры и подтвердите сроки.
 Главное, с чем, я надеюсь, мы согласны, это то, что нам действительно нужны все ответы и вся самая свежая информация о плане, чтобы получить какие-либо результаты от встречи 9 мая.
 Оставить его закрытым 21 мая вполне возможно.
 Итак, вы знаете, если при обсуждении планирования и обращения к нам кажется, что мы находимся в ситуации, когда мы не можем предоставить все по запросу.
 Я открыто жду короткого продления после 21 мая, если хотите, но сейчас я просто хочу сказать вам, что для встречи 21 мая нам нужно
 Все настроено, и речь идет только об изъятиях и запросах 9 мая.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9955.037s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Да, я понимаю.
 Я считаю, что, поскольку две из трех секций подлежат экспертной оценке, если мы сможем стать цивилизованными как можно скорее, наши сотрудники будут усердно работать, чтобы гарантировать, что мы получим ответы и сможем предоставить обратную связь на будущих слушаниях, чтобы ответить на комментарии и вопросы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9973.271s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Идеальный.
 Идеальный.
 Выглядит хорошо.
 Спасибо
 Это был весь мой транспорт.
 Так что, по крайней мере, мы можем перейти к некоторой исполнительной повестке дня.
 На самом деле, прежде чем сделать это, мы должны двигаться дальше.
 Поэтому президент ждет петиции, чтобы продолжить решение этого вопроса до 18:30 вторника, 23 апреля.
 Есть ли у меня второй?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10012.029s">[Unidentified]</a>: Понедельник.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10013.09s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Хорошо, позвоним
 Джейми?
 Это верно.
 Джим?
 Это верно.
 Эверетт?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10021.333s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Удачи.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10022.487s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Эндрю?
 Это верно.
 Микро?
 Да, окей.
 Что ж, тема продолжается.
 Спасибо, мой друг.
 Спасибо за обновления и отзывы.
 Все хорошо.
 Деннис, можешь перейти к следующему пункту повестки дня?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10041.06s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Конечно.
 Извините
 Когда я перезагрузил компьютер, мне нужно было сделать много вещей, которые не работали, и я заметил, что все, что раньше, не работало.
 Но у нас есть административные новости, так что, я думаю, потому что все здесь, мы просто хотим обсудить другое время встречи?
 Письмо, которое вы отправили ранее?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10068.429s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, конечно.
 Потом я получил несколько ответов.
 Так что это не имеет ничего общего с реальностью, иначе вы услышите
 Совет назначит еще одно внеочередное заседание.
 Затем, 3 апреля, в совет поступило заявление и запрос на проведение слушания по делу Mystic Street.
 40Б, HAC снова в совете.
 Вот почему нам нужна новая аудитория каждые 30 дней.
 Иногда нам это нужно из-за необходимости уведомления.
 Обычно неделя с 29 апреля.
 Поэтому я сверил даты с советом обоих кандидатов: 30 апреля и 2 мая.
 Это будет короткая встреча, и мы не будем заслушивать показания.
 Пройдемся по некоторым процедурным шагам и двинемся дальше.
 Мы можем попросить кандидатов представиться.
 Но я получил ответ и вроде бы между 4 и 30 числом.
 Итак, с 4 по 30 число будет датой проведения этой специальной встречи.
 Единственным вопросом на повестке дня будет дело.
 Как я уже сказал, это будет процедурное заседание.
 Поэтому городскому совету следует рассмотреть возможность предоставления городу возможности нанять равного консультанта.
 Я имею в виду, что разговор о 40B консультантах и ​​выбор даты решения этого вопроса даст время нанять этих консультантов.
 Так что да.
 По моим оценкам, мы сможем сделать это за 30 минут или меньше.
 Ничего не обещано, но дата — вторник, 30 апреля, 18:30.
 Звучит здорово, Деннис?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10229.028s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Завтра я опубликую объявление в газете.
 Отличная история.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10233.509s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Спасибо
 Все хорошо.
 Еще одно обновление администратора?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10245.316s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Я думаю, у меня ничего не осталось.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10252.28s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Так что же будет на следующей повестке дня?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10262.405s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: Просто прошли те минуты, которые, кажется, я отправил.
 Это верно.
 Содержимое папки черновиков на Google Диске.
 Потому что они у меня есть.
 Именно такой подход я решил применить на этот раз.
 В текущем протоколе указаны протоколы заседаний от 11.01.24 и 15.02.24.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10284.275s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: Да, это соответствует моему пониманию.
 Так что у меня была возможность их проверить.
 Была ли у кого-нибудь возможность ознакомиться с протоколом заседания 40Б от 11 января и 15 февраля?
 Я нашел протоколы в порядке.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10307.441s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: Я не хочу быть единственным, кто встает со стула и идет дальше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10319.967s">[Unidentified]</a>: Просить утвердить протокол заседания от 14 января, протокол заседания от 20 января отклонить.
 Мне очень жаль.
 11 января и 15 февраля.
 Просьба утвердить протоколы заседаний от 11 января и 15 февраля.
 Есть ли у меня второй?
