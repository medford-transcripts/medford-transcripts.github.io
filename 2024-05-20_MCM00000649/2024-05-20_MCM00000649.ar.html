    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=455.983s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  Great.
 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2419.579s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: إذن هذه هي الشريحة الأخيرة لدينا.
 نعم، تريد الدراجات الزرقاء فقط أن تخبرك لماذا نختار غالبًا الدراجات الزرقاء التي نريد وضعها في ملكية خاصة، ولكن في مكان مرئي للغاية بجوار الرصيف العام حتى يعرف الناس أنها هناك.
 ولهذا السبب اخترنا هذا الموقع، ولكن من الواضح أن هناك بعض المرونة عندما تنظر إليه من هذه الزاوية.
 العجلة الزرقاء تفكر بشكل مختلف.
 سوف نجد منزلاً جديداً، لكن هذا منطقي.
 في محطة الحافلات.
 يمكن للأشخاص ركوب الدراجة الزرقاء إلى الحافلة المتوقفة والصعود إليها، أو يمكنهم ركوب الحافلة والنزول من الدراجة الزرقاء...
 أقرب إلى المنزل.
 لذلك هذا مكان جيد.
 نعتقد أن هذه إضافة جيدة للمشروع.
 وبهذا ينتهي عرضنا.
 بات، لا أعرف إذا كانت لديك ملاحظة أخيرة أو إذا كنت تريد الانتهاء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2470.844s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، آل، هذا يبدو سيئًا جدًا بالنسبة لي. يبدو أن BT ليس مناسبًا لي أيضًا. تحدثت أولاً مع بعض الفرق الزرقاء للتعرف عليهم.
 ملاحظاتك حول جدوى التنسيب.
 بشكل عام، اتفقوا على أنه موقع جيد، ليس فقط لحجمه، ولكن أيضًا لقربه من المحطات الأخرى التي اعتبروها مناسبة.
 لذلك نقترح ونرغب بالتأكيد في إضافة التنسيق مع المدينة وشركة Bluebikes لإضافة محطات هناك.
 ولكن في نهاية العرض العام
 أعلم أننا سنكون مرنين بعض الشيء، لذلك أعتقد أننا سنقدم لك بعض النصائح في النهاية.
 فيما يلي وصف موجز لبعض أعمال البناء التي نقوم بها كجزء من مشروع الهندسة المدنية لدينا، لا أكثر.
 ببساطة، التصميم، والمناظر الطبيعية، والمرافق، ومواقف السيارات، وكل شيء آخر تراه يعمل معًا.
 فقط للتأكيد للجميع، هذه ليست مجموعة عشوائية.
 نحن نعمل على الإجابة على الأسئلة وتقديم المزيد من التفاصيل حول ما يطلب بولر من المدينة القيام به في الدعوى المدنية وما يفكر فيه الزملاء.
 أكملت النسخة التجريبية.
 لذلك، كما ذكر ستيف سابقًا، هذه بعض الأشياء التي نريد النظر إليها ومعالجتها أو التوسع فيها.
 لا نريد أن يواجه أي شخص مشاكل في العرض لأننا نريد دائمًا التأكد من قدرتنا على الإجابة على هذه الأسئلة، ولكن لدينا أيضًا القدرة
 وينطبق الشيء نفسه على مراجعات النظراء والتعليقات اللاحقة.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أنهي كلامي.
 لذا نأمل ألا نكون مشغولين للغاية بالنسبة للجميع، ولكننا نريد فقط التأكد من أننا نغطي جميع المواضيع التي نعتقد أنها ضرورية.
 لذا سأغلقه وأفتحه للأسئلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2612.827s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنه سيكون لدينا نسخة تجريبية قريبا.
 أعلم أن تعليقات الأصدقاء ليست جاهزة بعد، ولكن أريد فقط أن أحصل على فكرة عامة عن الوقت الذي يمكننا أن نتوقعه وبعد ذلك سنتلقى الأسئلة من مجلس الإدارة.
 أرى أن لديك جيف في فريق الاختبار.
 يرجى الاستمرار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2639.459s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: مرحباً برئيس المجلس.
 لذلك اسمحوا لي أن أخبركم بما سأتناوله على العشاء اليوم.
 لذلك لدي هذا.
 العرض التقديمي باستخدام برنامج PowerPoint، تمكنت من تلخيص التعليقات حول حركة المرور التي نتلقاها في البريد.
 ثم أستطيع أن أظهر لك.
 لدي بعض الاقتراحات من بيل ماكغراث، مهندسنا المدني.
 أنا أبحث عن هذا المشروع، فهو في إجازة هذا الأسبوع ولكن لدي قائمة بريد إلكتروني له.
 لقد وقعت على العرض التقديمي.
 يمكنني قراءة القائمة إذا أردت، ولكن إذا كانت لديك أسئلة تفصيلية، فلن أتمكن من الإجابة عليها.
 هذه هي تجربتي، ولكن إذا أردت يمكنني قراءة تعليقاتك الأولية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2690.178s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنًا، يبدو أن بيل لا يزال يعمل في قسم التعليقات، أليس كذلك؟ أو هل لديك قائمة بالتعليقات التي لم تعلق عليها بعد؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2700.087s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: أوه، لا أريد أن أتحدث نيابة عنه.
 أعني أن هذه قائمة تقريبية.
 قد لا يكون هذا مؤكدًا بعد، ولكننا نعمل على ذلك.
 أستطيع أن أقول أنه ربما في الأسبوع المقبل، عندما أعود من الإجازة، سأتمكن من تغليفها برسائل تعريفية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2716.223s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، تبدو جيدة.
 ولذلك، نعتزم النظر بمزيد من التفصيل في جلسة الاستماع المقبلة.
 سيمنحك هذا أيضًا الوقت لطلب التعليقات والبدء في الرد.
 خطة سليمة.
 نعم يا جيف، سأعود إلى أسئلتك المتعلقة بالشحن لاحقًا.
 أولاً، ذهبت إلى المجلس وطرحت أسئلة حول العرض التقديمي.
 هل تبدو جميلة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2745.784s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم شكرا لك.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2747.785s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 ستبدأ الأسئلة والتعليقات على اللوحة الآن.
 يستمر جيمي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2762.478s">[Unidentified]</a>: نعم، اعتقدت أنه كان عرضا رائعا.
 أقدر المناظر الطبيعية في الإضاءة العامة وكيف تمتزج مع السماء المظلمة.
 أعتقد أنه مفهوم واسع جدًا من حيث الاحتياجات والعوامل التي نريد تغطيتها.
 لدي سؤال حيث تتحدث عن تقاطع مدخل المبنى والواجهة - وهو مدخل شارع ميرتل.
 أعتقد أن اهتمامي الوحيد هو وجهة نظر العنوان: هل يجب تسمية هذا المبنى بـ 970 Fellsway، بغض النظر عن عنوان Myrtle Street، فقط نظرًا لأن خرائط Google وخرائط Apple والغرباء يجب أن يشيروا إلى مدخل Fellsway بدلاً من مدخل شارع Myrtle؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2809.941s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: نعم أستطيع الإجابة.
 إذا لزم الأمر، سيتم تقسيم العقار إلى وحدات فرعية ولن يكون للعقار السكني واجهة Fellsway وبالتالي لن يكون له عنوان Fellsway.
 من المرجح أن يظل 970 هو عنوان التخزين.
 اليوم، كل ذلك في حزمة واحدة، ولهذا السبب يطلق عليه 970.
 لكن المبنى الحالي سيحتفظ بهذا العنوان.
 سيكون للمبنى الجديد عنوان، ولا يمكن أن يكون له سوى عنوان في مورتا أو أمارانتو.
 يبدو أن ميرتل هي مرشحتنا الحالية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2849.895s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: هذه كارثة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2855.676s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟
 أندريه، هيا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2866.31s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: شكرا على النصيحة.
 معلومات مفيدة كبيرة.
 فقط بعض الأسئلة.
 أولاً، أدركت أنه سرعان ما ظهر بعض الرأي العام حول وسائل الراحة والمناظر الطبيعية، وتساءلت عما إذا كان هناك أي نقاش مع الجيران حول هذه الميزات، وخاصة منطقة اللعب.
 أود أيضًا معرفة ما إذا كان لديك أي أفكار لتضمين الفن العام أو المعلومات أو الخدمات التاريخية أو أي شيء من هذا القبيل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2908.533s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم أستطيع الرقص.
 بدءًا من السؤال الأول، التقيت بالجيران وناقشت المشروع كثيرًا.
 أحد التحديات هو إنشاء مساحة خارجية، وعادةً ما أقابل بعض الجيران عندما أتصل بهم.
 لا أريد أن أسيء تفسير ما قلته، لكن بشكل عام لدي انطباع بأن اللعب خارج المعدات البدنية ليس ممتعًا جدًا لبعض الجيران.
 ليس عليهم أن يتخيلوا أنفسهم يستخدمونه.
 ما نقوله هو أننا نريد أن تعود المساحة المفتوحة المخططة بالنفع على المجتمع، ونحن منفتحون على تعليقاتهم إذا كان هناك شيء يريدون رؤيته.
 فيما يلي الإجابات العامة التي تلقيتها حتى الآن.
 يشير إلى الفن العام.
 الجواب على هذا السؤال هو نعم، يعتمد الأمر على ما إذا كنا قادرين على التفكير أم لا.
 ليس لدينا معلومات محددة.
 لديك فكرة محددة في الاعتبار.
 أعتقد أننا تعلمنا من المراجعة الأخيرة التي تركز على البنية أننا سنستمر في معالجة هذه المشكلة من خلال مراجعة النظراء.
 لا أريد أن أستسلم، ولكن أعتقد أنه في المرة القادمة التي يلتقي فيها مهندسو ساحة ديفيس والواجهة الخارجية للمبنى، سيتم وضع عناصر المناظر الطبيعية في مقدمة المحادثة الحالية.
 وهذا ما نحاول التفكير فيه أكثر.
 لا أعرف إذا كان بإمكاننا أن نضمن أخيرًا أنه سيكون لدينا تصميم فني عام رسمي.
 هذا أمر لا يمكن تحديده بعد، ولكن بشكل عام، للإجابة على السؤال نعم، نحن بالتأكيد على استعداد لإدراجه في مناطق مختلفة من الموقع كجزء من الموقع.
 إذا كان لدى أحد أعضاء مجلس الإدارة أو أحد أعضاء المجتمع أي اقتراحات بشأن ما يجب فعله أو مكان القيام به، فنحن نحب أن نسمع منك.
 لأكون صادقًا، لقد كان مفيدًا جدًا عندما ناقشنا خطط المبنى وكيف سيبدو.</p>

 في الواقع، أريد فقط أن أعتذر عن متابعة كلامك لأنه
 ما يثير اهتمامي (وأتساءل عما إذا كنت تعتقد أن هذا صحيح) هو أن جميع الجيران الذين تحدثت إليهم كانوا جيرانًا في شارع ميرتل، أي أنهم كانوا جميعًا منازل وساحات.
 هل سبق لك أن تحدثت مع أحد سكان Amaranth Place عن شقة لا يبدو أنها تحتوي على ساحة كبيرة قريبة؟
 لأن هذا هو المكان
 يعتقد المكتب أن هذه المباني السكنية ستستفيد من بعض المساحات المفتوحة.

 لقد قلت أنه بإمكانهم ركن سياراتهم على الرصيف.
 هل هذا رصيف؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3368.909s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: هناك ممرات تحدد زوايا المبنى.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3406.901s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: عندما يتعلق الأمر بالدراجات، كم عدد الدراجات التي نتركها في المنزل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3419.029s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: أستطيع الرقص.
 لقد تلقينا هذا الرأي من مقدر بومر كجزء من مشروع معماري مستمر.
 نكمل أبعاد هذه الغرفة وفقًا للمخطط، ويظل مخطط الأرضية كما هو.
 نعمل حاليًا على تحديد مساحة هذه الغرفة ومن ثم الخروج بفكرة.
 ركزنا بشكل كبير على الدراجات ونظرنا إلى أحجام مختلفة من خزائن الدراجات وحوامل الساعات، سواء العلوية أو على الحائط، في محاولة لتحقيق أقصى قدر من كفاءة هذه المساحة.
 لذا، ليس لدي إجابة محددة فيما يتعلق بالرقم، ولكن فيما يتعلق بالصورة المربعة في الغرفة، فإننا نقوم بتحسين تلك الإجابة الآن وربما إجابة واحدة على الأقل في العرض التقديمي التالي بعد أن ننظر إلى المبنى.
 شكرا لك
 ولسوء الحظ، ينطبق هذا على الدراجات الموجودة في مقصورة الدراجات بالمبنى.
 لقد أظهرنا المنطقة خارج القاعة حيث توجد مضارب تخزين الدراجات.
 أعتقد أنه يمكننا تقديم بعض المال لهذا أيضًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3509.002s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنًا، هل يمكنني الاستمرار برأيي بشأن مواقف السيارات؟
 في مشروع 40B الأخير، نظرنا إلى إحدى المشكلات التي كان علينا التعامل معها غالبًا: وقوف السيارات.
 ولذلك، في سياق أصبحت فيه الدراجات النارية والدراجات الكهربائية أكثر شعبية من أي وقت مضى، عند النظر في تصميم مقاعد الدراجات.
 كما تعلمون، في بعض الأحيان توجد نيران يصعب إخمادها بهذه الأشياء.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن آخذ ذلك في الاعتبار وأتأكد من أنه مكان آمن للحريق.
 نعم المنطقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3548.73s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: يرجى ملاحظة أن مخزن الدراجات يقع في الطابق الأرضي، ومستوى المنصة، وهو مبنى غير قابل للاحتراق.
 من الواضح أنه يمكننا معرفة هذه الأشياء عندما يصل المشروع إلى وثائق التصميم ووثائق البناء ثم إرسالها لمراجعة الكود.
 لكن من الأفضل أن نتأكد من أننا نعتبره ملعبًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3579.455s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: جيم؟
 نعم، في نفس الموضوع، أعرف العديد من الأماكن التي يُمنع فيها ركوب الدراجات الإلكترونية بسبب مخاطر الحريق.
 هل سيتم أخذ هذا بعين الاعتبار؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3601.675s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: هذا سؤال جيد.
 وحتى يومنا هذا، ما زلنا لا نتواصل.
 لقد لجأنا إلى العديد من فرق إدارة الأصول للحصول على المساعدة، بالإضافة إلى Davis Local Asset Management.

 يمكننا بالتأكيد التحقيق والتنسيق مع فريق إدارة الممتلكات، ومن بين أمور أخرى،
 سيتلقى سكان المبنى التفاصيل، بالإضافة إلى القواعد واللوائح الموقعة، عند التقدم بطلب للإيجار.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3647.971s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: في الواقع، إنه أمر مهم جدًا لدرجة أنني لا أستطيع تذكره.
 أعتقد أن هذا قد تمت مناقشته بالفعل في مشاركة سابقة.
 عام، ولكن هل هذا الإطار موجود في مساحة معيشة مصنوعة من الخشب أو مادة أخرى؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3666.182s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 إذن كيف يبدو هذا المبنى وما هو المشروع الحالي؟
 هذا مبنى منصة.
 وقد وصل التكوين الحالي إلى ذروته.
 خمسة عناصر بناء في واحد وأربعة في واحد.
 نقطة أخرى هي مستوى مقاومة الحريق الخاص بك، سواء كان من الفولاذ أو الخرسانة لم يتم تحديده رسميًا، ولكن فوق مستوى مقاومة الحريق يجب أن يكون هناك إطار خشبي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3702.173s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أرى
 سبب سؤالي هو
 أحد الأسباب التي دفعتنا إلى قضاء الكثير من الوقت في مناقشة هذه القضية في جلسات الاستماع 40B السابقة هو أنه كان مبنى مشابهًا وكان لمفوض البناء لدينا في ذلك الوقت خبرة مباشرة مع حريق في والثام، وفي هذه الحالة حريق هيكلي.
 ولكن في الأساس هذا هو نوع المبنى الذي تم بناؤه
 ارتفاع خطر الحريق في حالات معينة.
 لذا ضع ذلك في الاعتبار عند مشاهدة المجموعات الأخرى.
 أعتقد أن التوجه، خاصة بالنسبة للمباني من نفس النوع، ربما يكون أفضل طريقة للوصول إلى هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3745.348s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، مفهومة ونقطة جيدة.
 فيما يتعلق بالاكتمال، سيكون المشروع متوافقًا تمامًا مع التعليمات البرمجية وسيخضع لعملية مراجعة.
 بعد ذلك، أثناء البناء، سيعمل مدير المبنى مع إدارة إطفاء الحرائق في ميدفورد لتطوير خطة NFPA 241 والامتثال لجميع القوانين واللوائح المعمول بها.
 نقوم بمراجعة كاملة لأنواع هياكل الإطارات الخشبية والمخاطر المرتبطة بها.
 حسنا، شكرا لك.</p>

 أندريه، استمرار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3795.043s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: هل يمكنك أن تشرح بمزيد من التفصيل البنية التحتية لشحن المركبات الكهربائية التي تتحدث عنها؟
 لأنها لا تبدو جيدة جدًا.
 أعني أننا نتحدث عن انتقال سريع إلى السيارات الكهربائية في السنوات الخمس إلى العشر القادمة.
 ومن الواضح أن إحدى أكبر العقبات هي توافر محطات الشحن.
 سيكون أمرا رائعا لو أمكنك شرح ذلك لنا أكثر قليلا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3822.498s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: نعم، بات يريد مني أن أفعل هذا؟
 سأخبرك أين هم.
 سأعيد الصورة إلى الشاشة لأوضح من أين بدأنا.
 ثم سنتحدث عن الميزات الموجودة في المبنى.
 لذلك فقط قم بتكبير الصورة قليلاً هنا.
 مرة أخرى، هناك 14 مكانًا، اثنان منها قديمان واثنان يمكن الوصول إليهما.
 نظرًا لصعوبة تركيب البنية التحتية للسباكة والتركيب خارج المبنى، نريد أن يكون كل شيء جاهزًا من اليوم الأول حتى تكون البنية التحتية جاهزة للعمل.
 تسمح خيارات التوسعة بالوصول إلى المرآب، ولكن ليس لدينا واحد.
 إن وضعه في المرآب أمر سهل إذا خططنا مسبقًا وقمنا بتركيب البنية التحتية الكهربائية المناسبة، أليس كذلك؟
 المحولات ولوحة التوزيع وما إلى ذلك.
 نحن بحاجة إلى الاستعداد لبناء هذه القوة في المستقبل.
 نحن بحاجة إلى التخطيط للمستقبل وتنفيذ تلك الخطة.
 عندما ندخل في مرحلة تصميم التسلسل، سنقوم بتنسيق هذا العمل مع شركة الكهرباء.
 ومع ذلك، بمجرد الانتهاء من إنشاء هذه البنية التحتية الحيوية، يصبح إضافة المعدات إلى المرآب الخاص بك أسهل قليلاً حيث يمكنك تركيب الأنابيب على سطح المرآب.
 قم بتشغيله أينما تريد وأضف محطات في أي وقت.
 هذه هي الطريقة التي نصل بها إلى الموقع، ونجد أصعب الأشياء من اليوم الأول ونضمن المرونة.
 وكما قال أنجانيتا، فهو يتوسع بسرعة.
 لا نعرف ما هو الطلب في السنوات القادمة، ولكن من السهل تلبيته.
 بات، أنا أتساءل ماذا يمكنك أن تقول أيضًا عن هذا المبنى؟
 هذا هو رأيي في إمكانيات التوسع في السيارات الكهربائية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: لذلك أعتقد أنك ضربت المسمار على رأسك.
 تتمثل عملية تفكيرنا في تركيب شاحن EV على الجزء الخارجي من المبنى كجزء من هيكل المبنى.
 سمعنا أعضاء المجلس وغيرهم ممن حضروا جلسة الاستماع يقولون إنهم يرغبون في رؤية شاحن خارج المبنى.
 لذلك نعتقد أن العمل في الموقع هو شيء يمكننا القيام به من خلال التوسع المستقبلي الذي يتسم بالقوة والمرونة من حيث الحجم المناسب للبنية التحتية الكهربائية، ولكن يمكنهم القيام بذلك على مستوى المنصة، على مستوى مبنى الحماية من الحرائق، وصولاً إلى مستوى المرآب حيث يمكنهم تركيب الأنابيب على السطح وإضافة محطات شحن السيارات الكهربائية.
 ولكي نكون منصفين، فقد حقق ديفيس نجاحًا في مشاريع أخرى وقد يضيف المزيد مع تزايد الطلب أو الطلب.
 إنها حقًا مسألة تنسيق البنية التحتية الكهربائية الخاصة بك.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، تكرار ما قاله ستيف، ولكن سماع ذلك مني مباشرة، هذا مجرد جزء من كيفية تصميمنا للموقع والتفكير فيه بفكرة لماذا تراهم يجلسون على الموقع ويتغيرون مع نمو المبنى في المستقبل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: نعم، أريد فقط أن أقول إنني سعيد لأنك مهتم بالتوسع داخليًا.
 أعتقد أنه مع وجود الكثير من مواقف السيارات، حتى اليوم الأول يكفي لشحن سيارة كهربائية.
 أود أن أوصي بالتأكيد أكثر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: هذا شيء يمكننا أن ننظر فيه حقًا.
 ليس لدي إجابة محددة فيما يتعلق بالتقييم الكمي، ولكننا نهتم بتعليماتك وسنأخذها بعين الاعتبار بالتأكيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4075.973s">[Unidentified]</a>: شكرا لك
 إذن، أين توجد محطات الشحن السريع هذه أو أين تريد أن يقوم الأشخاص بركن سياراتهم وشحنها طوال الليل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: هذا سؤال جيد.
 أعتقد أن هناك العديد من المستويات.
 يتطلب كل شيء بعض التنسيق مع البنية التحتية للطاقة لديك: مقدار الطاقة التي يمكنك الحصول عليها وما هو حجم الصندوق الذي تحتاجه لتوزيع نوع الطاقة التي تحتاجها.
 أستطيع أن أقول أنه يبدو لي أن هناك المزيد من محطات الشحن السريع.
 بالنسبة لمثل هذا المبنى، يمكن اعتبار هذا أمرًا طبيعيًا، وحتى غير نمطي، نظرًا لحجمه الكبير.
 ليس لدي إجابة واضحة.
 أعتقد أننا نريد أن نجعلها فعالة قدر الإمكان، ولكن سيتعين علينا تحديد كمية محطة الشحن لاحقًا عندما نتمكن من قياسها مع مهندس كهربائي والعمل مع مزود الخدمة لتأكيد مقدار الطاقة التي يمكن أن تصل إلى هذا الموقع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: من الجدير بالملاحظة أننا في هذا النوع من التطوير نستخدم فقط أجهزة الشحن العادية لأن الأشخاص سيعودون إلى منازلهم ويوقفون سياراتهم طوال الليل.
 وبالتالي، فإن سعر الليلة الواحدة لن يصبح عائقًا أمام الأنشطة التجارية العادية.
 إذا كانت الدورة أقصر، فأنت في هذه المرحلة تحتاج حقًا إلى حمل أسرع.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4170.979s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: حسنا
 ومع ذلك، إذا كان نفس الأشخاص الأربعة عشر يستخدمون تلك الأماكن الأربعة عشر ليلاً، وكان لديك أكثر من 300 مكان للتحقق منها، فسوف تستمر في استخدامها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4186.36s">[Unidentified]</a>: نعم، هذا ما أعنيه.
 هذا ما أعتقده.
 هل هذه المساحات مخصصة لمستخدمي المركبات الكهربائية؟ أو، كما تعلمون، في رأي أندرو، إذا لم يكونوا مجتهدين ولم يشحنوا بشكل أسرع، فهل يمكننا إعطاء هذه المساحات للمستأجرين، واستخدامها لشحن البطاريات، ثم نقل السيارة وإتاحتها للآخرين؟
 بالمناسبة، من الواضح أن هذه مجرد فكرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، هذا شيء يجب أن نتنازل عنه.
 نحن بحاجة إلى التنسيق بين فرق إدارة الممتلكات.
 أعتقد أنه في البيئة التي تتحدث عنها، حيث نقوم بحظر رقم إذا تقرر على الفور أن هناك حاجة إلى المزيد، أعتقد أننا نشعر بالارتياح لكوننا قادرين على الإضافة بسهولة.
 وبهذه الطريقة، إذا لم يتمكن الأشخاص من شحن سياراتهم بسبب التزامات العمل، فسنكون قادرين على إنشاء المزيد من محطات الشحن في المستقبل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنًا، سأقول في هذا المقال شيئًا واحدًا: إنه مناخ بارد.
 ولهذا السبب أعتقد أن السيارات الكهربائية تحتاج على الأقل إلى بعض المساحة الداخلية.
 وهذا يجعل من السهل أن نفهم.
 لا تنس التخطيط قبل تثبيت البنية التحتية.
 لذلك سيكون من المفيد لمشاهدينا المستقبليين أن يعرفوا ما هي خططهم، وما الذي يبحثون عنه، وإلى أي مدى يمكنهم التوسع وما إذا كان سيكون لديهم أي مساحة، مثل هل تعرف أين سيكون لديهم مساحة اليوم؟
 ماذا عن مواقف السيارات أو مع التصميم الحالي، كل شيء بالخارج؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4304.051s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: يشار إليها بنقطة الشكل الموصى بها للتثبيت.
 كما قلت في بضع دقائق، لقد فهمنا التعليقات، وسنكتشف مقدار المساحة المتاحة وإذا كان ما نقدمه اليوم ليس كافيًا، فسنجري القليل من البحث حوله وبعد ذلك يمكننا الرد بما نعتقد أنه جيد.
 وإذا كان الأمر كذلك، فلن تتلقى أي داخلية أو خارجية إضافية.
 ولهذا فإن مثال عصرنا فريد في هذا المفهوم أ.

 أسئلة طرحت علي ولم أطرحها:

 أعتقد أن توسع ميرتل يفتح بعض الاحتمالات الجديدة التي لم نستكشفها بعد ولكننا نريد أخذها بعين الاعتبار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4419.959s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: لدي أسئلة وتعليقات.
 هذه إيفيت.
 وفيما يتعلق بسعة الذاكرة المتبقية، آسف إذا اختفت بعد التحقق. أواجه مشاكل مؤقتة في الشبكة.
 هل المبنى بحاجة إلى تجديد؟
 أعلم أننا نتحدث عن السلامة العامة، وبالتأكيد، يمكن أن يكون في مكان ما، لكنهم بجوار منطقة صناعية كبيرة.
 إذًا ما الذي يحدث في هذا المجال للمساعدة في تحسين...</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4459.498s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: وماذا عن بشكل عام؟
 هذا سؤال جيد جدا.
 نحن لا نلمسه.
 هناك بالفعل أفكار لتحسين هذا المكان.
 قد يعطل عملية التفكير الخاصة بك.
 نحن نعتبر نوعين رئيسيين من المجالات.
 ستيف، هل يمكنك حذف هذا؟
 فقط خطة الموقع بأكملها كدليل.
 الأول في Fellsway، وكما ترون، يوفر الفرصة للرد ببساطة عن طريق قطع الرصيف لصالح الموقع بأكمله.
 قم بتغيير نقطة الوصول إلى المبنى وسعته، بالإضافة إلى كيفية دخول الشاحنات إلى المبنى والخروج منه.
 أعتقد أن هذا محدد جدًا لسؤالك.
 سيكون هذا تعديلاً للظروف الحالية.
 ثانيا، أعتقد.
 ما نريد أن نفهمه هو الحجم، وهذا معقد بعض الشيء، يا ستيف، ولكن عندما كان المبنى موجودًا، عندما تم هدم المستودع الحالي، كان لا بد من وجود جدار طويل متبقي للمبنى القائم بذاته.
 كيف نخطط لإنهاء هذا الجدار؟
 الآن هذا هو جدار CMU في المبنى.
 ستكون هناك خطط للدخول وتحسين الحالة الخارجية للجدار.
 بالطبع، سوف نتأكد من أن عملية التفكيك تتم بشكل آمن، ولكن جمالياتها تقتصر فقط على إنهاء هذا الجدار والحفاظ على جميع التوصيلات بالسقف سليمة.
 تم تنفيذ كل شيء يتعلق بالعزل المائي للمبنى بشكل صحيح.
 لذا، لن يتم هدم المبنى الحالي فحسب، بل إن العمل الذي نخطط للقيام به سيتضمن أيضًا بعض التحسينات التي ستسمح لنا بحل مشكلة المدخل الرئيسي لجزء من المبنى.
 أنا لا أريد.
 لقد توقفت المحادثات حول هذا العقار السكني، ولكننا نقوم بإعداد بعض العروض التوضيحية التي سنناقشها على انفراد مع المدينة للمساعدة في إيجاد طريق للمضي قدمًا لمزيد من تطوير المبنى عندما يكون بعض العمل عليه منطقيًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: Повторяю, я не знаю, как устроено это здание.
 Так что признаюсь, что я неосведомлен или неосведомлен о том, как работает этот бизнес.
 Но я просто думаю о своем личном опыте и о том, где я вырос.
 Помню, в промышленном здании рабочие выходили на улицу и устраивали место для встреч, ну и, знаете, бросали курить, делали перерывы на обед и так далее.
 Здесь нужны эти вещи?
 Если бы это произошло, то где бы это произошло?
 Означает взаимодействие с соседями?
 Потому что он больше не закрыт.
 Это торговля.
 Это район.
 Конечно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: لا، هذا سؤال مفيد.
 لذلك يتم استخدام المبنى حاليًا للتخزين الذاتي مما يعني الحد الأدنى من تكاليف الصيانة بالنسبة لنا وللعاملين في الموقع.
 هذا ليس عمل إنتاجي، بل مجرد توجيه وإشراف عام.
 التعقيد البشري التعقيد الذي يواجهه أولئك الذين لديهم إمكانية الوصول إلى الخلايا الشخصية.
 ولذلك فإن كثافة اليد العاملة للعاملين في الموقع وظروف العمل الميداني منخفضة للغاية.
 ونعتقد أنه لا داعي لتوفير مكان للتجمع لهم داخل المبنى.
 هناك مكاتب وغرف استراحة وما شابه ذلك، مكاتب تنفيذية.
 لذا، فإننا نفكر بشكل عام في جودة استخدام هذا المبنى وجودة عمليات التفتيش التي يتم إجراؤها من خلال تقليل عدد الموظفين.
 لم أتوقع أن يحدث ما قلته.</p>

 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟
 لا، أعتقد أن أذكى ما يمكن فعله هو التصويت لصالح مناقشة عامة للعملية المدنية.
 وبعد ذلك، وبعد مناقشة عامة لاهتمامات المواطنين، سنمر بفترة تنظيم حركة المرور.
 ثم سيواجه الرئيس عريضة عامة بشأن قضايا المرور.

 ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះ Cliff Bomer ។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នករិះគន់ស្ថាបត្យកម្ម ហើយអរគុណអ្នកខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ការនិយាយរបស់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំមានសំណួរមួយចំនួនដែលអាចកើតឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងមើលគ្នាទៅវិញទៅមក
 វគ្គនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាអស្ចារ្យណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​មាន​រឿង​រដ្ឋប្បវេណី​មួយ​ចំនួន​ប្រហែល​ជា​ត្រឡប់​មក​លើ​ប្រធាន​បទ​វិញ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតអំពីកន្លែងចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនចាំកន្លែងដែល Medford អនុវត្តលេខកូដចូលរួមនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែត្រូវចាំ។
 លេខកូដចូលរួមមានតម្រូវការជាក់លាក់សម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ហើយវាប្រែប្រួលយ៉ាងទូលំទូលាយ។
 នេះគឺជាការលោតផ្លោះដ៏ធំបើប្រៀបធៀបទៅនឹងលេខកូដផ្សេងទៀត។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាច្បាប់អន្តរប្រតិបត្តិការទាមទារ 20% នៃចំណតរថយន្តដើម្បីភ្ជាប់បណ្តាញ ខ្ញុំគិតថាមកពី
 សម្រាប់ចំណតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​បង្ហាញ​ខ្លួន​ឯង​ជា​អាជ្ញាធរ​លើ​បទប្បញ្ញត្តិ​ជាក់លាក់​នោះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​សូម​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​វា​ឡើង​វិញ ព្រោះ​វា​អាច​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ពិត​ប្រាកដ ប្រសិន​បើ​ទីក្រុង​ឆ្លងកាត់​វា​មុន​ដំណើរការ​អនុញ្ញាត​ចាប់ផ្តើម។
 ក៏មានមតិពីរឬបីទៀត។
 ជាដំបូងខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍យ៉ាងខ្លាំង
 ដ្យាក្រាមរង្វង់ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាមាននៅក្នុងរបៀបវារៈសម្រាប់វគ្គបន្ទាប់ គឺជាប្រធានបទមួយចំនួនដែលបានលេចឡើងទាក់ទងនឹងការបំភ្លឺនៃអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំបានឃើញវា។
 ច្រកចូលចំហៀងគឺជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អមួយដើម្បីបន្ថែមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍បរិមាណដល់ facade អាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មើល​ឃើញ​ថា​វា​ជា​ឱកាស។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចស្រដៀងគ្នារបស់ Andrew អំពីសិល្បៈសាធារណៈគឺត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 វាមានផ្នែកខាងមុខវែងដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងចំណតរថយន្ត ពណ៍ amaranth វែង ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ទីធ្លាជញ្ជាំងដែលពិតជាអាចបង្កើននូវអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាជាគំនិតដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ផែនការចំហៀងរបស់អាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមានឱកាសដ៏អស្ចារ្យនៅទីនោះ។
 យោបល់រហ័សពីរទៀត។
 មួយគឺ,
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​ផែនការ​ណា​មួយ​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ឃើញ​នៅ​យប់​នេះ​ឆ្លុះ​បញ្ចាំង​ពី​គំនិត​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​អំពី​ការ​កាត់​ជ្រុង​ភាគ​ពាយព្យ​នៃ​អគារ​នោះ​ទេ។
 យើង​បាន​មើល​ទៅ​លើ​ការ​សិក្សា​បរិមាណ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មាន​ប្រសិទ្ធិ​ភាព​ខ្លាំង​ក្នុង​ការ​កាត់​ចេញ​ជ្រុង​ពាយ័ព្យ ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​សូវ​សំខាន់​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងទុកវាចោល។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថានេះជាចេតនា ឬគ្រាន់តែជាបញ្ហាសម្របសម្រួលរវាងការងារសំណង់ និងសំណង់។
 ចំណុចសំខាន់គឺ ខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាអ្នកធ្វើដំណើរទេ ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាយឺតពេលទៅសន្និសីទ ប្រហែលជាពីរដង ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថានឹងមានជម្លោះលើការចូលរៀន។
 ដោយសារតំបន់មកដល់គឺនៅផ្នែកខាងជើងនៃអគារ មានការពិភាក្សាខ្លះអំពីរបៀបបង្កើតផ្លូវដើរដែលបំបែកអគារដែលមានស្រាប់ពីអគារថ្មី ដោយផ្លាស់ទីចម្ងាយ 100 ហ្វីតដំបូងទៅភាគខាងជើង ដើម្បីកុំឱ្យមនុស្សទៅពី Myrtle ទៅតំបន់មកដល់ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកចេញពីច្រកចូលចំណតនៅផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃអាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំសូមអភ័យទោសប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំខកខានការសន្ទនាផ្សេងទៀតអំពីបញ្ហានេះ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់បញ្ជាក់ថាខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាមនុស្សឆ្លងកាត់ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីចំនួនយានជំនិះដែលអាចប្រើវាជាច្រកទ្វារ។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្យ៉ាងវិញទៀត នេះជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានរៀនពីទស្សនៈស៊ីវិល ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 សម័យប្រជុំការងារត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងម្តងទៀត ហើយខ្ញុំបានថ្លែងអំណរគុណដល់បេក្ខជនចំពោះឆន្ទៈរបស់ពួកគេក្នុងការបន្តអភិវឌ្ឍស្ថាបត្យកម្មរបស់អគារ ដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវភ្ជាប់ជាមួយផែនការទេសភាព និងសំណង់ស៊ីវិល។</p>

 لذا، بما أن هناك بعض النقاط في بعض مناقشات الفريق التي قد توضح القصة قليلاً، فهل يريد أحد أن يقول ذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ផាត ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ឱ្យខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើម ខ្ញុំនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងលំដាប់បញ្ច្រាស និងគ្របដណ្តប់បន្ថែមទៀតនៃបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ដែល Cliff ទើបតែបានលើកឡើង តាមពិតនៅដើមពិធី។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចែករំលែករូបថតអេក្រង់របស់ខ្ញុំម្តងទៀត តែមួយដងទៀតប៉ុណ្ណោះ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំអាចបង្ហាញវាចេញ ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាយល់ព្រម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមតិទាំងអស់គឺអំពីប្រវែងនៃផ្លូវនេះ ប្រសិនបើវាចង់នៅម្ខាង ទិសមួយ ឬផ្លូវផ្សេងទៀត ឬយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ក្នុងទិសដៅនៃច្រកចូល ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាការសន្ទនា។
 យើងបានពិភាក្សាវា។
 ទីបំផុត​យើង​បាន​សម្រេច​ថា នេះ​ជា​ផ្នែក​ពីរ​ផ្លូវ។
 ហេតុផលគឺប្រសិនបើឡានមកយកអ្នកឧទាហរណ៍
 ការទម្លាក់នរណាម្នាក់ចេញ ឬរើសនរណាម្នាក់ឡើង នេះគឺដូចជាស្ថានភាពរើស និងទម្លាក់ចោល។
 អ្នកខ្លះកាន់កាបូបដើរទិញឥវ៉ាន់ ហើយទុកវានៅមុខទ្វារ។ ពេល​ភ្លៀង គេ​យក​កាបូប​រត់​ចេញ​តាម​ទ្វារ។
 អ្នក​ដែល​បើក​អ្នក​ចុះ​ពី​ផ្ទះ​អាច​បត់​ចូល​ទៅ​ណា​ក៏​បាន​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រោយ​អគារ រក​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត​របស់​គេ និង​ចូល​តាម​ទ្វារ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដើម្បី​ចូល ទោះ​បី​វា​នៅ​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​ក៏​ដោយ ហើយ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួកគេ​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន ពួកគេ​ប្រាកដ​ជា​មិន​ចេញ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើពួកគេចតនៅខាងក្រៅ វាមានឱកាសដែលនរណាម្នាក់នឹងត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដើរចុះក្រោម Fellsway ហើយបន្ទាប់មកត្រលប់មកវិញតាមច្រកចូលមួយទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងគិតថា នោះជាលក្ខណៈពិសេសមួយដ៏សំខាន់ ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើវាជាអ្នកមកទស្សនារយៈពេលខ្លី ហើយមាននរណាម្នាក់មកមើលអចលនទ្រព្យនោះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកដាក់ប្រាក់បញ្ញើទាំងបួននេះ ដោយសន្មត់ថាពួកគេត្រូវបានកាន់កាប់ទាំងអស់ បន្ទាប់មកបុគ្គលនេះត្រូវតែចាកចេញ ហើយទៅកាន់ Fellsway ដើម្បីចូលមកមើល។
 កន្លែងផ្សេងទៀតនៅកន្លែងណាមួយក្នុងតំបន់ យើងចាត់ទុកការធ្វើដំណើរទាំងនេះថាមិនសំខាន់ពីផ្លូវដែលនៅជាប់គ្នា ហើយរក្សាវានៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបានធ្វើវា មានការពិភាក្សា ហើយអ្នកនឹងមិនចាំខុស ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលយើងនិយាយម្តងទៀត វិស្វករចរាចរណ៍បានធ្វើការវិភាគខ្លះ ហើយប្រហែល 90% នៃអ្នកចូលរួមស្ថិតនៅក្នុងវិសាលភាពនៃការសិក្សា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងមកទិញសំបុត្រមួយទៀត។
 វាត្រូវបានគេជឿថាប្រហែល 10 ភាគរយនៃប្រជាជននឹងងាកទៅរកច្រកទ្វារ។
 នេះ​គឺ​ពិត​ជា​លើក​ទី​មួយ​។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងជឿថា វាមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់ក្នុងការថែរក្សាផ្លូវពីរផ្លូវនេះ នៅពេលដែលបរិមាណចរាចរណ៍មានកម្រិតទាបជាង និងផ្តល់ឱកាសដើម្បីមិនត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Fells Way វិញ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលយើងគិត។</p>

 تنقسم عملية التصميم من نواحٍ عديدة إلى قسمين، لذلك نولي اهتمامًا خاصًا للمستوى الأرضي. أعتقد أن هذا هو رأيك. نقوم بتجديد الجزء السكني من المبنى بحيث يكون المبنى فوق مستوى سطح الأرض.
 سطح المبنى كما هو موضح في الصورة أعلاه: المبنى يقع على ظهره.
 يجب أن أقول أن هذه الأغنية عادت.
 هذه شطب.
 لذلك فهو يتناسب مع العرض الذي قمنا به.
 قبل ذلك، بناءً على شائعات حول تصميمنا السابق وتعليقات من أصدقائنا السابقين.
 ولهذا السبب لم نعود وندمر المبنى.
 أنت تنظر فقط إلى مخطط الأرضية.
 لذلك نأمل أن نتمكن من القضاء على الفوضى.
 سأواصل الفن العام في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة.
 ملحوظة. وكما ذكرت سابقا، أعتقد أن هناك تعليقا آخر على هذه المسألة.
 وهذا شيء نخطط لمناقشته في اجتماع مراجعة النظراء القادم.
 وهذا شيء أخذناه بعين الاعتبار في مراجعتنا المعمارية ويسعدنا أن نحصل على الموقع المقترح.
 أتساءل هل هذا فن عام؟
 حسنًا، مبنى على مجرى الهواء، أو شيء ما في المبنى نفسه.
 كما تعلمون، أعتقد أننا منفتحون حقًا على الفكرة، ونريد أن نجعل منه فندقًا ترحيبيًا يمكن للمدينة أن تفخر به، والفن العام المرتبط به هو شيء نحن منفتحون جدًا عليه.
 أخيرًا، فيما يتعلق بقضايا وقوف السيارات، إليك بعض التعليقات المفيدة.
 أعتقد أننا حصلنا على الكثير من ردود الفعل الليلة.
 وكما ذكرت، الشيء الوحيد الذي تعلمته هو أننا قمنا بالمزيد من الواجبات المنزلية بشأن هذه المسألة.
 لا يمكنني الإشارة إلى لوائح محددة تتعلق بمواقف السيارات الكهربائية، ولكن سيتمكن فريقنا من الرجوع إليها لاحقًا عندما نلتقي.</p>

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងចាប់ផ្តើមនៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមានចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 តាមពិតវានៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃ Fellsway ។
 ដូច្នេះឥឡូវនេះ ក្មេងៗជាមូលដ្ឋានត្រូវទៅកន្លែងដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នៅ ហើយដើររហូតដល់ពួកគេឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ Fells ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ជា​ផ្លូវ​ល្អ។
 តាមពិតទៅ ឆ្លងកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវពីឃ្លាំងនៅលើផ្លូវ Fells Way គឺជាកន្លែងដែលក្មេងៗកំពុងរង់ចាំ។
 មានចំណតឡានក្រុងមួយទៀតនៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃ Myrtle ។
 ដោយសារតែម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាឧស្សាហកម្មមែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ គេ​មិន​នាំ​កូន​មក​ទី​នេះ​ទេ។
 តាមអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់ វានៅកាច់ជ្រុងផ្លូវ Myrtle និង Spring ប្រសិនបើវាអាចជួយបាន។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបើកឡានទៅទីនោះ។
 មតិមួយចំនួន។
 ជាដំបូង សូមអរគុណដល់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល និងជាការពិតណាស់ ដេវីត គ្រុប។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាស្គាល់ Pat ។
 វាជាវគ្គដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំសូមកោតសរសើរចំពោះពេលវេលា។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងមួយដែលត្រូវចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងមតិយោបល់៖
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាការយល់ច្រលំបន្តិច អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថា ជាពិសេសនៅដើមដំបូងនៃគម្រោង យើងបាននិយាយអំពីអ្វីដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នឹងមានរូបរាង អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងបានព្យាយាមប្តូរទិសចរាចរណ៍ ហើយយប់នេះខ្ញុំបានលឺថា អាសយដ្ឋានអចលនទ្រព្យនឹងស្ថិតនៅក្នុង Myrtle។
 ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំជឿថាមនុស្សនឹងដើរកាត់ Myrtle នៅពេលនេះ ហើយពិតជាប្រើច្រកចូល Fellsway នៅពេលចាំបាច់ ដែលវាពិបាកបន្តិច។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្តងទៀត នេះគ្រាន់តែជាមតិយោបល់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បាន​ឮ​អ្វី​ដែល​ខុស​ពី​យប់​នេះ​។
 ផ្នែកផ្សេងទៀតគឺថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងដើម្បីពង្រីកផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ធំ​បំផុត​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ច្បាស់​នោះ​គឺ​ថា​បើ​យើង​មិន​រើ​បង្គោល​ទេ អ្នក​ដែល​រស់​នៅ​តាម​ផ្លូវ​នោះ​នឹង​កត់​សម្គាល់​ឃើញ
 អស្ចារ្យខ្លះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​ច្រើន​ជាង​អ្វី​ដែល​បាន​បង្ហាញ​ក្នុង​រូបភាព​នេះ ហើយ​នោះ​ជា​វិធី​ល្អ​បំផុត​ក្នុង​ការ​ដាក់​វា។
 ដូច្នេះ ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​គុណ​ថា បើ​សសរ​មិន​រើ​ចូល​គ្នា​ទេ ផ្លូវ​ក៏​មិន​ទូលាយ​ដែរ។
 ច្បាស់ណាស់ ចំនុចប្រសព្វរវាង Fellsway និង Bernal មិនអាចពង្រីកបានទេ ដូចដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សានៅក្នុងបញ្ហានេះ និងនៅលើអចលនទ្រព្យ Walsh ។
 មិនមានដំណោះស្រាយពិតប្រាកដទេ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ការសង្កេតមួយទៀតគឺថា ខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តចំនួនកន្លែងចតរថយន្តដែលក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis Group កំពុងស្នើសុំ។
 ផងដែរ សួនឆ្កែគឺជាកង្វល់ចម្បងពីររបស់ខ្ញុំ គឺសម្រាប់តែកំណត់ត្រាប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 មិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែមនៅក្នុងតំបន់នេះទេ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 អំឡុងពេលមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិល មនុស្សប្រកួតប្រជែងគ្នាដើម្បីលំហរ ដូចអ្វីដែលពួកគេបានធ្វើនៅភាគនិរតី ជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំរស់នៅផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​ដូច​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​ធ្វើ​បែប​នោះ​ទាល់​តែ​សោះ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 វាក៏មានលទ្ធភាពដែលសត្វឆ្កែ 289 ក្បាលត្រូវបាននាំយកមកក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ខណៈពេលដែលខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះទីធ្លាបៃតង ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាសំខាន់ជាងក្នុងការផ្តោតលើកន្លែងសម្រាប់សត្វឆ្កែជាជាងសួនកុមារ ឬប្រភេទសួនកម្សាន្តផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា វា​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​ការ​ពេញ​និយម។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាពេញចិត្តក្នុងការវេចខ្ចប់នៅពេលចាំបាច់។
 មិនមានការលេចធ្លាយទេហើយខ្ញុំត្រូវចាកចេញពីយានដ្ឋានជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃ។
 នេះ​ជា​មតិ និង​ចម្ងល់​របស់​ខ្ញុំ ដើម្បី​កុំ​ឲ្យ​ខាត​ពេល​យូរ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាបញ្ហារបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាខ្ញុំមិនដឹងច្រើនអំពីផ្លូវ Warren ។
 វាមិនបង្ហាញក្នុងរូបភាពទាំងនេះទេ។
 នេះគឺជាផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់។
 វាជាផ្លូវមួយផ្លូវនៅ Myrtle ត្រង់ចំនុចប្រសព្វ Amarans ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសំណួររបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ៖ តើមានអ្វីផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវពិចារណា?
 ផ្លូវបំបែកនេះមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ឥឡូវនេះវាមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ជាមួយ​នឹង Davis Group និង​សូម្បី​តែ​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល​គឺ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​តែ​ពិចារណា។
 ទាក់​ទង​នឹង​សន្តិសុខ សំណួរ​ទី​ពីរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​បញ្ជាក់​សម្រាប់​ផ្ទះ​ក្នុង​ក្រុង វា​មិន​ច្បាស់​ទេ។
 តើមានវគ្គខ្លះទេ?
 ដោយផ្ទាល់នៅលើ Myrtle ឬនៅសណ្ឋាគារ។
 សំណួរទីបីរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអំពីការចតរថយន្តសម្រាប់អគារទាំងអស់នៅខាងក្រៅយានដ្ឋាន ជាពិសេសកន្លែងផ្ទុកខាងក្រោយ។
 វាហាក់ដូចជាច្បាស់។
 តើឡានដឹកទំនិញអាចចូលបានទេ?
 តើ​ឡាន​ដឹក​ជញ្ជូន និង​ផ្លូវ​ជម្រាល​មិន​អី​ទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចដើរចុះពីលើជម្រាលភ្នំបានទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចទាញយកវាដោយសុវត្ថិភាពបានទេ?
 ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាបានរស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះនេះមួយរយៈ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរជារៀងរាល់ឆ្នាំបន្ទាប់ពីបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សានៅមហាវិទ្យាល័យ។
 ពេល​នោះ​ខ្ញុំ​ចាំ​ថា​ការ​អាច​ធ្វើ​ចលនា​បាន​គឺ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ប្រឈម។
 នៅក្នុងអគារមួយមានចំណតរថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​រថយន្ត​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​អាច​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​បាន​ទេ។
 កង្វល់ពិតរបស់ខ្ញុំចំពោះសំណួរគឺ៖ តើអ្នកបានពិចារណាកន្លែងទំនេរនៅក្នុងឡានដឹកទំនិញដែលមានផ្លូវជម្រាលទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ច្រើន​ណាស់។
 អរគុណច្រើន។
 សូមអរគុណម្តងទៀតសម្រាប់ពេលវេលារបស់អ្នក។</p>

 نعم، هناك بعض المشاكل.
 كان هناك سؤال حول نقل السيارات في لورانس.
 هل يريد المرشحون التحدث عن هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5775.499s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 هل تريد أن تذهب، بات؟
 الشاحنات ومواقف السيارات.
 توجد الشاحنات في الجزء الخلفي من المبنى.
 هناك مساحة لعدة شاحنات هناك.
 لا نتوقع المزيد من الشاحنات لأن إدارة الأصول مستمرة بالفعل.
 سنقوم بإدارة الأنشطة الداخلية والخارجية.
 نعتقد أن هناك مساحة كافية للتعامل مع بعض أصعب ظروف السفر.
 نحن نحقق في الأمر وسنواصل العمل مع فريق العمليات لدينا لفهم الموقف.
 بالنسبة للمنازل السكنية، تأكد من أن جميع المداخل والمخارج تحت الأرض.
 لا توجد أرصفة أو ممرات في شارع ميرتل.
 يتم الوصول إلى هذه المنطقة من خلال المدخل الداخلي في الخلف.
 لذا أعتقد أنه إذا كنت تريد آخر الأخبار من شارع فلورنسا، فأنا أعلم أنه يراقب.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5841.227s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، نعم، في الواقع.
 هذا سؤال يأتي في الوقت المناسب، لذا فإن الإجابة العامة هي نعم.
 أعتقد أننا نعمل على ذلك الآن، ولا أعرف ما إذا كان جيف من الإصدار التجريبي سيُدلي بأي تعليقات في نهاية النسخة التجريبية، ولكننا حصلنا على الكثير من التعليقات من الإصدار التجريبي حول حركة المرور ونحن ندرسها.
 وبعضها كثير.
 تدابير التخفيف المقترحة التي يجب أن نأخذها في الاعتبار وبعض الأشياء التي يجب أن نأخذها في الاعتبار.
 بدون التقرير الذي أمامي، لا أعرف كيف كان سيبدو طريق لورانس، ولكن بشكل عام أعتقد أن الحركة المحلية والإغاثة في المنطقة تعتبر بشكل عام أكثر من مجرد جميز أو قطيفة.
 أعتقد أن لورانس ربما كان هناك.
 يجب أن أتحقق مرة أخرى، ولكن الإجابة المختصرة على سؤالك هي نعم.
 سنواصل العمل مع فريقنا وفريق المراجعة لتطوير خيارات لتقليل حركة المرور في هذه المنطقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5904.591s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: شكرا لتعليقك حول محطة الحافلات.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5908.352s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: لا شئ.
 أريد أن أقول أنني أعرف أن هذا صحيح.
 جيراني لديهم طفلان، لذلك أراهم يتسكعون كل يوم.
 لذا أشكركم جزيل الشكر على توضيحاتكم وتعليقاتكم.
 شكرا للجميع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5941.353s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: Christina បានទិញផ្ទះមួយនៅផ្លូវ 30 Myrtle ។
 ជាបឋម ខ្ញុំលើកយកបញ្ហាមួយចំនួនជាមួយក្រុមប្រឹក្សានេះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកបានពិភាក្សាជាមួយសង្គមស៊ីវិល។
 តើយើងបានជូនដំណឹងដល់អ្នករស់នៅ Amaranth Apartments អំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំទាំងនេះទេ?
 ព្រោះ​នៅ​គ្រប់​ទីកន្លែង​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ទៅ​គឺ​មិន​មាន​មតិ​សាធារណៈ​ក្នុង​ទិសដៅ​នេះ​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា ប្រសិនបើពួកគេនៅក្នុងប្រអប់សាកល្បង ពួកគេនឹងទទួលបានអ៊ីមែល សម្ភារៈផ្សព្វផ្សាយជាដើម ដើម្បីអាចស្តាប់សំឡេងរបស់ពួកគេ។
 បន្ទាប់មកទីពីរគឺ
 ថ្ងៃនេះ និងក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំមុនៗ យើងបានឮលោក Pat និយាយច្រើនអំពីក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងដែលនឹងគ្រប់គ្រងអចលនទ្រព្យ។
 សំណួរជាច្រើនត្រូវបានសួរ៖ អញ្ចឹងក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយ។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលនឹងពិចារណាចូលរួមកិច្ចប្រជុំមួយក្នុងចំណោមកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះបន្ទាប់ពី Davis សាងសង់អាគារនោះ
 អ្នកស្រុកមានអារម្មណ៍សុវត្ថិភាពអំពីអ្នកដែលជាម្ចាស់ និងគ្រប់គ្រងបទពិសោធន៍ប្រចាំថ្ងៃ របៀបដែលពួកគេមានគម្រោងគ្រប់គ្រងអ្វីៗដូចជាឡានដឹកទំនិញ របៀបដែលពួកគេគ្រប់គ្រងគំនូរណាមួយដែលអាចលេចឡើងនៅលើការងារសិល្បៈ ឬសួនកុមារ និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេនឹងសម្អាតវា។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ច្រានចោល​នេះ​ជា​ការ​ណែនាំ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​បញ្ចេញ​យោបល់​លើ​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​បាន​វិភាគ​ខាង​លើ។
 ចំពោះកន្លែងចតរថយន្ត ខ្ញុំបានលឺថាឥឡូវនេះមានចំណត 300 ហ្វីតនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកយល់ នៅពេលអ្នកនិយាយជាមួយយើង ហើយប្រាប់យើង ចូរនិយាយថា អ្នកបង្កើនវាដល់ 370 អ្នកមិនបង្កើនចំនួនចំណតនៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ទេ។
 រវាងផ្លូវ Amaranth និងផ្លូវ Myrtle,
 អ្នកមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែម។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តទៀតទេនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ក្នុងនាមជាអ្នករស់នៅ Myrtle Street ខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភយ៉ាងខ្លាំងអំពីពេលដែលការភ្ជួររាស់នឹងត្រូវបញ្ចប់ ហើយនៅពេលណាដែលនឹងមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិលធ្លាក់ ព្រោះឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំត្រូវចតនៅ Amaranth ។
 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅតែម្នាក់ឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចូលចិត្ត​គំនិត​មក​ផ្ទះ​យប់​ជ្រៅ ហើយ​ឃើញ​មនុស្ស​ចូល​ចត​នៅ Myrtle ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចត​នៅ​ជ្រុង​ម្ខាង។
 ញ៉ាំ amaranth ហើយដើរទៅផ្ទះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវានឹងកើតឡើង ដោយសារតែក្រុមហ៊ុនទាំងអស់នេះ និងខុនដូប្រណិតៗទាំងអស់នេះ ដែលគិតថ្លៃអ្នកស្នាក់នៅសម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្ត ពួកគេនឹងដឹងថា Amaranth និង Myrtle គឺមិនគិតថ្លៃទេ ហើយពួកគេនឹងជំនួសកន្លែងរបស់យើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឱ្យអ្នកដឹងថា គម្រោងកែលម្អ $130,000 ទៅ $170,000 ដែលអ្នកបានស្នើសម្រាប់ Myrtle Street គឺពិតជាក្លែងក្លាយ ហើយអ្នកដឹងថាវា។
 ទីបំផុត ខ្ញុំពិតជាគិតថាយើងកំពុងចាប់ផ្តើមទៅកាន់កន្លែងដែលសំឡេងរបស់មនុស្សត្រូវបានឮ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានការខកចិត្តនៅពេលឮថាយើងមិនបានបង្វែរចរាចរណ៍ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដូច Allison ទើបនឹងនិយាយ។
 Cliff ក៏​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ថា​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​ចុង​ក្រោយ​នេះ​យើង​បាន​និយាយ​ថា​អ្នក​ស្រុក​នឹង​មិន​អាច​ធ្វើ​បាន​
 ចូលយានដ្ឋានពីផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 វា​ជា​ពពុះ​ដែល​ហូរ​ចូល និង​ចេញ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បង្ហាញពីការខកចិត្តរបស់ខ្ញុំ ដោយសារតែខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានឮត្រូវបានដកចេញពីខ្ញុំក្នុងការហៅទូរស័ព្ទពិសេសនេះ។

 لذلك حول هذا الموضوع.
 أعتقد أن سهولة الاستخدام هي شيء سنركز عليه في تحديثات مراجعة النظراء.
 لذلك لا أعرف إذا كان المرشح مستعدًا للحديث عن ذلك أم لا.
 أعلم أنك ذكرت السبب.
 لذلك سنحصل أيضًا على تعليقات في الإصدار التجريبي.
 لذلك أعتذر.
 تورم الدماغ.
 ثم بدأ تساقط الثلوج.
 حسنًا، لم نناقش الثلج بعد.
 لذلك أشياء مثل إزالة الثلوج.
 أعلم أن هناك موقف سيارات داخلي متاح للمقيمين.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه سيكون من المفيد للجنة أن تستمع الآن أو في جلسات الاستماع المستقبلية حول خططها لحدث الثلوج.
 ثم أطلق النار أيضًا.
 آسف كريستينا، ما الذي ينقصني في الجزء الثالث؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6235.053s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: بالحديث عن مواقف السيارات، فالثلج يتساقط لذا أعتقد أنه مثل كل هذه الشقق الفاخرة هناك رسوم على مواقف السيارات.
 أنا متأكد من أن التغطية ستكون أكبر وأصغر.
 ولكن مع مرور الوقت، سيكتشف السكان المحليون أن الياسمين والياسمين مجانيان.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6526.232s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: أريد أن أعرف ما قاله أندرو سابقًا عن مواقف الدراجات الإلكترونية والمركبات الكهربائية.
 ما أعنيه هو أن المركبات الكهربائية والمركبات الكهربائية تسبب نفس المشاكل التي تسببها الدراجات الكهربائية.
 حتى الآن، كما تقول، في العديد من المدن، وأنا أعلم أن هذا لا يحدث فقط في ميدفورد أو المنطقة التي نتحدث عنها، ولكن، كما تعلمون، حريق منتظم.
 قسم الإطفاء والسيارة لا يحرقان السيارة الكهربائية.
 عادة ما يتعين عليهم الذهاب إلى Massport للحصول عليه.
 لذا، أريد فقط أن أشير إلى أننا نناقش أيضًا كمية الطاقة التي نحتاجها.
 أعتقد أن القضايا الأخرى التي أود طرحها مع كريستينا وأليسون هي قضايا الوصول إلى مواقف السيارات والمرآب.
 أعرف أن هذا قد تم ذكره، ولكني أريد فقط أن أكرر أنه إذا زادت حركة المرور في شارع ميرتل، فسيكون العنوان هو شارع ميرتل.
 حتى لو كانت لديك منطقة توصيل في ميرتل، كم عدد سائقي Uber Eats الموجودين عندما يكون لديك الكثير من السكان؟
 سيكون لديك العديد من الأشخاص في نفس الوقت، وليس واحدًا أو اثنين فقط.
 هذا صحيح، ويمكنك رؤية الشقة التي مكثت فيها مع أصدقاء آخرين.
 أعني أن هذا بالضبط ما يحدث في هذه الوحدات.
 لا أريد أن يكون طريق ميرتل (لأنه نقطة الالتقاء والتوصيل) بمثابة موقف للسيارات بينما ينتظر الناس الدخول.
 إذن أنت الآن خارج الطريق.
 هذا ما أعتقده.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6631.389s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا

 في الواقع، قدم بولس ملاحظة مختلفة.
 قلت أنه عندما نتحدث عن مخرج أو مدخل طريق ميرتل، فهو في الواقع مخرج طوارئ، وليس المخرج الرئيسي.
 إذا كان مجرد طلب من قسم الإطفاء، يمكنك إيقاف تشغيله وتوجيه حركة المرور إلى Fellsway.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6669.151s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: للتوضيح، عندما تقول "أطفئ"، هل تقصد هدفًا ماديًا أم وسيلة نقل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6674.116s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: هذه هي أنواع الأشياء التي يمكنهم الوصول إليها، لذا فهي ليست دخولًا إلى المنطقة، فأنت تجبر حركة المرور على طريق Fellsway.</p>

 那么，晚安。
 回到那个和婴儿组。
 开展交通影响评估研究。
 为了开始这个过程，我们进行了实地考察，观察交通状况，审查了 Van Essen Associates 影响研究、Polar Engineering 项目计划，并审查了所有交通方式，不仅包括交通，还包括行人、自行车和公共交通。
 我们与土建工程也有一些重叠，因此您可以在场地规划、内部循环、装载和交付以及运输需求管理计划中看到一些内容。
 总体而言，交通研究是按照我们现有的国家和行业专业标准进行的，是一份综合报告。
 因此，我将总结我们的评论。
 有些评论要求提供更多信息，要求澄清。
 我们更多地谈论外部缺陷以及可能的改进。
 感谢您的介绍。
 亲爱的玩家，我认为我们提出的一些意见在今天的演示中得到了回答。
 所以我谢谢你。
 也许这有点多余。
 我们讨论了一些主题，所以这或多或少是按照流量影响研究的顺序进行的。
 因此，在研究区域内，对整个区域的交叉口进行了综合评估。
 这有点难以阅读。
 我想说的是，第一个正在考虑纳入的十字路口是您注意到的唯一一个未包括在内的十字路口，即第四街。
 嗯，这里看起来围栏很围，所以标有人行横道。
 所以那将是唯一的地方。
 我想你可以考虑看看。
 因此，在现有条件下，采集1月11日的流量。
 小马丁·路德·金
 假期是15号。
 我只是想得到一些答案，以及周一假期是否会对周四的计数产生任何预期影响。
 然后收集并汇总流量。
 我们想了解更多有关该网站现有使用所产生的行程的信息。
 所以，这里只是有关该地区行人现有状况的一些信息。
 我们自己根据刚刚写下的观察结果做了一个清单。
 中环街和春街交叉口没有行人信号灯，该路口是正在研究的交叉路口。
 该地区的几个十字路口没有可检测的人行横道和警告牌，而这些必须符合 ADA 标准，其中包括 Myrtle、Amaranth 和 Lawrence 街道的十字路口。
 这些只是一些观察和笔记。
 安全方面，该地区有多个路口曾发生过安全事故。
 正如我刚才提到的，Central 和 Spring 有 13 次失败。
 最重要的是，事故发生率超过了马萨诸塞州交通部第 4 区的平均水平和州平均水平，达到了令人担忧的程度。
 Fellsway 和 Riverside 五年内发生了 31 起事故。
 MassDOT 将其认定为高事故群体，使其有资格接受 2019 年进行的高速公路安全审计，并被认定为存在安全问题。
 Fellsway Central 和 Medford Street 五年内发生了 23 起事故。
 我们只是想更多地了解该地区发生的行人和自行车事故类型。
 停车，我们询问在现有条件下，是否有关于今天该地点街道和停车场占用情况的信息，您知道，这些空间在相邻街道和该地点本身占用的百分比，了解这些信息会很有用。
 未来的情况，所以我先讲一下出行生成和出行分配归因。
 因此，预计该项目将在工作日上午和下午高峰时段产生约 90 趟车次。
 我们认为这是一个合理的数字。
 我们希望获得更多关于卡车出行次数的信息，包括这个数字。
 行人、自行车和公共交通出行。
 因此，如果能够对它们进行分解和识别，将会很有帮助。
 计算中使用了未来 5% 的自行车比例。
 我们认为它可能有点高。
 我认为全市 Medford 模式的总体比例为 1%。
 所以我想知道如果计算时假设从自行车模式分裂到较低模式，这会对车辆的出行产生多大影响？
 Fells Way 上的许多行程都会在中央大街掉头返回该地点。
 我想知道是否有其他交通可以使用的替代路线，因为认识到此行进中存在一些延误和拥堵，尤其是在下午，例如河滨大道，左转进入河滨，甚至使用 I-93 作为替代路线。
 其中一些交通是否会使用 I-93 而不是 Fells Way？
 嗯，报告中有一个表格确定了该项目的流量增加情况，但事实并非如此。
 识别现场附近的道路，例如 Fellsway、Myrtle、Pinker、Lawrence 和 Spring。
 因此，我想量化有关该地点附近道路交通量增加的信息。
 一个已经被谈论了一点的停车项目，停车比例为1.14。
 我们只是想确保这个数字是正确且足够的，可以满足该地点的预期停车需求。
 你知道，请记住，我们希望确保我们做的每件事都是正确的。
 因此，如果有足够的停车位，就不会溢出到邻近的社区和道路。
 我们看到前面有 4 个访客空间，即送货区。
 我们认为它可能有点低。
 嗯，我们还想更多地了解游客空间本身。
 不仅是短期送货，而且如果人们拜访该综合体的居民，他们会在哪里停车，如果他们这样做几个小时？
 如果他们停车很长时间或停车过夜。
 所以一些关于这是如何运作的讨论。
 访客空间将由网站运营和管理。
 关于拟议的停车位，新的Amaranth停车位，只是这些停车位的意图，我知道它们是向公众开放的，但它们应该供现场访客使用吗？
 这些空间的用途是什么？
 进行了交叉口通行能力分析。
 交通工程师使用所谓的交叉口服务级别。
 它类似于成绩单，其中 A，表示条件极佳，几乎没有延误或拥堵。
 E和F不足。
 F 是最差的，或者因巨大的延迟、拥塞和排队而失败。
 所以，你知道，我们在那里看到了 Fellsway 上的拥堵情况，大部分是早上向南行，下午向北行。
 Fellsway、Central 以及 Fellsway 和 Riverside 交叉口目前以 F 服务级别运行，这意味着它们有一个或多个交通通常无法达到 F 服务级别。
 而项目未来的非施工条件和施工条件又使这些条件更加恶化。
 该项目将导致中环 Fellsway 的交通显着增加，而中央大道东行通道的延误将会增加。
 其中一些问题已经得到解决。
 就在今天晚上，我看到了这里右上角的空间。
 我想我们在仓库的 A 区。
 感谢您提供这个。
 此外，还可以进入建筑物和会场周围的空间，今晚也展示了这一点，所以这很棒。
 这里显示了与未来自行车道的联系。
 我想这一切都已经解决了。
 只是对街道空间、默特尔街和阿默斯特的新空间进行澄清。
 我知道它们向公众开放，但谁对这些空间拥有管辖权？
 它们真的是城市还是属于私人管辖？
 因此，对这些空间进行更多澄清。
 就其本身而言，我们谈论的是场地规划中更广阔的空间，即流通道路的宽度。
 抱歉，必须提供路边停车位。
 讨论居民和游客的自行车停放只是为了明确车位数量。
 现场必须标明储雪区域。
 我知道有人在谈论默特尔街，但我还需要知道那里的雪将储存在哪里。
 这就是制定运输需求管理计划的原因。
 这些计划的目标是减少汽车出行次数，尤其是单人车辆。
 我们还确定了该计划需要考虑的其他一些领域或措施。
 您可能早些时候已经谈到过这一点。
 停车费与停车费是分开的吗？
 今晚我没有听到，但也许会有更多的讨论。
 我知道对于网站来说最好的选择是需要权衡的。
 您可以考虑向居民提供交通补贴或蓝色自行车订阅，作为一项 TDM 措施。
 你展示了蓝色的自行车站，所以照顾好它真是太好了。
 并且您应该考虑现场是否有汽车共享空间，例如汽车共享拉链车。
 那么项目提出的外部改进，我们稍微谈了一下公交候车区。
 MBTA 巴士站附近的现有停车位将进行重新配置和景观美化，如今晚向我们展示的那样，以及新的停车位、扩大 Amaranth 街和 Myrtle 街的通行权，或者更好的是街道和人行道停车位。
 因此，我们确定了一些其他的措施，只是为了考虑和改进。
 这些大多是外部地点。
 其中许多位于我提到的十字路口，存在操作或安全缺陷。
 第一个是Fellsway Riverside Avenue。
 因此，我提到，已识别出在服务级别 F 上运行的高崩溃集群的交叉点。此次交通安全审计确定了对策和安全对策的改进，包括交通信号优化、增强左转阶段和通行时间。
 所以这些事情是可以考虑的。
 Avenida Central 和 Rua Primavera 的事故发生率很高。
 可以考虑升级旧的信号设备并安装现有的行人标志。
 Fellsway、Central 和 Medford Street 在两个高峰时段再次在 F 级服务条件下运行，可以看到并提供信号定时优化。
 北行左转车道多次被堵塞，特别是在晚高峰期间，因此车辆在车道畅通之前无法进入该车道。
 是否有可能拓宽 Fells Way 北行左转车道？
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle Street 相连，因此 Fellsway 有一条长长的人行横道。
 我们知道，交通流量大，车速高，可以考虑使用矩形快闪灯，这是对行人的安全措施，也能提高驾驶员的安全意识。
 我们只是想评估提供中间间隔是否可行，无论是在红绿灯处还是向北左转处。
 我知道这样做有利有弊，但这样做是否有足够的好处来考虑这种改变？</p>

 أعتقد أن هذا التقاطع يستحق المزيد من الاهتمام.
 أعلم أنهم تحدثوا عن لورانس أيضًا.
 قد توجد امتدادات الرصيف الأخرى في الزاوية الجنوبية الغربية أو حتى تمتد التقاطع.
 أعتقد أن هذا مسار مهم للمشروع والمجتمع.
 هذه فرصة لتسهيل الحركة
 تقليل سرعة السيارة وتحسين تدفق المشاة والسلامة المحلية.
 وهناك عدد قليل من التعليقات.
 تقع محطة الحافلات الموجودة على طريق South Fells Way بالجوار وهي في حالة جيدة.
 هذا ملجأ قديم.
 أعتقد أننا يجب أن نفكر في ترقية محطة الحافلات هذه.
 نعم، من الضروري وضع خطة لإشارات الطريق.
 سيظهر التقدم المحرز في المشروع بوضوح أين سيدخل ويعود السكان والزوار وأفراد النقل إلى الموقع.
 الرصيف في أمهيرست، جنوب شارع ميرتل، في حالة سيئة.
 ولذلك، ينبغي اعتبار إصلاح هذا الطريق جزءا من المشروع.
 بالطبع، من الضروري إنشاء خطة لإدارة حركة المرور للمشروع لإظهار تأثيرها على المجتمع.
 ملاحظة أخيرة: نظرًا للتغيرات الطبيعية في التصميم، فإن إدراج DCR يتطلب الحصول على تصريح بناء.
 مطلوب إذن DCR للدخول والخروج من Fellsway.

 تأكد من أن هذا جانب مهم من المشروع.
 وأتساءل ما رأيك في هذا</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8116.863s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 ولذلك، سننظر في إنشاء تصميم للافتات التي ستوجه المقيمين والزوار، وكذلك وسائل النقل من وإلى الحدث.
 وبطبيعة الحال، سيعرف السكان المحليون كيفية الدخول والخروج.
 كما تعلمون، سوف نقدم للزوار العديد من الأماكن في الحديقة، لذلك يمكن أن يكون مزيجًا من أنواع مختلفة من العلامات، ويمكن أن يكون نصبًا تذكاريًا، أو يمكن أن يكون علامات أخرى، لكن كما تعلمون، سيوضح هذا معظم الطريق.
 قم بالإشارة إلى مواقع ومواقع وقوف السيارات بناءً على ظروف محددة.
 من أنت والمكان الذي تريد الذهاب إليه سيرشدك في هذه الرحلات الخارجية.
 أعتقد أن شارع فيلز سيكون المدخل الرئيسي، ولكن هذا العنوان يبدو وكأنه موقع جيد.
 إذا قام شخص ما بإدخال عنوان في Waze ولا يعرف الموقع، فسيتم نقله إلى شارع ميرتل، وهو على الأرجح ليس المكان الذي نريد الذهاب إليه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8194.189s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 لقد رأيت تعليق كريس في الدردشة لذا سأقوم بنشره.
 هل يعرف أحد ما هي النسبة المئوية لحركة المرور الواردة والصادرة التي سيستخدمها المرآب الجانبي لـ Amaranth؟
 أتفق مع المستشار في أن الوصول إلى الطريق يمثل مشكلة.
 لذلك أعتقد أنني أرى جزءًا من خطة إدارة الطلب على وسائل النقل.
 أعلم أن لدينا سكوت.
 لا أعرف إذا كانت تعكس آخر تحديث، فهي جزء مختلف من الفندق، ولكنها ذات مسارين.
 ولكن نعم، ربما يمكنك التحدث عن ذلك، سكوت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8236.272s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم بالتأكيد.
 شكرا سيدي الرئيس.
 سكوت ثورنتون وشريكته فانيسا.
 لذلك نحن نقدر أن حوالي 30، 30 إلى 40 بالمائة من حركة المرور سوف تستخدم مدخل شارع أمارانث، والفكرة وراء ذلك تعتمد فقط على مسافة وقوف السيارات من ذلك الموقع.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، قد يكون هناك بعض حركة المرور المطلوبة
 على سبيل المثال، في الغرب يمكنك زيارة مكان يؤدي إلى الطريق السريع 93.
 توفر بعض هذه المناطق إمكانية الوصول إلى الأماكن التي قد تكون أسهل اعتمادًا على الوقت من اليوم.
 يمكن الوصول إليه بسهولة وسرعة عبر أمارانث ومن ثم العودة إلى شارع سبرينج عبر شارع ميرتل أو شارع لورانس.
 لكن التقدير الأولي يتراوح بين 30 و40%.
 أعتقد أن هذا لا يزال ينطبق على الخطة الأخيرة المقدمة هنا الليلة.
 ولا نتوقع أي تغييرات جوهرية على هذا التوزيع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8322.547s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا
 شكرا لك
 كريس. هل لديك أي أسئلة أو مخاوف؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8333.162s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: هل يمكنني مواصلة ما قاله كريس؟
 لذا، كما تعلمون، بمجرد النظر إلى حركة المرور على الطريق، أعني أنني أفهم أن نسبة معينة من حركة المرور من المحتمل أن تترك العماريين وتتجه غربًا، لكن الاقتراب من الغرب يبدو مستحيلًا.
 يبدو أن كل حركة المرور تقريبًا ستبتعد عن Fellsway.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8361.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: نعم، أعني، كما تعلمون، أن التوزيع يعتمد حقًا على المكان الذي نعتقد أنه يتواجد فيه الأشخاص أو حيث تظهر بيانات التعداد الأشخاص الذين يعملون ويعيشون في تلك المنطقة.
 نقترح هنا مجموعة من نماذج السفر الموجودة.
 أوافق في بعض الأحيان
 إذا كان الناس من الغرب أو الجنوب، فمن الأكثر فعالية استخدام Fellsway.
 ولكن هذا ليس صحيحا في أي وقت من اليوم.
 هذه هي المشكلة التي يهدف هذا التوزيع إلى حلها.
 ولسوء الحظ، يتوافق هذا مع نموذج السمات المتوقع لدينا، والذي يمثل توزيع حركة المرور على مدار الفترة ذات الصلة بأكملها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8422.885s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 أندريه، هل لديك؟
 يرجى اتباع هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8437.957s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: ليس حقيقيًا.
 أعني
 مرة أخرى أقرب إلى مثل هذا المشروع.
 ما أعنيه بهذا هو أنه يبدو أن الطريقة الوحيدة للوصول إلى مدخل أمارانث هي السير في لورانس، وعبور أمارانث بليس والمبنى السكني، ثم الدخول إلى مشروع أمارانث، والذي يبدو دائريًا وشبه مستحيل للمبتدئين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8475.658s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أخرى؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8485.526s">[Unidentified]</a>: خايمي.
 فيما يتعلق بأعمال التقاطع، أعتقد أن سؤالي يتعلق بالاقتراح المقدم في النسخة التجريبية لتحسين إشارات المرور ومعابر المشاة.
 إلى أين يتجه هذا؟
 هل هذا شيء يمكنك أخذه إلى المدينة؟
 هل هذا ما نعمل مع المرشحين من حيث الحجم؟
 أوافق تماماً على أن كل هذه التقاطعات تحتاج إلى تحسين.
 أنا فقط لا أعرف كيفية إعداد هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8526.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: ما أفهمه هو أن الأمر يعتمد قليلاً على التقاطع.
 لذلك أعتقد
 يجوز لمقدم الطلب أن يعلن عن نيته إجراء بعض أو كل التحسينات على استجابته.
 في بعض الحالات، لا يلزم سوى الحصول على تصريح من المدينة.
 وفي حالات أخرى قد يأتي من حالة أكثر تعقيدًا قليلاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8553.604s">[Unidentified]</a>: نعم، أنا أعمل في Spring Street Center Crossing وهذه مشكلة مستمرة.
 بالنسبة للمشاة، يوجد في Haynes Plaza محطة دراجات زرقاء للمقيمين.
 إذا كانت هناك محطة دراجات زرقاء في الموقع، فيمكنك بالتأكيد الخروج من هناك.
 ولكن إذا كان هناك مشاة، إذا كان هناك الكثير من المشاة، فإن هذا التقاطع ذو صلة بالتأكيد.
 كما تعلمون، يسمونه نقص العبور وأشياء من هذا القبيل.
 حسنًا، هذا بالضبط ما لم أتوقعه، لكن هذه الدراسة تظهر ذلك بوضوح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8595.186s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا لك، خايمي.
 جيف، هل لديك أي تعليقات على هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، اعتمادًا على الطريقة التي تريد بها المدينة تحديد أولويات الطرق ضمن نطاق اختصاصها.
 لذا فالأمر مختلف قليلاً.
 من السهل التعامل مع التقاطع الذي تسيطر عليه المدينة بالكامل.
 كما تعلمون، منتصف والربيع، ولكنك تفهم.
 يؤثر تأخير العمل والازدحام أيضًا على السلامة.
 لكنني أعتقد أن المدن يجب أن تحدد أولوياتها بناءً على التحسينات التي تعتقد أنها معقولة وذات صلة بالمشروع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8662.117s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أنا التالي.
 لذا فأنا أتساءل حقًا عما إذا كانت حركة المرور في الاتجاهين عند مدخل شارع ميرتل منطقية.
 ولهذا السبب أسمع مخاوف الناس.
 يحتوي التكوين الحالي على حد أطول لأنه يعتبر حذرًا جدًا لتجنب هذه المشكلة.
 أفهم أنه يجب فتحه لاستخدام مخرج الطوارئ.
 لكن المعلومات المقدمة لا تخبرني بالضبط عن مدى تأثير ذلك على المجتمع.
 نعم يوجد توصيل.
 إذا كان مغلقًا في اتجاه واحد، فقد تضطر إلى العودة إلى ميرتل في اتجاه واحد.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هذا أمر معقول، وأنا أفهم اعتبارات التصميم، ولكن يبدو أن هناك خطرًا هنا وهو أنه بالنسبة لحركة المرور في الاتجاهين، فإن الأمر يشبه فتح حاجز، وهو خطوة إلى الوراء.
 حاول تقليل الازدحام المروري باستخدام Myrtle Street View.
 أريد أن أسمع رأيك في هذا، جيف.
 أتساءل عما إذا كان لديك الوقت لمراجعته بشكل كامل ومشاركة أفكارك وأفكارك حوله، أو إذا كنت بحاجة إلى التفكير فيه أكثر ولكنك تريد معرفة المزيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8778.533s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: ليس عليك أن تفكر على الإطلاق إذا كان الهدف هو الحد من عدد الرحلات على طريق ميرتل، فأنت تعرف ما إذا كنت تسير في اتجاه واحد أو تعرف ما إذا كنت تسير في اتجاه أو آخر.
 لذا، سيتعين عليك التفكير فيما ستكون عليه تلك الرحلات وإلى أين ستذهب، هل سينتهي بها الأمر في ميرتل أو كما تعلم، هل ستذهب إلى فيلسواي.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هذا سؤال جيد.
 كما تعلمون، ربما نحتاج إلى إعادة تقييم مجموعة سكوت-فارنيس والتفكير في هذا وذاك.
 أنت تعرف ما هي العواقب التي يمكن أن تكون لو كانت حركة المرور في اتجاه واحد بدلاً من اتجاهين.
 مرة أخرى، هذا موضوع جيد.
 أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى مناقشة وتقييم المزيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8834.447s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8841.325s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 جيف، لكني آسف إذا لم أتذكر ما حدث لك.
 كما تعلمون، هناك.
 ما أعنيه هو أنه عند تقاطع فيلسواي وميرتل لا توجد إشارات مرور أو أجهزة سلامة للمشاة بخلاف ممر للمشاة وطريق صغير.
 كما تعلمون، بالتأكيد يبدو الأمر كذلك.
 نعم، سيكون لدينا المزيد من السكان في هذه الزاوية.
 حسنًا، الشيء الأكثر أهمية هو أن هناك شيئًا ما عند هذا التقاطع.
 خفف السرعة بالنسبة للمشاة، أو على الأقل أعط إشارة للمشاة.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، لقد فكرت في الأمر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، تحدثت في إحدى الشرائح عن ضوء أمامي مستطيل.
 هذه علامة ضغط على الزر للمشاة.
 لذلك أعتقد أن التقاطع بحاجة إلى تحسين، خاصة وأن هناك مواقف للحافلات على الجانبين.
 عندما كنت هناك، رأيت الناس يخرجون من سياراتهم ويعبرون الشارع.
 لذا أعتقد أنه مصباح أمامي مستطيل بمستوى عنصر الضوء.
 علاوة على ذلك، ستكون إشارة مرور كاملة، كما هو الحال في المسار الرابع.
 لكنني أعتقد أن سلامة هذه السجادة تحتاج إلى تحسين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8959.722s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: شكرا لك
 آسف إذا فاتني ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8962.498s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، أشعر بالقلق أيضًا بشأن سلامة المشاة عند التقاطعات.
 من الجيد أن توجد محطات للحافلات على كلا الجانبين.
 لذا، إذا كان السكان المحليون يسافرون بالحافلة، فمن المرجح أن يتم نقلهم إلى الجانب الآخر من طريق فيلز.
 وشيء آخر: أعلم أن بعض العوامل يصعب تغييرها بشكل عام، وهذا صحيح.
 للاستعداد لرحلة اليوم، سيقود السكان المحليون طريق Fells Way ويعبرون المشروع ويعودون أدراجهم.
 سيكون الأمر سهلا
 قد أكون مخطئا، ولكن كل الدلائل تشير إلى أن هذه مشكلة محتملة.
 أريد أن أعرف ماذا أفعل هناك.
 أعلم أنك بحاجة إلى إذن ECR، لكن هذا لا يتعلق بي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9038.718s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: هل لدى المجلس أي أسئلة أو تعليقات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9048.76s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: أنا أتفق مع ما قلته، مايك.
 أعني أنني أتفهم مخاوف باترز بشأن زيادة حركة المرور على طريق ميرتل، ولكن أعتقد أن هذا كل شيء.
 إنه أكثر خطورة على الناس أن يدوروا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9067.528s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: في الواقع، أعتقد أن الطريقين منفصلان لأنه مما أفهمه، إذا اتجهت شمالًا، أعتقد أن الطريق الأكثر شيوعًا هو إذا خمنت أين يذهب الناس إلى العمل، فمن المحتمل أن يكون في مكان ما في وسط المدينة، وأعتقد أنك تعود دائمًا.
 أو سيكون عليك السير في الشارع.
 لذلك أعتقد أن ميرتل قد انتهت.
 قد يكون هذا علاجًا أكثر فعالية من مغادرة العقار.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه بالنسبة للكثير من الناس، إذا ذهبوا شمالًا، فإن العودة هي الخيار الأفضل، حتى لو كان في كلا الاتجاهين.
 روبرت باركهيرست (PB) - An An: حسنًا، لا أرى أي أعضاء آخرين في المجلس يرغبون في التحدث عن ذلك.
 روبرت باركهيرست، PB - اقرأ المزيد:
 : ثم
 أعتقد أنه من أجل السلامة يجب علينا إعادة فتح الرأي العام.
 أعلم أنه كانت لدينا تعليقات عامة حول حركة المرور من قبل، ولكننا ناقشنا أشياء جديدة أيضًا.
 أعتقد أن بعض الأشخاص هنا قد شاركوا وجهات نظرهم بشأن حركة المرور.
 لكن نعم، أريد التأكد من عدم حدوث ذلك.
 تجاهل الأشخاص الذين ينتظرون الحديث عن ذلك.
 ولذلك، فإن الرئيس ينتظر الالتماس للتعليق العام على تقييم الخبراء.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟

 لم أقل هذا من قبل لأنني لم أعتقد أبدًا أننا سننظر إلى تقاطعات إشارات التوقف وظروف حركة المرور الفعلية في المنطقة، بما في ذلك الدوران على شكل حرف U في سنترال، لورانس،
 هناك العديد من الطرق في منطقتنا.
 لا يمكن رفعها وخفضها إلا بطرق معينة.
 أليسون، المقيمة منذ فترة طويلة والتي قطعت آلاف الأميال في هذه الشوارع، عندما مررت بمنزلك، بدأت بالتلويح لك.
 الناس لا يتوقفون عند علامات التوقف.
 عندما أقف على هذه الخطوط المثلثة، وعندما أصعد إلى الحافلة، لا يتوقف الناس عند هذه الخطوط المثلثة.
 عندما تصل إلى المحطة، لا يتوقف الناس على طريق فيلس حتى تتمكن من عبور الطريق.
 توجد علامة توقف قريبة أو من المحزن بعض الشيء عدم وجود علامات للمشاة على أضواء الشوارع.
 يمكنك تجنب التعرض للاصطدام طالما لم ينعطف أحد إلى اليمين عند الإشارة الحمراء.
 أحب مناقشة سلامة المشاة لأن هذه الطرق صعبة جدًا على المشاة.
 ناهيك عن أن الشوارع ليست نظيفة للغاية، ولكن هذا هو مركز بيدفورد.</p>

 على حد علمي، سنتلقى قبل ذلك تعليقات من الخبراء المدنيين.
 يبدو أننا سنراكم، لكن ليس من الواضح مقدار الوقت المتبقي قبل الاجتماع.
 سيكون لدى المرشحين الوقت الكافي للتحقق، لكنهم قد لا يكونون مستعدين لتقديم إجابة كاملة.
 إذن هذا هو في المقام الأول رد المرشح على مراجعة النقل، والمراجعة المدنية، وربما مجرد معلومات عامة حول المشروع.
 لذا، أريد التحدث مع السيد نون.
 هل هذا يتوافق مع خطتك وفهمك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9760.153s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: أعتقد أنه عندما نفكر في الجمهور المستقبلي، فإننا نحاول تنظيمه.
 لتحديث الرسم البياني، تلقيت للتو التعليقات أدناه.
 حسنًا
 وحدد موعدًا لاجتماع مراجعة مع Bomber الأسبوع المقبل.
 أنا شخصياً لا أعرف ما إذا كان سيتم إصدار النسخة التجريبية في قسم الشحن بعد ظهر اليوم.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هذه الآراء منطقية.
 والآن أصبح هذا الأمر حاضرًا في أذهان الجميع، وعلينا أن نولي المزيد من الاهتمام لجلسة الاستماع يوم 20، وأعتقد أن يوم 23، السيد الرئيس يريد فقط التأكيد.
 إنها الساعة الثانية صباحًا يوم الثلاثاء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9810.864s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: الثلاثاء
 نعم، اليوم هو الثلاثاء الثالث والعشرون.
 لذلك كنت مخطئا.
 لذا نعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9818.083s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: أوه... لذا أعتقد أننا سنحاول في جلسة الاستماع هذه العثور على بعض الإجابات لمشاكل المرور. لا أريد أن أتحدث باسم سكوت. أعلم أنه يعمل على ذلك، وبصراحة، ليس لدينا وسيلة للتواصل... أين يعمل. أعتقد أننا تلقينا هذه التعليقات بعد ظهر يوم الجمعة الماضي، اه... لقد مرت بضعة أيام ومنذ العملية، لنرى ما إذا كان بإمكاني تقديم اقتراحات، اه...
 إذا وافق مجلس الإدارة، فسوف نستمر في العمل على بعض جداول الأعمال.
 أعتقد أن الفكرة هي الاستجابة لحركة المرور بطريقة ما والرد على التعليقات البناءة بطريقة ما.
 ومن دون تعليقات من المدنيين، من الصعب القول ما إذا كنا سنكون مستعدين يوم 23.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هدفنا هو الجمع بين النقل والهندسة المعمارية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9870.349s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، هذا يبدو معقولا بالنسبة لي.
 نعم، سنكون ممتنين لو قمتم باتخاذ الترتيبات اللازمة وتأكيد التوقيت.
 الشيء الرئيسي الذي آمل أن نتفق عليه هو أننا نحتاج حقًا إلى جميع الإجابات وجميع المعلومات الحديثة حول الخطة لإنجاز أي شيء بدءًا من اجتماع 9 مايو.
 من الممكن تمامًا إبقاءه مغلقًا في 21 مايو.
 لذلك، كما تعلم، إذا بدا عند مناقشة الجدولة والاتصال بنا أننا في موقف لا يمكننا فيه تقديم كل شيء كما هو مطلوب.
 إنني أتطلع صراحةً إلى تمديد قصير إلى ما بعد 21 مايو إذا أردتم، ولكن في الوقت الحالي أريد فقط أن أخبركم أننا بحاجة إلى اجتماع 21 مايو
 كل شيء جاهز ونحن نتحدث فقط عن الضبطيات والطلبات في 9 مايو.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9955.037s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: نعم، أنا أفهم.
 أعتقد أنه نظرًا لأن قسمين من الأقسام الثلاثة يخضعان لمراجعة النظراء، فإذا تمكنا من أن نصبح متحضرين في أسرع وقت ممكن، فسيعمل موظفونا بجد لضمان حصولنا على إجابات ويمكننا تقديم تعليقات في جلسات الاستماع المستقبلية للرد على التعليقات والأسئلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9973.271s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: مثالي.
 مثالي.
 تبدو جيدة.
 شكرا لك
 كان هذا كل ما عندي من وسائل النقل.
 لذلك على الأقل يمكننا الوصول إلى بعض الأجندة التنفيذية.
 في الواقع، قبل أن نفعل ذلك، علينا أن نمضي قدمًا.
 ولذلك ينتظر الرئيس الالتماس لمواصلة حل هذه القضية حتى الساعة 18:30 الثلاثاء 23 أبريل.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10012.029s">[Unidentified]</a>: الاثنين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10013.09s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، دعونا نتصل
 جيمي؟
 هذا صحيح.
 جيم؟
 هذا صحيح.
 ايفرت؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10021.333s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10022.487s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: أندرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 مايكرو؟
 نعم حسنا.
 حسنًا ، يستمر الموضوع.
 شكرا لك يا صديقي.
 شكرا على التحديثات وردود الفعل.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 دينيس، هل يمكنك الانتقال إلى البند التالي من جدول الأعمال؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10041.06s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 آسف
 عندما قمت بإعادة تشغيل جهاز الكمبيوتر كان علي أن أفعل الكثير من الأشياء التي لم تكن تعمل، ولاحظت أن كل ما كان من قبل لم يكن يعمل.
 لكن لدينا تحديثات إدارية، لذا أعتقد أنه نظرًا لوجود الجميع هنا، نريد فقط مناقشة موعد آخر للاجتماع؟
 الرسالة التي أرسلتها في وقت سابق؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10068.429s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم بالتأكيد.
 ثم تلقيت عدة إجابات.
 لذلك لا علاقة له بالواقع، وإلا فسوف تسمع
 وسيحدد المجلس جلسة خاصة أخرى.
 ثم، في 3 أبريل، تلقى المجلس طلبًا وطلبًا لعقد جلسة استماع في شارع ميستيك.
 40B، عاد HAC إلى اللوحة.
 ولهذا السبب نحتاج إلى جمهور جديد كل 30 يومًا.
 في بعض الأحيان نحتاج إلى هذا بسبب متطلبات الإخطار.
 عادةً ما يكون الأسبوع الذي يبدأ في 29 أبريل.
 لذا، قمت بالتحقق من التواريخ بناءً على نصيحة كلا المرشحين: 30 أبريل و2 مايو.
 سيكون هذا اجتماعًا قصيرًا ولن نأخذ أدلة.
 دعنا نمر ببعض الخطوات الإجرائية ونمضي قدمًا.
 قد نطلب من المرشحين تقديم أنفسهم.
 لكني تلقيت ردًا ويبدو أنه كان بين اليوم الرابع والثلاثين.
 لذلك، من الرابع إلى الثلاثين سيكون موعدًا لهذا الاجتماع الخاص.
 البند الوحيد على جدول الأعمال سيكون هو الحال.
 وكما قلت من قبل، سيكون هذا اجتماعا إجرائيا.
 ولذلك، يجب على مجلس المدينة النظر في السماح للمدينة بتعيين مستشار نظير.
 ما أعنيه هو أن الحديث عن 40 مليار استشاري وتحديد موعد لحل هذه المشكلة سيعطي الوقت لتوظيف هؤلاء الاستشاريين.
 لذا نعم.
 أقدر أنه يمكننا القيام بذلك في 30 دقيقة أو أقل.
 لم يتم الوعد بأي شيء، لكن الموعد هو الثلاثاء 30 أبريل الساعة 6:30 مساءً.
 يبدو عظيما، دينيس؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10229.028s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: غدا سأنشر إعلانا في الجريدة.
 قصة عظيمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10233.509s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: شكرا، كل شيء على ما يرام.
 تحديث إداري آخر؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10245.316s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: أعتقد أنه لم يبق لي شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10252.28s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 إذن ما هو جدول الأعمال التالي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10262.405s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: لقد مرت للتو الدقائق التي أعتقد أنني أرسلتها.
 هذا صحيح.
 محتويات مجلد المسودات في Google Drive.
 لأن لدي لهم.
 وهذا هو بالضبط النهج الذي قررت اتباعه هذه المرة.
 يتضمن المحضر الحالي محضري الاجتماعين بتاريخ 24/01/11 و 15/02/24.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10284.275s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: نعم، هذا يتوافق مع فهمي.
 لذلك أتيحت لي الفرصة للتحقق منها.
 هل أتيحت الفرصة لأي شخص لمراجعة محضر اجتماع 40ب يومي 11 يناير و15 فبراير؟
 لقد وجدت البروتوكولات جيدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10307.441s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: لا أريد أن أكون الوحيد الذي ينهض من الكرسي ويمضي قدمًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10319.967s">[Unidentified]</a>: طلب الموافقة على محضر اجتماع 14 يناير، رفض محضر اجتماع 20 يناير.
 أنا آسف حقا.
 11 يناير و 15 فبراير.
 برجاء الموافقة على محضر اجتماعى 11 يناير و15 فبراير.
 هل لدي واحدة ثانية؟
 الاثنين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10342.394s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: حسنا، دعونا نتصل

 هذا صحيح.

 من الجيد جدًا أن تمر كل دقيقة.
 شكرا راشيل ودينيس.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 أعتقد أن هذه هي نهاية جدول أعمالنا، أليس كذلك؟
 بالضبط.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 ينتظر الرئيس اقتراحًا بإنهاء الاجتماع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10379.262s">[Unidentified]</a>: يرجى إنهاء الاجتماع.</p>
