 各位，如果你们不熟悉全面的许可流程，我想这在过去五个月里已经举行了多次听证会。
 我们曾经
 了解与此案例相关的各种主题。
 今天下午的中心议程是土木工程以及交通研究同行评审。
 是的，这就是今天的目的。
 我们将接受公众对这些事项的意见。
 我看到帕特·努恩先生是我们的候选人。
 那么请继续吧。
 欢迎。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=180.897s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 嘿伙计们。
 谢谢主席先生、董事会成员。
 是的，所以我们在这里。
 我们将专门介绍并提供有关我们的土木项目的最新信息。
 我们的团队成员都在这里。
 我会问史蒂夫·马约拉诺是否可以。
 共享屏幕，今晚它将成为幻灯片母版。
 首先，我将简单地更新自上次听证会以来的情况，并为史蒂夫和他的团队接手做好准备。
 谢谢。
 那么，让我们开始，对自几周前举行的上次听证会以来我们所处的情况进行一些更新。
 在同行评审方面，我们在几个方面取得了进展。
 主席先生，正如您提到的交通问题，上周我们收到了贝达关于交通影响分析的意见，我们正在审查和吸收这些意见，并准备正式答复。
 今晚我们有斯科特·桑顿的电话。
 对这些评论的回应不是本正式演示的一部分。
 但我看到测试团队成员都在这里，可以直接发表评论。
 但我们已经收到了它们，正在对其进行审查，一旦我们有机会充分消化它们，我们将与该团队组织一次后续同行评审会议，以进行讨论。
 在建筑方面，我们收到了 Cliff 的反馈。
 戴维斯广场建筑师事务所 (Davis Square Architects) 的克里夫·鲍默 (Cliff Bowmer) 评论。
 我们感谢您的评论，并正在对其进行审核并准备回复。
 我们正在与 Cliff 协调下周的后续同行评审会议。
 我们将准备阅读您的评论并继续
 在下一次听证会之前将它们合并并使用它，我们可以再次审查和展示架构。
 因此，从平民的角度来看，我们得到
 来自继续工作的 BEDA 的说明。
 我们尚未正式收到您的反馈，因此今晚并不代表同行评审反馈。
 此时当我们收到反馈时，会根据反馈的程度以及是否需要进行调整或解决
 一旦我们有了它们，我们肯定会这样做，我不会再代表正在通话的测试团队发言，但从我们的角度来看，这就是我们现在坐的地方，期待今晚的演示。
 我认为这个演讲会回答很多问题。
 我们尝试对其进行调整，以重点关注之前听证会中讨论过的事情、之前提出过的问题，试图提供尽可能多的澄清。
 这样，如果您想转到下一张幻灯片，史蒂夫，我会为您做的。
 我稍后会将其转交给您，最后附上我团队的帮助信息。
 古尔斯顿的彼得·谭先生今晚不在这里。
 团队成员帕特里克·加拉格尔（Patrick Gallagher）也来自古尔斯顿，目前不在场。
 他将在稍后的听证会上参加传票。
 所以如果有任何疑问的话
 这是特定于法律方面的事情，而他不在场，我可以推迟到他到场为止。
 今晚他会晚一点到达。
 我只想向听证会后期联系我或法律团队的任何人指出这一点。
 话虽这么说，史蒂夫，如果你想开始演示，那就太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=455.983s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  Great.
 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

 大家晚安。
 那么，这就是景观的概述。
 其中大部分内容与我想你们大多数人都见过的之前听证会上的内容相似。
 正如史蒂夫提到的，我们当前的网站是
 完全不透水，我们正在大幅增加透水区域和开放空间，其中大部分将可供公众进入和使用，包括
 走廊和大楼旁边的儿童游乐场。
 正如您所看到的，第一位是访客进入送货区域。
 二是游乐场。
 第三个是人造草狗公园。
 它们都被拟议的树木和额外的植物所包围，这将增加美学价值，并提高场地的雨水容量，并为社区创造更好的开放空间体验。
 第四是自行车架，位于自行车存放处旁边，为自行车提供额外的停车空间。
 在 5 号处，沿着蜿蜒的走道，有一些健身器材，一直延伸到 8 号，这是未来的，有可能连接未来的铁路线。
 第六条是在建筑物西侧提供景观绿地的走道，以保护地面停车场，并在建筑物降低时与社区更好地融合，然后我们用拟议的景观和树木以及更多的灌木和多年生植物创造出更柔和的边缘。
 呃，呃，除了史蒂夫呃呃，呃，提议的人行道之外，它还创建了一条额外的路径，呃，我们正在向阿玛兰特添加额外的人行道，可以用于呃，步行和骑自行车，并且将来可能成为这个，呃，自行车网络的一部分，可以将社区连接到该铁路线。
 10号是我们希望在进一步协调后可能包括一个蓝色自行车站的地方，这似乎是对公交车站旁边的这个区域的一个很好的补充，并提高了该区域的交通能力。
 而且你还可以看到庭院。
 我们有两个具有不同功能的露台，毗邻内部服务区。
 我们在二楼有一个游泳池，还有绿地和户外活动供居民使用。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 这是照明计划和我们的照明策略的概述，它将利用不同灯具的组合，包括墙壁装置、行人灯柱、停车场和护柱的较大灯柱。
 我们与照明设计合作，确保所有灯具均兼容 LED 和 Dark Sky，并避免对邻近区域产生影响，同时还为所有室外空间提供所需的适当光照水平，以保证建筑物周围停车人员的安全性和可达性。
 这些只是对概述中显示的便利设施、户外空间和开放空间功能的更详细了解，以及一些额外的先前图像和灵感图像，让您了解这个空间在以下方面的外观：
 它会是什么样子，它会如何工作，以及在这种潜力中将使用的材料。
 前广场将是开放的，可能会更轻，有鹅卵石和额外的植物，这将使建筑具有令人愉悦和欢迎的外观。
 下一张幻灯片。
 这与游乐场的外观非常相似，增加了合适的围栏，可能还有额外的座位和可供居民和邻居使用的小型游乐设备。
 如您所见，狗公园排名第三。
 我们特意将狗公园移离街道，并在其周围种植了更多的树木，以过滤可能产生的任何额外噪音。
 利用狗公园生产，也方便居民每天使用。
 其中一些带有健身器材和自行车架的图像，这些器材和自行车架将沿着通往建筑物西侧的走道布置。
 以及它能为人们使用它提供什么。
 下一张。
 这些人物照片展示了景观美化和人行道的外观，为人们提供跑步、骑自行车的空间，并在建筑物上添加了绿屏，并保护人行道免受街道、停放的汽车和建筑物外墙的影响。
 一些鼓舞人心的庭院图片以及其中供居民使用的便利设施。
 这就是我提到的蓝色自行车站。
 有反对的余地。
 我们认为这将是一个合适的位置，但显然，当您使用蓝色自行车时，您必须更仔细地考虑，以将该站点放置在人们访问和使用它的最佳位置。
 我想这是最后一张幻灯片了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2419.579s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，这是我们的最后一张幻灯片。
 是的，蓝色自行车，只是为了给您一些背景信息，说明为什么我们在那里选择蓝色自行车，很多时候他们希望将其放在私人财产上，但靠近公共人行道的一个非常明显的位置，以便人们知道它在那里。
 所以我们选择了这个位置，但显然那个角落的景观有一定的灵活性。
 蓝色自行车的想法不同。
 我们会为他找到一个新家，但这很有意义。
 就在公交车站。
 人们可以骑一辆蓝色自行车到公共汽车，然后把它停在那里然后上公共汽车，或者他们可以乘坐公共汽车然后下车，骑上蓝色自行车然后去他们的……
 离你家更近一点。
 所以这是一个好地方。
 我们认为这是对该项目的一个很好的补充。
 我们的演讲到此结束。
 帕特，我不知道你是否有任何最后的笔记或想要结束。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2470.844s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，不具体，我只能完成一点，关闭蓝色自行车我也特意想到了。我与蓝队的一些人进行了初步交谈，只是想了解他们。
 您对该地点可行性的看法。
 总的来说，他们都认为这是一个很好的位置，不仅在规模上，而且在靠近他们认为合适的其他车站的位置上。
 因此，我们正在提议，并且肯定会愿意与城市和 Bluebikes 进行添加和协调，以在那里添加一个站点。
 但以总体演示结束时，
 我知道我们会有点波动，所以我想我们会在结束时为大家提供指导。
 这是我们在土木工程项目中正在进行的一些土木工作的一个小总结，仅此而已。
 简而言之，就是场地规划、景观美化、公共服务、停车场以及你看到的许多东西都协调一致。
 所以为了向大家确认，这不是随机收集的东西。
 我们试图回答问题，并提供更多关于鲍勒在民事诉讼中向市政府提出的内容以及正在接受同行评审的更多细节。
 通过测试版。
 因此，正如史蒂夫之前提到的，这里有一些事情我们很乐意重新审视、解决或扩展。
 我们不希望任何人觉得如果演示中存在问题，一如既往，我们希望确保能够回答这些问题，但我们也有机会获得
 同行评审和后续团队的回应也是如此。
 所以我只是想让演讲圆满结束。
 因此，希望每个人都不会感到忙碌，但只是想确保我们涵盖了我们认为需要的所有主题。
 所以我将结束并开放提问。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2612.827s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，所以我的想法是我们将很快进入测试阶段。
 我知道同行评审意见还没有准备好，但我只是想了解一般想法以及我们何时应该预见到它们的预期，然后我们将向董事会提出问题。
 我看到我们有来自测试组的杰夫。
 请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2639.459s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 是的，主席先生、董事会成员们晚上好。
 那么让我告诉你今晚我有什么。
 所以我有这个。
 PowerPoint 演示文稿，我可以总结我们在信中提供的交通评论。
 然后我可以给你看。
 我有一些来自我们的土木工程师 Bill McGrath 的评论。
 我正在审查这个项目，他这周正在休假，但我有一个给他的电子邮件列表。
 我签名作为演示文稿。
 如果您愿意，我可以阅读该列表，但如果您有详细的问题，我无法回答。
 这是我的经验，但如果您愿意，我可以阅读您的初步评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2690.178s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的，那么，看起来 Bill 还在处理评论吗？或者评论列表是您还没有评论的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2700.087s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 好吧，我不想替他说话。
 我想说这是他们的初步名单。
 这可能还不是确定的，但我们正在努力。
 我想说，可能下周当我度假回来时，我可能会将它们包裹在求职信中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2716.223s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，看起来不错。
 因此，我们计划在下次听证会上更详细地审查它们。
 这也将为提问者提供一些时间来接收反馈并开始做出回应。
 听起来像是一个计划。
 是的，杰夫，我稍后会回复您有关交通的问题。
 首先，我会到白板前询问有关演示的问题。
 看起来不错？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2745.784s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 是的，谢谢。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2747.785s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 董事会的问题和评论现在开始。
 杰米，继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2762.478s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的，我认为这是一个很棒的演示。
 我很欣赏整体的照明景观以及黑暗天空的顺应性。
 我认为它对于我们想要涵盖的要求和元素来说非常全面。
 当你谈论建筑物入口的焦点和作为默特尔街入口点的正面时，我有一个问题。
 我想我唯一关心的是从地址的角度来看：这座建筑是否会被称为 970 Fellsway，而不参考默特尔街地址，只是出于对谷歌地图、苹果地图的考虑，不知道该地区的人会被带到 Fellsway 入口而不是默特尔街入口？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2809.941s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，我可以回答。
 如果需要，该房产将被细分，并且住宅房产不会有 Fellsway 临街面，因此不会有 Fellsway 地址。
 970 很可能仍将是存储地址。
 如今，一切都在包装中，这就是它被称为 970 的原因。
 但现有建筑将保留该地址。
 新大楼将有一个地址，它只能在穆尔塔或阿马兰托有一个地址。
 默特尔似乎就是我们现在获得的提名。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2849.895s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 这是一场灾难。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2855.676s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 董事会还有其他问题和意见吗？
 安德烈，请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2866.31s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 感谢您的介绍。
 超级有用的信息。
 只是几个问题。
 一是，我知道不久前有一些关于设施、景观的公众评论，我想知道是否与邻居就这些功能（尤其是游乐场）进行过任何对话。
 我也很好奇您是否有任何关于融入公共艺术或历史信息或服务或类似内容的概念性想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2908.533s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我可以跳。
 从第一个问题开始，我会见了一些邻居，就这个项目进行了广泛的讨论。
 问题之一就是室外空间的安排，一般来说，我遇到的一些邻居都是随叫随到的。
 我不想歪曲所说的任何内容，但总的来说，我收到的评论都是户外游戏，户外健身器材不一定会让一些邻居感到兴奋。
 他们不一定想象自己会使用它。
 我们进行的对话是，我们希望对户外空间进行规划，为社区带来好处，如果他们有什么想看的东西，我们愿意接受他们的反馈。
 但总的来说，这是我迄今为止收到的答复。
 关于公共艺术，
 这个问题的答案是肯定的，就看我们是否有能力考虑。
 我们没有具体的
 心中有一个具体的想法。
 我认为我们从上一次专注于架构的听证会得出的结论是，可以说，我们将在本次同行评审的框架下继续考虑这一问题。
 我不想认输，但我认为随着即将到来的戴维斯广场建筑师和建筑外观的同行评审会议，并将景观元素纳入当前对话的焦点。
 这是我们正在尝试多思考的事情。
 我不知道最终我们是否能够保证我们将为公共艺术提供一个非常规范的设计。
 这有点待定，但一般来说，要回答这个问题，是的，我们当然愿意将其作为网站的一部分合并到网站的不同区域。
 如果市议会或社区成员对做什么或在哪里做有建议，我们很乐意听到反馈。
 坦率地说，这对我们推进建筑规划及其实际外观很有帮助。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3071.088s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 我看到亨特主任举起了手。
 我只想先和安德烈谈谈。
 安德烈，你还想问其他问题吗？或者这回答了你的问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3082.759s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的，在这些问题上没问题。
 我可能还发表了一些评论，但我很高兴艾丽西亚插话。
 亨特主任，请进。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3090.006s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 谢谢。
 事实上，我只是想提出，抱歉，你提到的后续行动，因为
 我的印象是，我想知道你是否认为这是真的，与你交谈的邻居都是默特尔街地址的邻居，所以他们都是房子和院子。
 您是否曾与 Amaranth Place 的居民交谈过或听说过，这些居民都是公寓，他们似乎没有与之相关的开放庭院？
 因为那就是那里
 办公室认为一些开放空间对这些公寓的附近有好处。
 我只是想澄清这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3128.948s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 不，这是一个很好的问题。
 我没有遇到 Amaranth Place 公寓的任何居民。
 因此，我所代表的言论并非来自他们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3139.158s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 出色的。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3141.518s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢你，安德烈。
 回到你身边。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3143.899s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的，这是一个很好的观点。
 爱丽丝.
 感谢您提到这一点。
 哦。
 只是关于流通方面的一些评论或问题。
 嗯，1就是在之间的那种直线。
 拟议的项目和存储设施，看起来马上就很长了。
 我想知道他们是否正在考虑一些障碍或其他类型的缓解措施。
 我也很好奇你能否多解释一下。
 搬家卡车将在哪里、如何进入并前往车库，他们会在哪里进行？
 人们会把家具等搬到哪里？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3191.623s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 当然，我会再次共享屏幕，以便我们可以看到一些图形。
 是的，直线是一条长直线。
 好处是把车停在前面可以平息交通，对吗？
 它看起来不会像一条鼓励高速行驶的城市街道。
 我们没有减速带或
 现在提出的任何立交桥或类似的项目，我并不是说我们做不到，但它们通常是一个维护问题，并且带来了一系列不同的挑战。
 但我们肯定会仔细看看。
 我们故意在入口处以 90 度角这样做。
 所以人们必须来并成为那样。
 所以它不像快车道。
 显然在另一端也有一个 90 度角。
 因此，人们在停下来转向90度之前，有一定的时间保持直线。
 所以我认为这是一个合理的距离，但绝对是看得更远一点的好点。
 关于装载，正如我们所看到的，我们对消防车进行了研究，以便云梯车可以在整个建筑物内行驶。
 搬家卡车经常用于此类项目。
 想想超大的 U-Haul，它比客车小一点，但它不一定是 U-Haul。
 但这种单箱卡车，
 这比消防车好一点。
 因此，我们展示移动消防车的任何地方，移动消防车都可以去，但它们实际上会在建筑物的后面。
 所以他们正试图到达后面的壁架，这样他们就可以越过阿玛兰斯并爬上这里的壁架。
 他们可以
 如果允许，他们可以穿过 Fellsway 并从建筑物的这一侧进入。
 装载操作就在这扇门后面进行。
 那里有货物和电梯。
 所以装货作业实际上是沿着这条路边线进行的，路边没有停车位
 位于建筑物的街道一侧，这样他们就可以把车停在路边，卸货，从后门进去，乘电梯到他们的楼层。
 卡车不得进入车库。
 进入车库将有货车可通行的高度，因此将设有货车可通行的停车场。
 因此，如果您有一辆较小的搬运车，它可以进入车库，但不能作为箱式卡车。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3362.226s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 我只是想评价一下。
 你说他们可以停在人行道上。
 这是人行道，对吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3368.909s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 那里有一条人行道界定建筑物的边缘。
 所以有一条人行道，然后人行道将被抬高，这样他们就可以把车停在与人行道相邻的路边。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3383.955s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 一切都好。
 董事会还有其他问题吗？
 金，你沉默了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3406.901s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: 至于自行车，我们家可以存放多少辆自行车？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3419.029s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 我可以跳。
 作为正在进行的架构设计的一部分，这是我们从审阅者 Bomer 先生那里收到的评论之一。
 我们正在最终确定场地平面图上该房间的大小，底层平面图仍然保留。
 我们现在正在努力确定该房间的面积，然后整合概念设计。
 我们专注于尽可能多的自行车，并研究不同规格的自行车架和机架安装座，无论是落地式还是壁挂式，试图最大限度地提高该空间的效率。
 因此，我在数量方面没有具体的答案，但就房间的平方英尺而言，我们现在正在努力改进该尺寸，并且应该能够在建筑评论后的下一次演示中至少提供一个大概的数字。
 谢谢。
 抱歉，这适用于大楼自行车室内的自行车。
 我们展示了房间外面的地方，外面设置了架子，也可以存放自行车。
 我认为我们也可以为此指定一个金额。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3500.71s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3509.002s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 好吧，我可以继续关于自行车停放的评论吗？
 在我们研究的上一个 40B 项目中，我们经常处理的一件事是自行车停放。
 因此，鉴于电动滑板车和自行车比以往任何时候都更加常见，在考虑设计自行车架时，
 嗯，你知道，偶尔会发生火灾，这些问题很难用这些东西扑灭。
 所以我只想考虑到这一点，确保它是一个防火位置。
 嗯，地区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3548.73s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 请注意，我们的自行车储藏室位于底层，它将位于讲台的高度，这是一个不可燃的建筑。
 显然，当项目进入设计文档、构造文档的级别，然后将其发送出去进行代码审查时，我们可以进入这些内容。
 但最好确保我们将其视为比赛场地。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3579.455s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: 吉姆？
 是的，关于同一主题，我知道许多地方由于火灾危险而不允许在单位内使用电动自行车。
 是否正在考虑这一点？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3601.675s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 这是一个好问题。
 直到今天，我们还没有进行过这样的谈话。
 我们征求了多个物业管理团队以及戴维斯公司内部资产管理团队的意见。
 这不是一个出现的话题，所以我对这个问题没有具体的答案。
 我们当然可以与物业管理团队进行调查和协调，并且与其他事情一起，
 将为建筑物的居民提供详细信息以及他们在执行租约时签署的规则和条例。
 我们当然可以进一步研究这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3640.824s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3647.971s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 事实上，与此相关，以至于我不记得了。
 我想在之前的一篇文章中可能已经提到过。
 公共的，但是这个框架在住宅部分是由木头制成的还是由其他材料制成的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3666.182s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是真的。
 因此，这座建筑最初的样子和当前的项目
 这是一个讲台建筑。
 当前的这个配置显然已经达到了顶级的程度。
 有五上一和四上一的构造元素。
 不止一个是你的不可燃水平，无论是钢还是混凝土还没有正式定义，但在该不可燃水平之上将是一个木框架。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3702.173s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我明白。
 我问的原因是，
 我们在之前的 40B 听证会上花了这么多时间讨论这个问题的原因之一是，这是一个类似的建筑，而且我们当时的建筑专员对沃尔瑟姆大火（在本例中是建筑火灾）有直接的经验。
 但基本上这种类型的建筑都是建的
 在某些情况下发生火灾的风险很高。
 因此，在查看其他群体时请记住这一点。
 我认为方向，尤其是类似类型的建筑物，可能是这里使用的最佳实践。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3745.348s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，理解并且观点很好。
 在完成设计方面，这将完全符合代码要求，并且显然会经过审查过程。
 然后在施工过程中，施工经理将与梅德福消防局合作，制定 NFPA 241 计划，并遵守与其相关的所有规则和规定。
 我们充分考虑了木框架的建筑类型以及与之相关的风险。
 好吧，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3787.53s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？
 安德烈，继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3795.043s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 您能否更详细地解释一下您所谈论的电动汽车充电基础设施？
 因为看起来并不多。
 我的意思是，我们正在谈论未来五到十年电动汽车的快速转型。
 显然，最大的障碍之一是充电站的可用性。
 如果您能向我们多解释一下，那就太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3822.498s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，帕特，你想让我这么做吗？
 我会告诉你他们在哪里。
 我将把图像带回到屏幕上以显示我们开始的内容。
 然后我们将讨论大楼中的机会。
 所以这里只是放大一点。
 同样，这里有 14 个空间，其中两个是传统空间，然后是两个无障碍空间。
 由于稍后很难返回并在建筑物外部安装基础设施、管道、获取电力并设置站点，因此我们希望从第一天起就将所有这些都投入使用，以便基础设施到位并准备就绪。
 扩展选项确实可以进入车库，但我们只是没有它
 只要我们提前计划并安装适当的电气基础设施，将其放置在车库内相对容易，对吧？
 变压器、配电盘等等。
 我们需要做好准备，在未来增强这种力量。
 我们需要提前计划并实施这一计划。
 当我们进入工单设计阶段时，我们将与电力公司协调进行这项工作。
 但是，一旦拥有了这一重要的基础设施，在车库内添加设备就相对容易了，因为您可以在车库屋顶上安装管道。
 并在需要的地方运行它并随时添加电台。
 这就是我们处理该网站的方式，从第一天起就找出最困难的事情，然后提供这种灵活性。
 正如 Anjanita 所说，它正在迅速扩张。
 我们不知道几年后会有什么需求，但是添加起来很容易。
 帕特，我不知道你对这座建筑还有什么要补充的吗？
 这是我对电动汽车扩张机会的看法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我认为你击中要害了。
 我们的思考过程是将电动汽车充电器作为建筑结构的一部分沿着建筑物的外部安装。
 我们从理事会成员和其他出席上述听证会的人那里得知，他们只是想看到电动汽车充电器位于大楼外。
 因此，我们认为，在现场进行这项工作是我们可以与未来的扩张相协调的事情，有能力做到这一点，并灵活地调整电力基础设施的规模，但能够在裙楼层、不可燃建筑层，一直到车库层，能够安装屋顶管道和添加电动汽车充电站。
 坦率地说，戴维斯公司在其他项目中已经取得了成功，能够根据需要或随着需求的增长进行添加。
 这实际上是协调您的电力基础设施的问题。
 所以，你知道，重申史蒂夫所说的话，但直接从我那里听到的，这只是我们设计该场地并从概念上思考它的一部分，为什么你会看到它们位于场地外并随着建筑物的未来增长而变化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的，我只想说，我的意思是，我很高兴你正在考虑内部扩张。
 我只是认为对于这么多的停车位，即使在第一天，给电动汽车充电就足够了。
 我肯定会建议更多。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 这是我们绝对可以研究的事情。
 我没有具体的答案可以量化，但我们注意到了您的建议，并且绝对可以考虑一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4075.973s">[Unidentified]</a>: 谢谢。
 作为后续行动，这些是快速充电站还是您希望有人停车并过夜充电的地方？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 这是一个好问题。
 我认为有几个层次。
 这一切都取决于与电力基础设施的一点协调，您可以获得多少电力，以及需要多大的盒子才能提供所需的电力类型。
 我可以说，我认为快速充电站确实超越了它们本来的样子。
 对于像这样的建筑来说，从大尺寸的意义上来说，这将被认为是典型的，甚至是非典型的。
 我没有具体的答案。
 我认为我们希望使它们尽可能高效，但一旦我们能够与电气工程师实际量化并与公用事业提供商合作确认可以到达该站点的电量，我们就需要稍后确定充电站的具体规格。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 补充一点，通常在这种类型的开发中，我们只使用传统的充电器，因为居民预计会回家并停车过夜。
 因此，夜间费率不会成为开展典型业务的障碍。
 如果这是更短期的轮换，那么此时您确实需要更快的充电。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4170.979s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 好的。
 但是，如果这 14 个空间在夜间由同样 14 个人使用，并且您有超过 300 个空间需要检查，那么您将一直使用它们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4186.36s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的，这就是我的意思。
 这就是我的想法。
 这些空间是为拥有电动汽车的人准备的吗？或者，你知道，在安德烈看来，如果它们不是专用的并且充电速度更快，我们是否可以将租户分配给这些空间，用它们来充电，然后移动汽车并提供给其他人？
 说出来，显然只是一个想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，这是我们必须协调的事情。
 我们需要通过物业管理团队进行协调。
 我认为在你所说的条件下，当我们最终确定数量时，如果立即确定需要更多，我认为我们对轻松添加更多的能力感到满意。
 因此，如果居民因为工作繁忙而无法给车辆充电，我们将能够协调未来增加充电站。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，我在这篇文章中要提到的一件事是，这是一个寒冷的气候环境。
 这就是为什么我认为电动汽车至少需要一些内部空间。
 所以理解是添加起来比较容易。
 事后看来，在基础设施安装方面预先规划是必要的。
 因此，对于我们未来的观众来说，了解计划是什么是有好处的，例如，他们正在考虑做什么，可以扩展多少，以及他们是否会有一些，例如，你今天知道他们会有一些专用空间吗？
 也在停车场内，还是按照目前的安排，所有东西都在外面？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4304.051s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 此时，外观就是建议安装的了。
 正如我几分钟前所说，我们可以理解，反馈是为了让我们探索有多少职位空缺，如果我们目前提出的建议似乎不够，我们将对此进行一些研究，然后我们可以对我们认为正确的数字做出回应。
 以及是否包括更多的内部或更多的外部。
 所以我们当然可以扩展这个想法。
 好的，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4340.081s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？
 我已经被问到但还没有被问到的一个问题是：
 校车停靠站的可能位置。
 所以我不知道今天最近的公交车站在哪里，但我知道它目前处于工业用途，并且可能会有几个家庭住在新大楼里。
 那么，是的，校车会在这个包裹附近停在哪里？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4387.755s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 就我个人而言，我没有看过校车车站或路线。
 我不知道他们是否沿着默特尔街走，也不知道最近的路线是什么，但我们绝对可以和交通团队一起看一下，找出那个位置在哪里。
 我认为默特尔扩张提供了一些我们尚未探索过的新机会，但我们很乐意看看。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4413.771s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4417.797s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4419.959s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 我有一个问题和评论。
 是伊薇特。
 关于剩余的存储单元，如果您检查后丢失了，我深表歉意，我暂时遇到了一些网络问题。
 这座建筑是否需要进行任何改进？
 我知道我们正在谈论公共警卫，当然也许那可能是一个地方，但他们毗邻一个巨大的工业园区。
 那么这个领域正在发生什么来帮助改进......？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4459.498s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 一般来说？
 这是一个很好的问题。
 我们不碰它。
 肯定会有改进这个空间的想法。
 也许为你打破思维过程。
 我们正在关注两种主要类型的领域。
 史蒂夫，您可能会发现删除
 只是该地点的总体规划作为参考点。
 第一个就在 Fellsway 旁边，正如您所看到的，为了整个房产的利益而简单地重新调整路缘切割提供了机会
 修改该建筑物的出入点和该建筑物的负载，以及卡车如何进出那里。
 我认为这显然是针对你的问题的。
 这将是对现有条件的一种修改。
 其次，我认为。
 我们想要了解的是范围，这有点牵强，史蒂夫，但是一旦建筑物在那里，一旦现有的仓库被拆除，显然会为现有的自助仓储建筑留下一堵长长的裸露墙。
 我们计划以某种方式完成那堵墙。
 目前它是该建筑内的一堵 CMU 墙。
 将有计划进入并改善那堵墙的外部状况。
 显然，我们将确保拆除工作安全完成，但就美观而言，只需完成那堵墙并固定屋顶的所有连接件即可
 与该建筑物防水相关的一切都已正确完成。
 因此，不仅现有建筑的拆除，而且我们计划进行的工程都会有一些改进，这将使我们能够在某种程度上解决该建筑的主入口问题。
 我不想
 这场针对住宅物业的对话偏离了轨道，但我们正在制作一些图纸，我们将与市政府单独讨论这些图纸，以帮助了解该建筑的前进道路，因为它的某些工作变得可以负担得起。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 我重复一遍，我不知道这座建筑是如何运作的。
 因此，我承认我对这个业务是如何运作的很天真或无知。
 但我只想到我自己的经历和我长大的地方。
 我记得在工业建筑里，工人们会出去，有空间在外面聚集，你知道，有抽烟时间和午休时间以及类似的事情。
 这是那种需要这些东西的地方吗？
 如果发生的话，会发生在哪里？
 这是否意味着要与邻居互动？
 因为现在已经不再关闭了。
 这是商业性的。
 这是一个街区。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 不，这是一个有用的问题。
 因此，这座建筑目前的用途是作为自助仓储设施，这对我们来说意味着现场工人的维护成本相当低。
 这不是生产工作，只是一般管理和监督
 人们的复杂性，人们访问其私人储物笼的复杂性。
 因此，就现场工人而言，以及对任何外部工作的要求而言，强度非常低。
 我们认为大楼内没有必要为他们提供聚集区。
 有一间办公室和一间休息室以及类似的东西，一个行政办公室。
 因此，总的来说，我们认为，随着该建筑的使用类型以及在员工人数减少的情况下进行的监督类型，
 我没想到会发生你提到的情况。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4732.384s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 谢谢。
 我没有其他问题或评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4734.786s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 一切都好。
 谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？
 没有看到任何，我认为在组织上最有意义的是我们将投票对民事程序公开评论。
 然后，在对民事问题进行公众评论后，我们将进入流量同行评审测试阶段。
 接下来，总统等待就交通问题公开征求意见的动议。
 土木工程的介绍。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4776.651s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 非常感慨。</p>

 好的，大家，我们现在将接受公众对今天收到的土木工程更新的评论。
 哦是的。
 克里夫，请继续。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4813.254s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 嘿伙计们。
 我叫克里夫·博莫。
 我是建筑审稿人，非常感谢您的演讲。
 我有几个可能会出现的问题。
 我知道我们正在看着对方
 工作会议，我认为这太棒了，我很期待。
 我只是有一些民事问题，也许回到主题吧。
 我认为在电动汽车停车方面，我实际上不记得梅德福在哪里采用参与代码，但请记住
 参与代码对电动汽车停车位有非常具体的要求，而且它们有很大不同。
 与其他代码相比，这是一个很大的飞跃。
 我认为参与守则要求的是 20% 的停车位是联网的，我想这就是这个词，
 用于停放电动汽车。
 因此，我不想把自己表现为专门法规的权威，但请审查它们，因为如果城市在开始许可程序之前采用它，这可能会成为一个非常现实的问题。
 另外，另外两条，另外三个评论。
 一是我很欣赏
 循环图和了解我认为下一次工作会议的议程是什么是在阐明建筑物外墙方面出现的一些主题。
 我看到了。
 次要入口是在建筑立面上创造更多体积兴趣的好机会。
 所以我把它当作一个机会。
 我认为甚至安德烈关于公共艺术品的观点也是如此。
 它有一个长长的立面，可以俯瞰停车场，长长的苋菜色，我认为这是一个壁画空间的绝佳机会，它可以真正丰富我认为建筑那一侧景观规划的一个非常好的想法。
 我认为那里有很大的机会。
 还有两个快速评论。
 其一是，
 我认为我们今晚看到的任何计划都没有反映出我们讨论过的关于削减建筑物西北角的想法。
 我们研究了体积研究，我认为这些研究对于切除西北角非常有效，因此它不那么突出。
 所以我会把它留在那里。
 我不知道这是故意的还是只是土木和建筑之间的协调问题。
 最后一个是，我不是一个交通人员，我可能会迟到一场演讲，甚至可能会迟到两次，但我认为有关于入场的讨论。
 由于到达区位于大楼的北侧，因此就如何修建将现有大楼与新大楼分开的路径进行了一些讨论，将最初的 100 英尺左右向北移动，这样人们就不会从默特尔到到达区停留，然后从那里前往大楼东侧的停车场入口。
 如果我错过了有关此问题的任何其他对话，我深表歉意，并且我想强调，我不是过境人员，所以我不知道是否有人担心可能使用此作为网关的汽车数量。
 但另一方面，这就是我从平民角度学到的一切，我真的很期待
 再次举行工作会议，我感谢候选人愿意继续推进建筑物的架构，该架构将与景观和土木计划联系起来。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5106.377s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢，悬崖。
 那么，由于工作组中正在进行的一些讨论有一些观点更能澄清问题，有没有人想谈谈这个问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 帕特，如果你想让我开始，我会按照相反的顺序，解决克里夫刚刚提出的更多流通问题，实际上是在仪式入口处。
 我将再次共享我的屏幕，只是再一次，这样我就可以指出并确保我们都在同一页面上。
 我认为评论是关于这一段路的，无论它想要在一侧，在一个方向还是另一个方向，或者至少在入口的方向，我认为这就是谈话。
 我们讨论了它。
 最终我们认为这应该是一个双向部分。
 原因是 如果有一辆车来送你 比如说
 送人或接人，这更像是送人的情况。
 有人拿着购物袋，把它们放在入口处，下雨了，跑到前门，然后
 然后，送您下车的人可以转身前往建筑物后面的任何地方，找到他们的停车位，并根据可用的停车位从任何其他门进入。
 所以我们认为这是一个进入的机会，无论是在车库里，如果他们进入车库，他们可能就不会出来了。
 但如果他们把车停在外面，有人就有机会跳回默特尔街，沿着 Fellsway 漫步，然后从另一个入口返回。
 所以我们认为这是一个重要的功能，特别是如果是短期访客，有人来看房，那么这四个下车时间，假设他们都很忙，那么那个人就必须离开并来到 Fellsway 进来寻找
 场地内某个地方的另一个空间，我们认为这些是相邻道路上不必要的行程，并将它们保留在场地内部。
 所以我们就这样做了，进行了讨论，你不会记得很糟糕，但是当我们进行迭代时，交通工程师做了一些分析，大约 90% 的人都在这个研究范围内。
 我会来买其他的票。
 他们相信大约有 10% 的人会为了这个条目而前来。
 确实是第一次来的人。
 因此，我们认为，基于交通量较低并创造了不返回 Fells Way 的机会，维持这条双向街道非常重要。
 这就是我们的想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5271.853s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_06]</a>: 谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5274.586s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，是的，我可以快速干预，我将继续以相反的顺序工作。
 我当时正在做笔记。
 所以是建筑物悬崖的西北角，如果这里有任何混乱，抱歉。
 他们是。
 以多种方式将设计过程分为两部分，因此我们专门关注接地层。我认为这就是你所发表的评论。我们对建筑物的住宅部分进行了改造，以便建筑物在地面层
 建筑物的占地面积如图所示，在该高度之上，建筑物后退。
 我必须说，那首歌又回来了。
 这是一个倒角。
 所以这与我们所做的演示是一致的。
 之前在我们之前的以架构为重点的听证会和之前的同行评审中。
 所以我们没有回去毁掉这座建筑。
 只是您正在查看底层平面图。
 所以希望我们能够消除这些混乱。
 我会继续，阿联酋的公共艺术。
 非常非常注意到，正如我之前提到的，我认为对此还有另一个评论。
 这是我们计划在下一次同行评审会议上讨论的内容。
 这是我们在建筑同行评审中考虑的事情，并且很高兴收到建议的位置。
 我想知道这是否是公共艺术。
 嗯，沿着蜿蜒小路的建筑物，或者是沿着建筑物本身的东西。
 你知道，我认为我们绝对对想法持开放态度，我们希望将其打造成一个受欢迎的酒店，让这座城市引以自豪，而与之相关的公共艺术也是我们持开放态度的。
 最后，关于停车，这是一个有用的评论。
 我认为今晚我们确实收到了很多反馈。
 正如我提到的，我唯一学到的就是我们在这方面做了更多的功课。
 我无法参考电动汽车停车的具体规范指令，但当我们下次见面时，我们的团队将能够这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5413.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 出色的。
 谢谢。
 是的，谢谢。
 一切都好。
 朋友们，我们愿意接受公众评论。
 所以如果你是一个想讲土木工程话题的观众，你可以举手变焦，打开相机举手，你可以写这样的东西。
 您还可以发送电子邮件至 Medford dash ma.gov 的 Dennis D. McDougal。
 我看到我们有一位艾莉森·D。请列出她的姓名和地址以供记录。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5447.956s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: 大家好，艾莉森·达戈斯蒂诺。
 我代表 D'Agostino Family Trust 的 1022-1024 Fellsway。
 谢谢大家。
 事实上，我有很多评论以及标记的很多数字和问题。
 我会尽可能地组织起来。
 对于初学者来说，如果我能避免这一切的话。
 我对公交车站的情况略知一二。
 所以我将从这里开始。
 我知道有一个公交车站。
 它实际上位于 Fellsway 的另一边。
 所以现在孩子们基本上必须穿过默特尔街所在的地方，步行直到穿过菲尔斯路。
 所以这是一条常走的路。
 实际上，在 Fells Way 通往仓库的当前路缘石对面，就是孩子们等待的地方。
 默特尔（Myrtle）尽头还有另一个巴士站。
 因为我再说一遍，这是工业，对吧？
 所以他们不带任何孩子来这里。
 据我了解，它位于默特尔街和斯普林街的拐角处，如果有帮助的话。
 所以我们就开车去了那里。
 一些评论。
 首先，感谢董事会，当然还有戴维斯公司。
 我实际上是认识帕特的人。
 这是一次很棒的会议，我很珍惜这段时光。
 所以，从评论开始的一件事：
 我认为这有点误导，你知道，我认为，特别是在项目开始时，我们讨论了默特尔街会是什么样子，你知道，我们试图转移交通，今晚听说，你知道，该房产的地址将在默特尔。
 而且，你知道，我相信人们会在那时穿过默特尔并实际按照规定使用 Fellsway 入口，这有点牵强。
 但话又说回来，这只是一条评论。
 我希望今晚我能听到一些不同的东西。
 另一部分是我真的很喜欢拓宽默特尔街的尝试。
 我认为我还不清楚的最重要的一点是，如果我们不重新安置电线杆，住在那条街上的任何人都会注意到，你知道，他们是
 大的，有一些。
 我认为这比这张插图中所说明的内容还要多，这是最好的表达方式。
 因此，虽然我很欣赏这一点，但如果这些柱子没有移到一起，就说明街道拓宽得不够。
 显然，Fellsway 和 Bernal 的交叉点不能扩大，因为我们已经与 Walsh 遗产讨论过这一点。
 确实没有解决办法。
 然而，另一个评论是，我真的很喜欢戴维斯公司提出的停车位数量。
 另外，对于我来说，狗公园是我最关心的两个问题，仅供记录。
 该地区不再有额外的停车位。
 非常拥挤。
 在雪灾紧急情况下，人们会争夺空间，就像我也住过的南西一样。
 所以这根本不像是我做的。
 非常拥挤。
 此外，该地区还有可能引入 289 只狗。
 虽然我欣赏绿色空间，但我认为对我来说，更多地关注对狗友好的空间比游乐场或其他类型的公园更重要。
 所以我只是希望这种情况变得普遍。
 我真的很感激他们尝试按照要求停车，因为这是必要的。
 没有泄漏，我每天都需要离开车库。
 这些是我的评论、我的问题，以免浪费太多时间。
 我想我的问题是我对沃伦街不太清楚。
 它似乎没有包含在这些插图中。
 这是一条交叉的交通路线。
 这是一条单行道，穿过默特尔，就在阿玛兰斯的十字路口。
 我想我的问题是：还有什么正在考虑中吗？
 这个十字路口对我来说是非常危险的。
 现在很危险。
 所以我向戴维斯公司，甚至董事会提出的问题是我们仍在考虑的事情。
 关于安全问题，我的第二个问题只是对联排别墅进行澄清，不清楚。
 有通道吗？
 直接在桃金娘上或酒店内。
 我的第三个问题是关于车库外整个外部建筑的停车位，但特定于后装载区域。
 似乎还不清楚。
 卡车可以开进来吗？
 卡车、带坡道的运输卡车可以吗？
 你能走下坡道吗？
 您能够安全下载吗？
 我可能在这所房子里住了一段时间，但大学毕业后我每年都会搬家。
 然后我记得能够移动是一个挑战。
 在有停车场的建筑物中。
 所以这些卡车无法进入车库。
 我真正关心和问题是：您是否考虑过带有坡道的移动卡车的空间量？
 所以这就很多了。
 非常感谢。
 再次感谢您抽出宝贵时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5763.815s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 是的，有一些问题。
 有一个关于移动卡车、关于劳伦斯的问题。
 候选人愿意谈谈这个吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5775.499s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的。
 你想去吗，帕特？
 卡车移动和停车。
 移动卡车位于建筑物的整个后面。
 那里可以停几辆卡车。
 我们预计那里不会有很多卡车，因为物业管理部门实际上会。
 我们将管理行动、进入和退出。
 我们认为有足够的空间来处理一些高峰移动条件。
 我们正在调查此事，并将继续与运营团队合作以了解这一情况。
 对于半独立式住宅，需要澄清的是，所有通道均位于土地内部。
 没有路缘石或通往默特尔街的通道。
 都是通过后面的内部入口进入这个地方。
 所以我想如果你想提供佛罗伦萨街的最新情况，我知道它正在被关注。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5841.227s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，是的，绝对是的。
 这是一个及时的问题，所以一般来说答案是肯定的。
 我想我们现在正在处理中，我不知道 Beta 的 Jeff 是否会在听证会结束时发表一些评论，但我们已经收到了 Beta 的很多有关流量的反馈，我们正在研究它。
 作为其中的一部分，有一些
 我们应该考虑的建议缓解措施以及我们应该研究的一些其他内容。
 如果没有我面前的报告，我不知道劳伦斯街是否存在，但总的来说，我认为该地区的交通和该地区的缓解措施被广泛考虑，而不仅仅是桃金娘或苋菜。
 我想劳伦斯可能在那里。
 我必须仔细检查一下，但对你的问题的简短回答是肯定的。
 我们将继续与我们的团队和同行评审团队合作，制定该地区的交通缓解方案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5904.591s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 感谢您对巴士站的评论。
 我谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5908.352s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: 不客气。
 我的意思是，据我所知，它是准确的。
 我的邻居有两个孩子，所以我每天看着他们离开。
 所以，非常感谢您的澄清和评论。
 谢谢大家。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5920.557s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 其他有关土木工程的公众意见。
 是的，我们逮捕了克里斯蒂娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5934.505s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5935.446s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我认为这是我连续第二次做得很好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5941.353s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 克里斯蒂娜在默特尔街 30 号买了一套。
 首先，我向董事会提出一些问题，然后就与民间社会讨论的内容提出一些问题。
 我们是否已将这些会议通知 Amaranth 公寓的居民？
 因为在我去过的所有这些中，都没有来自这个方向的公众评论。
 因此，我想确保，如果他们在演示箱中，他们会收到电子邮件、小册子等，以便听到他们的声音。
 然后第二个是
 今天，以及在之前的会议上，我们从帕特那里听到了很多关于这家将管理该物业的管理公司的信息。
 很多问题都是针对：嗯，管理公司会处理这个，管理公司会处理这个，管理公司会处理这个。
 我希望理事会考虑让他们参加其中一场会议。
 所以，戴维斯建造了这座大楼之后，
 居民对拥有和管理日常体验的人感到放心，他们计划如何处理移动卡车等事情，他们将如何处理艺术品或游乐场上出现的任何潜在涂鸦，以及他们将如何清理它们。
 所以我只是想将此作为一个建议予以驳回。
 所以我对我们上面分析的内容发表了评论。
 关于停车，我听说目前在默特尔街 (Myrtle Street) 有 330 英尺的停车位。
 所以您明白，当您与我们交谈并告诉我们，比如说，您将其增加到 370 个时，您并没有增加默特尔街的停车位。
 在 Amaranth 街和默特尔街之间，
 你有更多的停车位。
 但默特尔街的停车位并没有增加。
 作为默特尔街的居民，我非常担心何时会进行耕作以及何时会出现下雪紧急情况，因为现在我必须将车停在 Amaranth。
 我一个人住。
 我不喜欢深夜回家看到居民占领了默特尔的停车场而我不得不把车停在街角的想法。
 吃苋菜然后步行回家。
 我认为会的，因为所有这些公司和所有这些豪华公寓都向居民收取停车费，他们会意识到 Amaranth 和 Myrtle 是免费的，他们会抢走我们的位置。
 所以我只是想让你知道，你为默特尔街提出的 130,000 美元到 170,000 美元的升级计划确实具有误导性，你也意识到了这一点。
 最后，我真的认为我们已经开始到达一个能够听到居民声音的地方。
 因此，当我得知我们将不再从默特尔街分流交通时，我感到非常失望，艾利森刚才提到了这一点。
 克里夫还提到，在之前的一次会议上，我们被告知居民将无法
 从默特尔街进入车库。
 这是一个小环形交叉路口，进出是一条死胡同。
 所以我只是想表达我的失望之情，因为我觉得自己听到的事情在这次特别的电话会议上被拿走了。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6166.32s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 是的，所以关于这个话题
 我认为访问是我们将在同行评审更新中解决的问题。
 所以我不知道候选人是否愿意谈论这个问题。
 我知道你已经提到了原因。
 所以我们也会在测试版中得到反馈。
 所以，我很抱歉。
 有脑放屁。
 然后，啊，下雪了。
 是的，我们还没有讨论过雪。
 所以，除雪之类的事情。
 我知道有为居民提供的有盖停车场。
 但我认为，委员会现在或在未来的听证会上了解有关雪事件的计划将会有所帮助。
 然后他也投篮。
 抱歉克里斯蒂娜，我错过的第三个是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6235.053s">[MCM00000654_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 如果你说的是停车问题，当时正在下雪，所以我的猜测是，就像所有这些豪华公寓一样，他们会收取停车费。
 我确信覆盖的空间会更大，而地段会更小。
 但最终，居民们会发现苋菜和香桃木是免费的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6255.102s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，这是正确的。
 所以不是这个。
 所以我理解了这一点并理解了。
 就是经营和管理。
 哦是的。
 在过去的40B中我们获得了有关该建筑的运营和管理计划的一些详细信息。
 据我了解，戴维斯公司打算经营此业务。
 这是正确的吗？
 还是我理解错了？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6281.057s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 因此，戴维斯公司具有物业管理职能，但不延伸至住宅物业。
 我懂了。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，克里斯蒂娜，这只是后退半步，
 在提供一些答案时，目的并不是给出直接答案。
 我正在尽力给出目前我能给出的最佳答案。
 我认为我在这个阶段、在这个设计水平上能够在项目上做的一些工作，与我们的物业管理团队和资产管理团队进行内部咨询，这些团队真正关注的是住宅，
 还与我们合作运营一些住宅物业的物业管理团体进行对话。
 我们尚未与该项目的物业经理签订任何合同，因此我目前没有可以邀请并要求出席的特定团队。
 主席先生，如果有
 我将查看您之前的 4DB 项目的参考资料，看看提供了什么，如果我们可以提供任何类似的内容，我们肯定会这样做，以尽可能诚实和翔实地回答尽可能多的以操作为重点的问题。
 有些问题我很难给出具体答案。
 例如，对于除雪，我认为这将根据雪量而具体情况而定。
 整个场地都有绿地，在暴风雨发生时可以将雪移走并定位。
 然后，如果有暴风雨和大量降雪，
 当您与物业管理公司交谈时，他们会协调物业除雪。
 所以我不能具体说明这个阈值是什么或者它发生的频率。
 这将是一个具体情况具体分析。
 所以我想总结一下，
 如果我可以查看记录并找到之前的 40B 申请人提供的内容，我们可以做一些功课并尝试提供有关如何运营该建筑物的信息，以便获得更多信息。
 我并不想成为
 不要让人们觉得我们对此不透明。
 希望这至少能回答部分问题。
 如果您认为提及物业管理集团是我们的一场赌博，我很抱歉。
 这当然不是意图。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6463.915s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢，是的，如果您可以查看我们在之前的申请中收到的内容并看看您可以提供哪些详细信息。我理解这是一种不同的情况，因为在这种情况下，这是一种情况。
 原告打算单独经营该建筑。
 但是，是的，这些细节对议会和居民都有帮助。
 是的，如果您现在了解的某些事情具有类似的详细程度，那肯定会有所帮助。
 我们绝对可以做到这一点。
 好的，谢谢。

 我的意思是，电动汽车和火灾与电动自行车有着类似的担忧。
 到目前为止，正如你所说，在许多城市，我知道这并不是梅德福或我们正在谈论的这个房产所独有的，但你知道，一场普通的火灾，
 消防部门和卡车不会扑灭电动汽车的火灾。

 所以我只想提出这个问题，我们也在讨论需要多少个电源点。

 我知道有人提到过这一点，但我只想再次记录一下，如果默特尔街的交通量增加，默特尔街就是地址。
 即使你在默特尔街有送货和取货区，但你有这么多居民，有多少 Uber Eats 司机？
 你会同时有几个人，而不仅仅是一两个人。
 只是，你可以在其他朋友身上看到我去过的公寓。
 我的意思是，在这些单位中会发生这种情况。
 我不希望默特尔街（因为它是上下车区）变成停车场，而人们则在等待进入该空间。
 所以现在你阻塞了道路上的交通。
 这就是我的想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6631.389s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的。
 所以你提到了三个名字。
 和你坐在一起的其他人想说话吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6641.51s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 哦，我是名义上说的。
 事实上，保罗还提出了另外的评论。
 我说过，有一次我们正在谈论默特尔街的出口或入口实际上更像是一个紧急出口，而不是一个前出口。
 如果这确实只是消防部门的要求，您可以关闭它，然后将交通引导至 Fellsway。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6669.151s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 需要明确的是，当您说接近时，您是指物理上还是交通上的原因？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6674.116s">[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>: 类似的东西，他们可以进入，所以它并不是真正的地产入口，你实际上是在强迫交通使用 Fellsway。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6684.448s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 我懂了。
 好吧，谢谢。
 好的，还有其他公众愿意就这个话题发言吗？
 总统什么也没看到，正在等待一项结束公众对此土木工程演示发表评论的动议。
 非常感慨。
 第二。
 我看到一只手。
 来自规划部门？
 是的，丹尼斯。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6728.697s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 对不起，是我。
 我忘记了我的相机已经关闭了。
 这只是 Christine 早些时候就该通知发表的评论之一，该房产 300 英尺范围内的每个人，其中包括所有这些，你知道，Amaranth 公寓，他们都在该项目开始时收到了通知。
 这基本上就是我们所做的通知。
 所以是的
 我们不能说为什么他们没有参加这些会议，但他们在项目开始时都得到了通知。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=6761.895s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢，丹尼斯。
 一切都好。
 因此，我们现在立即提出一项关闭公共部分的动议。
 好的。
 看来我们有第二个吉姆了。
 我们打个电话吧。

 是的。
 你很安静，吉姆，但我看到你在挥手。
 好的。
 安德鲁？
 你好。

 那么，晚安。
 回到那个和婴儿组。
 开展交通影响评估研究。
 为了开始这个过程，我们进行了实地考察，观察交通状况，审查了 Van Essen Associates 影响研究、Polar Engineering 项目计划，并审查了所有交通方式，不仅包括交通，还包括行人、自行车和公共交通。
 我们与土建工程也有一些重叠，因此您可以在场地规划、内部循环、装载和交付以及运输需求管理计划中看到一些内容。
 总体而言，交通研究是按照我们现有的国家和行业专业标准进行的，是一份综合报告。
 因此，我将总结我们的评论。
 有些评论要求提供更多信息，要求澄清。
 我们更多地谈论外部缺陷以及可能的改进。
 感谢您的介绍。
 亲爱的玩家，我认为我们提出的一些意见在今天的演示中得到了回答。
 所以我谢谢你。
 也许这有点多余。
 我们讨论了一些主题，所以这或多或少是按照流量影响研究的顺序进行的。
 因此，在研究区域内，对整个区域的交叉口进行了综合评估。
 这有点难以阅读。
 我想说的是，第一个正在考虑纳入的十字路口是您注意到的唯一一个未包括在内的十字路口，即第四街。
 嗯，这里看起来围栏很围，所以标有人行横道。
 所以那将是唯一的地方。
 我想你可以考虑看看。
 因此，在现有条件下，采集1月11日的流量。
 小马丁·路德·金
 假期是15号。
 我只是想得到一些答案，以及周一假期是否会对周四的计数产生任何预期影响。
 然后收集并汇总流量。
 我们想了解更多有关该网站现有使用所产生的行程的信息。
 所以，这里只是有关该地区行人现有状况的一些信息。
 我们自己根据刚刚写下的观察结果做了一个清单。
 中环街和春街交叉口没有行人信号灯，该路口是正在研究的交叉路口。
 该地区的几个十字路口没有可检测的人行横道和警告牌，而这些必须符合 ADA 标准，其中包括 Myrtle、Amaranth 和 Lawrence 街道的十字路口。
 这些只是一些观察和笔记。
 安全方面，该地区有多个路口曾发生过安全事故。
 正如我刚才提到的，Central 和 Spring 有 13 次失败。
 最重要的是，事故发生率超过了马萨诸塞州交通部第 4 区的平均水平和州平均水平，达到了令人担忧的程度。
 Fellsway 和 Riverside 五年内发生了 31 起事故。
 MassDOT 将其认定为高事故群体，使其有资格接受 2019 年进行的高速公路安全审计，并被认定为存在安全问题。
 Fellsway Central 和 Medford Street 五年内发生了 23 起事故。
 我们只是想更多地了解该地区发生的行人和自行车事故类型。
 停车，我们询问在现有条件下，是否有关于今天该地点街道和停车场占用情况的信息，您知道，这些空间在相邻街道和该地点本身占用的百分比，了解这些信息会很有用。
 未来的情况，所以我先讲一下出行生成和出行分配归因。
 因此，预计该项目将在工作日上午和下午高峰时段产生约 90 趟车次。
 我们认为这是一个合理的数字。
 我们希望获得更多关于卡车出行次数的信息，包括这个数字。
 行人、自行车和公共交通出行。
 因此，如果能够对它们进行分解和识别，将会很有帮助。
 计算中使用了未来 5% 的自行车比例。
 我们认为它可能有点高。
 我认为全市 Medford 模式的总体比例为 1%。
 所以我想知道如果计算时假设从自行车模式分裂到较低模式，这会对车辆的出行产生多大影响？
 Fells Way 上的许多行程都会在中央大街掉头返回该地点。
 我想知道是否有其他交通可以使用的替代路线，因为认识到此行进中存在一些延误和拥堵，尤其是在下午，例如河滨大道，左转进入河滨，甚至使用 I-93 作为替代路线。
 其中一些交通是否会使用 I-93 而不是 Fells Way？
 嗯，报告中有一个表格确定了该项目的流量增加情况，但事实并非如此。
 识别现场附近的道路，例如 Fellsway、Myrtle、Pinker、Lawrence 和 Spring。
 因此，我想量化有关该地点附近道路交通量增加的信息。
 一个已经被谈论了一点的停车项目，停车比例为1.14。
 我们只是想确保这个数字是正确且足够的，可以满足该地点的预期停车需求。
 你知道，请记住，我们希望确保我们做的每件事都是正确的。
 因此，如果有足够的停车位，就不会溢出到邻近的社区和道路。
 我们看到前面有 4 个访客空间，即送货区。
 我们认为它可能有点低。
 嗯，我们还想更多地了解游客空间本身。
 不仅是短期送货，而且如果人们拜访该综合体的居民，他们会在哪里停车，如果他们这样做几个小时？
 如果他们停车很长时间或停车过夜。
 所以一些关于这是如何运作的讨论。
 访客空间将由网站运营和管理。
 关于拟议的停车位，新的Amaranth停车位，只是这些停车位的意图，我知道它们是向公众开放的，但它们应该供现场访客使用吗？
 这些空间的用途是什么？
 进行了交叉口通行能力分析。
 交通工程师使用所谓的交叉口服务级别。
 它类似于成绩单，其中 A，表示条件极佳，几乎没有延误或拥堵。
 E和F不足。
 F 是最差的，或者因巨大的延迟、拥塞和排队而失败。
 所以，你知道，我们在那里看到了 Fellsway 上的拥堵情况，大部分是早上向南行，下午向北行。
 Fellsway、Central 以及 Fellsway 和 Riverside 交叉口目前以 F 服务级别运行，这意味着它们有一个或多个交通通常无法达到 F 服务级别。
 而项目未来的非施工条件和施工条件又使这些条件更加恶化。
 该项目将导致中环 Fellsway 的交通显着增加，而中央大道东行通道的延误将会增加。
 其中一些问题已经得到解决。
 就在今天晚上，我看到了这里右上角的空间。
 我想我们在仓库的 A 区。
 感谢您提供这个。
 此外，还可以进入建筑物和会场周围的空间，今晚也展示了这一点，所以这很棒。
 这里显示了与未来自行车道的联系。
 我想这一切都已经解决了。
 只是对街道空间、默特尔街和阿默斯特的新空间进行澄清。
 我知道它们向公众开放，但谁对这些空间拥有管辖权？
 它们真的是城市还是属于私人管辖？
 因此，对这些空间进行更多澄清。
 就其本身而言，我们谈论的是场地规划中更广阔的空间，即流通道路的宽度。
 抱歉，必须提供路边停车位。
 讨论居民和游客的自行车停放只是为了明确车位数量。
 现场必须标明储雪区域。
 我知道有人在谈论默特尔街，但我还需要知道那里的雪将储存在哪里。
 这就是制定运输需求管理计划的原因。
 这些计划的目标是减少汽车出行次数，尤其是单人车辆。
 我们还确定了该计划需要考虑的其他一些领域或措施。
 您可能早些时候已经谈到过这一点。
 停车费与停车费是分开的吗？
 今晚我没有听到，但也许会有更多的讨论。
 我知道对于网站来说最好的选择是需要权衡的。
 您可以考虑向居民提供交通补贴或蓝色自行车订阅，作为一项 TDM 措施。
 你展示了蓝色的自行车站，所以照顾好它真是太好了。
 并且您应该考虑现场是否有汽车共享空间，例如汽车共享拉链车。
 那么项目提出的外部改进，我们稍微谈了一下公交候车区。
 MBTA 巴士站附近的现有停车位将进行重新配置和景观美化，如今晚向我们展示的那样，以及新的停车位、扩大 Amaranth 街和 Myrtle 街的通行权，或者更好的是街道和人行道停车位。
 因此，我们确定了一些其他的措施，只是为了考虑和改进。
 这些大多是外部地点。
 其中许多位于我提到的十字路口，存在操作或安全缺陷。
 第一个是Fellsway Riverside Avenue。
 因此，我提到，已识别出在服务级别 F 上运行的高崩溃集群的交叉点。此次交通安全审计确定了对策和安全对策的改进，包括交通信号优化、增强左转阶段和通行时间。
 所以这些事情是可以考虑的。
 Avenida Central 和 Rua Primavera 的事故发生率很高。
 可以考虑升级旧的信号设备并安装现有的行人标志。
 Fellsway、Central 和 Medford Street 在两个高峰时段再次在 F 级服务条件下运行，可以看到并提供信号定时优化。
 北行左转车道多次被堵塞，特别是在晚高峰期间，因此车辆在车道畅通之前无法进入该车道。
 是否有可能拓宽 Fells Way 北行左转车道？
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle Street 相连，因此 Fellsway 有一条长长的人行横道。
 我们知道，交通流量大，车速高，可以考虑使用矩形快闪灯，这是对行人的安全措施，也能提高驾驶员的安全意识。
 我们只是想评估提供中间间隔是否可行，无论是在红绿灯处还是向北左转处。
 我知道这样做有利有弊，但这样做是否有足够的好处来考虑这种改变？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7754.877s">[Unidentified]</a>: 默特尔、阿默斯特和劳伦斯</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7762.287s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 项目就在街边，配置很奇怪。
 单向的街道布局让司机和行人感到困惑。
 我知道该项目提出了一些扩建和人行横道。
 我认为这种交叉值得更多关注。
 我知道他们也提到了劳伦斯。
 额外的人行道延伸可能位于西南角，甚至可能抬高十字路口。
 我认为这是毗邻项目并进入社区的重要门户。
 这是一个平息交通的机会
 降低车速并改善该区域的行人流通和安全。
 再补充几句评论。
 Fells Way 南行的现有巴士站毗邻工地，状况良好。
 这确实是一个简陋的避难所。
 我认为应该考虑这个公交车站的现代化。
 嗯，需要制定一个寻路标志计划。
 该项目的进展将清楚地显示居民、访客和送货人员将在哪里进入和返回该地点。
 默特尔街以南的阿默斯特的人行道状况很差。
 因此，该街道的重新铺设应被视为该项目的一部分。
 事实上，有必要为施工制定交通管理计划，以显示对社区的影响。
 最后的评论是，由于项目的性质正在发生变化，因此需要获得施工许可证才能进入 DCR。
 进出 Fellsway 需要 DCR 许可证。
 这是我们评论的摘要。
 还有更多，其中一些虽小但很详细。
 在我们提供给您的审查信中。
 非常感谢。
 我可以回答你的任何问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7917.434s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢。
 因此，在我们继续讨论论坛问题之前，我只想向帕特·牛顿核实一下我的理解。
 那么，帕特，总的来说，您今天想讨论的主题有哪些，或者我们将在今年晚些时候的会议上讨论的更新内容？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7936.758s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我们今晚不打算讨论这些评论。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=7945.762s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 看起来很棒。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8057.796s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的，我们仍然有一点进进出出。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8069.759s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8082.747s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 我，我就像，我只是在想，嗯，关于杰夫的问题。
 今晚我们听到了一些关于默特尔大街地址问题的评论。
 嗯，我想知道你是否有具体的建议，我知道你说的是指导，比如 Fellsway 入口处可能有什么样的标牌，你知道，
 确保这是项目的主要输入。
 不知道你对此是否有任何想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8116.863s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 是的。
 因此，我们将考虑制定一个标牌方案来引导居民和游客以及进出现场的送货。
 当然，居民一旦到达那里就会知道如何进出。
 你知道，我们要引导游客去公园的很多地方，所以它可能是不同类型标志的组合，可能是纪念碑标志，也可能是其他标志，但它会显示，你知道，主要是通道。
 根据具体情况指示停车位置和地点。
 你是谁，然后去我们想要引导这些外部旅程的地方。
 我认为菲尔斯路将是主入口，但我认为这个地址是一个好点。
 如果有人在位智中输入地址但不熟悉该网站，它会将他们引导至默特尔街，而这可能不是我们希望他们去的地方。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8194.189s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 我看到克里斯的评论现在在聊天中，所以我会发表出来。
 有谁知道有多少百分比的传入或传出流量将使用车库的 Amaranth 一侧？
 我同意顾问的观点，即街道汇合是一个问题。
 所以我想我在交通需求管理计划中看到了一些百分比。
 我知道我们有斯科特。
 我不知道它们是否反映了最新的更新，这是酒店的不同部分，但有双向交通。
 但是，是的，也许你可以谈谈这个，斯科特。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8236.272s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的当然。
 谢谢总统先生。
 斯科特·桑顿 (Scott Thornton) 与瓦妮莎协会 (Vanessa Associates)。
 因此，我们估计大约 30%、30% 到 40% 的交通将使用 Amaranth Avenue 通道，其背后的想法只是基于停车位与该位置的距离。
 另外，可能有一些流量想要
 例如，向西行驶，您可以访问通往 93 号的站点。
 其中一些区域提供区域访问，根据一天中的时间，可能会更方便
 可以通过 Amaranth 轻松快速地到达，然后经默特尔街 (Myrtle Street) 或劳伦斯街 (Lawrence Street) 返回斯普林街 (Spring Street)。
 但是，最初的估计是在 30% 到 40% 之间。
 我认为这仍然适用于今晚在这里提出的最新计划。
 我们预计此分布不会发生重大变化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8322.547s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好的。
 谢谢。
 克里斯，您还有任何后续问题或其他问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8333.162s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 我可以继续克里斯说的话吗？
 所以，你知道，只要看看街道上的交通，我的意思是，我明白一定比例的交通可以离开阿玛兰斯并向西行驶，但从西边接近这个地方似乎几乎是不可能的。
 看起来几乎所有交通都必须离开 Fellsway。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8361.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我们确实做到了，你知道，分布实际上是基于我们认为人们在哪里，或者人口普查数据表明人们在该地区工作和生活的地方。
 这就是我们通过结合现有的旅行模式进行分销的地方。
 我同意有时候
 如果人们来自西部或南部，使用 Fellsway 会更有效率。
 但并非一天中所有时段都是如此。
 这就是该发行版旨在解决的问题。
 对不起，它符合我们所期望的归因模式，即所有涉及时间段内的流量归因。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8422.885s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 安德烈，你有吗？
 按照这个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8437.957s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 不完全是。
 我的意思是，
 再次以这种方式处理该项目。
 我的意思是，似乎到达 Amaranth 入口的唯一方法是沿着 Lawrence 走，经过 Amaranth Place 和公寓项目，然后进入 Amaranth 项目，这对于任何不太熟悉的人来说似乎非常曲折，几乎是不可能的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8475.658s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 好的，谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8485.526s">[Unidentified]</a>: 海梅.
 至于十字路口的工作，我想我的问题来自于测试版中提出的改善红绿灯和人行横道的建议。
 比如，这是要去哪里？
 这是去城里的东西吗？
 这是我们与候选人在范围上合作的内容吗？
 我完全同意所有这些交叉点都需要改进。
 我只是不知道我们如何归因它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8526.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 据我了解，这在一定程度上取决于交叉点。
 所以我认为，
 申请人可以在其答复中表明实施部分或全部这些改进的意图。
 在某些情况下，只需要获得市政府的许可。
 在其他情况下，它可能来自国家，这有点复杂。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8553.604s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的，我在斯普林街中心十字路口工作，这是一个持续存在的问题。
 尤其是当我们谈论行人时，海恩斯广场有一个蓝色的自行车站，所以人们可以使用它。
 如果酒店内设有蓝色自行车站，您显然可以在那里下车。
 但如果有行人在行走，如果有额外的行人流量，那个十字路口绝对令人担忧。
 他们称之为，你知道，缺乏人行横道之类的东西。
 是的，这绝对是我没有想到的事情，但这项研究显然揭示了这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8595.186s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 谢谢你，海梅。
 杰夫，你对此有什么想法吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 嗯，是的，这取决于城市想要如何优先考虑这些管辖范围内的道路。
 所以这有点不同。
 完全由城市控制的交叉路口将更容易解决。
 所以，你知道，中央和春天，但是，你知道。
 和操作并延迟拥堵，这也会影响安​​全。
 但我认为，应该由市政府根据他们认为合理且与项目相关的改进来确定其优先事项。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8662.117s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 嗯，我是下一个。
 所以我真的很想知道这个双向交通，嗯，在默特尔街的入口处是否有意义。
 所以我听到了居民的担忧。
 当前的设置导致了许多额外的旅程，而此前据了解，我们正在非常小心地避免这种情况。
 我知道这需要开放供消防通道使用。
 但所提供的信息并没有让我清楚这会给社区带来多大的问题。
 所以是的，有人送货。
 如果它以某种方式关闭，您可能需要乘坐单向溪流返回默特尔。
 所以我认为合理化这一点，我当然理解设计考虑因素，但似乎这里存在一个风险，对于双向交通，这就像打开闸门一样，是一种倒退。
 试图从默特尔街的角度缓解交通拥堵。
 我很想听听你对此的看法，杰夫。
 我不知道您是否有时间全面审查它并准备好分享它的想法和评论，或者您是否需要更多地考虑但想了解更多。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8778.533s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 你根本不必考虑是否，你知道，如果目标是限制默特尔街的出行次数，你知道，如果你做单向，或者，你知道，如果你做单向或。
 所以你必须考虑这些旅行将如何在地点内流通以及他们要去哪里，你知道，他们是否会最终到达默特尔，或者，你知道，他们是否会去 Fellsway。
 所以我认为这是一个很好的问题。
 我们可能需要做更多的评估，你知道，结合斯科特和瓦内斯，并思考这一点以及什么，
 你知道，如果它是单向的而不是双向的，可能会产生什么影响。
 再说一遍，这是一个好话题。
 我认为我们需要对此进行更多的讨论和评估。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8834.447s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 董事会还有其他问题或意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8841.325s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 是的。
 杰夫，如果我不记得这件事和你说的话，我很抱歉，但是。
 你知道，的。
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle 的人行横道，我的意思是，除了人行横道和一条非常小的中间带之外，没有交通灯或任何类型的行人安全装置。
 你知道，看起来确实如此。
 是的，我们将有更多的居民住在那个角落。
 呃，更重要的是那个路口有某种东西。
 减慢行人速度或至少设置一个行人信号灯。
 所以，你知道，你想过了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 是的，在我的一张幻灯片中，我谈到了考虑使用矩形快速闪光头灯。
 这是给行人的按钮信号。
 所以是的，我认为十字路口需要改进，特别是因为两边都有公交车站。
 当我在那里时，我看到人们下车并过马路。
 所以我猜这是一种入门级快闪矩形头灯。
 再往前走，它会是一个完整的红绿灯，就像第四街上的红绿灯一样。

 因此，如果我们有居民乘坐公交车出行，他们很可能会在 Fells Way 的另一边下车。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9048.76s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 我只是同意你所说的，迈克。
 我的意思是，我理解巴特斯对默特尔街交通流量增加的担忧，但我认为确实如此。
 每个人转身都危险得多。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9067.528s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 嗯，实际上我认为两者是分开的，因为据我了解，如果你向北走，我认为这是最常见的路线，如果你必须猜测人们要去哪里工作，那可能是在市中心的某个地方，我认为你仍然需要掉头。
 或者你必须走几条小巷。
 所以我认为默特尔与不，
 它可能会对离开该房产产生更大的影响。
 但我认为，如果他们要向北走，对于很多人来说，掉头将是最好的选择，即使是双向的。

 为了安全起见，我认为我们应该重新开放公众评论。
 我知道我们之前曾对流量进行过公开评论，但我们讨论了新内容。
 我想，出现在这里的一些公众已经分享了他们对交通的评论。
 但是，是的，我想确保这种情况不会发生
 忽略那些一直在等待谈论这个话题的人。
 因此，总统正在等待一项针对交通同行评审公开评论的动议。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9213.514s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: 谢谢。
 你好，艾莉森·达戈斯蒂诺。
 我代表 1022-1024 Pillsbury。
 对不起，我感冒了。
 但谢谢你再次打开这个。
 我只想发表第一条评论，感谢您的同行评审。
 事实上，所有这些交叉口均已被宣布为 F 级，它让我大开眼界，而且似乎与我每天的经历非常一致。
 我只想发表评论，非常感谢您的解决。
 我认为显然与 Amaranth、Lawrence、Myrtle 的交集非常关键。
 我现在告诉你，我住在通往默特尔的菲尔斯路附近的一所房子里，我每天必须看好几次，因为有人正在转过街角，沿着默特尔街走。
 我个人几乎被住在这里的汽车撞过至少三四次。
 所以对我来说，我真正尊重董事会和其他人考虑的关键领域，戴维斯公司，是默特尔和费斯威，
 Myrtle 以及 Fellsway 和 Central 的康复率达到 100 %。
 他们与 Fellsway 和 DCR 合作，创造了这种新型的弹出式走道，非常适合行人。
 但造成这种情况的原因是大型车辆无法真正实现这种方向的改变。
 所以我只是想提出这个问题。
 以及一个担忧。
 我丈夫，有趣的是，在演示中他的卡车就是你看到的那辆，那是道奇公羊。
 但他实际上必须沿着中央，沿着肯德尔，沿着默特尔才能到达我们家，然后沿着阿玛兰斯经过那个换乘。
 我们回到菲尔斯路回家。
 因此，如果该大楼的任何居住者拥有货车或大型车辆，他们将无法在 Fells Way 和 Central 掉头。
 我认为你绝对应该在评估中考虑这一点。
 无论如何，我的最后评论只是感谢您提到这一点。我真的很感谢我遇到的董事会和戴维斯公司，他们也非常热情。
 你知道，在尝试进行这些对话时，他会发声并提供帮助。
 所以我认为这次会议没有发现这一点。
 但在我看来，作为一个以结婚两年的婆婆为代表的长期居民，拥有这栋房子已经五十多年了，这真的太棒了。
 但看到目前交通评估非常重视，特别是劳伦斯和默特尔、Fellsway，非常感谢你们。
 但我只是想指出，实际上路缘削减，我认为新的 DCR 代码，我认为需要考虑，因为如果你在 Central 和 Fellsway 上有一辆大型车辆，你甚至无法掉头。
 所以我就到此为止。
 谢谢。</p>

 我之前没有说过这件事，因为我从来没有想过我们会考虑人行横道和停车标志，以及这个社区目前的驾驶状况，包括中环、劳伦斯的掉头，
 我们这个街区有几条单行道。
 您只能以某种方式升高和降低它们。
 作为一名在这些街道上跑了数千英里的长期居民，艾莉森，当我经过你家时，我会开始向你挥手。
 人们不会在停车标志处停下来。
 当我站在那些三角形的人行横道上，当我赶公共汽车时，人们不会在那些三角形的人行横道上停下来。
 到了火车站，人们不会在 Fells Way 上停下来让你过马路。
 附近有几个停车标志，或者，对不起，附近的路灯没有行人标志。
 你只有在红灯亮的那一刻，没有人右转才能避免被撞。
 我很高兴有关于行人安全的讨论，因为这些街道对行人来说很困难。
 更不用说人行道不是很好，但这就是贝德福德镇。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9537.494s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 谢谢。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9576.152s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 微？
 是的，好的。
 关于此事的公众评论已关闭。
 好了，今晚计划的文章到此结束。
 这就是为什么我想花一点时间来表达对我们下次会议的期望。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9601.232s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 所以我们拭目以待，我会再次拿起它。
 一切都好。
 抱歉，只需一分钟。
 我应该现在就打开它。
 好吧，我们开始吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9645.58s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 因此，就我们最初安排的时间表而言，我们讨论了架构和早期同行评审反馈。
 我们已经讨论过民事问题，但我们没有对此的初步同行评审意见。
 现在我们讨论流量和初步同行评审。
 对此的评论。
 我们对架构计划进行了多次迭代。
 所以我们还是要做工程同行评审意见。
 我们需要反映建筑和工程计划的更新。
 然后建议需要到达
 请求的豁免和提议的条件。
 所以我们需要做的事情很多，但时间并不多。
 这就是为什么我们的下一次会议安排在 4 月 22 日。
 据我所知，在那之前我们将收到民间同行评审的反馈。
 似乎是在本次会议之前，但尚不清楚距离本次会议还有多少时间。
 候选人将有一些时间进行审查，但可能尚未准备好完整的答案。
 因此，这主要是候选人对交通同行评审、民事同行评审的回应，也许只是一般项目更新。
 那我想和中午先生谈谈。
 这符合你的计划和理解吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9760.153s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 嗯，我想是的，当我们考虑即将举行的听证会时，我们努力做好准备。
 对于架构更新，我刚刚收到这些评论。
 唔。
 并安排下周与轰炸机先生进行同行评审会议。
 就我个人而言，我不知道测试版会在今天下午在过境元素中发布。
 所以我认为这些评论是有道理的。
 既然大家都记忆犹新，我们需要稍微关注一下20号的听证会，我相信是23号，主席先生，也只是为了确认这一点。
 现在是星期二凌晨 2 点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9810.864s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 周二。
 是的，今天是 23 号星期二。
 所以我错了。
 所以是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9818.083s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 呃...所以我认为在那次听证会上我们呃...我们打算尝试对交通做出一些反应。我不想代表斯科特说话。我知道他正在努力，坦率地说，我们还没有机会联系……他在这个过程中所处的位置。我想我们在上周五下午收到了这些评论，呃......所以审查过程已经过了几天，如果我可以建议的话，呃......
 如果董事会同意，我们将推进某种计划议程。
 我认为这个想法是以某种方式响应流量和以某种方式响应架构反馈。
 如果没有民间评论，很难说我们是否会在 23 日做好准备。
 所以我认为我们的目标是交通和建筑的结合。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9870.349s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 好吧，这对我来说似乎很合理。
 是的，如果您愿意跟进并确认时间表，我们将不胜感激。
 我希望我们达成一致的主要事情是，我们确实需要所有答案和计划更新，以便在 5 月 9 日的会议上获得任何结果。
 维持 5 月 21 日关闭的现实可能性。
 所以，你知道，如果在讨论时间表并与我们联系时，我们似乎正在进入一个可能无法提供所要求的一切的境地。
 如果您愿意的话，我当然愿意在 5 月 21 日之后探索一个非常短的延期，但我现在只是让您知道，为了真正满足 5 月 21 日的日期，我们需要
 一切都已经趋于一致，我们只是在讨论 5 月 9 日这一天的豁免和提案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9955.037s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我明白。
 我相信，由于三个学科中的两个学科都可以提供同行评审意见，如果我们能尽快保持文明态度，我们的工作人员肯定会努力确保我们收到答复，并可以在未来的听证会上提供意见，以回应意见和问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10041.06s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 当然。

 当我重新启动计算机时，我必须这样做，很多东西都关闭了，我注意到以前的东西不起作用。
 但我们有行政更新，所以我想既然大家​​都在场，我们只是想讨论另一次会议的时间安排？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10068.429s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 是的当然。
 然后我得到了一些答案。
 所以这与电流无关，否则你会听到
 董事会需要安排一次额外的特别会议。
 随后，4 月 3 日，董事会收到了在神秘大道举行听证会的申请和请求。
 40B，由 HAC 返回给董事会。
 这就是为什么我们需要在 30 天内重新举行听证会。
 由于通知要求，我们有时会需要它。
 基本上是4月29日这一周。
 所以我向董事会核实了两位候选人的日期：4 月 30 日和 5 月 2 日。
 这将是一次简短的会议，我们不会听取证词。
 让我们执行一些程序步骤，然后继续。
 我们可以让候选人自我介绍。
 但我收到了回复，看来 4 号到 30 号都有空位。
 因此，4 日至 30 日将是该特别会议的日期。
 议程上唯一的项目将是此案。
 正如我所说，这将是一次程序性会议。
 因此，市议会应考虑授权市政府聘请同行评审顾问。
 我的意思是，谈论 40B 顾问并选择一个日期来解决这个问题，以便有时间雇用这些顾问。
 所以是的。
 我估计我们可以在 30 分钟或更短的时间内完成此任务。
 但没有任何承诺，但选定的日期是 4 月 30 日星期二下午 6:30。
 听起来不错吗，丹尼斯？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10229.028s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 明天我会把通知寄给报纸。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10262.405s">[Denis MacDougall]</a>: 只是会议记录的批准，我相信是我发送的。
