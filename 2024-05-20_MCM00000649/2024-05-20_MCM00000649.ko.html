    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=455.983s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  Great.
 Thanks, Pat.
 As Pat said, I'm Steve Moderano with Bowler.
 Hopefully everybody can see the slides at this point, but we'll just walk you through kind of high level on the civil engineering side, and I'll turn it over to one of our landscape architects to talk through some of the landscape elements after.
 obviously open to questions, but I'll go through the presentation and then hopefully this is a good Q&A and we can answer questions that you have and go back to any slides if you want to pull anything back up.
 Generally, we're going to run through some of the information you may have seen on previous hearings, but just give you the update of where we are, site circulation, pedestrians and vehicular circulation.
 What we're doing on Myrtle Street and Amaranth and how those change, we think, for the better.
 What our parking plans are, how we accommodate the existing uses that are to remain on the site, and how we are parking for the new multifamily development.
 fire truck circulation, how that works.
 And then I'll walk you through the utility plans as well, talk a little bit about the infrastructure and conversations we've had with the public works department to date.
 And then we'll walk you through some of the landscape elements and lighting and things of that nature.
 So that's our agenda tonight.
 Obviously, we'd be happy to talk about anything, but that's what the presentation focuses on.
 So this is the site plan as it stands today.
 You can see lot A is really the existing self-storage facility.
 So that is the building to remain.
 The left side of the site is the new multifamily building.
 We have the two shaded colors.
 Those are to
 to indicate where the roof changes are.
 The white is the higher elements that are tucked into the site, and the gray is where we have stepped the building down as we get near the existing residential areas.
 Then the circulation, and we'll get into the details of it, but it shows the circulation patterns that go from Amaranth.
 around the property and access out to the Fellsway and to Myrtle Street.
 We'll get into the details there.
 Then you have six townhomes along Myrtle Street as well.
 That was just a quick refresh.
 This is just a snapshot of what we're starting with just to give some context of you can kind of see how these buildings have come together over the years.
 So there's a nice division of the existing building to remain.
 And then these are the buildings that are not in the best condition today that will be coming down as part of the development.
 But really the site today is virtually 100% impervious.
 A couple, there's a couple of shrubs and a little grass growth through the pavement, but otherwise it's an impervious site today, well, property line to property line.
 In the proposed development this this slide just shows how pedestrians get around where people walking where they going to where they coming from and how do they really get in and out of the buildings.
 So, obviously, just starting on the outside we've got a bus stop and then there's there's.
 sidewalks along Myrtle Street and we'll get into the sidewalk and streetscape we're introducing to Amaranth that doesn't exist on this side today.
 Then we have a connection path down to what hopefully becomes a rail trail in the future, but we're planning for that access and think that's an important connection.
 Hopefully, that comes to fruition and we're able to make that connection, but we're planning for it and putting it into today.
 Walking around the building, we'll start at the main entrance.
 So this is the main entrance.
 We do have
 you know, sort of a ceremonial drop-off.
 We'll get to the vehicular patterns in a moment, but this is really the visitor entrance, people coming to the building for the first time.
 This is where they'll be.
 If you punch in your Myrtle Street address, it's going to bring you to this location.
 So this is really the ceremonial or new arrival folks coming in.
 So this is the main entrance door here coming around counterclockwise.
 We have a bike room with connections right out to this red line coming along the edge is really a wider multi-use path feel there going along adjacent to the bike room and getting you that
 as I mentioned, hopefully a future connection to the rail trail.
 But we'll put this part in now and we think it works well with some screening we're trying to accomplish on that side and some other things we're doing over there.
 We have another egress there.
 Some of these are just required stairs, so they do create new egress points, and we connect out to the pathway there.
 On the back here, there is an elevator on the backside of the building and an egress here, so that's sort of a back residential entrance, also has a connection out to the pathway.
 This is more back of house operations here, but there is an egress door there.
 We have a sidewalk all along this edge of the building, and this is another egress into the building, a staircase, and this is the elevated bank.
 So, you might get some of these exterior residential parking spaces have access right into the elevators versus going around to the main lobby.
 That's the gist of how the pedestrians move around the site and some of those key points of what's happening on the edges of the building.
 And then this just demonstrates the vehicular patterns, which really you can come in and out of Amaranth.
 This is generally where the curb cut is today, and we've got a little more detail on that.
 But that would be a full access curb cut there.
 You do have the ceremonial curb cut and myrtle to get into the turnaround and they do have the ability to come in and get into the garage or park if it was not just a quick visitor drop off.
 And then we think that the majority of the traffic is coming right in and right out of the Fells Way entrance, because that is the most direct route into the garage.
 So just path of least resistance, easiest travel pattern for residents who are coming in and out on a more regular basis, that seems like a pretty natural pattern.
 Generally, I think the site circulation is probably pretty similar to what we've discussed in the past.
 And then we do have some short-term visitor parking there, could be pizza delivery, Uber pickup can occur in this sort of turnaround area, and future residents hopefully are coming in there to the main entrance and getting that feel as they come in here, and a place for some short-term parking there.
 This gets into the detail of what are we doing, I mentioned we're making some improvements to Amaranth and Myrtle Street and so just looking at what's out there today, there's just some really wide curb cuts that exist today.
 right at the intersection, which is really not the ideal place for a curb cut into a property is in the middle of a pretty complicated intersection already.
 It's multiple legs coming in at unusual angles.
 So we'll be closing that, but there's 43 feet of curb cut, 84 and 17 is sort of a narrow entrance into the property.
 So it's a little bit of an unusual layout.
 There's some telephone poles, there's building projections.
 It's really an industrial back of house feel on the project side of Amaranth.
 So in the future, we want to really dress that up.
 curve it like a regular road.
 The yellow, we'd introduce some new parking lanes that don't exist there today.
 So you get some landscape bump outs in there.
 We have a bump out at the corner to shorten any pedestrian crossings and really formalize this parking lane.
 And I'll talk a little bit about how that marries well with what's happening on Myrtle Street.
 But this really becomes a finished road.
 Right now it's finished on the opposite side where the other residential community is.
 It's a more traditional roadway.
 This really finishes off this side of the road and provides
 180 linear feet of parking lane, which is about 9 to 12 cars can fit in there, and there's no parking on this side today.
 And then down here, we introduce a 24-foot, which is a traditional width curb cut.
 It matches up opposite the other residential access driveway, similar widths, makes a nice T-intersection at the end of Amaranth, and again, really finishes it off more properly than the current condition.
 Similar look, what's happening on Myrtle Street today.
 We heard from the community, Myrtle Street's a challenge, right?
 It's a two-lane, two-direction road, traffic going both directions.
 But as you can see, we put the dimension on here.
 When you have cars parked on both sides, it effectively becomes
 about a 10 foot wide road, which is the challenge, right?
 So two cars cannot pass if there's cars parked all along Myrtle Street.
 It's about 330 feet of parking lane.
 And I'll get back to that number, but just that's what the yellow zone shows, about 330 feet of parking lane.
 But the real challenge we're trying to solve is how do we improve that 10 foot conflict of cars coming in and out at the same time?
 So what we've done, you can see where these parked cars are in the image.
 That's where the yellow was.
 That is the parking lane today.
 We're pushing the proposals to push the parking lane into the private property, push the sidewalk into the private property.
 And what that does is obviously widens the throughway, widens the road.
 You'll have approximately 18 feet car to car, depends on how they park, but we're given pretty generous.
 It's probably 18 to 20 or 21 feet between parked cars if they're parking as close to the curb as they should.
 but at least 18 feet, which is passable for cars going in the opposite direction.
 So we think that that addresses the concern we heard from the community.
 There are some elements that need to be in that zone.
 So the yellow is more broken up than just 330 straight feet, because we will have accessible ramps and things that you don't want to push those back into the parked cars.
 They do want to project out.
 um and shorten the crossing and make the pedestrians more visible so we have that there and then there um we need some room around our proposed entrance and there's some electrical infrastructure uh telephone pole and guy wire that maybe they can be modified a little bit to create a little more room but um we're just we're out you know we're leaving we're respecting what's what's there from from electrical infrastructure so
 The net is today there's about 330 feet of parking lanes between the two roads.
 When we're done, we'll increase that by about 40 feet to about 370 total feet.
 So the net is today you probably fit 16 to 20 cars.
 in the parking lanes, that'll increase to about 18 to 20 or 22 cars.
 We were trying to get net neutral, but we actually were able to pick up about two car lengths of parking between the two roads.
 We think it's a good approach to the roads.
 It will definitely finish them off a little better, create these bump outs, some landscape elements, some better visibility at the crossings for the pedestrians, and Ambrance becomes a fully complete road and not half a road with an industrial side.
 Just that's our thinking and our approach and the net impact of those.
 And then on the Fellsway, it's really just the realignment of the existing curb cut and then bringing it up to DCR standards.
 So there's some modifications over there, but that curb cut exists today.
 We're just relocating it.
 And then we have a significant reduction overall.
 There's about 45 feet of curb cut on Myrtle today.
 It goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 There's 100 feet of curb cut on Amaranth that goes down to a single 24-foot curb cut.
 And there's a slight increase on the Fells Way in total curb cut width, but that's just to bring it up to current TCR standards.
 So just to give you an effect of how we're handling the curb cuts.
 This slide has a lot of color, and we're going to break it down into smaller chunks.
 But I just want to give you a snapshot of where people are parking.
 So all the colors are different.
 We have the sort of the teal or just regular pedestrian, I mean, regular vehicle parking spaces.
 The pink are electric vehicles.
 The blues and purples are accessible spaces.
 The reds are short-term spaces.
 And green are loading zones or loading spaces.
 Here's the summary of that, and then I'll break it down to what each of those numbers are.
 But effectively, lot A is the self-storage to remain.
 We have 22 parking spaces dedicated to lot A. Then lot B, which is the residential lot, we have a total of 324 parking spaces for lot B.
 So how does that break down?
 And just where are these spaces?
 So this is really the lot B spaces for the multifamily and the residential components.
 Obviously, the teal is the bulk of the parking.
 We spread the accessible spaces in the garage around.
 Those are to be at the elevator banks.
 As I mentioned, we have two elevator banks.
 There's a larger elevator bank up by the main lobby, but there is the rear elevator bank.
 So we provide some accessible spaces back there.
 The electric vehicle charging, we basically flanked the garage entrance with electric vehicles.
 So we have 14 on the left.
 And really we have six, sorry, I'm looking at my numbers here.
 We have four on the right, which is two traditional charging stations and then two that will be accessible charging spaces with accessible chargers.
 So really just trying to think forward and provide those accommodations.
 And then to the right of those, there's some outdoor accessible parking spaces.
 And then obviously the townhomes each have two spaces, one in a garage and one in the driveway.
 This is short-term and loading where those operations happening on site and then bicycle parking.
 So the purple over here is the bike parking room and some exterior bike racks are over in this corner.
 So really just playing off of that multi-use path that we're creating along Amaranth.
 Going around clockwise, we have a couple of spaces here.
 This is a pull up and drop somebody off.
 Uber driver doing a quick pickup.
 It's not a leave your vehicle there.
 That's a live loading operation.
 The four spaces again that I said earlier, this is short term parking that pizza delivery happening, a future resident coming in to meet the staff for reviewing and that type of short term use.
 And then we just again highlighted some of the building operations here.
 the orange are the staircases, and then along the back of the building, we have the stair with the elevator core in the back towards the middle of the building.
 That is really we're just indicating this is where move-in move-outs are likely to occur.
 Because it does have that direct elevator access through that door there.
 And then the other green loading zone, that's trash pickup.
 So that's a trash and recycling room in that back corner.
 They can wheel it right out, be picked up.
 And it's a wide route for the vehicles to maneuver through the property.
 So we think operationally, those are the components that we need.
 And just want to give you some insight as to how we pick those locations.
 And this just gives you a quick snapshot of what's happening on the existing self-storage lot, we're calling it Lot A. So Lot A has parking in the rear and parking up towards the Fellsway-Myrtle intersection.
 That's where regular passenger vehicles, people coming to the
 park and bring stuff out of their unit or lease a new unit.
 Again, some accessible parking spaces as required at the main entrance.
 Then the green are the loading zones.
 That's where the loading activities occur.
 The bulk of it is where it happens today on the front of the building, but there is some loading that occurs in the rear as well.
 Just to give you an idea of what's happening and remaining on lot A.
 This is just fire truck turning, again, vehicular access and looking at do we have, does the layout work, right?
 Does the fire department have proper access?
 Can they get around the building?
 This just shows they can come in Amaranth, they could come in Myrtle, they can get out either.
 We have next slide that shows that you can also get out the Fellsway, but really this is to demonstrate as far as
 A development goes, we have 360-degree access for the fire department around the building, which is their ideal scenario.
 All the lanes are 24-foot travel lanes, which is well above the minimum fire lane width.
 So we feel it gives them pretty good access.
 We've met with the fire department.
 They did not have any issues with our approach to access.
 So, I think it's probably because it's a good approach, I think.
 360 degrees is their ideal scenario.
 So, this just demonstrates how that the trucks can get in and out off of the Fellsway.
 Obviously, very major road there, plenty of width for them to come in, but just shows a route that they could get around the whole building without backing up.
 And then real high level infrastructure look and update on what we've talked about with engineering is water pressures are good.
 We have some hydrant testing.
 There will be more hydrant testing as the project moves forward, but pressures are in the 80 PSI range, which is really a strong number.
 And
 The fire department was happy to see that.
 The water department did not have any concerns with capacity to serve a project like this.
 And then the project does intend to loop Amaranth system around to Myrtle, which is helpful to those two streets.
 It does provide some additional redundancy and ability for water to flow both ways.
 If the DPW ever had to come in to do a maintenance operation, it could shut off and it could be fed through our site.
 So you get some redundancy in the area, which is helpful to the water department.
 Sewer, similar story.
 So the sewer department or engineering department did not have issues.
 They do not have known issues with capacity out here.
 We've run some capacity analysis.
 There's relatively good sized mains in the area.
 So there's not a concern with the capacity to feed our project.
 And on a project this size, there's a requirement called I&I removal, inflow and infiltration removal.
 So there's water in
 infrastructure in a city like Medford is older and there's known issues that the engineering department has a list of some projects that need to be done in the area that would be taking stormwater or some other connection that shouldn't be entering the sewer system.
 And a project like this will be mitigating what we put in
 at a four to one ratio.
 So we're effectively will complete projects in this general vicinity that will ultimately when the projects are all completed, there will be more capacity in the sewer system.
 Even though we're adding some flow to it, we have to take more of the I&I, the flow, the stormwater flow that shouldn't be in the system.
 We have to take that out, which will create new capacity in the system when we're done.
 Sewer capacity is usually not an issue.
 It's not an issue here on day one, and it will improve as the project completes the mitigation.
 And my last slide is just stormwater.
 A site like this, it's always an improvement, right?
 Just to get rid of some of the impervious coverage, introduce some landscaping, introduce trees.
 That inherently is an improvement to quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff.
 In addition, you can see we have a fair amount of infrastructure we're proposing there's there's a large system on the backside of the building that that will capture hold water on our site even more, more than just the landscaping.
 So we'll hold some water and systems will provide some infiltration there.
 and there'll be treatment devices to take out sands and oils and debris that would normally run off of parking lots.
 We capture it and it'll be disposed of without getting into the city system, which helps the city achieve their MS4 goals.
 Then we have another sizable system up closer to the townhouses to handle that side of the site.
 That's a super high level of drainage.
 get we could have a whole half hour if you want on drainage, but I'll leave it at that.
 And I'm going to hand it over to Masoud.
 And again, that was a ton of information at a high level.
 So I'm happy to come back after and answer any questions on the on the infrastructure and engineering side.

 예, Blue Bikes는 우리가 Blue Bikes를 자주 선택하는 이유를 알려 드리고자 합니다. 우리는 Blue Bikes를 사유지에 두기를 원하지만 공공 보도 옆 눈에 잘 띄는 곳에 사람들이 알 수 있도록 합니다.
 그래서 우리가 이 위치를 선택한 이유지만, 분명히 그 각도에서 보면 어느 정도 유연성이 있습니다.
 파란색 바퀴는 다르게 생각합니다.
 우리는 새 집을 찾을 것이지만 그것은 의미가 있습니다.
 버스 정류장에서.
 사람들은 파란색 자전거를 타고 주차된 버스까지 타고 갈 수도 있고, 버스를 타고 파란색 자전거에서 내릴 수도 있는데...
 집에 더 가깝습니다.
 그래서 이곳은 좋은 곳이에요.
 우리는 이것이 프로젝트에 좋은 추가라고 생각합니다.
 이것으로 프레젠테이션을 마칩니다.
 Pat, 마지막 메모가 있는지 아니면 끝내고 싶은지 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2470.844s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 응, 알. 나한테는 그게 꽤 안 좋은 것 같아. BT도 나한테는 안 맞는 것 같다. 나는 먼저 몇몇 블루 팀들과 이야기를 나눠서 알아봤습니다.
 배치 타당성에 대한 귀하의 의견.
 전반적으로 그들은 규모뿐만 아니라 적합하다고 생각하는 다른 역과의 근접성 측면에서도 좋은 위치라는 점에 동의했습니다.
 그래서 우리는 도시 및 Bluebikes와 협력하여 그곳에 정거장을 추가할 것을 확실히 제안하고 싶습니다.
 하지만 공개 발표가 끝나면
 우리가 좀 유연해질 거라는 걸 알기 때문에 마지막에 조언을 해줄 것 같아요.
 다음은 토목 공학 프로젝트의 일환으로 우리가 수행하는 일부 건설 작업에 대한 간략한 설명입니다.
 간단히 말해서, 디자인, 조경, 편의 시설, 주차 및 눈에 보이는 모든 것이 함께 작동합니다.
 모두를 안심시키기 위해 이것은 무작위 컬렉션이 아닙니다.
 우리는 질문에 답변하고 Bowler가 민사 소송에서 시에 요청한 내용과 동료들의 생각에 대한 자세한 내용을 제공하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다.
 체험판을 완료했습니다.
 따라서 Steve가 앞서 언급했듯이 이러한 사항은 우리가 살펴보고 다루거나 확장하고 싶은 사항입니다.
 우리는 항상 그러한 질문에 답할 수 있는지 확인하고 싶기 때문에 프레젠테이션에 문제가 있는 사람을 원하지 않습니다.
 동료 검토 및 후속 의견에도 동일하게 적용됩니다.
 그래서 그냥 끝내려고 합니다.
 따라서 우리가 모두에게 너무 바쁘지는 않기를 바라지만, 우리가 필요하다고 생각하는 모든 주제를 다루고 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 그럼 닫고 질문을 위해 열어보겠습니다.</p>

 그래서 나는 이것을 가지고 있습니다.
 프레젠테이션 파워포인트를 사용하여 우리가 메일로 받는 트래픽에 대한 의견을 요약할 수 있었습니다.
 그러면 보여드릴 수 있어요.
 우리 토목 기술자인 Bill McGrath로부터 몇 가지 제안이 있습니다.
 저는 이 프로젝트를 찾고 있습니다. 그는 이번 주에 휴가 중이지만 그 사람의 이메일 목록이 있습니다.
 나는 프레젠테이션에 서명했다.
 원하시면 목록을 읽어드릴 수 있지만 자세한 질문이 있으신 경우 답변해 드릴 수 없습니다.

 나는 일반 조명을 받은 풍경과 그것이 어두운 하늘과 어떻게 조화를 이루는지 감상합니다.
 우리가 다루고자 하는 요구와 요소 측면에서 보면 매우 광범위한 개념이라고 생각합니다.
 건물 입구와 정면(머틀 스트리트 입구)의 교차점에 대해 말씀하시는지 질문이 있습니다.
 내 유일한 관심사는 주소의 관점인 것 같습니다. Google 지도, Apple 지도 및 낯선 사람이 머틀 스트리트 입구 대신 Fellsway 입구를 가리켜야 한다고 해서 이 건물을 머틀 스트리트 주소에 관계없이 970 Fellsway라고 불러야 할까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2809.941s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 네, 대답할 수 있어요.
 필요한 경우 해당 부동산은 분할되며 주거용 부동산에는 Fellsway 정면이 없으므로 Fellsway 주소가 없습니다.
 970은 저장 주소로 남을 가능성이 높습니다.
 오늘날 이 모든 것이 하나의 패키지에 담겨 있어 970이라고 불립니다.
 하지만 현재 건물은 그 명칭을 그대로 유지하게 됩니다.
 새 건물에는 주소가 있으며 Muerta 또는 Amaranto에만 주소가 있을 수 있습니다.
 머틀이 현재 후보인 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=2908.533s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 네, 저는 춤을 출 수 있어요.
 첫 번째 질문부터 시작해서 이웃들과 만나서 프로젝트에 관해 많은 논의를 나눴습니다.
 어려운 점 중 하나는 야외 공간을 만드는 일인데, 이웃에게 전화를 걸면 우연히 마주치는 경우가 많습니다.
 나는 당신이 말한 것을 잘못 해석하고 싶지 않지만 일반적으로 물리적 장비 밖에서 노는 것이 일부 이웃에게는 그다지 재미 있지 않다는 인상을 받았습니다.
 그들은 그것을 사용하는 것을 스스로 상상할 필요가 없습니다.
 우리가 말하고자 하는 것은 계획된 열린 공간이 커뮤니티에 도움이 되기를 원하며 그들이 보고 싶은 것이 있으면 피드백에 열려 있다는 것입니다.
 다음은 제가 지금까지 받은 일반적인 답변입니다.
 공공미술을 가리킨다.
 이 질문에 대한 대답은 '예'입니다. 이는 우리가 생각할 수 있는지 여부에 달려 있습니다.
 구체적인 정보가 없습니다.
 구체적인 아이디어를 염두에 두십시오.
 최근 아키텍처 중심 리뷰를 통해 우리는 피어 리뷰를 통해 이 문제를 계속해서 해결할 것임을 배웠다고 생각합니다.
 포기하고 싶지는 않지만 다음에 데이비스 스퀘어의 건축가와 건물의 외관이 만날 때 풍경 요소가 현재 대화의 최전선에 놓이게 될 것이라고 믿습니다.
 이것이 우리가 더 많이 생각하려고 하는 것입니다.
 우리가 마침내 공식적인 공공 미술 디자인을 갖게 될 것이라고 보장할 수 있을지 모르겠습니다.
 이는 아직 결정될 수 없는 사항이지만 일반적으로 질문에 대답하자면 '예'입니다. 사이트의 일부로 사이트의 다른 영역에 이를 포함할 의향이 있습니다.
 이사회 구성원이나 커뮤니티 구성원이 무엇을 해야 할지, 어디서 해야 할지에 대한 제안이 있으면 언제든지 알려주세요.
 솔직히 말해서, 우리가 건물의 계획과 건물의 모습을 논의할 때 그는 매우 도움이 되었습니다.</p>

 사실, 나는 단지 당신이 말한 것에 대해 후속 조치를 취한 것에 대해 사과하고 싶습니다.
 나에게 흥미로운 점(그리고 이것이 사실이라고 생각하는지 궁금합니다)은 내가 이야기한 모든 이웃이 머틀 스트리트의 이웃이라는 것입니다. 즉, 그들은 모두 집과 마당이었습니다.
 근처에 큰 마당이 없는 것 같은 아파트에 대해 Amaranth Place 거주자와 이야기해 본 적이 있습니까?
 이곳이 바로 이곳이니까
 사무실은 이러한 아파트 건물이 개방된 공간으로부터 이익을 얻을 것이라고 믿습니다.
 나는 이것을 확인하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3128.948s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 아니요, 좋은 질문입니다.

 우리는 진행 중인 건축 프로젝트의 일환으로 Baumer 견적 담당자로부터 이 의견을 받았습니다.
 우리는 계획에 따라 이 방의 치수를 완성하고 평면도는 동일하게 유지합니다.
 우리는 현재 이 방의 공간을 정의하는 작업을 진행하고 있으며 아이디어를 내고 있습니다.
 우리는 자전거에 중점을 두고 머리 위나 벽에 있는 다양한 크기의 자전거 보관함과 시계 스탠드를 살펴보고 공간의 효율성을 극대화하려고 노력했습니다.
 그래서 숫자에 관해서는 구체적인 답변이 없지만 방에 있는 정사각형 이미지에 관해서는 지금 그 답변을 다듬고 있으며 아마도 건물을 살펴본 후 다음 프레젠테이션에서 적어도 하나는 있을 것입니다.
 감사합니다
 안타깝게도 이는 건물의 자전거 보관소에 있는 자전거에만 적용됩니다.
 우리는 자전거 보관함이 있는 홀 바깥쪽 공간을 보여주었습니다.
 내 생각엔 우리도 이걸로 돈을 좀 벌 수 있을 것 같아.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3509.002s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 좋아요, 주차에 관한 제 의견을 계속해도 될까요?
 지난 40B 프로젝트에서 우리는 가장 자주 다루어야 했던 문제 중 하나인 주차에 대해 살펴보았습니다.
 따라서 오토바이와 전기자전거가 그 어느 때보다 대중화되고 있는 상황에서 자전거 시트의 디자인을 고려할 때.
 아시다시피, 가끔 이런 것들로는 진압하기 어려운 화재가 발생하기도 합니다.
 그래서 저는 그 점을 고려하여 그곳이 화재로부터 안전한 곳인지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 응, 그 지역.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3548.73s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 자전거 보관소는 1층, 포디엄 층에 있으며 불연성 건물입니다.
 분명히 우리는 프로젝트가 설계 문서와 건설 문서에 도달한 다음 코드 검토를 위해 제출할 때 이러한 사항을 알 수 있습니다.
 하지만 우리는 그것을 놀이터로 생각하는 것이 좋습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3579.455s">[kCdGHg1OaMo_SPEAKER_21]</a>: 짐?
 예, 같은 주제로, 화재 위험으로 인해 전기자전거 탑승이 금지된 곳이 많이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3601.675s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 이것은 좋은 질문입니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3666.182s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 그렇다면 이 건물은 어떤 모습이며, 현재 진행 중인 프로젝트는 무엇인가요?
 플랫폼 건물입니다.
 현재의 형성은 정점에 도달했습니다.
 5가지 건물 요소가 하나로, 4가지 요소가 하나로 통합되었습니다.
 또 다른 요점은 내화성 수준입니다. 강철이든 콘크리트이든 공식적으로 지정되지는 않지만 내화성 수준 위에는 나무 프레임이 있어야 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3702.173s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 나는 본다
 제가 묻는 이유는
 이전 40B 청문회에서 이 문제를 논의하는 데 너무 많은 시간을 소비한 이유 중 하나는 이 건물이 비슷한 건물이었고 당시 건물 위원이 Waltham에서 화재(이 경우 구조 화재)를 직접 경험했기 때문입니다.
 하지만 기본적으로 그것은 지어진 건물의 유형입니다.
 어떤 경우에는 화재 위험이 높습니다.
 그러니 다른 컬렉션을 볼 때 이 점을 명심하세요.
 제 생각에는 방향, 특히 같은 유형의 건물에 대한 방향이 아마도 여기에 도달하는 가장 좋은 방법일 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3745.348s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 예, 이해했습니다. 좋은 지적입니다.
 완료 측면에서 프로젝트는 코드를 완전히 준수하고 검토 프로세스를 거치게 됩니다.
 그런 다음 건설 중에 건물 관리자는 Medford Fire Department와 협력하여 NFPA 241 계획을 개발하고 모든 해당 코드 및 규정을 준수합니다.
 우리는 목재 프레임 구조의 유형과 이와 관련된 위험을 충분히 검토합니다.
 좋아요, 고마워요.</p>

 왜냐면 별로 좋아보이지 않거든요.
 내 말은, 우리는 향후 5~10년 안에 전기 자동차로의 급속한 전환에 대해 이야기하고 있다는 뜻입니다.
 분명히 가장 큰 장애물 중 하나는 충전소의 가용성입니다.
 이에 대해 좀 더 설명해 주시면 좋을 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3822.498s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 네, Pat이 제가 이걸 하길 바라나요?
 그들이 어디에 있는지 말해주지.
 이미지를 다시 화면으로 가져와 우리가 시작한 위치를 보여 드리겠습니다.
 그러면 건물의 특징에 대해 이야기하겠습니다.
 여기를 조금 확대해 보세요.
 이번에도 14개의 장소가 있는데, 그 중 2개는 오래되었고, 2개는 접근 가능합니다.
 배관 및 설치 인프라는 오프프레미스에 설치하기 어려울 수 있으므로 인프라를 바로 사용할 수 있도록 첫날부터 모든 것이 준비되어 있어야 합니다.
 확장 옵션을 사용하면 차고에 접근할 수 있지만 차고가 없습니다.
 미리 계획하고 적절한 전기 인프라를 설치하면 차고에 설치하는 것이 쉽습니다. 그렇죠?
 변압기, 분전반 등
 우리는 미래를 위한 이러한 힘을 키우기 위해 준비해야 합니다.
 우리는 미리 계획을 세우고 그 계획을 실행해야 합니다.
 시퀀스 설계 단계에 들어가면 전기 회사와 이 작업을 조정할 것입니다.
 그러나 일단 이 중요한 인프라를 갖추면 차고 지붕에 파이프를 설치할 수 있으므로 차고에 장비를 추가하는 것이 좀 더 쉬워집니다.
 원하는 곳 어디에서나 재생하고 언제든지 스테이션을 추가하세요.
 이것이 우리가 현장에 도착하여 첫날부터 가장 어려운 일을 찾고 유연성을 보장하는 방법입니다.
 Anjanita가 말했듯이 빠르게 확장되고 있습니다.
 앞으로 몇 년 동안 수요가 어떻게 될지는 알 수 없지만 충족하기는 쉬울 것입니다.
 Pat, 이 건물에 대해 또 뭐라고 말씀하실 수 있는지 궁금합니다.
 이것이 전기차의 확장 가능성에 대한 나의 생각이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=3946.569s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 그래서 나는 당신이 머리에 못을 박았다고 생각합니다.
 우리의 사고 과정은 건물 구조의 일부로서 건물 외부에 EV 충전기를 장착하는 것입니다.
 청문회에 참석한 시의회 의원과 다른 사람들이 건물 밖에 충전기를 두고 싶다고 말하는 것을 들었습니다.
 따라서 우리는 현장 작업이 전기 인프라 규모를 적절하게 조정한다는 측면에서 강력하고 유연한 향후 확장을 통해 할 수 있는 일이라고 생각합니다. 단, 연단 수준, 소방 건물 수준, 지붕에 파이프를 설치하고 전기 자동차 충전소를 추가할 수 있는 차고 수준까지 이 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다.
 공평하게 말하면 Davis는 다른 프로젝트에서 성공을 거두었으며 수요나 관심이 증가함에 따라 더 많은 프로젝트를 추가할 수도 있습니다.
 실제로 전기 인프라를 조정하는 문제입니다.
 아시다시피 Steve가 말한 내용을 반영하지만 저에게서 직접 듣는 것은 우리가 사이트를 설계한 방법의 일부일 뿐이며 왜 그들이 사이트에 앉아 미래에 건물이 성장함에 따라 변화하는 것을 볼 수 있는지에 대한 아이디어로 생각했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4033.358s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 네, 내부 확장에 관심을 가져주셔서 기쁘다는 말씀을 드리고 싶습니다.
 주차공간이 너무 많아서 첫날에도 전기차를 충전할 수 있을 것 같아요.
 나는 확실히 더 많은 것을 추천할 것이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4058.579s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 이것은 우리가 실제로 살펴볼 수 있는 것입니다.
 정량적 평가에 대해서는 구체적인 답변을 드릴 수 없으나, 귀하의 지시사항을 귀담아듣고 반드시 반영하도록 하겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4075.973s">[Unidentified]</a>: 감사합니다
 그렇다면 이러한 고속 충전소는 어디에 있습니까? 아니면 사람들이 차를 주차하고 밤새 충전하기를 원하는 곳은 어디입니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4087.797s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 이것은 좋은 질문입니다.
 레벨이 많은 것 같아요.
 모든 것에는 에너지 인프라와의 조정이 필요합니다. 즉, 얻을 수 있는 전력의 양과 필요한 전력 유형을 분배하는 데 필요한 상자의 크기입니다.
 고속충전소가 더 많은 것 같다고 말씀드릴 수 있겠네요.
 그러한 건물의 경우, 그 크기만 고려하면 이는 정상적이거나 비정형적인 것으로 간주될 수 있습니다.
 명확한 대답이 없습니다.
 가능한 한 효율적으로 만들고 싶지만 나중에 전기 엔지니어와 측정하고 서비스 제공업체와 협력하여 해당 위치에 도달할 수 있는 전력량을 확인할 수 있을 때 충전소를 수량화해야 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4141.656s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 이러한 유형의 개발에서는 사람들이 밤새 집에 가서 차를 주차하기 때문에 일반 충전기만 사용한다는 점은 주목할 가치가 있습니다.
 따라서 1박당 가격은 정상적인 비즈니스 활동에 장애가 되지 않습니다.
 주기가 더 짧다면 이 시점에서는 더 빨리 임신해야 합니다.
 괜찮은</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4170.979s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 알았어
 그러나 동일한 14명이 매일 밤 14개 장소를 사용하고 있고 체크아웃할 장소가 300개 이상인 경우 해당 장소를 계속 사용하게 됩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4186.36s">[Unidentified]</a>: 네, 그게 내 말이에요.
 이것이 내 생각이다.
 전기차 이용자를 위한 공간인가요? 아니면 Andrew의 의견으로는 그들이 부지런하지 않고 더 빨리 충전하지 않는다면 그 공간을 임차인에게 주고 그 공간을 사용하여 배터리를 충전한 다음 차를 옮겨서 다른 사람들이 사용할 수 있도록 할 수 있을까요?
 그건 그렇고, 이것은 분명히 단지 아이디어일 뿐입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4210.198s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 그렇습니다. 이것은 우리가 포기해야 할 것입니다.

 당신이 말하는 환경에서는 더 많은 것이 필요하다고 즉시 판단되면 번호를 차단하는 환경에서는 쉽게 추가할 수 있어서 편안함을 느끼는 것 같아요.
 이렇게 하면 사람들이 업무 때문에 자동차를 충전할 수 없는 경우 향후 더 많은 충전소를 설치할 수 있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4244.893s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 글쎄, 나는 이 기사에서 한 가지만 말할 것이다: 그것은 추운 기후이다.
 그렇기 때문에 전기차에는 최소한의 실내 공간이 필요하다고 생각합니다.
 이렇게 하면 이해하기 쉽습니다.
 인프라를 설치하기 전에 계획을 세우는 것을 잊지 마십시오.
 따라서 미래의 시청자들이 자신의 계획이 무엇인지, 무엇을 찾고 있는지, 얼마나 확장할 수 있는지, 공간이 있는지 여부를 아는 것이 도움이 될 것입니다. 예를 들어 오늘 공간이 어디에 있는지 아시나요?
 주차나 현재 레이아웃으로 모든 것이 외부에 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4304.051s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 설치 권장 형상점으로 표시됩니다.
 제가 몇 분 후에 말했듯이 우리는 의견을 이해하고 사용 가능한 공간이 얼마나 되는지 알아보고 오늘 제공하는 것이 충분하지 않은 경우 이에 대해 약간의 조사를 한 다음 우리가 좋다고 생각하는 것으로 응답할 수 있습니다.
 그렇다면 귀하는 추가 내부 또는 외부 지급을 받지 않습니다.
 그러므로 우리 시대의 예는 이 개념에서 독특합니다.
 좋아요, 고마워요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4340.081s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 위원회에 질문이나 의견이 있습니까?
 내가 묻지 않은 질문들:
 가능한 스쿨버스 주차 위치.
 그래서 현재로서는 가장 가까운 버스 정류장은 모르지만, 현재 공업지역에서 사용되고 있고 새 건물에 거주하는 가족들도 있을 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 이 숙소 근처에 스쿨버스가 정차하는 곳은 어디인가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4387.755s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: 개인적으로 저는 역이나 노선을 잘 보지 않습니다.
 머틀 로드로 갈지, 근처 도로로 갈지는 모르겠지만, 배송팀에 전화해서 어디인지는 확실히 알 수 있을 것 같습니다.
 내 생각에 머틀의 확장은 우리가 아직 탐구하지 않았지만 고려하고 싶은 몇 가지 새로운 가능성을 열어준다고 생각합니다.</p>

 이베트입니다.
 남은 메모리 용량에 대해서는 확인 후 사라지셨다면 죄송합니다. 일시적인 네트워크 문제가 발생했습니다.
 건물을 개조해야 합니까?
 우리가 공공 안전에 대해 이야기하고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 물론 어딘가에 있을 수도 있지만 그들은 대규모 산업 단지 옆에 있습니다.
 그렇다면 이 분야에서 개선을 돕기 위해 어떤 일이 일어나고 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4459.498s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 일반적으로 어떻습니까?
 이것은 매우 좋은 질문입니다.
 우리는 그것을 만지지 않습니다.
 이곳을 개선할 아이디어가 정말 많습니다.
 그것은 당신의 사고 과정을 방해할 수 있습니다.
 우리는 두 가지 주요 유형의 도메인을 고려합니다.
 스티브, 이거 지워줄래?
 전체 사이트 계획은 참고용입니다.
 첫 번째는 Fellsway에 있으며, 보시다시피 전체 사이트의 이익을 위해 단순히 포장 도로를 절단하여 반격할 수 있는 기회를 제공합니다.
 건물 접근 지점과 수용 능력은 물론 트럭이 건물에 들어오고 나가는 방법도 변경하세요.
 나는 이것이 귀하의 질문에 매우 구체적이라고 생각합니다.
 이는 현재 상황에 대한 조정일 것입니다.
 둘째로 생각합니다.
 우리가 이해하고 싶은 것은 규모이고 이것은 조금 복잡합니다, Steve. 하지만 건물이 거기에 있었을 때 기존 창고가 철거되었을 때 독립 건물을 위해 긴 벽이 남아 있어야 했습니다.
 이 벽을 어떻게 마무리할 계획인가요?
 이제 이것은 건물의 CMU 벽입니다.
 안으로 들어가 벽의 외부 상태를 개선할 계획이 있을 것이다.
 물론 해체 과정이 안전하게 이루어지도록 하겠지만 그 미학은 이 벽을 마무리하고 천장과의 모든 연결을 그대로 유지하는 것에만 국한됩니다.
 건물의 방수와 관련된 모든 것이 제대로 이루어졌습니다.
 따라서 기존 건물을 철거할 뿐만 아니라, 우리가 계획하는 작업에는 건물 일부의 정문 문제를 해결할 수 있는 몇 가지 개선 작업도 포함될 것입니다.
 나는 원하지 않는다.
 이 주거용 부동산에 대한 대화는 중단되었지만, 일부 작업이 타당할 때 건물을 더욱 발전시킬 수 있는 방법을 찾는 데 도움이 되도록 시와 비공개로 논의할 몇 가지 데모를 준비하고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4612.548s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 반복합니다. 저는 이 건물이 어떻게 작동하는지 모릅니다.
 그래서 나는 이 사업이 어떻게 작동하는지에 대해 무지하거나 무지하다는 것을 인정할 것입니다.
 하지만 저는 단지 제 개인적인 경험과 제가 자란 곳을 생각하고 있을 뿐입니다.
 산업 건물에서 노동자들이 밖으로 나가서 모임 장소를 마련하고, 담배를 끊고, 점심 시간을 보내는 등의 작업을 하던 것을 기억합니다.
 여기에 이런 것들이 필요합니까?
 이런 일이 일어난다면, 어디서 그런 일이 일어날까요?
 이웃과의 교류를 의미하나요?
 더 이상 문을 닫지 않았기 때문입니다.
 이것은 무역입니다.
 이 지역입니다.
 틀림없이.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4658.253s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 아니요, 이것은 유용한 질문입니다.
 따라서 건물은 현재 셀프 보관소로 사용되고 있으며 이는 우리와 현장 직원에게 최소한의 유지 관리 비용을 의미합니다.
 이는 생산 작업이 아니며 일반적인 지도 및 감독에 불과합니다.
 인간의 복잡성 개인 세포에 접근하는 사람들이 직면하는 복잡성입니다.
 따라서 현장 근로자의 노동 강도와 현장 작업 조건은 매우 낮습니다.
 우리는 그들이 건물 내부에 모일 수 있는 장소를 제공할 필요가 없다고 믿습니다.
 사무실, 휴게실 등, 임원실이 있습니다.
 그래서 우리는 일반적으로 이 건물의 사용 품질과 직원 수를 줄여 수행되는 검사의 품질에 대해 생각합니다.
 나는 당신이 말한 일이 일어날 것이라고 기대하지 않았습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4732.384s">[Yvette Velez]</a>: 감사합니다

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=4734.786s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 감사합니다
 위원회에 질문이나 의견이 있습니까?
 아니요, 가장 현명한 일은 민사 절차에 대한 공개 토론에 투표하는 것입니다.
 이어 시민들의 고민을 종합적으로 논의한 뒤 교통규제 기간을 거치게 됩니다.
 그러면 대통령은 교통 문제와 관련해 국민청원을 받게 된다.

 ខ្ញុំឈ្មោះ Cliff Bomer ។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នករិះគន់ស្ថាបត្យកម្ម ហើយអរគុណអ្នកខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ការនិយាយរបស់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំមានសំណួរមួយចំនួនដែលអាចកើតឡើង។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងមើលគ្នាទៅវិញទៅមក
 វគ្គនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាអស្ចារ្យណាស់ ហើយខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​មាន​រឿង​រដ្ឋប្បវេណី​មួយ​ចំនួន​ប្រហែល​ជា​ត្រឡប់​មក​លើ​ប្រធាន​បទ​វិញ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតអំពីកន្លែងចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនចាំកន្លែងដែល Medford អនុវត្តលេខកូដចូលរួមនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែត្រូវចាំ។
 លេខកូដចូលរួមមានតម្រូវការជាក់លាក់សម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី ហើយវាប្រែប្រួលយ៉ាងទូលំទូលាយ។
 នេះគឺជាការលោតផ្លោះដ៏ធំបើប្រៀបធៀបទៅនឹងលេខកូដផ្សេងទៀត។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាច្បាប់អន្តរប្រតិបត្តិការទាមទារ 20% នៃចំណតរថយន្តដើម្បីភ្ជាប់បណ្តាញ ខ្ញុំគិតថាមកពី
 សម្រាប់ចំណតរថយន្តអគ្គិសនី។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​បង្ហាញ​ខ្លួន​ឯង​ជា​អាជ្ញាធរ​លើ​បទប្បញ្ញត្តិ​ជាក់លាក់​នោះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​សូម​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​វា​ឡើង​វិញ ព្រោះ​វា​អាច​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ពិត​ប្រាកដ ប្រសិន​បើ​ទីក្រុង​ឆ្លងកាត់​វា​មុន​ដំណើរការ​អនុញ្ញាត​ចាប់ផ្តើម។
 ក៏មានមតិពីរឬបីទៀត។
 ជាដំបូងខ្ញុំសូមផ្តល់អនុសាសន៍យ៉ាងខ្លាំង
 ដ្យាក្រាមរង្វង់ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាមាននៅក្នុងរបៀបវារៈសម្រាប់វគ្គបន្ទាប់ គឺជាប្រធានបទមួយចំនួនដែលបានលេចឡើងទាក់ទងនឹងការបំភ្លឺនៃអគារ។
 ខ្ញុំបានឃើញវា។
 ច្រកចូលចំហៀងគឺជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អមួយដើម្បីបន្ថែមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍បរិមាណដល់ facade អាគារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មើល​ឃើញ​ថា​វា​ជា​ឱកាស។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាចំណុចស្រដៀងគ្នារបស់ Andrew អំពីសិល្បៈសាធារណៈគឺត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 វាមានផ្នែកខាងមុខវែងដែលប្រឈមមុខនឹងចំណតរថយន្ត ពណ៍ amaranth វែង ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាឱកាសដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ទីធ្លាជញ្ជាំងដែលពិតជាអាចបង្កើននូវអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាជាគំនិតដ៏ល្អសម្រាប់ផែនការចំហៀងរបស់អាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមានឱកាសដ៏អស្ចារ្យនៅទីនោះ។
 យោបល់រហ័សពីរទៀត។
 មួយគឺ,
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​ផែនការ​ណា​មួយ​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ឃើញ​នៅ​យប់​នេះ​ឆ្លុះ​បញ្ចាំង​ពី​គំនិត​ដែល​យើង​បាន​ពិភាក្សា​អំពី​ការ​កាត់​ជ្រុង​ភាគ​ពាយព្យ​នៃ​អគារ​នោះ​ទេ។
 យើង​បាន​មើល​ទៅ​លើ​ការ​សិក្សា​បរិមាណ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មាន​ប្រសិទ្ធិ​ភាព​ខ្លាំង​ក្នុង​ការ​កាត់​ចេញ​ជ្រុង​ពាយ័ព្យ ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​សូវ​សំខាន់​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងទុកវាចោល។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថានេះជាចេតនា ឬគ្រាន់តែជាបញ្ហាសម្របសម្រួលរវាងការងារសំណង់ និងសំណង់។
 ចំណុចសំខាន់គឺ ខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាអ្នកធ្វើដំណើរទេ ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាយឺតពេលទៅសន្និសីទ ប្រហែលជាពីរដង ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថានឹងមានជម្លោះលើការចូលរៀន។
 ដោយសារតំបន់មកដល់គឺនៅផ្នែកខាងជើងនៃអគារ មានការពិភាក្សាខ្លះអំពីរបៀបបង្កើតផ្លូវដើរដែលបំបែកអគារដែលមានស្រាប់ពីអគារថ្មី ដោយផ្លាស់ទីចម្ងាយ 100 ហ្វីតដំបូងទៅភាគខាងជើង ដើម្បីកុំឱ្យមនុស្សទៅពី Myrtle ទៅតំបន់មកដល់ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកចេញពីច្រកចូលចំណតនៅផ្នែកខាងកើតនៃអាគារ។
 ខ្ញុំសូមអភ័យទោសប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំខកខានការសន្ទនាផ្សេងទៀតអំពីបញ្ហានេះ ហើយខ្ញុំចង់បញ្ជាក់ថាខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាមនុស្សឆ្លងកាត់ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីចំនួនយានជំនិះដែលអាចប្រើវាជាច្រកទ្វារ។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្យ៉ាងវិញទៀត នេះជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានរៀនពីទស្សនៈស៊ីវិល ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំវា។
 សម័យប្រជុំការងារត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងម្តងទៀត ហើយខ្ញុំបានថ្លែងអំណរគុណដល់បេក្ខជនចំពោះឆន្ទៈរបស់ពួកគេក្នុងការបន្តអភិវឌ្ឍស្ថាបត្យកម្មរបស់អគារ ដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវភ្ជាប់ជាមួយផែនការទេសភាព និងសំណង់ស៊ីវិល។</p>

 그렇다면 팀 토론 중 일부 내용에 이야기를 좀 더 구체화할 수 있는 몇 가지 요점이 있으므로 그렇게 말하고 싶은 사람이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5124.903s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_10]</a>: ផាត ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ឱ្យខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើម ខ្ញុំនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងលំដាប់បញ្ច្រាស និងគ្របដណ្តប់បន្ថែមទៀតនៃបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ដែល Cliff ទើបតែបានលើកឡើង តាមពិតនៅដើមពិធី។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងចែករំលែករូបថតអេក្រង់របស់ខ្ញុំម្តងទៀត តែមួយដងទៀតប៉ុណ្ណោះ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំអាចបង្ហាញវាចេញ ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាយល់ព្រម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាមតិទាំងអស់គឺអំពីប្រវែងនៃផ្លូវនេះ ប្រសិនបើវាចង់នៅម្ខាង ទិសមួយ ឬផ្លូវផ្សេងទៀត ឬយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ក្នុងទិសដៅនៃច្រកចូល ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាការសន្ទនា។
 យើងបានពិភាក្សាវា។
 ទីបំផុត​យើង​បាន​សម្រេច​ថា នេះ​ជា​ផ្នែក​ពីរ​ផ្លូវ។
 ហេតុផលគឺប្រសិនបើឡានមកយកអ្នកឧទាហរណ៍
 ការទម្លាក់នរណាម្នាក់ចេញ ឬរើសនរណាម្នាក់ឡើង នេះគឺដូចជាស្ថានភាពរើស និងទម្លាក់ចោល។
 អ្នកខ្លះកាន់កាបូបដើរទិញឥវ៉ាន់ ហើយទុកវានៅមុខទ្វារ។ ពេល​ភ្លៀង គេ​យក​កាបូប​រត់​ចេញ​តាម​ទ្វារ។
 អ្នក​ដែល​បើក​អ្នក​ចុះ​ពី​ផ្ទះ​អាច​បត់​ចូល​ទៅ​ណា​ក៏​បាន​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រោយ​អគារ រក​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត​របស់​គេ និង​ចូល​តាម​ទ្វារ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​អាស្រ័យ​លើ​កន្លែង​ចត​រថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ឱកាស​មួយ​ដើម្បី​ចូល ទោះ​បី​វា​នៅ​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​ក៏​ដោយ ហើយ​ប្រសិន​បើ​ពួកគេ​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន ពួកគេ​ប្រាកដ​ជា​មិន​ចេញ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើពួកគេចតនៅខាងក្រៅ វាមានឱកាសដែលនរណាម្នាក់នឹងត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដើរចុះក្រោម Fellsway ហើយបន្ទាប់មកត្រលប់មកវិញតាមច្រកចូលមួយទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងគិតថា នោះជាលក្ខណៈពិសេសមួយដ៏សំខាន់ ជាពិសេសប្រសិនបើវាជាអ្នកមកទស្សនារយៈពេលខ្លី ហើយមាននរណាម្នាក់មកមើលអចលនទ្រព្យនោះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកដាក់ប្រាក់បញ្ញើទាំងបួននេះ ដោយសន្មត់ថាពួកគេត្រូវបានកាន់កាប់ទាំងអស់ បន្ទាប់មកបុគ្គលនេះត្រូវតែចាកចេញ ហើយទៅកាន់ Fellsway ដើម្បីចូលមកមើល។
 កន្លែងផ្សេងទៀតនៅកន្លែងណាមួយក្នុងតំបន់ យើងចាត់ទុកការធ្វើដំណើរទាំងនេះថាមិនសំខាន់ពីផ្លូវដែលនៅជាប់គ្នា ហើយរក្សាវានៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបានធ្វើវា មានការពិភាក្សា ហើយអ្នកនឹងមិនចាំខុស ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលយើងនិយាយម្តងទៀត វិស្វករចរាចរណ៍បានធ្វើការវិភាគខ្លះ ហើយប្រហែល 90% នៃអ្នកចូលរួមស្ថិតនៅក្នុងវិសាលភាពនៃការសិក្សា។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងមកទិញសំបុត្រមួយទៀត។
 វាត្រូវបានគេជឿថាប្រហែល 10 ភាគរយនៃប្រជាជននឹងងាកទៅរកច្រកទ្វារ។
 នេះ​គឺ​ពិត​ជា​លើក​ទី​មួយ​។
 ដូច្នេះហើយ យើងជឿថា វាមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់ក្នុងការថែរក្សាផ្លូវពីរផ្លូវនេះ នៅពេលដែលបរិមាណចរាចរណ៍មានកម្រិតទាបជាង និងផ្តល់ឱកាសដើម្បីមិនត្រឡប់ទៅផ្លូវ Fells Way វិញ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលយើងគិត។</p>

 여러 면에서 설계 과정은 두 부분으로 나누어지므로 우리는 접지면에 특별한 주의를 기울입니다. 나는 그것이 당신의 의견이라고 생각합니다. 건물이 지상보다 높도록 건물의 주거 부분을 개조하고 있습니다.
 건물의 지붕은 위 사진과 같습니다. 건물이 등받이에 놓여 있습니다.
 이 노래가 돌아왔다고 말하고 싶어요.
 이것은 상각입니다.
 그래서 우리가 했던 쇼와 딱 들어맞는다.
 그 전에는 이전 디자인에 대한 소문과 이전 친구들의 피드백을 바탕으로 작성했습니다.
 그래서 우리는 돌아가서 건물을 파괴하지 않았습니다.
 평면도만 보고 계십니다.
 그러니 우리는 혼란을 없앨 수 있기를 바랍니다.
 나는 UAE에서 공공미술을 계속할 것이다.
 메모. 앞서 언급했듯이 이 문제에 대한 또 다른 의견이 있다고 생각합니다.
 이는 다음 동료 검토 회의에서 논의할 계획입니다.
 이는 우리가 건축 검토에서 고려한 사항이며 제안된 부지를 확보하게 되어 기쁘게 생각합니다.
 이게 공공미술인지 궁금하네요.
 음, 덕트 위의 건물이거나 건물 자체의 무언가입니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 이 아이디어에 대해 정말 개방적이라고 생각합니다. 우리는 이 호텔을 도시가 자랑스러워할 수 있는 환영받는 호텔로 만들고 싶고, 이와 관련된 공공 예술도 우리가 매우 열려 있는 것입니다.
 마지막으로 주차 문제와 관련하여 유용한 의견이 있습니다.
 오늘 밤에는 많은 피드백을 받은 것 같습니다.
 앞서 언급했듯이 제가 배운 한 가지 사실은 우리가 이 문제에 대해 더 많은 숙제를 했다는 것입니다.
 전기차 주차에 관한 구체적인 규정을 말씀드릴 수는 없지만, 나중에 저희 팀에서 만나면 참고할 수 있을 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5413.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 이상적인.
 감사합니다
 네, 감사합니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 우리 친구들은 여론을 들을 준비가 되어 있습니다.
 그러니 청중석에서 토목공학에 관해 이야기하고 싶다면 손을 들어서 줌을 하고, 카메라를 열고 손을 들고 이렇게 쓰면 됩니다.
 Medford Dash ma.gov를 통해 Dennis D. McDougal에게 이메일을 보낼 수도 있습니다.
 Alison D가 있는 것 같군요. 메모에 그녀의 이름과 주소를 적어주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5447.956s">[MCM00001504_SPEAKER_11]</a>: ជំរាបសួរ Allison D'Agostino ។
 ខ្ញុំតំណាងឱ្យ D'Agostino Family Trust នៅ 1022-1024 Fellsway ។
 អរគុណអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នា។
 តាមពិតទៅ ខ្ញុំ​មាន​មតិ​ច្រើន ហើយ​មាន​លេខ​និង​សំណួរ​ជាច្រើន​។
 ខ្ញុំព្យាយាមរៀបចំឱ្យបានច្រើនតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 សម្រាប់ការចាប់ផ្តើម, ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំអាចជៀសវាងការទាំងអស់នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងរឿងមួយ ឬពីរអំពីចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងចាប់ផ្តើមនៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមានចំណតឡានក្រុង។
 តាមពិតវានៅម្ខាងទៀតនៃ Fellsway ។
 ដូច្នេះឥឡូវនេះ ក្មេងៗជាមូលដ្ឋានត្រូវទៅកន្លែងដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នៅ ហើយដើររហូតដល់ពួកគេឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ Fells ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ជា​ផ្លូវ​ល្អ។
 តាមពិតទៅ ឆ្លងកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវពីឃ្លាំងនៅលើផ្លូវ Fells Way គឺជាកន្លែងដែលក្មេងៗកំពុងរង់ចាំ។
 មានចំណតឡានក្រុងមួយទៀតនៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃ Myrtle ។
 ដោយសារតែម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាឧស្សាហកម្មមែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ គេ​មិន​នាំ​កូន​មក​ទី​នេះ​ទេ។
 តាមអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់ វានៅកាច់ជ្រុងផ្លូវ Myrtle និង Spring ប្រសិនបើវាអាចជួយបាន។
 ដូច្នេះយើងបើកឡានទៅទីនោះ។
 មតិមួយចំនួន។
 ជាដំបូង សូមអរគុណដល់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល និងជាការពិតណាស់ ដេវីត គ្រុប។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាស្គាល់ Pat ។
 វាជាវគ្គដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំសូមកោតសរសើរចំពោះពេលវេលា។
 ដូច្នេះរឿងមួយដែលត្រូវចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងមតិយោបល់៖
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាការយល់ច្រលំបន្តិច អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំគិតថា ជាពិសេសនៅដើមដំបូងនៃគម្រោង យើងបាននិយាយអំពីអ្វីដែលផ្លូវ Myrtle នឹងមានរូបរាង អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងបានព្យាយាមប្តូរទិសចរាចរណ៍ ហើយយប់នេះខ្ញុំបានលឺថា អាសយដ្ឋានអចលនទ្រព្យនឹងស្ថិតនៅក្នុង Myrtle។
 ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំជឿថាមនុស្សនឹងដើរកាត់ Myrtle នៅពេលនេះ ហើយពិតជាប្រើច្រកចូល Fellsway នៅពេលចាំបាច់ ដែលវាពិបាកបន្តិច។
 ប៉ុន្តែម្តងទៀត នេះគ្រាន់តែជាមតិយោបល់ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​បាន​ឮ​អ្វី​ដែល​ខុស​ពី​យប់​នេះ​។
 ផ្នែកផ្សេងទៀតគឺថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងដើម្បីពង្រីកផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​រឿង​ធំ​បំផុត​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ច្បាស់​នោះ​គឺ​ថា​បើ​យើង​មិន​រើ​បង្គោល​ទេ អ្នក​ដែល​រស់​នៅ​តាម​ផ្លូវ​នោះ​នឹង​កត់​សម្គាល់​ឃើញ
 អស្ចារ្យខ្លះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មាន​ច្រើន​ជាង​អ្វី​ដែល​បាន​បង្ហាញ​ក្នុង​រូបភាព​នេះ ហើយ​នោះ​ជា​វិធី​ល្អ​បំផុត​ក្នុង​ការ​ដាក់​វា។
 ដូច្នេះ ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​គុណ​ថា បើ​សសរ​មិន​រើ​ចូល​គ្នា​ទេ ផ្លូវ​ក៏​មិន​ទូលាយ​ដែរ។
 ច្បាស់ណាស់ ចំនុចប្រសព្វរវាង Fellsway និង Bernal មិនអាចពង្រីកបានទេ ដូចដែលយើងបានពិភាក្សានៅក្នុងបញ្ហានេះ និងនៅលើអចលនទ្រព្យ Walsh ។
 មិនមានដំណោះស្រាយពិតប្រាកដទេ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ការសង្កេតមួយទៀតគឺថា ខ្ញុំពិតជាចូលចិត្តចំនួនកន្លែងចតរថយន្តដែលក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis Group កំពុងស្នើសុំ។
 ផងដែរ សួនឆ្កែគឺជាកង្វល់ចម្បងពីររបស់ខ្ញុំ គឺសម្រាប់តែកំណត់ត្រាប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 មិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែមនៅក្នុងតំបន់នេះទេ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 អំឡុងពេលមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិល មនុស្សប្រកួតប្រជែងគ្នាដើម្បីលំហរ ដូចអ្វីដែលពួកគេបានធ្វើនៅភាគនិរតី ជាកន្លែងដែលខ្ញុំរស់នៅផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​មិន​ដូច​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​ធ្វើ​បែប​នោះ​ទាល់​តែ​សោះ។
 កកកុញណាស់។
 វាក៏មានលទ្ធភាពដែលសត្វឆ្កែ 289 ក្បាលត្រូវបាននាំយកមកក្នុងតំបន់នោះ។
 ខណៈពេលដែលខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះទីធ្លាបៃតង ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាសំខាន់ជាងក្នុងការផ្តោតលើកន្លែងសម្រាប់សត្វឆ្កែជាជាងសួនកុមារ ឬប្រភេទសួនកម្សាន្តផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា វា​នឹង​ក្លាយ​ជា​ការ​ពេញ​និយម។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាពេញចិត្តក្នុងការវេចខ្ចប់នៅពេលចាំបាច់។
 មិនមានការលេចធ្លាយទេហើយខ្ញុំត្រូវចាកចេញពីយានដ្ឋានជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃ។
 នេះ​ជា​មតិ និង​ចម្ងល់​របស់​ខ្ញុំ ដើម្បី​កុំ​ឲ្យ​ខាត​ពេល​យូរ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាបញ្ហារបស់ខ្ញុំគឺថាខ្ញុំមិនដឹងច្រើនអំពីផ្លូវ Warren ។
 វាមិនបង្ហាញក្នុងរូបភាពទាំងនេះទេ។
 នេះគឺជាផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់។
 វាជាផ្លូវមួយផ្លូវនៅ Myrtle ត្រង់ចំនុចប្រសព្វ Amarans ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសំណួររបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ៖ តើមានអ្វីផ្សេងទៀតដែលត្រូវពិចារណា?
 ផ្លូវបំបែកនេះមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 ឥឡូវនេះវាមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់។
 ដូច្នេះ​សំណួរ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​ជាមួយ​នឹង Davis Group និង​សូម្បី​តែ​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល​គឺ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​កំពុង​តែ​ពិចារណា។
 ទាក់​ទង​នឹង​សន្តិសុខ សំណួរ​ទី​ពីរ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​បញ្ជាក់​សម្រាប់​ផ្ទះ​ក្នុង​ក្រុង វា​មិន​ច្បាស់​ទេ។
 តើមានវគ្គខ្លះទេ?
 ដោយផ្ទាល់នៅលើ Myrtle ឬនៅសណ្ឋាគារ។
 សំណួរទីបីរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអំពីការចតរថយន្តសម្រាប់អគារទាំងអស់នៅខាងក្រៅយានដ្ឋាន ជាពិសេសកន្លែងផ្ទុកខាងក្រោយ។
 វាហាក់ដូចជាច្បាស់។
 តើឡានដឹកទំនិញអាចចូលបានទេ?
 តើ​ឡាន​ដឹក​ជញ្ជូន និង​ផ្លូវ​ជម្រាល​មិន​អី​ទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចដើរចុះពីលើជម្រាលភ្នំបានទេ?
 តើអ្នកអាចទាញយកវាដោយសុវត្ថិភាពបានទេ?
 ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាបានរស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះនេះមួយរយៈ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំបានផ្លាស់ប្តូរជារៀងរាល់ឆ្នាំបន្ទាប់ពីបញ្ចប់ការសិក្សានៅមហាវិទ្យាល័យ។
 ពេល​នោះ​ខ្ញុំ​ចាំ​ថា​ការ​អាច​ធ្វើ​ចលនា​បាន​គឺ​ជា​បញ្ហា​ប្រឈម។
 នៅក្នុងអគារមួយមានចំណតរថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​រថយន្ត​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​អាច​ចូល​ក្នុង​យានដ្ឋាន​បាន​ទេ។
 កង្វល់ពិតរបស់ខ្ញុំចំពោះសំណួរគឺ៖ តើអ្នកបានពិចារណាកន្លែងទំនេរនៅក្នុងឡានដឹកទំនិញដែលមានផ្លូវជម្រាលទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ច្រើន​ណាស់។
 អរគុណច្រើន។
 សូមអរគុណម្តងទៀតសម្រាប់ពេលវេលារបស់អ្នក។</p>

 예, 몇 가지 문제가 있습니다.
 로렌스에서 자동차 이동에 관한 질문이 있었습니다.
 후보자들은 이에 대해 이야기하고 싶습니까?</p>

 갈래, 팻?
 트럭과 주차장.
 트럭은 건물 뒤쪽에 위치해 있습니다.
 거기에는 여러 대의 트럭을 주차할 수 있는 공간이 있습니다.
 자산 관리가 이미 진행 중이기 때문에 더 많은 트럭을 기대하지는 않습니다.
 내부 및 외부 활동을 관리하겠습니다.
 우리는 가장 어려운 여행 조건을 처리할 수 있는 충분한 공간이 있다고 생각합니다.
 우리는 이 문제를 조사하고 있으며 상황을 이해하기 위해 운영팀과 계속 협력할 것입니다.
 주거용 주택의 경우 모든 출입구가 지하에 있는지 확인하세요.
 머틀 스트리트에는 인도나 횡단보도가 없습니다.
 이 공간은 뒤쪽에 있는 내부 입구를 통해 접근할 수 있습니다.
 그래서 당신이 플로렌스 스트리트의 최신 뉴스를 원한다면 그가 보고 있다는 것을 압니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=5841.227s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 예, 그렇습니다.
 이것은 시의적절한 질문이므로 일반적인 대답은 '예'입니다.
 현재 작업 중이라고 생각하며, 베타 버전의 Jeff가 베타가 끝나면 어떤 코멘트를 할지는 모르겠지만, 베타 버전에서 트래픽에 대한 많은 피드백을 받았으며 이를 검토하고 있습니다.
 일부는 많습니다.
 우리가 고려해야 할 완화 조치와 염두에 두어야 할 몇 가지 사항을 제안합니다.
 내 앞에 보고된 내용이 없었다면 로렌스 로드가 어떤 모습이었을지 알 수 없습니다. 하지만 전체적으로 보면 이 지역의 지역적 움직임과 구호는 일반적으로 플라타너스나 아마란스 이상의 것으로 간주됩니다.
 내 생각에는 로렌스가 거기에 있었을 것 같아요.
 다시 확인해야 하지만 귀하의 질문에 대한 짧은 대답은 '예'입니다.
 우리 팀 및 검토팀과 계속 협력하여 이 지역의 교통량을 줄이기 위한 옵션을 개발할 것입니다.</p>

 ជាបឋម ខ្ញុំលើកយកបញ្ហាមួយចំនួនជាមួយក្រុមប្រឹក្សានេះ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកបានពិភាក្សាជាមួយសង្គមស៊ីវិល។
 តើយើងបានជូនដំណឹងដល់អ្នករស់នៅ Amaranth Apartments អំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំទាំងនេះទេ?
 ព្រោះ​នៅ​គ្រប់​ទីកន្លែង​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ទៅ​គឺ​មិន​មាន​មតិ​សាធារណៈ​ក្នុង​ទិសដៅ​នេះ​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា ប្រសិនបើពួកគេនៅក្នុងប្រអប់សាកល្បង ពួកគេនឹងទទួលបានអ៊ីមែល សម្ភារៈផ្សព្វផ្សាយជាដើម ដើម្បីអាចស្តាប់សំឡេងរបស់ពួកគេ។
 បន្ទាប់មកទីពីរគឺ
 ថ្ងៃនេះ និងក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំមុនៗ យើងបានឮលោក Pat និយាយច្រើនអំពីក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងដែលនឹងគ្រប់គ្រងអចលនទ្រព្យ។
 សំណួរជាច្រើនត្រូវបានសួរ៖ អញ្ចឹងក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយនេះ ក្រុមហ៊ុនគ្រប់គ្រងកំពុងដោះស្រាយ។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលនឹងពិចារណាចូលរួមកិច្ចប្រជុំមួយក្នុងចំណោមកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះបន្ទាប់ពី Davis សាងសង់អាគារនោះ
 អ្នកស្រុកមានអារម្មណ៍សុវត្ថិភាពអំពីអ្នកដែលជាម្ចាស់ និងគ្រប់គ្រងបទពិសោធន៍ប្រចាំថ្ងៃ របៀបដែលពួកគេមានគម្រោងគ្រប់គ្រងអ្វីៗដូចជាឡានដឹកទំនិញ របៀបដែលពួកគេគ្រប់គ្រងគំនូរណាមួយដែលអាចលេចឡើងនៅលើការងារសិល្បៈ ឬសួនកុមារ និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេនឹងសម្អាតវា។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ច្រានចោល​នេះ​ជា​ការ​ណែនាំ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​បញ្ចេញ​យោបល់​លើ​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​បាន​វិភាគ​ខាង​លើ។
 ចំពោះកន្លែងចតរថយន្ត ខ្ញុំបានលឺថាឥឡូវនេះមានចំណត 300 ហ្វីតនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកយល់ នៅពេលអ្នកនិយាយជាមួយយើង ហើយប្រាប់យើង ចូរនិយាយថា អ្នកបង្កើនវាដល់ 370 អ្នកមិនបង្កើនចំនួនចំណតនៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ទេ។
 រវាងផ្លូវ Amaranth និងផ្លូវ Myrtle,
 អ្នកមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តបន្ថែម។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តទៀតទេនៅលើផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 ក្នុងនាមជាអ្នករស់នៅ Myrtle Street ខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភយ៉ាងខ្លាំងអំពីពេលដែលការភ្ជួររាស់នឹងត្រូវបញ្ចប់ ហើយនៅពេលណាដែលនឹងមានគ្រោះអាសន្នព្រិលធ្លាក់ ព្រោះឥឡូវនេះខ្ញុំត្រូវចតនៅ Amaranth ។
 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅតែម្នាក់ឯង។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចូលចិត្ត​គំនិត​មក​ផ្ទះ​យប់​ជ្រៅ ហើយ​ឃើញ​មនុស្ស​ចូល​ចត​នៅ Myrtle ខណៈ​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​ចត​នៅ​ជ្រុង​ម្ខាង។
 ញ៉ាំ amaranth ហើយដើរទៅផ្ទះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវានឹងកើតឡើង ដោយសារតែក្រុមហ៊ុនទាំងអស់នេះ និងខុនដូប្រណិតៗទាំងអស់នេះ ដែលគិតថ្លៃអ្នកស្នាក់នៅសម្រាប់ការចតរថយន្ត ពួកគេនឹងដឹងថា Amaranth និង Myrtle គឺមិនគិតថ្លៃទេ ហើយពួកគេនឹងជំនួសកន្លែងរបស់យើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ឱ្យអ្នកដឹងថា គម្រោងកែលម្អ $130,000 ទៅ $170,000 ដែលអ្នកបានស្នើសម្រាប់ Myrtle Street គឺពិតជាក្លែងក្លាយ ហើយអ្នកដឹងថាវា។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានការខកចិត្តនៅពេលឮថាយើងមិនបានបង្វែរចរាចរណ៍ទៅផ្លូវ Myrtle ដូច Allison ទើបនឹងនិយាយ។

 ចូលយានដ្ឋានពីផ្លូវ Myrtle ។
 វា​ជា​ពពុះ​ដែល​ហូរ​ចូល និង​ចេញ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បង្ហាញពីការខកចិត្តរបស់ខ្ញុំ ដោយសារតែខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានឮត្រូវបានដកចេញពីខ្ញុំក្នុងការហៅទូរស័ព្ទពិសេសនេះ។

 내 말은, EV와 전기 자동차가 전기 자전거와 동일한 문제를 일으킨다는 것입니다.
 이제 말씀하신 대로 많은 도시에서 이런 일이 메드퍼드나 우리가 말하는 지역에서만 발생하는 것이 아니라 일반적인 화재라는 것을 알고 있습니다.

 那么，晚安。
 回到那个和婴儿组。
 开展交通影响评估研究。
 为了开始这个过程，我们进行了实地考察，观察交通状况，审查了 Van Essen Associates 影响研究、Polar Engineering 项目计划，并审查了所有交通方式，不仅包括交通，还包括行人、自行车和公共交通。
 我们与土建工程也有一些重叠，因此您可以在场地规划、内部循环、装载和交付以及运输需求管理计划中看到一些内容。
 总体而言，交通研究是按照我们现有的国家和行业专业标准进行的，是一份综合报告。
 因此，我将总结我们的评论。
 有些评论要求提供更多信息，要求澄清。
 我们更多地谈论外部缺陷以及可能的改进。
 感谢您的介绍。
 亲爱的玩家，我认为我们提出的一些意见在今天的演示中得到了回答。
 所以我谢谢你。
 也许这有点多余。
 我们讨论了一些主题，所以这或多或少是按照流量影响研究的顺序进行的。
 因此，在研究区域内，对整个区域的交叉口进行了综合评估。
 这有点难以阅读。
 我想说的是，第一个正在考虑纳入的十字路口是您注意到的唯一一个未包括在内的十字路口，即第四街。
 嗯，这里看起来围栏很围，所以标有人行横道。
 所以那将是唯一的地方。
 我想你可以考虑看看。
 因此，在现有条件下，采集1月11日的流量。
 小马丁·路德·金
 假期是15号。
 我只是想得到一些答案，以及周一假期是否会对周四的计数产生任何预期影响。
 然后收集并汇总流量。
 我们想了解更多有关该网站现有使用所产生的行程的信息。
 所以，这里只是有关该地区行人现有状况的一些信息。
 我们自己根据刚刚写下的观察结果做了一个清单。
 中环街和春街交叉口没有行人信号灯，该路口是正在研究的交叉路口。
 该地区的几个十字路口没有可检测的人行横道和警告牌，而这些必须符合 ADA 标准，其中包括 Myrtle、Amaranth 和 Lawrence 街道的十字路口。
 这些只是一些观察和笔记。
 安全方面，该地区有多个路口曾发生过安全事故。
 正如我刚才提到的，Central 和 Spring 有 13 次失败。
 最重要的是，事故发生率超过了马萨诸塞州交通部第 4 区的平均水平和州平均水平，达到了令人担忧的程度。
 Fellsway 和 Riverside 五年内发生了 31 起事故。
 MassDOT 将其认定为高事故群体，使其有资格接受 2019 年进行的高速公路安全审计，并被认定为存在安全问题。
 Fellsway Central 和 Medford Street 五年内发生了 23 起事故。
 我们只是想更多地了解该地区发生的行人和自行车事故类型。
 停车，我们询问在现有条件下，是否有关于今天该地点街道和停车场占用情况的信息，您知道，这些空间在相邻街道和该地点本身占用的百分比，了解这些信息会很有用。
 未来的情况，所以我先讲一下出行生成和出行分配归因。
 因此，预计该项目将在工作日上午和下午高峰时段产生约 90 趟车次。
 我们认为这是一个合理的数字。
 我们希望获得更多关于卡车出行次数的信息，包括这个数字。
 行人、自行车和公共交通出行。
 因此，如果能够对它们进行分解和识别，将会很有帮助。
 计算中使用了未来 5% 的自行车比例。
 我们认为它可能有点高。
 我认为全市 Medford 模式的总体比例为 1%。
 所以我想知道如果计算时假设从自行车模式分裂到较低模式，这会对车辆的出行产生多大影响？
 Fells Way 上的许多行程都会在中央大街掉头返回该地点。
 我想知道是否有其他交通可以使用的替代路线，因为认识到此行进中存在一些延误和拥堵，尤其是在下午，例如河滨大道，左转进入河滨，甚至使用 I-93 作为替代路线。
 其中一些交通是否会使用 I-93 而不是 Fells Way？
 嗯，报告中有一个表格确定了该项目的流量增加情况，但事实并非如此。
 识别现场附近的道路，例如 Fellsway、Myrtle、Pinker、Lawrence 和 Spring。
 因此，我想量化有关该地点附近道路交通量增加的信息。
 一个已经被谈论了一点的停车项目，停车比例为1.14。
 我们只是想确保这个数字是正确且足够的，可以满足该地点的预期停车需求。
 你知道，请记住，我们希望确保我们做的每件事都是正确的。
 因此，如果有足够的停车位，就不会溢出到邻近的社区和道路。
 我们看到前面有 4 个访客空间，即送货区。
 我们认为它可能有点低。
 嗯，我们还想更多地了解游客空间本身。
 不仅是短期送货，而且如果人们拜访该综合体的居民，他们会在哪里停车，如果他们这样做几个小时？
 如果他们停车很长时间或停车过夜。
 所以一些关于这是如何运作的讨论。
 访客空间将由网站运营和管理。
 关于拟议的停车位，新的Amaranth停车位，只是这些停车位的意图，我知道它们是向公众开放的，但它们应该供现场访客使用吗？
 这些空间的用途是什么？
 进行了交叉口通行能力分析。
 交通工程师使用所谓的交叉口服务级别。
 它类似于成绩单，其中 A，表示条件极佳，几乎没有延误或拥堵。
 E和F不足。
 F 是最差的，或者因巨大的延迟、拥塞和排队而失败。
 所以，你知道，我们在那里看到了 Fellsway 上的拥堵情况，大部分是早上向南行，下午向北行。
 Fellsway、Central 以及 Fellsway 和 Riverside 交叉口目前以 F 服务级别运行，这意味着它们有一个或多个交通通常无法达到 F 服务级别。
 而项目未来的非施工条件和施工条件又使这些条件更加恶化。
 该项目将导致中环 Fellsway 的交通显着增加，而中央大道东行通道的延误将会增加。
 其中一些问题已经得到解决。
 就在今天晚上，我看到了这里右上角的空间。
 我想我们在仓库的 A 区。
 感谢您提供这个。
 此外，还可以进入建筑物和会场周围的空间，今晚也展示了这一点，所以这很棒。
 这里显示了与未来自行车道的联系。
 我想这一切都已经解决了。
 只是对街道空间、默特尔街和阿默斯特的新空间进行澄清。
 我知道它们向公众开放，但谁对这些空间拥有管辖权？
 它们真的是城市还是属于私人管辖？
 因此，对这些空间进行更多澄清。
 就其本身而言，我们谈论的是场地规划中更广阔的空间，即流通道路的宽度。
 抱歉，必须提供路边停车位。
 讨论居民和游客的自行车停放只是为了明确车位数量。
 现场必须标明储雪区域。
 我知道有人在谈论默特尔街，但我还需要知道那里的雪将储存在哪里。
 这就是制定运输需求管理计划的原因。
 这些计划的目标是减少汽车出行次数，尤其是单人车辆。
 我们还确定了该计划需要考虑的其他一些领域或措施。
 您可能早些时候已经谈到过这一点。
 停车费与停车费是分开的吗？
 今晚我没有听到，但也许会有更多的讨论。
 我知道对于网站来说最好的选择是需要权衡的。
 您可以考虑向居民提供交通补贴或蓝色自行车订阅，作为一项 TDM 措施。
 你展示了蓝色的自行车站，所以照顾好它真是太好了。
 并且您应该考虑现场是否有汽车共享空间，例如汽车共享拉链车。
 那么项目提出的外部改进，我们稍微谈了一下公交候车区。
 MBTA 巴士站附近的现有停车位将进行重新配置和景观美化，如今晚向我们展示的那样，以及新的停车位、扩大 Amaranth 街和 Myrtle 街的通行权，或者更好的是街道和人行道停车位。
 因此，我们确定了一些其他的措施，只是为了考虑和改进。
 这些大多是外部地点。
 其中许多位于我提到的十字路口，存在操作或安全缺陷。
 第一个是Fellsway Riverside Avenue。
 因此，我提到，已识别出在服务级别 F 上运行的高崩溃集群的交叉点。此次交通安全审计确定了对策和安全对策的改进，包括交通信号优化、增强左转阶段和通行时间。
 所以这些事情是可以考虑的。
 Avenida Central 和 Rua Primavera 的事故发生率很高。
 可以考虑升级旧的信号设备并安装现有的行人标志。
 Fellsway、Central 和 Medford Street 在两个高峰时段再次在 F 级服务条件下运行，可以看到并提供信号定时优化。
 北行左转车道多次被堵塞，特别是在晚高峰期间，因此车辆在车道畅通之前无法进入该车道。
 是否有可能拓宽 Fells Way 北行左转车道？
 Fellsway 和 Myrtle Street 相连，因此 Fellsway 有一条长长的人行横道。
 我们知道，交通流量大，车速高，可以考虑使用矩形快闪灯，这是对行人的安全措施，也能提高驾驶员的安全意识。
 我们只是想评估提供中间间隔是否可行，无论是在红绿灯处还是向北左转处。
 我知道这样做有利有弊，但这样做是否有足够的好处来考虑这种改变？</p>

 저는 이 프로젝트에 대중교통 도로 확장 및 건설이 포함되어 있는 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 저는 이 교차로가 좀 더 주목을 받을 만하다고 생각합니다.
 나는 그들이 로렌스에 대해서도 이야기했다는 것을 압니다.
 다른 보도 확장은 남서쪽 모퉁이 또는 교차로 확장에 위치할 수도 있습니다.
 나는 이것이 프로젝트와 커뮤니티를 위한 중요한 길이라고 생각합니다.
 움직임을 원활하게 할 수 있는 기회입니다.
 차량 속도를 줄이고 보행자 흐름과 지역 안전을 개선합니다.
 몇 가지 의견.
 South Fells Way의 버스 정류장이 근처에 있고 상태가 양호합니다.
 이곳은 오래된 쉼터입니다.
 내 생각엔 이 버스 정류장 업그레이드를 고려해야 할 것 같아요.
 예, 도로 표지판에 대한 계획이 필요합니다.
 프로젝트 진행 상황은 주민, 방문객, 교통 인력이 현장에 들어오고 돌아올 곳을 명확하게 보여줍니다.
 머틀 스트리트(Myrtle Street) 남쪽 애머스트(Amherst)의 보도 상태는 좋지 않습니다.
 따라서 이 도로의 수리는 프로젝트의 일부로 간주되어야 합니다.
 물론, 프로젝트가 지역사회에 미치는 영향을 보여줄 수 있는 교통 관리 계획을 수립하는 것이 필요합니다.
 최종 참고 사항: 설계의 자연스러운 변화로 인해 DCR을 등록하려면 건축 허가가 필요합니다.
 Fellsway에 들어가고 나가려면 DCR 권한이 필요합니다.
 다음은 우리의 리뷰를 요약한 것입니다.
 그 밖에도 많은 것들이 있는데, 일부는 작지만 세부적입니다.
 귀하에게 보내는 리뷰 편지에서.
 매우 감사합니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8082.747s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 마치 제프를 생각하는 것 같았습니다.
 오늘 저녁 머틀 스트리트 주소에 대한 몇 가지 의견을 들었습니다.
 글쎄요, 구체적인 지시 사항이 있는지 궁금합니다. Philsway 입구에 어떤 종류의 표지판이 있을지 같은 조언에 대해 말씀하시는 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 이것이 프로젝트의 중요한 측면인지 확인하십시오.
 이에 대해 어떻게 생각하시는지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8116.863s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 따라서 우리는 주민과 방문객을 안내하고 행사장을 오가는 교통수단을 안내할 간판 디자인을 만드는 것을 고려할 것입니다.
 물론 현지인들은 들어오고 나가는 방법을 알고 있을 것입니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 방문객들에게 공원의 많은 장소를 제공할 것입니다. 따라서 다양한 유형의 표시가 결합될 수도 있고, 기념관이 될 수도 있고, 다른 표시가 될 수도 있지만, 이것이 대부분의 방법을 설명할 것입니다.
 특정 조건에 따라 주차 장소 및 위치를 나타냅니다.
 당신이 누구인지, 어디로 가고 싶은지는 이러한 해외 여행에서 당신을 안내할 것입니다.
 Fells Street가 정문이 될 것 같은데, 이 주소가 좋은 위치인 것 같습니다.
 누군가 Waze에 주소를 입력하고 위치를 모른다면 아마도 우리가 가고 싶은 곳이 아닌 Myrtle Street으로 이동하게 될 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8194.189s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 채팅에서 Chris 님의 댓글을 보고 게시하겠습니다.
 Amaranth 옆 차고가 들어오고 나가는 트래픽의 몇 퍼센트를 사용할지 아는 사람이 있습니까?
 나는 도로 접근이 문제라는 시의원의 의견에 동의합니다.
 그래서 교통수요관리방안의 일부를 본 것 같습니다.
 나는 Scott이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 최신 업데이트가 반영되었는지는 모르겠지만, 호텔의 다른 부분인데, 2차선으로 되어있습니다.
 하지만 그래, 어쩌면 그것에 대해 이야기할 수도 있겠지, 스콧.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8236.272s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 물론이죠.
 감사합니다, 대통령님.
 스콧 손튼(Scott Thornton)과 그의 파트너 바네사(Vanessa).
 따라서 우리는 교통량의 약 30, 30~40%가 아마란스 스트리트 입구를 사용할 것으로 추정하고 그 뒤에 있는 아이디어는 단지 해당 위치로부터의 주차 거리를 기반으로 합니다.
 또한 약간의 트래픽이 필요할 수 있습니다.
 예를 들어 서쪽에서는 93번 고속도로로 이어지는 곳을 방문할 수 있습니다.
 이들 지역 중 일부는 하루 중 시간에 따라 더 쉽게 접근할 수 있는 장소를 제공합니다.
 Amaranth를 통해 쉽고 빠르게 접근할 수 있으며 Myrtle Street 또는 Lawrence Street를 통해 Spring Street으로 돌아올 수 있습니다.
 하지만 초기 추정치는 30~40% 사이다.
 나는 이것이 오늘 밤 여기에 제시된 최신 계획에 여전히 적용된다고 믿습니다.
 우리는 이 배포판에 어떠한 중대한 변화도 없을 것으로 예상합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8322.547s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 알았어
 감사합니다
 크리스. 질문이나 우려사항이 있으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8333.162s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 크리스가 말한 것을 계속해도 될까요?
 그러니까 도로의 교통 상황만 보면 아마도 교통량의 일정 비율이 아마리야네를 떠나 서쪽으로 향할 것이지만 서쪽에서 접근하는 것은 불가능해 보인다는 뜻입니다.
 거의 모든 교통이 Fellsway에서 멀어질 것으로 보입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8361.383s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_02]</a>: 예, 내 말은, 분포는 실제로 사람들이 어디에 있다고 생각하는지 또는 인구 조사 데이터에 따르면 사람들이 해당 지역에서 일하고 살고 있는 위치에 따라 달라집니다.
 여기에서는 기존 여행 모델을 선택하여 제안합니다.
 나는 가끔 동의한다
 서쪽이나 남쪽 출신이라면 Fellsway를 이용하는 것이 가장 효과적입니다.
 그러나 이것은 하루 중 언제라도 사실이 아닙니다.
 이것이 바로 이 배포판이 해결하려는 문제입니다.
 불행하게도 이는 전체 관련 기간에 대한 트래픽 분포를 나타내는 예상 기능 모델과 일치합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8422.885s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 안드레, 있어요?
 이것을 따르십시오.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8437.957s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 진짜가 아닙니다.
 내 말은
 그런 프로젝트에 다시 더 가까워졌습니다.
 이것이 의미하는 바는 아마란스 입구로 가는 유일한 방법은 로렌스를 따라 내려가 아마란스 플레이스와 아파트 건물을 지나서 아마란스 프로젝트에 들어가는 것인 것 같다는 것입니다. 이는 원형이고 초심자에게는 거의 불가능해 보입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8475.658s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 의회에 다른 질문이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8485.526s">[Unidentified]</a>: 제이미.
 교차로 공사와 관련하여 제 질문은 신호등과 횡단보도 개선을 위한 시범사업 제안과 관련이 있는 것 같습니다.
 이건 어디로 가는 걸까요?
 이게 시내에 가지고 갈 수 있는 물건인가요?
 이것이 우리가 볼륨 후보와 협력하는 방식입니까?
 나는 이러한 모든 교차로에 개선이 필요하다는 점에 전적으로 동의합니다.
 나는 이것을 설정하는 방법을 모른다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8526.799s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 내 이해는 교차로에 따라 약간 다르다는 것입니다.
 그래서 내 생각엔
 신청자는 답변의 일부 또는 전부를 개선하겠다는 의사를 밝힐 수 있습니다.
 어떤 경우에는 시의 허가만 필요합니다.
 다른 경우에는 약간 더 복잡한 상태에서 발생할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8553.604s">[Unidentified]</a>: 예, 저는 Spring Street Center Crossing에서 일하고 있으며 이는 지속적인 문제입니다.
 보행자를 위해 Haynes Plaza에는 주민을 위한 파란색 자전거 정류장이 있습니다.
 현장에 파란색 자전거 스테이션이 있으면 그곳에서 자전거를 타고 나갈 수 있습니다.
 하지만 보행자가 있고 보행자가 많으면 이 교차로는 확실히 관련이 있습니다.
 아시다시피, 사람들은 이를 대중교통 부족이라 부르죠.
 글쎄요, 그건 제가 기대하지 않았던 바로 그 일인데, 이번 연구는 그것을 분명히 보여줍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8595.186s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 고마워요, 제이미.
 제프, 이에 대해 의견이 있으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8602.162s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 예, 시가 관할권 내 도로의 우선순위를 어떻게 정하느냐에 따라 다릅니다.
 그래서 조금 다릅니다.
 완전히 도시에서 통제되는 교차로는 길 찾기가 쉽습니다.
 알다시피, 중반과 봄이지만 이해합니다.
 작업 지연과 혼잡도 안전에 영향을 미칩니다.
 하지만 저는 도시들이 프로젝트와 합리적이고 관련성이 있다고 생각하는 개선 사항을 기반으로 우선순위를 설정해야 한다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8662.117s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8664.48s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 응, 다음은 나야.
 그렇다면 머틀 스트리트 입구에서 양방향 통행이 가능한지 정말 궁금합니다.
 그렇기 때문에 나는 사람들의 우려를 듣는다.
 현재 구성에는 이 문제를 피하기 위해 매우 신중하게 고려되었기 때문에 더 긴 제한이 있습니다.
 비상구를 이용하려면 문을 열어야 하는 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 그러나 제공된 정보는 이것이 커뮤니티에 얼마나 많은 영향을 미칠지 정확히 알려주지 않습니다.
 네, 배송이 있습니다.
 한 방향으로 닫혀 있으면 한 방향으로 머틀로 돌아가야 할 수도 있습니다.
 그래서 나는 그것이 합리적이라고 생각하고 설계 고려 사항을 이해하지만 양방향 교통의 경우 한 단계 뒤로 물러나는 장벽을 여는 것과 같은 위험이 있는 것 같습니다.
 머틀 스트리트 뷰로 교통 혼잡을 줄여보세요.
 이에 대한 당신의 의견을 듣고 싶습니다, 제프.
 충분히 검토하고 이에 대한 생각과 아이디어를 공유할 시간이 있는지, 아니면 더 생각해야 하지만 더 알고 싶은지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8778.533s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 머틀 로드의 여행 횟수를 제한하는 것이 목표라면 전혀 생각할 필요가 없습니다. 한 방향으로 가는지, 한 방향으로 가는지 아니면 다른 방향으로 가는지 알 수 있습니다.
 따라서 여러분은 그 여행이 무엇일지, 어디로 갈지, 머틀에서 끝날지, 아니면 펠스웨이로 갈지 생각해야 할 것입니다.
 그래서 좋은 질문이라고 생각합니다.
 아마도 우리는 Scott-Farnese 그룹을 재평가하고 이것저것 생각해 볼 필요가 있을 것입니다.
 트래픽이 양방향이 아닌 단방향인 경우 어떤 결과가 발생할 수 있는지 알고 있습니다.
 이번에도 좋은 주제입니다.
 좀 더 논의하고 평가해야 할 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8834.447s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 위원회에 질문이나 의견이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8841.325s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 제프, 하지만 당신에게 무슨 일이 일어났는지 기억나지 않는다면 미안해요.
 있잖아요.
 즉, 펠스웨이와 머틀 교차로에는 횡단보도와 작은 도로 외에는 신호등이나 보행자 안전장치가 없다는 뜻이다.
 알다시피, 확실히 그럴 것 같습니다.
 네, 이 모퉁이에는 더 많은 주민이 거주하게 될 것입니다.
 음, 가장 중요한 것은 이 교차로에 뭔가가 있다는 것입니다.
 보행자를 위해 속도를 낮추거나 최소한 보행자에게 신호를 보내십시오.
 그래서 생각해 봤습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8897.88s">[MCM00000653_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 예, 슬라이드 중 하나에서 직사각형 헤드라이트에 대해 이야기했습니다.
 보행자를 위한 버튼 표시입니다.
 그래서 교차로는 개선이 필요하다고 생각합니다. 특히 양쪽에 버스 정류장이 있기 때문에 더욱 그렇습니다.
 제가 그곳에 갔을 때 사람들이 차에서 내려 길을 건너는 것을 보았습니다.
 그래서 직사각형의 조명 요소 레벨 헤드램프라고 생각합니다.
 게다가 4차선처럼 완전한 신호등이 될 것이다.
 하지만 이 러그의 안전성은 개선이 필요하다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8959.722s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 감사합니다
 놓치셨다면 죄송합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=8962.498s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, 교차로에서의 보행자 안전도 걱정됩니다.
 양쪽에 버스정류장이 있어서 좋은 것 같아요.
 따라서 현지인들이 버스로 여행하는 경우 Fells Road 반대편으로 이동하게 될 가능성이 높습니다.
 그리고 한 가지 더: 일부 요소는 일반적으로 변경하기 어렵다는 것을 알고 있으며 이는 사실입니다.
 당일 여행을 준비하기 위해 현지인들은 Fells Way를 운전하고 개발 지역을 건너 돌아올 것입니다.
 쉬울거야
 제가 틀렸을 수도 있지만 모든 징후는 이것이 잠재적인 문제임을 나타냅니다.
 거기서 무엇을 해야 하는지 알고 싶습니다.
 ECR 권한이 필요하다는 것을 알고 있지만 이는 나와 관련이 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9038.718s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 위원회에 질문이나 의견이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9048.76s">[Andre Leroux]</a>: 나는 당신이 말한 것에 동의합니다, 마이크.
 내 말은, 나는 머틀 로드의 교통량 증가에 대한 버터스의 우려를 이해하지만 그게 전부인 것 같아요.
 사람이 회전하는 것이 더 위험합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9067.528s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 사실 두 경로는 별개인 것 같아요. 내가 이해하는 바에 따르면 북쪽으로 가면 사람들이 출근하는 곳을 추측하면 아마도 시내 어딘가일 것이고 항상 돌아오는 것이 더 일반적인 경로라고 생각합니다.
 아니면 길을 따라 걸어가야 합니다.
 그래서 머틀은 끝난 것 같아요.
 이는 약물을 중단하는 것보다 더 효과적인 치료법일 수 있습니다.
 하지만 내 생각에는 많은 사람들이 북쪽으로 갔다면 양방향이라 할지라도 다시 돌아오는 것이 최선의 선택이라고 생각합니다.
 Robert Parkhurst (PB) – An An: 음, 위원회의 다른 구성원 중 그 문제에 대해 이야기하고 싶어하는 사람은 없는 것 같습니다.
 로버트 파크허스트(Robert Parkhurst), PB - 자세히 알아보기:
 : 그런 다음
 나는 안전을 위해 여론을 다시 열어야 한다고 믿습니다.
 이전에 교통에 관해 일반적인 논평을 한 적이 있다는 것을 알고 있지만 새로운 사항에 대해서도 논의했습니다.

 하지만 네, 그런 일이 일어나지 않도록 하고 싶어요.

 ដូច្នេះហើយ ប្រសិនបើអ្នកណាម្នាក់នៅក្នុងអាគារមានឡានដឹកទំនិញ ឬរថយន្តធំ ពួកគេនឹងមិនអាចបើកទៅកាន់ Fells Way និង Central បានទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា អ្នក​គួរ​តែ​ពិចារណា​វា​ក្នុង​ការ​វាយ​តម្លៃ​របស់​អ្នក។
 យ៉ាងណាក្តី មតិចុងក្រោយរបស់ខ្ញុំ គឺគ្រាន់តែអរគុណចំពោះការលើកឡើងនេះ។ ខ្ញុំពិតជាមានអំណរគុណចំពោះក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាល និងក្រុមហ៊ុន Davis ដែលខ្ញុំបានជួប ហើយពួកគេក៏ត្រូវបានស្វាគមន៍យ៉ាងកក់ក្តៅផងដែរ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ វាមានអត្ថន័យ និងមានប្រយោជន៍នៅពេលអ្នកកំពុងព្យាយាមសន្ទនាទាំងនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​គិត​ថា​ជំនួប​នេះ​គឺ​អំពី​រឿង​នោះ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែតាមគំនិតរបស់ខ្ញុំ ក្នុងនាមជាអ្នករស់នៅយូរអង្វែងតំណាងដោយម្តាយក្មេករបស់ខ្ញុំអស់រយៈពេលពីរឆ្នាំ គាត់បានកាន់កាប់ផ្ទះនេះអស់រយៈពេលជាងហាសិបឆ្នាំមកហើយ ដែលពិតជាអស្ចារ្យណាស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែសូមដឹងថា ការវាយតម្លៃចរាចរណ៍បច្ចុប្បន្នកំពុងត្រូវបានយកចិត្តទុកដាក់យ៉ាងខ្លាំង ជាពិសេស Lawrence, Myrtle និង Fellsway សូមអរគុណច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ចង្អុលបង្ហាញថា តាមពិតការកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ខ្ញុំគិតថាលេខកូដ DCR ថ្មី ខ្ញុំគិតថាពួកគេត្រូវតែមើល ព្រោះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមានឡានធំនៅ Central និង Fellsway អ្នកក៏មិនអាចបត់ដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងឈប់នៅទីនេះ។
 សូមអរគុណ</p>

 저는 이전에 이 말을 한 적이 없습니다. 왜냐하면 우리가 센트럴의 유턴, 로렌스,
 우리 지역에는 도로가 많습니다.
 특정 방법으로만 높이거나 낮출 수 있습니다.
 이 거리에서 수천 마일을 여행한 오랜 거주자인 앨리슨은 내가 당신 집을 지나갈 때 당신에게 손을 흔들기 시작했습니다.
 사람들은 정지 신호에 멈추지 않습니다.
 제가 이 삼각선 위에 섰을 때, 제가 버스에 탔을 때, 사람들은 이 삼각선에 정차하지 않았습니다.
 역에 도착하면 Fells Road에 사람들이 정차하지 않으므로 길을 건너갈 수 있습니다.
 근처에 정지 신호가 있거나 조금 슬프게도 가로등에 보행자 신호가 없습니다.
 빨간불에 우회전하는 사람이 없다면 충돌을 피할 수 있습니다.
 이 도로는 보행자에게 매우 어렵기 때문에 보행자 안전에 관해 논의하는 것을 좋아합니다.
 거리가 그리 깨끗하지는 않지만, 이곳은 베드포드의 중심지입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9537.494s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 감사합니다

 응 알았어.
 이 문제에 대한 여론은 비공개입니다.
 이상으로 오늘 예정된 발사가 끝났습니다.
 이것이 바로 제가 잠시 시간을 내어 다음 만남에 대한 기대를 표현하고 싶은 이유입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9601.232s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 그럼 다시 돌려받을 수 있는지 알아보겠습니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 잠시만 죄송합니다.
 지금 켜야 해요.
 좋아요, 시작해 보겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9645.58s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 따라서 초기 타임라인 측면에서 먼저 아키텍처와 동료 검토에 대해 논의합니다.
 우리는 민사 문제에 대해 논의했지만 아직 이 문제에 대한 사전 이해가 없습니다.
 우리는 이제 주요 친구들의 교통 및 수표에 대해 논의하고 있습니다.
 이에 대해 의견을 보내주십시오.
 우리는 건축 프로젝트를 여러 번 다루었습니다.
 따라서 여전히 동료 검토 방법이 필요합니다.
 건설 및 엔지니어링 프로젝트를 반영하려면 최신 정보가 필요합니다.
 그러면 수요가 발생해야 합니다.
 면제 요청 및 제안 조건.
 그래서 우리가 할 수 있는 시간은 많지만 시간이 많지는 않습니다.
 따라서 다음 회의는 4월 22일로 예정되어 있습니다.
 제가 아는 한, 그 전에는 민간 전문가들의 의견을 듣게 될 것입니다.
 뵙게 될 것 같지만, 회의까지 시간이 얼마나 남았는지는 확실하지 않습니다.
 응시자는 확인할 시간이 있지만 완전한 답변을 제공할 준비가 되어 있지 않을 수도 있습니다.
 따라서 이것은 주로 교통 검토, 민간 검토 및 프로젝트에 대한 일반적인 정보에 대한 후보자의 반응입니다.
 그래서 저는 Nunn씨와 이야기를 나누고 싶습니다.
 이것이 귀하의 계획 및 이해와 일치합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9760.153s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 미래의 관객을 생각할 때 큐레이팅하려고 노력하는 것 같아요.

 그는 다음 주에 Bomber와의 검토 회의를 계획했습니다.
 개인적으로 오늘 오후쯤 배송부서 베타버전이 나올지는 잘 모르겠습니다.
 그래서 저는 이러한 의견이 타당하다고 생각합니다.
 이제 이것은 모든 사람의 마음에 달려 있으며 20일 청문회에 더 많은 관심을 기울여야 하며 23일 대통령은 단지 확인을 원한다고 생각합니다.
 화요일 새벽 2시입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9810.864s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 화요일
 네, 오늘은 23일 화요일입니다.
 그래서 나는 틀렸다.
 그렇죠.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9818.083s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 아...그래서 이번 청문회에서는 교통 문제에 대한 답을 찾으려고 노력할 것 같아요. 나는 스캇의 입장에서 말하고 싶지 않습니다. 나는 그가 그 일을 하고 있다는 것을 알고 있지만 솔직히 우리는 그가 일하는 곳에서 의사소통할 방법이 없습니다. 저번 금요일 오후에 이런 댓글을 받은 것 같은데, 어... 며칠이 지났는데 수술하고 나서 혹시 제안할 수 있는지 알아보자, 어...
 이사회가 동의한다면 우리는 일부 안건에 대해 계속해서 작업할 것입니다.
 트래픽에 어떤 방식으로 반응하고 건설적인 댓글에 어떤 방식으로 반응하자는 생각이 듭니다.
 민간인의 피드백 없이는 23일 준비가 될지 말하기 어렵다.
 그래서 우리의 목표는 교통과 건축을 결합하는 것이라고 생각해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9870.349s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 네, 제가 보기에는 이것이 타당해 보입니다.
 네, 필요한 준비를 하고 시기를 확인해 주시면 감사하겠습니다.
 우리가 동의하기를 바라는 가장 중요한 점은 5월 9일 회의부터 시작하는 모든 일을 완료하려면 계획에 대한 모든 답변과 모든 최신 정보가 정말로 필요하다는 것입니다.
 5월 21일에는 폐쇄하는 것이 전적으로 가능합니다.
 그래서, 일정을 논의하고 저희에게 연락을 하시면 저희가 요청한 대로 모든 것을 전달할 수 없는 상황인 것처럼 보입니다.
 원하신다면 솔직히 5월 21일 이후로 짧은 연장을 생각하고 있지만 지금은 5월 21일 회의가 필요하다는 점만 말씀드리고 싶습니다.
 모든 것이 준비되었으며 5월 9일 압수 및 명령에 대해서만 이야기하고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9955.037s">[FGwns8hP0DA_SPEAKER_00]</a>: 네, 이해합니다.
 3개 섹션 중 2개 섹션이 동료 심사를 거쳤기 때문에 가능한 한 빨리 예의바르게 행동할 수 있다면 우리 직원들이 답변을 얻을 수 있도록 열심히 노력할 것이며 향후 청문회에서 피드백을 제공하여 의견과 질문에 응답할 수 있을 것이라고 믿습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=9973.271s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 이상적인.
 이상적인.
 좋아 보인다.
 감사합니다
 그게 내 이동수단의 전부였어.
 그러면 최소한 우리는 경영진의 의제에 도달할 수 있습니다.
 사실, 그렇게 하기 전에 먼저 진행해야 합니다.
 따라서 대통령은 4월 23일 화요일 18시 30분까지 이 문제를 계속 해결해 달라는 청원을 기다리고 있습니다.

 미안
 컴퓨터를 다시 시작했을 때 작동하지 않는 많은 일을 해야 했고, 이전에 있던 모든 것이 작동하지 않는다는 것을 깨달았습니다.
 하지만 행정상의 업데이트가 있어서 모두가 여기 있으니 다른 회의 날짜를 논의하고 싶은 걸까요?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000649&t=10068.429s">[Mike Caldera]</a>: 물론이죠.
 그러다가 여러 가지 답변을 받았습니다.
 그래서 그것은 현실과 아무 관련이 없습니다. 그렇지 않으면 당신은 듣게 될 것입니다
 협의회는 또 다른 특별 회의 일정을 잡을 예정이다.
 그러다가 4월 3일 시의회는 미스틱 스트리트에서 청문회를 열어 달라는 발의와 요청을 받았습니다.
 40B, HAC가 다시 보드에 올랐습니다.
 그렇기 때문에 30일마다 새로운 청중이 필요합니다.
 때로는 알림 요구 사항으로 인해 이 정보가 필요할 수도 있습니다.
 보통 4월 29일이 주입니다.
 그래서 두 후보의 조언에 따라 날짜를 4월 30일과 5월 2일로 확인해봤습니다.
 이번 회의는 짧은 회의이므로 증거를 수집하지 않을 것입니다.
 몇 가지 절차를 거쳐 다음으로 넘어가겠습니다.
 우리는 후보자에게 자신을 소개하도록 요청할 수 있습니다.
 그런데 답변을 받았는데 4일에서 30일 사이였던 것 같아요.
 따라서 이번 특별회의 개최일은 4일부터 30일이다.
 의제의 유일한 항목은 사건입니다.
 앞서 말했듯이 이번 회의는 절차적인 회의가 될 것입니다.
 따라서 시의회는 시가 동료 고문을 고용할 수 있도록 허용하는 것을 고려해야 합니다.
 내 말은 400억 명의 컨설턴트에 대해 이야기하고 이 문제를 해결할 날짜를 정하면 이러한 컨설턴트를 고용할 시간이 생긴다는 것입니다.
 그렇죠.
 내 생각에는 이 작업을 30분 이내에 완료할 수 있을 것 같습니다.
 아직 약속된 바는 없지만 날짜는 4월 30일 화요일 오후 6시 30분입니다.
 정말 좋은데요, 데니스?</p>
