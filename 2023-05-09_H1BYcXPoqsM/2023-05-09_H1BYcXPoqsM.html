    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=0.63s">I</a>  look forward to presenting under this new format. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=6.331s">So</a>  dear mayor longer current and members of the school committee, as the year winds down to a close, it is hard to believe that there are only six weeks of school left to this academic year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=18.455s">As</a>  I had the opportunity to gather data and reflect on this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=22.757s">There</a>  was so much to be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=24.937s">And</a>  yet at the same time, during the most difficult times, there were many lessons learned from crises. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=33.46s">I</a>  can say that looking back, I have grown both professionally and personally this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=39.263s">As</a>  I forge ahead, I am determined to stay focused on what is important and positive, our students and our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=47.528s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools, currently we are at an important crossroads and through thoughtful community and family collaboration, we will continue to improve and thrive as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=60.735s">I</a>  will provide a few brief highlights now, but I look forward to taking you on my journey with the Medford Public Schools this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=69.378s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools continues to be an inclusive school district, rich in history and diversity, which offers so many educational opportunities for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=81.222s">We</a>  encourage our parents and caregivers to collaborate and to partner in their students' educational processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=89.935s">My</a>  aces of achievement collaboration equity and support guide me in my duties daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=96.937s">Additionally,</a>  social emotional learning continues to be a cornerstone of our district, along with responsive classroom and restorative practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=107.421s">This</a>  year we work to hire additional guidance Councilors and social workers adjustment Councilors school psychologists, teachers and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=117.044s">We</a>  join the Sandy Hook promise to teach our students to start with hello, see something say something initiative, and new to us this year, we implemented the new say something anonymous reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=132.809s">in</a>  an effort to empower everyone, students and staff to help create change and promote safer schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=141.492s">We</a>  also implemented a 10 point action plan at Medford High School for safety, transparency, culture, climate and accountability, which did include the Sandy Hook promise, updating the handbook and implementing new hall and bathroom passes for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=161.152s">Additionally,</a>  we offered viewings of screenagers presentations for our middle school students and parents and caregivers to help them be aware of the dangers of too much screen time. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=173.371s">In</a>  my practice, I continue to bring an equity lens to all the work that I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=178.153s">I</a>  stand in agreement with this quote from Maya Angelou. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=181.495s">In</a>  diversity, there is beauty and there is strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=185.236s">In</a>  Medford, there is so much beautiful diversity and strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=190.719s">I</a>

href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=213.044s">In</a>  closing, for this portion, the sea of aces represents collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=219.469s">Without</a>  the collaboration, thought partnership, and input from my senior leadership team, Peter Cushing, Suzanne Galuzzi, Joan Bowen, and MPS administrators, this work could not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=232.098s">I'm</a>  truly grateful that I have such a talented team to work with collaboratively with and on behalf of Medford Public School students, staff, and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=243.085s">So</a>  I am going to take you through my evaluation self guide self evaluation, and I'm going to ask Dr. Cushing, if he would be

shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=271.252s">And</a>  also all the work that we do is linked and connected to the district's strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=283.639s">So</a>  the district improvement goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=286.684s">When</a>  I presented my goals for school year 22-23, the overarching goal was that during this school year, the Medford Public Schools will improve the systems and structures that directly impact student services and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=303.774s">Improved</a>  outcomes or plans to improve outcomes will be seen in student transportation, communications, and facilities operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=317.93s">and</a>  I listed key actions and outcomes under the district improvement goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=329.918s">I</a>  am going to, I'm sorry, Dr. Cushing, would you mind just going back? <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=335.042s">I'm</a>  gonna just highlight a few of the proposed outcomes that were stated under the district improvement goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=347.33s">Bicycle</a>  racks updated at middle and high school complexes. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=353.035s">I</a>  am pleased

pleased to report that the panorama survey for our high school students will be administered this Thursday, May 11th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=463.866s">I</a>  received confirmation from Principal DeLeva today, and it took a considerable amount of time for the survey to be uploaded into the panorama portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=479.797s">And</a>  for the translations. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=482.019s">There</a>  was a lot of back and forth back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=485.943s">So</a>  we did not expect it to take this long, but I am pleased to say that it is in their portal, and our students will be taking that survey on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=503.05s">Dr</a>  Christian we can move to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=506.493s">I'd</a>  actually like you to go forward one more and I'm going to have you go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=509.996s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=511.177s">Our</a>  student learning goal was to assess early literacy skills, implementing interventions and literacy to improve outcomes by deepening teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=523.428s">and</a>  principal knowledge of early literacy practices while maintaining a district wide focus on instruction and assessment through the continued use of NWEA map. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=535.412s">And</a>  so this student growth goal is a continuation from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=545.036s">We</a>  started the early literacy journey, and we are continuing with that this year and we've continued to make substantive changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=559.904s">Four</a>  key actions were identical to last year and we added two additional key actions of continued use of end of the map, which we are doing in our core program review, which is taking place right now with health for literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=583.358s">And</a>  so, some of our proposed outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=588.217s">We</a>  proposed that there would be full implementation of equity across all the key to two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=596.585s">Yes,</a>  it is fully implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=600.732s">And</a>  equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=602.654s">In</a>  addition to being fully implemented K to two. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=606.498s">This</a>  year, our great three teachers have been trained, so that they to have a greater understanding of the instruction that their students received from K to two so continuing to build upon that. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=621.494s">principles</a>  and Hill for literacy consultants continue to complete monthly rounds and going deeper on visible implementation of the science of reading across all of our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=640.76s">Intentional</a>  analysis is taking place with our early literacy programs that includes ECRI, DIBELS, and NWEA MAP growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=654.629s">Student</a>  supports are analyzed and adjusted as a result of this benchmark data. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=660.894s">Also,</a>  the new literacy program being selected <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=666.218s">The</a>  programs that are being vetted are Wonders, McGraw-Hill, My View Literacy Sabbath, and Interreading by Houghton Riefling. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=678.988s">There</a>  will be publisher and user roundtable session that's going to take place next week on May 18 with a selection of the program by May 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=692.233s">So</a>  we are right in the thick of things right now but by the end of this month, a final selection will be made for the new literacy program. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=704.337s">Under</a>  accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=707.932s">The</a>  assessment window for NWEA map testing will be closing on June 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=716.016s">I</a>  will be able to have that data to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=720.848s">hopefully</a>  by June 9, because it takes about 24 hours for the data to turn over after the window closes. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=729.654s">The</a>  measurement again for students in grades six through 10, that assessment window is going to close on May 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=738.98s">And</a>  again, we will need a 24 to 48 hour window to be able to get some data regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=746.665s">And</a>  65% of students will meet or exceed their projected growth on the NW EA map assessments by the spring of 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=755.453s">Those</a>  reports for the winter progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=764.6s">We</a>  would like to have a presentation to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=768.945s">If</a>  it's not May 15, it would be the following meeting by Miss Lucy, and we'll be able to have samples for your reference at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=780.138s">Dr</a>  cushion Can you go to professional practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=783.282s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=784.864s">The</a>  professional practice goal was for me to continue to further develop my skills in strategy development, data analysis, instructional leadership, and district-wide communications through participating in superintendent-level professional development sessions this year using Leading Now and MassReady, which is Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents Professional Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=815.564s">And</a>  that has been, there is ongoing work that is taking place and I will have some additional information that I will be able to share with you regarding my professional practice goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=839.613s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=842.611s">So</a>  the next slide shows the focus standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=846.094s">And</a>  this is new this year, working with the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=848.737s">The</a>  committee identified the following standards that they would like to focus in on as you look at the pieces of evidence that are provided as evidence for all of the listed indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=869.238s">So</a>  the focus standards are instructional leadership, data-informed decision-making, environment, engagement, sharing responsibility, communication, commitment to high standards, cultural proficiency, and managing conflict.</p>

    <p>[o9F0qYH9Geo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=893.262s">Under</a>  instructional leadership, standard 1B,</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=899.048s">It</a>  ensures that practices in all settings reflect high expectations regarding content and quality of effort, and work engage all students and are personalized to accommodate diverse learning styles, needs, interests, and levels of readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=916.005s">Some</a>  samples of support, the level of readiness, we have new schedules for the 2324 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=925.035s">Every</a>  student will be participating in wind blocks in what I need in literacy and mathematics, looking at diverse learning styles. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=936.687s">language-based</a>  learning groups and different specific learning groups that we are trying to provide targeted professional development for our staff and community under student engagement activities that also involve instructional leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=955.959s">We</a>  do have CCSR, our clubs, our sports, and we participated in the DESE district review with AIR. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=966.337s">Under</a>  our next standard one e data informed decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=973.701s">This</a>  is just a highlight to show that multiple sources of evidence related to student learning, including state district and school assessment results and growth data to inform our goals in to improve organizational performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=990.41s">These</a>  again are just a few of the assessments that have been taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=995.432s">Equi,</a>  DIBLS, the NWEA map, and MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1003.355s">Also,</a>  we continue to use tiered instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1008.857s">Under</a>  section 1E, data informed decision making, continuing <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1018.041s">uses</a>  multiple sources of evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1024.106s">All</a>  ninth grade students will participate in an exploratory rotation that now includes all 15 shops at the vocational school, as well as music, art, theater, and computer offerings. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1036.235s">And</a>  Dr. Cushing, I'm not sure if you're able to click on the hyperlink.</p>

    <p>[o9F0qYH9Geo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1045.082s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1052.079s">Let</a>  me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1052.559s">Okay,</a>  we can just keep moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1068.311s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. crushing.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1085.003s">So,</a>  there is a slide graph showing you some data for our vocational programming and how that data is continuing to show increased interest in our career technical education offerings vocational programming at Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1106.397s">And</a>  so as a result of seeing that using the data and seeing that there's increased interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1114.563s">And</a>  one of the areas where it was woefully neglected was the arts specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1121.448s">And</a>  so using the data, looking at how we could creatively incorporate the arts and being able to have that become part of the rotation is really wonderful for our students for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1137.659s">We</a>  can move to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1140.921s">Under</a>  category to environment develops and execute executes effective plans procedures routines and operational systems to address a full range of safety health emotional and social needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1157.933s">And</a>  so a few samples would be school-based evacuation plans, responsive classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1167.499s">We</a>  are using, at the middle schools, cell programming and Nexus class offerings that we offer within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1180.328s">Also,</a>  I have additional <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1184.747s">pieces</a>  of evidence for standard two <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1191.559s">We're,</a>  we're talking about environment but there are many other things that fell under standard to under management and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1202.448s">And</a>  one of them that I highlighted was that we made significant improvements in the traffic flow and congestion that had been taking place at the high school and at the start of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1216.099s">We.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1219.402s">moved</a>  from school starting pick up and drop off at the front of the building, everything kind of shifting to the West courtyard, which has really alleviated the congestion that would go all the way on to Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1233.034s">And</a>  so now dismissal there is probably about 15 minutes of a little activity whereas before it was significantly longer.</p>

    <p>[o9F0qYH9Geo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1245.084s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1249.482s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1252.269s">Under</a>  category three. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1254.963s">which</a>  is family, community, and engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1258.004s">Category</a>  three, there are three indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1262.606s">Under-engagement</a>  actively ensures that all families are welcome members of the classroom and school community and can contribute to the effectiveness of the classroom, school, district, and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1274.932s">We</a>  have unified basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1277.353s">We</a>  had the Women's History Month celebration, the Black History Month celebration, <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1283.435s">middle</a>  school open houses that just took place last week, our eighth grade course selection night, which I was hugging our mascot at that event but there were a lot of families that came out a lot of questions were asked and it was really an exciting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1302.811s">to</a>  think about engagement and when we think about engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1308.413s">There</a>  are many many events between the middle school lottery the middle school open houses which I said elementary events, which will be coming up field day fun day kindergarten open houses which just took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1327.221s">Our</a>  sports programming and camp Mustang that will be coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1334.13s">We</a>  had our veteran presentations to honor Veterans Day that was engagement with members of the community partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1344.964s">We</a>  are just receiving a new autism communication board at the McGlynn and those are going to be rolled out at other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1356.95s">Again</a>  Thanksgiving flag football inclusive team, and just many other events including the football game that took place at Fenway. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1371.417s">Building</a>  bridges to kindergarten jumpstart music program which happens in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1377.164s">So</a>  there are definitely opportunities continued opportunities for engagement, sharing responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1392.13s">continuously</a>  collaborates with families and community stakeholders to support student learning and development at home, and in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1401.892s">We</a>  just recently conducted our budget Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1404.772s">At</a>  principal meetings, we meet to discuss best practices during our rebus professional development trainings to ensure that we have consistency in the evaluation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1419.616s">We</a>  are currently, I am pleased to announce that we concluded the high school principal search but we had three concurrent principal searches taking place, which included the voices of parents and community and student involvement, family surveys, which will be upcoming for the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1441.395s">We're</a>  working on a community wide project which involved all schools within the district, and we have active PTOs parents supporting parent volunteers, supporting all of our athletic teams field trips enrichment events and we had the blizzard basketball game which was a sold out success. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1463.997s">And</a>  we support and always advertise for all of our CPAC events that are taking place within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1473.169s">So</a>  those are some examples of sharing responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1476.413s">The</a>  next category of 3C communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1482.1s">which</a>  I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, we engage in regular two way culturally proficient communication with families and community stakeholders about student learning and performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1497.234s">The</a>  weekly memo, although it is one sided going out in one direction the weekly memo does. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1507.624s">We</a>  ensure that it is translated in the four most popular languages that are in the district, which are Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, and Arabic. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1519.968s">And</a>  for talking points, it's a two-way application that we use with our non-English speaking families. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1528.611s">So</a>  that has really gotten significant traction. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1532.913s">where</a>  messages can be sent out to families through talking points, and they are able to respond right away and communicate with teachers or administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1544.561s">So</a>  that is one of the areas where we clearly, I feel, are making strong inroads with communications and with our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1558.911s">The</a>  next standard is for and for a is commitment to high standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1566.081s">fostering</a>  a shared commitment to high standards of service, teaching and learning with high expectations for achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1573.444s">We</a>  had our ethics school, we had our students that traveled down to North Carolina, our robotics team, which just was recognized for their wonderful underwater robot. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1587.189s">We</a>  had mock trials, athletic accomplishments this year, which were many. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1594.511s">and</a>  expansion of after school offerings and programs for our students to participate in enrichment activities for be cultural proficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1608.762s">It</a>  ensures that policies and practices enable staff members and students to interact effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1617.728s">in</a>  a culturally diverse environment in which students backgrounds identities strengths and challenges are respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1624.15s">And</a>  we just had a wonderful trip to France that took place for many of our students to learn about a new culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1635.074s">This</a>  committee has already approved travel next year to Italy and Spain. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1641.277s">We</a>  had the Black History Celebration, the Women's History Month celebration, the Haitian Flag Day celebration is upcoming next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1652.163s">And</a>  I also participated in the Japanese New Year celebration in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1658.806s">And</a>  I spoke to our Japanese partners and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1664.569s">and</a>  at their graduation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1668.07s">The</a>  next category, category 4F, managing conflict, employ strategies for responding to disagreement and dissent, constructively resolving conflict and building consensus throughout a district or school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1686.017s">So</a>  we had many, many negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1688.018s">We</a>  still have four more to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1690.659s">But</a>  I did list that that, you know, negotiation sometimes can be contentious, and it takes time to get to the finish line but just being able to work through it and get to that finish line I wanted to cite that as a piece of evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1707.716s">When</a>  we had the crisis that took place at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1711.66s">We</a>  offered listening sessions for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1715.363s">staff</a>  and we held assemblies and those took place, multiple events and we offered additional support sell support to our school community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1729.875s">We</a>  brought in Mr. Michael Welch as an administrative consultant to work with the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1735.519s">to</a>  support his to support us and to provide his expertise in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1742.803s">We</a>  held Q and A's and also just to help bring about a greater systems and structures as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1751.828s">We</a>  implemented the new hallway and bathroom system at the high school with the passes and e-hall passes and there's just a sample here of the listening sessions and <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1764.455s">when</a>  they had taken place, and also the say something app which was presented to the committee already, but this is again something where students, staff, if they want to be able to report something anonymously, they are able to report it and we are able to follow through with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1788.064s">And</a>  so those are all of the indicators and I just wanted to thank the community, and the committee for this opportunity to present my. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1803.478s">self-assessment</a>  to you and provide evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1808.342s">And</a>  I just wanted to close in saying that in order to continue the work of leading this district, it could not be done again without the support of a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1818.008s">And</a>  I wholeheartedly thank the support of my senior leadership team again, and the administrators who manage all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1826.134s">This</a>  takes collaboration and coordination of teams, administrators, teachers, and staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1832.578s">to</a>  create the best learning environment for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1837.442s">And</a>  so, I close by saying I am still the very proud superintendent of the Medford Public Schools, and I am very grateful to be a member of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1850.431s">And</a>  those are my closing remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1853.975s">And</a>  I thank you for this opportunity to present, and I just put in an additional note that there are a few additional hyperlinks that I would like to add between over the next 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1869.512s">so</a>  that the supplemental document which I just sent as an email, but I will continue to add to that document because it is a living document and we have the proms coming up and there are a few other things that I would like to include for your review before we come back on May 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/H1BYcXPoqsM&t=1891.562s">Thank</a>
