    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=239.156s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=240.176s">So,</a>  um, I think everyone is familiar now with the, um, Section 3A of Chapter 48 of Mass General Law, but I'll go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=249.198s">Um,</a>  basically, um, several years ago, the Baker administration, under the Baker administration, the, um, 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=259.57s">One,</a>  I don't know, it seemed like a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=263.311s">But</a>  there was a law passed requiring that all MBTA served communities adopt a zoning district that would allow multifamily by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=279.255s">The</a>  language of the act was very sparse. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=282.916s">So</a>  the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=289.345s">issued</a>  guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=290.546s">They</a>  were updated several times, most recently in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=295.908s">So</a>  every time they change, it's taken a bit of a catch up. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=300.61s">But</a>  they determined the amount of units that have to be produced for each municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=308.653s">And</a>  Medford's is 6,443. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=309.253s">And</a>  75% of those have to be within <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=317.858s">a</a>  half mile of a station area, an eligible station area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=322.182s">Back</a>  in the summer, we got a technical assistance grant to hire a consultant to crunch the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=332.151s">The</a>  state created a compliance model where you would basically <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=340.047s">upload</a>  all of the city's parcel data, and then we would put in all the zoning inputs, and it would spit out how many units could be produced or they could be yielded in any of those districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=356.956s">And</a>  we tested the station areas, all of the station areas in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=362.358s">And</a>  because of excluded land, other areas, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=370.916s">big</a>  parks, Tufts, City of Somerville, which we can't count, because a lot of the stations are right on the line, that the only real place feasible area that would work is the Wellington Orange Line station. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=386.904s">So</a>  we moved forward with that, taking the approach of creating an overlay, which would be superimposed over the base zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=397.629s">So</a>  it wouldn't touch the base zoning at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=401.072s">We</a>  want to do that eventually to implement a comprehensive plan, but that's a bigger project. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=406.473s">So</a>  we're just doing an overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=411.214s">So</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=413.554s">I</a>  can bring up the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=415.194s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=418.355s">I'll</a>  share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=419.735s">I</a>  feel like the button's all moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=428.837s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=437.35s">Can</a>  folks see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=442.951s">So</a>  based on some assumptions that we put into the model, the shaded or the blue parcels would be included in this overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=461.994s">We</a>  didn't include some of these denser <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=469.481s">single</a>  and two-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=473.922s">So</a>  this is the existing station landing area that's built out. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=478.784s">This</a>  is the mixed-use zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=482.025s">This</a>  is the newly rezoned to the MUZ as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=489.127s">This</a>  is the... What the heck is the name of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=495.805s">the</a>  roast beef place, Kelly's Roast Beef. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=498.626s">And</a>  then this is all owned by the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=502.867s">So</a>  this is technically excluded because we can't, our zoning doesn't apply to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=511.891s">And</a>  then up here is some existing apartments and then some other taller buildings, the Cappy's, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=525.1s">The,</a>  yeah, this is the Cappy's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=528.022s">And</a>  then the building with the tattoo shop, and there's some other stuff there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=535.949s">And</a>  then this is a piece of the Wellington Plaza over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=543.375s">And</a>  that is based on, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=547.853s">getting</a>  just a little bit over the number that we need to hit, the 6,443, based on, if you look at the zoning, minimum parking 0.8 per unit and five stories as the baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=568.481s">I'll</a>  stop sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=570.722s">So</a>  this is the proposed, we're calling it the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=577.891s">So</a>  because of some of the limitations of the law, where we can't require mixed use, we can't require anything that would be construed as somehow dampening housing production, that the way that we approach this was through a series of incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=599.703s">So</a>  because we want this area to be walkable and there to be amenities for folks, rather than just a bunch of standalone apartment buildings, we'd like there to be corner stores and places to go about your daily errands. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=616.693s">So</a>  we set the floor at five stories as the minimum or as the max height, but with incentives such as, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=629.988s">Should</a>  I put this up so people can follow along? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=663.863s">I'm</a>  going to share my screen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=675.626s">Can</a>  you see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=677.987s">Is</a>  this the text of the amendment?</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=682.428s">Yeah,</a>  but it's very small.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=684.029s">I'm</a>  going to make it bigger.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=692.044s">That's</a>  better, is that good enough for the members or should we zoom in further? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=696.046s">Is</a>  that good? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=699.388s">Yeah,</a>  that's good right there.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=701.63s">Yeah,</a>  so just to briefly go through this, we have this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=703.631s">So</a>  the state that they've been trying to make it as easy as possible by providing technical assistance and then they had some kind of like a framework of model zoning that we adapted for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=719.995s">So</a>  just like with the outline, so like the purposes, you know, the applicability, then we had to add some new definitions that we didn't have already. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=731.785s">And</a>  then, so the table of uses and parking regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=735.569s">So</a>  the uses, the residential uses that would be allowed by right would be senior housing facility and multifamily. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=744.636s">Currently</a>  multifamily is not <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=746.963s">In</a>  our current zoning ordinance, we have class A and class B, multiple dwelling, and those are convoluted and associated with maximum heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=759.209s">So</a>  we just took that out and created the new category multifamily for this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=769.233s">And</a>  then so some of the we were thinking about, okay, what other uses would we want to allow by right with site plan review in this district to have, you know, kind of like a live, work and play area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=781.3s">So</a>  community uses, some of the commercial uses like recreation, hotel, brewery or taproom, you know, some office uses, some of them we decided should be by special permit, because perhaps on certain <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=799.185s">streets</a>  it would make more sense to have more active uses and in other places it would be okay to have like a medical office or bank but we're trying to get away from banks and other insurance agencies from occupying like prime storefronts areas that could be more active. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=819.641s">So</a>  retail sales <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=822.048s">neighborhood</a>  retail, consumer services, all by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=826.91s">Drive-thru</a>  is by special permit from the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=831.392s">Currently</a>  in the MUZ, there's a drive-thru for Walgreens. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=835.413s">So</a>  we wanted to be able to keep that option if there was a site-specific location, then it would be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=845.077s">So</a>  it would be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=847.202s">It</a>  might be OK on a certain parcel, but we didn't want it to be by right across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=853.264s">In</a>  some parcels, it might not be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=857.446s">And</a>  then miscellaneous commercial uses, so parking areas or parking garages, but not surface parking lots standalone for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=871.632s">Research</a>  and testing, home occupation, more child care, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=875.9s">And</a>  then the scientific research development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=882.925s">I'm</a>  now just realizing that non-commercial greenhouse tool shed or similar accessory structure, we don't have anything in that column. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=892.872s">I'll</a>  have to figure out what was supposed to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=895.474s">I'm</a>  imagining it was supposed to be a Y, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=900.077s">Do</a>  you recall, Alicia? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=901.158s">I'm</a>  not sure how that.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=906.203s">I</a>  think I did, but at this point, anything that we want changed should actually come as a recommendation from the CD board to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=914.826s">Let</a>  me see if it's in the other version that, sorry, yes, Emily sends us. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=922.688s">My</a>  brain just blopped because Emily is on the board and Emily is our consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=928.07s">And</a>  just FYI, I did hear back from Emily and she's had something urgent come up and she can't make it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=938.479s">So</a>  for the dimensional standards, and so this is actually different than how most of the rest of our ordinance is treated where uses are tied to a dimensional standard rather than the zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=953.128s">So</a>  we're trying to get away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=959.512s">So</a>  this table reflects that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=963.974s">So</a>  we have a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=967.952s">Maximum</a>  building coverage, 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=969.073s">And</a>  then, what is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=971.875s">Oh,</a>  yeah, and then the maximum height, minimum stories, two, maximum five. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=980.921s">And</a>  then maximum with bonus incentives, nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=983.923s">And</a>  then 80 feet, 140 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=987.105s">And</a>  then the setbacks, zero to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=989.226s">And</a>  then there's <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=994.188s">some</a>  development standards of what can be within those front yard setbacks later on in this document, as we're trying to get away from front yard parking and other things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1006.052s">And</a>  then we have the setbacks, side yard or interior rear yard setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1014.494s">And</a>  then the table of development incentive bonuses, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1023.797s">And</a>  I would love any feedback on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1026.882s">So,</a>  some of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1032.19s">Provisions</a>  that we thought to, we would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1035.596s">In</a>  this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1038.997s">district</a>  that we can't require, but we would like to incentivize, is providing active ground floor space would get you an additional story added. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1050.804s">So</a>  you could get six stories if your ground floor is active. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1056.088s">Another</a>  way to get an additional story is to provide below market rent for a commercial tenant or nonprofit or local business under <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1069.471s">10</a>  employees, and we're trying to create a space where small businesses can thrive and don't get priced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1079.395s">So</a>  this is kind of experimental. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1081.555s">We'll</a>  see how it works, but I've always wondered why we have affordable housing and subsidized housing, but we don't have subsidized commercial spaces for nonprofits and small businesses and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1100.392s">can't</a>  compete with some of the bigger chains and banks and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1104.513s">So</a>  we'll see how this works out. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1110.954s">A</a>  lot of zoning is just testing it and seeing what sticks and if anything comes out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1118.955s">And</a>  then additional incentives is for deeper affordability of the units and increased affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1126.157s">Currently,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1127.283s">Our</a>  inclusionary zoning ordinance that we have is not allowed unless we can prove through a third party economic feasibility analysis that it won't stymie housing production. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1144.733s">And</a>  so that's currently being performed by MAPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1148.134s">And</a>  they expect that the findings will be that our existing ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1156.237s">is</a>  economically feasible and will be able to apply it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1159.178s">So</a>  currently we're operating under the assumption that we will be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1162.799s">Right</a>  now the state is saying the baseline is 10% of units at 80% AMI is allowed, but anything more than that, you need to prove that it's viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1176.122s">And</a>  then some of the other incentives <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1182.663s">are</a>  for if you have a net zero emissions building or build to different LEED certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1192.149s">Initially,</a>  we were going to require more things, but the city recently adopted the specialized stretch code. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1200.633s">So</a>  folks are going to have to do them anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1204.336s">So</a>  we're like, what can we require that won't already be required? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1207.938s">And</a>  our climate planner <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1212.594s">identified</a>  that these were feasible things that folks could do to achieve some density bonuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1228.762s">And</a>  then so there'll be exceptions and exemptions from setbacks for certain things, like renewable energy installations, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1238.76s">you</a>  know, some exceptions from that, from going into setbacks or height. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1244.403s">And</a>  then for parking, we are proposing to use the same parking standards in the rest of the city for within half mile of high frequency transit, which is 0.8 spaces per dwelling unit for market rate and 0.5 for affordable dwelling units. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1266.283s">But</a>  one of the things that's different is that we actually putting a maximum parking on this so that you can only build one and a half spaces per dwelling unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1277.326s">That's</a>  the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1278.866s">So</a>  a developer can't say we really need two spaces per unit and build that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1286.188s">It</a>  wouldn't be allowed unless they got a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1291.349s">And</a>  then we have some biking parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1295.562s">Bike</a>  parking spaces, one per dwelling unit is the minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1302.463s">Bike</a>  storage, EV parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1306.864s">And</a>  then this section is the design guidelines and development standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1312.605s">So</a>  this goes into different aspects of site design, which would supplement our site plan review criteria and performance standards elsewhere in our ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1325.788s">to</a>  specifically speak to this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1334.731s">And</a>  does anyone have any questions about any of these? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1337.912s">This</a>  talks about like building placement and where parking should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1353.637s">That</a>  is it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1357.094s">I'll</a>  stop sharing my screen for the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1361.215s">Daniel,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1363.316s">One</a>  of the questions I wanted before you went through is, can you explain to the board and to the public exactly why this district was chosen and how it relates to, like for instance, why not West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1380.92s">Why</a>  not Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1382.1s">Why</a>  is it at Wellington?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1386.019s">Can</a>  you answer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1387.741s">I'm</a>  just going to mention that we have the presentation that we had done for the public that has the map that shows those other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1395.807s">Would</a>  that be helpful to have to illustrate your answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1400.791s">I</a>  realize that I don't have it open on my computer, but I can get it up.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1408.117s">First</a>  to the draw. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1410.719s">Do</a>  you want me to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1411.64s">Sure,</a>  you can do it.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1416.867s">I</a>  was actually just talking to Clem that we should get these up onto our web page. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1420.55s">I</a>  apologize that we had not. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1423.813s">Oh,</a>  Clem just sent me a link. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1436.502s">I</a>  have also the presentation that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1439.204s">All</a>  right, let me. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1447.885s">I'm</a>  just trying to share this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1451.106s">Actually,</a>  what I want to do is just share this image. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1454.427s">So</a>  let me share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1457.949s">So</a>  part of this is what Danielle was talking about is, let me see if I can figure out a good way to, if I can view that into a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1471.033s">Fit</a>  to window, view.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1476.89s">And</a>  Alicia, one of the things that I was hoping that can be illustrated here is myself as a planner and knowing more about the law, the MBTA law and how it is, I know, and just speaking with the city that moving it, moving it to another part of it, the city is not feasible with compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1492.186s">But</a>  if you can paint out what that looks like for the audience, for the public and for the board.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1497.932s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1498.412s">So</a>  there's a couple of things and what part of what you can see here is that huge swaths of the two Green Line stations, the half mile are actually in the Somerville area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1513.043s">Huge</a>  amounts of that is actually taken up by Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1516.625s">All</a>  of this pink here is Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1519.447s">land,</a>  all of that doesn't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1521.949s">And</a>  the other thing is you have to have reasonable minimum lot sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1528.232s">And</a>  almost all of this area, although I'm afraid this image doesn't show it either, are lots that are on the order of 5,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1538.078s">They're</a>  like single family lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1540.78s">And</a>  so it would be effectively not making a district because it would be extraordinarily hard to assemble any parcels to make multifamily housing in these areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1553.754s">There</a>  are a couple of locations and we're starting to see those spring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1559.907s">But</a>  a lot of it was all the very dense single and two-family housing in all of this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1567.572s">In</a>  this area, it is all these very tiny lots all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1572.996s">There</a>  really isn't space for multi-family except for a very small area around the train station here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1580.581s">Danielle,</a>  you want to add stuff to that as well?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1587.266s">Yeah,</a>  because when you <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1589.405s">Enter</a>  these into the model, even with a zero, or with no minimum lot size. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1595.63s">The</a>  model tests real parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1600.314s">So</a>  it's not just land. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1605.618s">If</a>  you have a 3,000 square foot parcel, what could conceivably be built on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1613.523s">with</a>  the push and pull of all the dimensionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1615.624s">So</a>  if you have even like an 80% lot coverage, and then fitting in any kind of parking, and it's just, it starts to, you only get like a handful of units. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1632.788s">And</a>  also it's the land area and keeping it contiguous, you just keep bumping up against things. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1638.549s">And</a>  also one of the issues with, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1642.922s">spreading</a>  it around is we lose a lot of the local control over what we can have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1650.829s">So</a>  in West Medford, you have this village center that's very vibrant and walkable, and we're trying to make it more vibrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1664.501s">We</a>  can't require retail or commercial <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1668.975s">So</a>  we can't require mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1671.436s">So</a>  having a 3A overlay there wouldn't match the historic built environment of that village center. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1682.541s">It</a>  gets difficult because of the things that we can't require. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1686.083s">And</a>  also in the beginning, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1689.605s">The</a>  first guidelines was you can't have inclusionary housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1694.467s">You</a>  can't have it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1697.108s">And</a>  then there was outcry. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1698.128s">I</a>  wrote the senator, Jaylen, being like, this is nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1701.509s">We</a>  need to be able to allow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1703.69s">And</a>  then DHCD, as their name was at the time, kind of backpedaled on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1710.492s">It's</a>  like, OK, you can have your inclusionary zoning, but you can only do this if you already had it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1717.483s">And</a>  then there's still outcry, like, but we just adopted it and it wasn't in place then. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1721.387s">And</a>  so it was just a lot of uncertainty of what we could require it would be allowed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1729.695s">And</a>  the more it spread out, like, having different rules for different districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1737.561s">started</a>  to get very complicated, especially since we're trying to embark on a full-fledged zoning overhaul that would change all of our base zoning and the overlays might not be appropriate in all of these different spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1760.59s">So</a>  the simplest and most straightforward one <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1768.78s">was</a>  feasible was Wellington because of the lot sizes, the land area, and what we could get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1779.487s">There's</a>  just too much excluded land around the Tufts Station, not enough land around Ball, and the West Medford was also very complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1791.155s">It</a>  has excluded land too, but you have Playstead Park and then <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1796.732s">some</a>  of those very, very small parcels.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1801.016s">And</a>  actually, I just want to touch on something that Danielle just said that I just think, I think that this board is very aware of, but I don't know that members of the public are, is that this is not like, oh, we have to take advantage of this bite at the apple to change zoning because it's so hard to change zoning in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1819.134s">That</a>  is actually very true historically, but we actually have an RFP out right now to hire a zoning consultant jointly with the city council to do a full fledged redraft of zoning throughout the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1834.963s">And</a>  so what we really focused on here was the state is putting heavy pressure on us to pass this residential multifamily as of right by December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1848.669s">So</a>  let's do that and be in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1852.372s">And</a>  on Tuesday of next week, we are getting our bids back for hiring a zoning consultant jointly with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1861.319s">And</a>  so our office and the city council are going to hire a zoning consultant with the intention of spending 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1869.577s">looking</a>  at the entire city and how do we use our comprehensive plan and everything in our comprehensive plan that said what we wanted to see and how do we actually change because if you start digging into our zoning it's bizarre. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1884.751s">It's</a>  just really weird and so how do we just throw out all of it and start over clean and <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1893.178s">For</a>  this, we wanted to, what can we do that is clean, straightforward, everybody can understand, shouldn't have any unintended consequences, and meets the regulations? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1906.22s">Does</a>  that answer your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1910.821s">And</a>  I'm going to take the chair down.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1912.721s">So</a>  because this is one of the questions that I have, and I think one of the only other questions that I have, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1922.89s">And</a>  then I'll open it up for the board for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1926.491s">It's</a>  the parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1927.831s">Since</a>  we're doing this in a transit oriented development and we have 0.5 at this point, and we can actually really go big and create more density. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1941.454s">No</a>  parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1942.834s">Get</a>  rid of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1944.294s">Is</a>  that feasible? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1945.575s">Is</a>  that something that <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1948.63s">And</a>  if I'm not mistaken, Danielle, you've ran the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1953.251s">Can</a>  you share with the board what that would mean if we were to get rid of the parking limit?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1958.713s">Yeah,</a>  so I ran the model with zero, with a parking minimum of zero spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1967.295s">And</a>  the number jumped up to, let's see here, it was 11,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1979.497s">745</a>  going from 0.8 to zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1988.221s">The</a>  only thing with that is we would want to bring down the height so that developers would actually take advantage of those incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=1999.505s">Because</a>  instead of putting a couple floors of <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2008.922s">parking</a>  wrapped with housing on top, then they would just build the housing without any of the other things that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2023.954s">So</a>  then I ran it with 0.5 rather than 0.8, and that gets you <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2034.358s">a</a>  little over 7,000 units and dropping the height down, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2037.181s">So</a>  I can even</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2051.105s">share</a>  this so you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2053.008s">But</a>  while Dania's doing that, I actually just want to raise, like, do we think that allowing people to build housing there with no parking is actually a good idea in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2064.344s">Do</a>  you believe that people would move into apartment buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2068.61s">And</a>  I look at it and I see it's right next to Route 16, Route 28, and it's about four blocks from 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2075.796s">And</a>  they wouldn't buy cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2077.498s">And</a>  then what would they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2078.939s">Or</a>  they would live there and then they'd realize that they actually need a car to get to Medford Square and to do other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2086.365s">And</a>  all of a sudden, we have housing built with no parking that residents <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2094.562s">are</a>  buying cars and now they're parking them in the neighborhoods and in the parking lots and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2101.309s">We're</a>  already seeing overflow parking in Hormel Stadium from the apartment buildings around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2108.13s">That's</a>  just my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2110.471s">Incentivizing</a>  fewer cars makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2114.352s">I'm</a>  very nervous about the developer that actually builds the building with no parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2121.874s">But</a>  I would be interested in hearing what the rest of the board thinks.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2129.19s">Yeah,</a>  I guess I'm not sure if I'm alone in this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2132.752s">And</a>  I understand your reservation on it, but we, our car dependency is the reason why we're in trouble with the house insurance now. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2140.256s">So</a>  I just saw it as an opportunity just to not to be so car dependent, but I can also understand on the other side, because I happen to live in one of those apartment buildings near Homel that you just referenced.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2154.923s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think there is a concern with <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2158.454s">that</a>  and I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2159.695s">I</a>  mean, there is a part of me that likes to think that if somebody is signing a lease or whatever for a building that they know doesn't have any parking or a unit that doesn't have a parking space attached to it, they know what they're getting into and they're not going to suddenly decide they need a car after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2184.785s">But</a>  I can't understand that that's not <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2187.948s">That's</a>  not always going to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2189.232s">And</a>  sometimes people are going to do that and it's going to put a, you're going to, you're going to end up having a car with nowhere to go.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2200.361s">I</a>  also do understand that concern, and I think there is an element of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2206.624s">That</a>  being said, being connected to the Green Line does give access to most amenities that people starting leases would need. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2215.329s">They</a>  may not all be in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2217.45s">They</a>  might take the Green Line to, say, Somerville.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2220.232s">The</a>  Orange Line?</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2222.153s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2223.013s">Wellington,</a>  not Ball Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2225.154s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2229.282s">I</a>  do like the idea of at least lowering the parking minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2236.209s">Maybe</a>  thinking about that 0.5 instead of 0.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2238.971s">I</a>  am definitely excited about the idea of disincentivizing car ownership where it does not already exist.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2263.006s">Is</a>  there any other board input on parking minimums or anything else? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2267.048s">Are</a>  there thoughts on the actual development incentive bonuses that Danielle wanted input on?</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2276.031s">I</a>  think lowering the number of parkings is more acceptable in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2282.154s">Not</a>  having a parking spot for guests, for instance, is okay, but for residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2288.652s">Especially</a>  if we want, for instance, families to be living in these multifamily housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2294.74s">Starting</a>  from myself with my kids, it's very hard to imagine myself without a parking spot which is close by. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2305.899s">to</a>  my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2306.919s">So</a>  if we're planning to attract families also to this area and not only youth or young people, then definitely parking is required in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2322.27s">I'm</a>  also in favor of keeping the parking minimum above zero.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2325.292s">So</a>  I ran the model through the chair with 0.5 <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2335.76s">And</a>  that would get you 0.5 spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2339.022s">And</a>  lowering the height to, let's see, four stories would get you 6,595. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2354.527s">units,</a>  which is more than the minimum that we're required to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2360.268s">And</a>  again, the reason why lowering the height was to make sure that we could get some of the incentives, that developers would take advantage of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2373.19s">Because</a>  you can go up to nine stories if you incorporate those other provisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2379.151s">I</a>  think if we keep it five stories as the baseline, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2383.172s">with</a>  0.5 spaces as the minimum, I'm not sure that we'll get the other kind of development that moves forward all of our other goals as well.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2402.907s">One</a>  thing I think we should also keep in mind is the accessible parking spaces, like to ensure that individuals with special needs <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2411.975s">have</a>  convenient access and we're not excluding them from the multifamily too.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2421.404s">Yeah,</a>  actually, that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2423.186s">I'm</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2426.193s">against</a>  car dependency that one of the things that made it a little bit more humbling was I attended a conference where there was someone with a disability who had kept saying, you know, you keep talking about no parking, no parking, but what about my caretakers that come to take care of me? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2453.96s">All</a>  right, so it's currently at 0.5, Danielle, or?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2458.661s">The</a>  draft zoning that you have is off of 0.8 as the minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2468.342s">And</a>  1.5 is the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2472.123s">Well,</a>  actually, no, it's 0.8 for the market rate, 0.5 for the affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2480.825s">So</a>  the same as it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2483.582s">in</a>  the rest of the city if you're within half a mile of high frequency transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2491.705s">And</a>  so with the one and a half spaces per dwelling unit would be the max. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2497.308s">What</a>  is the comfort of the board with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2500.149s">Because</a>  that definitely sends a message of don't over park these developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2508.818s">if</a>  you build it, they will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2510.3s">So</a>  they can, a lot of developers we talked to say, our market demands that we provide at least one per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2519.267s">And</a>  so they'll want to build that because either they can get more rent or the investors will get on board because they don't wanna see empty apartment complexes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2530.837s">So</a>  they will build more than what is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2534.38s">So</a>  there's nothing, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2537.737s">that</a>  would prevent developers from building up to that maximum one and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2543.938s">So</a>  I think that there will be, and if we unbundle the parking from the units, that there could be X amount of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2552.2s">And</a>  if you want it, you can pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2553.88s">So</a>  if you're a family and you have two cars, you could lease two spaces or purchase two spaces, say if it's a condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2563.755s">And</a>  if you don't own a car, then that's unbundled from your rent and your housing costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2570.158s">So</a>  it's not that people that would want the spaces couldn't get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2577.1s">If</a>  there's enough housing production, then hopefully that there will be housing of all types.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2587.885s">I</a>  think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2588.765s">I</a>  especially like unbundling that from housing, because I know plenty of people who <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2594.673s">who</a>  don't own cars and have no use for a parking space and wouldn't want to pay for one in their rent.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2608.484s">Can</a>  you tell me more about the mechanism of unbundling it from the housing units? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2613.347s">I'm</a>  certainly interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2614.508s">I'm</a>  just not sure I've seen an example of it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2624.275s">Where</a>  I live, if you have, you can have two spaces per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2630.66s">And</a>  it's like, I don't know, there's different levels because we have a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2636.004s">It's</a>  not part, it becomes part of my rent if I take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2641.228s">If</a>  I don't want any, if I want no parking, then it's not part of my rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2645.271s">And</a>  I'm guessing that that's what the idea is.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2652.726s">So</a>  I guess my question is in terms of the zoning, it makes sense to me in how it would be written into a lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2658.453s">What</a>  I'm not sure of is how it plays into what we're writing, if that makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2665.358s">I</a>  think that we can refer that back to our consultant, but I don't think Danielle meant that we would require that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2672.941s">What</a>  we are seeing is that we're seeing more and more of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2676.482s">I</a>  actually found out from one of the staff in City Hall that the big apartment building across from Wegmans, if you want to park on the surface parking outside, it's free. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2686.446s">But</a>  if you want a garage space, you have to pay $200 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2690.487s">And</a>  what he tells me is that there's not enough surface parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2693.368s">So</a>  if you want to be guaranteed a spot when you come home, you have to pay $200 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2698.751s">It's</a>  sort of interesting for me because this particular staff person actually bikes to City Hall fairly regularly, but he and his wife also have a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2708.055s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2711.068s">But</a>  we're seeing it more and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2712.389s">I</a>  don't think we can require it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2716.192s">Dana,</a>  you can correct me if you think I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2718.374s">We</a>  can also just bump it to Emily just to check.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2723.118s">I</a>  don't think you can require that the parking not be associated with an individual unit.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2735.987s">So</a>  something that we want to research, but I don't think we're ready for it here, is that Somerville has some regulations written into their zoning and into their conditions about how the housing is marketed and how the parking is described and marketed. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2753.682s">And</a>  that they have to be explicit about whether or not you have parking, whether or not you're allowed to park on the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2761.688s">For</a>  example, a lot of their new apartment buildings, you're not eligible for street permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2768.49s">The</a>  way that's successful is that they actually enforce that you have to market in your apartment marketing that there is no street parking and that you're not eligible for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2782.14s">They've</a>  been successful, but it's a chicken and an egg problem here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2786.781s">They</a>  have much better intra-city public transportation than we have, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2792.323s">You</a>  can get all over Somerville and all over Cambridge and Boston, well, most of Boston, without a vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2799.105s">And</a>  Medford, it's dramatically harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2803.486s">And</a>  so we would love to improve the MBTA services. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2807.728s">I'm</a>  actually <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2808.868s">sidebar,</a>  asking MAPC for a technical assistance grant to start to pull together a group to look at these intra-city transportation issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2820.552s">And</a>  we're going to be talking about that shortly, the MAPC and I. But it's this is this is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2830.275s">We</a>  are seeing more people charging for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2833.496s">But</a>  I don't think it's something we can add here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2837.096s">So</a>  one thing, just to be clear with our timeline, and I do want to remind you, this is a public hearing, so we have to open to the public for comments as well, is that we've structured this so that it's easy for you guys to have a lot of questions and thoughts and stuff for us to run some more things by the consultants and for you all to vote on this at your next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2858.861s">And</a>  we'll have to talk about the timing of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2861.222s">And</a>  then the city council public hearing was advertised for December 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2867.424s">for</a>  them to give them two meetings to be able to talk about this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2871.968s">And</a>  if all of that works, we meet our deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2875.391s">If</a>  that doesn't work, it's the prerogative of the board and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2878.633s">We</a>  can't make you do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2880.775s">But</a>  it does mean that the state is going to be extremely unhappy with us about not making their timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2886.98s">We</a>  actually had a conversation with them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2889.583s">They</a>  don't have amazing sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2893.406s">But</a>  we like them to like us because then they give us grants and more assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2898.648s">So</a>  I don't know how else to phrase that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2902.45s">So</a>  if you, through the chair, if folks want to have three meetings for this, so tonight and then the 6th.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2912.535s">We</a>  don't need to go there yet.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2914.076s">Let's</a>  just have the conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2915.717s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just saying so people don't feel like they're under the gun, that we could hold a special meeting on the 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2922.48s">because</a>  we will have to continue this to a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2925.902s">So</a>  it'll either be the 29th and you'll need to let us know if we can have a quorum that night or we continue to the sixth. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2934.848s">But</a>  that's your prerogative, but I just wanna not feel, people feel rushed.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2940.371s">No,</a>  thank you, Danielle, because one of the things, and it does seem, and we understand where the city's, I understand where the city's situation is, but it's also very, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2952.278s">important</a>  and pertinent to let the board know that you're expecting to vote by 12-6-23. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2958.345s">And</a>  if that's the case, then we're going to have to hold another special meeting because who's going to do Thanksgiving?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2965.272s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2966.753s">You</a>  could just have one more meeting on the 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2972.06s">It</a>  was actually our recommendation that if we are going to vote on the 6th, we actually have to turn around the decision to the city council the next day on the 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2983.848s">So</a>  it's our request that if you think things are going to change a lot the week, so what we'd like to know is all the stuff that you're interested in getting more information from. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2996.514s">We'll</a>  take that to the consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2997.895s">She</a>  can run more models. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=2999.056s">She</a>  can draft additional language. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3000.577s">She</a>  can make changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3001.437s">She</a>  can do all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3002.398s">She</a>  can be here on the 29th to meet with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3007.701s">She</a>  is probably not available on the 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3012.644s">But</a>  if we meet both times, then we could have stuff ready for the 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3020.109s">Did</a>  that help? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3021.91s">I</a>  think I was just more confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3026.228s">But</a>  we also, rather than getting into the dates now, we also should talk, are there other things in the zoning that the board would like to think about or discuss?</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3039.711s">Given</a>  the conversation we just had, can we also get a model on changing the maximum, say, from 1.5 to 1.3 or 1.4? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3051.836s">I</a>  understand that we probably feasibly can't go too low, but since they're going to be going above the minimum, thinking about the other places where we can move around. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3063.141s">I</a>  don't know if that's for sure what we'll go for, but I would be interested in seeing that.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3067.463s">So</a>  the model says how many units would be generated if this is built out to its max? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3077.421s">The</a>  max parking with the maximum number of units, it assumes all the developers build to the lowest number of park, like the lowest parking spaces and the furthest setbacks that you build out as much as you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3096.915s">The</a>  maximum parking is just something we put in because we thought it was a good idea in Medford, but does not impact production, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3107.258s">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3109.405s">It</a>  does. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3111.448s">haven't</a>  drawn the connection to how the model works. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3115.189s">But</a>  I would be interested in other people's thoughts about playing with the maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3119.091s">I</a>  really like the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3120.571s">I</a>  wonder if anyone else is interested in playing around with it.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3124.433s">I</a>  also like the idea of maybe leaving the minimum where it is and taking the maximum down to some above 1, but still less than 1.5 number. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3142.219s">just</a>  because maybe that's where we can trim parking a little bit, if not at the minimum level, then at the maximum level.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3156.065s">And</a>  then another thing that we could think about is, if we lower the parking and it's increasing the potential unit yield, we could shrink <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3171.808s">the</a>  zone to keep it all on the Wellington side of 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3176.049s">And</a>  I don't know, because I feel like there could be pushback for parking with some of the neighborhood behind Cappy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3188.872s">It</a>  was just a thought.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3190.673s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3193.294s">I</a>  think coming to you live from behind Cappy's, I think we have plenty of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3197.695s">But</a>  that's just me.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3209.692s">Maybe</a>  I'm being overambitious, but it seems like the spirit of the law is to kind of put in zoning to build a lot of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3219.318s">There</a>  is broad interest in Medford in building a lot of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3225.823s">I</a>  know that's simplifying things enormously, but just throwing it out there.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3234.499s">So</a>  another thing that I've asked the consultant for, but she wasn't able to get it for tonight, is to do some visual modeling of what this would mean and what this could realistically mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3252.129s">in</a>  terms of development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3253.389s">And</a>  I'm wondering if it would help this board at all for me to actually show the Google map of what's currently there, like the thing, and walk through what we think will actually get changed and redeveloped under this or what could, and what do we think is not changing in the next 30 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3272.675s">I</a>  don't know if that's a helpful exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3275.056s">I</a>  kind of expect it's going to be for the city council.</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3279.055s">I</a>  think it's going to be really helpful, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3281.836s">One</a>  of my questions would be where exactly, like where do you think realistically development will occur? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3288.097s">Because</a>  like station landing, I don't think much is going to change in station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3291.938s">A</a>  lot of the apartments behind Cappy's are pretty good as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3299.54s">I</a>  see very low number of spots where development actually can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3306.855s">And</a>  one other question is, I know there are a lot of places which has smaller lots, but there could be instances where two lots, one person could buy two lots and maybe demolish single families' houses and make a bigger house there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3323.158s">Could</a>  that even be a possibility?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3325.179s">So</a>  if the chair wants, I'll share my screen and walk through some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3330.9s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3336.349s">And</a>  to answer, sorry, just to answer Siraj's second question, so the model just speaks to existing parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3346.004s">If</a>  parcel lines change or are combined, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3350.464s">they</a>  could potentially yield many more parcels because the model only looks at what's actually there, the constraints now. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3358.529s">So</a>  there's nothing that would prevent merging parcels to- How about lowering the 10,000 square feet minimum to 8,000 maybe?</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3366.533s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3371.516s">That's</a>  something we could look at.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3374.505s">I</a>  will tell you that if you, there is a point at which you, no matter how small you make the parcel size, you can't actually put like a five-story building there unless it's a pencil, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3384.792s">Like,</a>  although I am not an expert with those numbers, I think the model has actually some controls in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3392.557s">So</a>  if you split it down to the parcel size of zero, it makes some assumptions about what your reasonable parcel size is. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3400.082s">But</a>  that's a good question for Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3404.228s">So</a>  this is the whole area that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3407.99s">And</a>  I'm going to zoom in a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3409.431s">And</a>  I'll tell you, so this is Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3414.454s">And</a>  this here, we actually are getting this is what was recently rezoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3419.217s">And</a>  there is a special permit site plan review application coming in for a multifamily building here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3428.304s">I</a>  don't have it in my head, but my gut, I think it's like 250 units and it's like five stories to go here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3436.187s">So</a>  that's actually happening regardless of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3440.068s">This</a>  is the whole MBTA area and its change depends on the MBTA and the air rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3447.751s">And</a>  nothing can be built as of right on this entire area, no matter what the zoning is. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3453.72s">Over</a>  here, this is stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3456.424s">It's</a>  all new. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3458.006s">It's</a>  not changing, but there is some space between stations landing and the MBTA here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3464.675s">That's</a>  a little less clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3466.718s">So,</a>  like the Kelly's roast beef parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3469.502s">It's</a>  developable. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3470.622s">We</a>  haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3471.722s">Nobody's</a>  approached us about it, but it's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3476.103s">There's</a>  a little bit of surface parking here, but I don't know that it's really enough to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3481.464s">I</a>  believe most of this may actually be owned by the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3485.345s">Wow,</a>  it's like popping up pictures for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3488.966s">The</a>  CAPI site, that is completely in play. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3492.247s">It's</a>  actually on the market and there is a housing developer that is very interested in building housing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3499.898s">This</a>  is a relatively, so then these apartment buildings, I think I can actually do the 3D thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3507.505s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3508.666s">Tilt</a>  view. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3510.728s">See</a>  if I can do this the way I think I can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3513.05s">I'm</a>  going to try and tilt this so you can actually see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3518.816s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3520.397s">Brilliant.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3521.378s">Isn't</a>  that brilliant? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3524.211s">Now</a>  you can really see what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3525.872s">The</a>  station's landing area, that is not changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3530.015s">Cappy's,</a>  it has potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3532.736s">Some</a>  of this maybe, but this is owned by the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3536.298s">I</a>  think this is MBTA through here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3539.801s">And</a>  the Yacht Club, this is state-owned DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3545.684s">Sorry</a>  about the pop-ups, I don't know how to stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3548.225s">So</a>  the CAPI site is in play, but these apartment buildings, it's really hard to think that somebody's going to do something else there, but those apartment buildings actually exist right now between the area we've been talking about and all the single and two-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3565.72s">It</a>  would be quite a feat for somebody to buy up a bunch of these two-family homes and put a bigger apartment building on it, which is why we haven't even bothered to include these in this space. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3582.473s">This</a>  is a relatively new Wellington Place. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3585.535s">It's</a>  a relatively new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3588.477s">In</a>  theory, with the right rules, somebody could come in and put <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3595.715s">a</a>  building on their parking lot if they incorporated enough parking so that they didn't push Wellington Place out of compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3605.727s">Then</a>  is this section over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3608.51s">So</a>  this is a new multifamily building. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3613.199s">This</a>  is a pretty good shape commercial building that's been doing some renovations and all. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3619.564s">We</a>  see these two commercial buildings back here actually as being a potential for either conversion to housing or this giant parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3632.693s">Could</a>  they incorporate a housing development into some of these two parking lots? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3640.779s">Maybe,</a>  not unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3643.603s">I</a>  will just so you're aware, this up here is Rivers Edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3648.467s">Rivers</a>  Edge has its own very weird zoning and regulation section. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3654.391s">I'm</a>  not going to go into that tonight, but we left this out because we're not sure that we legally can mess with it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3663.998s">But</a>  that said, this is housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3667.429s">This</a>  is housing, and they're planning to come in and do a development here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3674.475s">So</a>  we're actually talking to Rivers Edge and a developer about a housing project that they would like to bring in and file in the next couple of months to do housing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3684.742s">This</a>  one space, they're reserving for some additional commercial space, but they're not prepared to start development yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3693.511s">That's</a>  really all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3695.052s">The</a>  only other piece that's in play is where Danielle was talking about this section across the way here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3704.282s">This</a>  is an interesting parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3706.465s">It</a>  is all strip mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3708.186s">I</a>  do believe there are some long leases in here and it might not be so easy to just redevelop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3715.054s">We</a>  didn't even try to touch this up here because the reality is they all have long-term leases that require crazy, crazy amounts of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3726.823s">We've</a>  been dealing with this property owner as she's been bringing in new businesses into her <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3734.039s">her</a>  building. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3736.201s">And</a>  we've talked about the fact that we'd like like a whole new, like, let's just redevelop the whole thing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3742.606s">And</a>  basically, because of their current leases, that's not on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3748.411s">But</a>  we would talk to them about rezoning as part of a bigger rezoning effort for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3756.007s">Is</a>  that, oh, and in case anybody is wondering, people don't know, this little corner here, that's a state police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3763.473s">So</a>  it's state-owned land. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3766.656s">We</a>  can't touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3770.159s">Does</a>  that help? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3771.44s">And</a>  the one other thing, we didn't include this one, which is actually in the residential zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3777.044s">That's</a>  Bianco Sausage. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3783.405s">So</a>  that's the one other. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3784.927s">And</a>  if that, yeah, so we didn't include that parcel.</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3790.515s">What</a>  about the green space behind Felsbury Plaza?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3796.715s">Oh,</a>  this, that, that is a fascinating parcel of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3802.76s">It</a>  is privately owned man-made wetland. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3807.284s">And</a>  now that it's been in existence for quite a while, we can't touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3811.367s">In</a>  fact, and if you look really closely, you can see here the circle and a dot and a circle and a dot and the line through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3819.414s">It</a>  was AM radio towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3822.696s">And</a>  back in the early, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3825.038s">1900s</a>  when they built AM radio towers, they had to surround them with water to reflect the radio signals off the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3832.825s">And</a>  so that's where there are actually a lot of different storm drains that end up in this area that create this wetland. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3841.032s">So</a>  it's protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3844.975s">We</a>  have talked to some developers who would love to think big about redeveloping this whole area, including that, and then cleaning that area up and turning it into a beautiful wetland with boardwalks the way they have in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3858.949s">But</a>  that would have to be part of a massive development to be able to afford something that cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3889.01s">All</a>  right, any other questions?</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3893.713s">I</a>  think you answered this in there somewhere, but just how does this play with the air rights at Wellington Station, which would fall in this zone but might fall into the Wellington Station, our zoning doesn't apply area?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3913.15s">Right,</a>  so the whole air rights is over the land that is owned by the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3919.294s">The</a>  MBTA is not bound by our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3923.777s">And</a>  apparently we can't regulate them with zoning at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3930.422s">In</a>  order to build above it, we have to work through the whole air rights process where we have to provide the parking and be above their stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3943.538s">and</a>  work out that agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3948.501s">This</a>  would facilitate that because what we would probably want to do would now not be against zoning if it fell into all of these categories and stuff we just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3960.13s">We've</a>  always been under the assumption though that at the point that this actually went out for our <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3967.586s">P,</a>  there was a developer that in the end we might need to do a planned development district in order to accommodate whatever the end results of all of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3980.229s">But</a>  it might make it easier, but I don't think you could do any of it as of right because of the weirdness of the property ownership.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3992.433s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=3992.893s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4119.068s">Oh,</a>  and congratulations William on your marriage.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4124.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4125.694s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4126.715s">And</a>  thank you for recognizing me. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4128.516s">I</a>  actually sent in a written comment, which I can pull up if you want me to, but I actually raised my hand to ask a different question. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4138.628s">The</a>  incentive it says provided additional 20% additional affordable units above the required number. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4147.316s">I'd</a>  argue that's pretty ambiguous because is that 20% of the required units? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4153.562s">For</a>  example, you're required to put in 10 and then you put in 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4158.035s">or</a>  is that 20% of the entire development? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4160.957s">Like</a>  you're required to put in 10% and now you're gonna put in 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4165.7s">So</a>  I would argue that that language, maybe there's a legal, maybe a lawyer could tell us which it is, but I would argue that it should probably be understood by somebody who's just reading it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4178.188s">So-</a>  I can tell you what the intention is. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4181.628s">And</a>  we did talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4182.729s">It's</a>  20% or more than what is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4187.033s">So</a>  if it's based on, if our current affordable housing requirements are approved by the state, then you would go by the table where, so say, of course I don't have this open right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4205.237s">Yeah,</a>  so currently 10 to 24 lots or units is, you have to provide 10% as affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4212.26s">If</a>  you have 25 to 49 units, it's 13% and 80 or more, it's 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4218.043s">So</a>  say, so you would run the calculation and like, so say, you know, it's a hundred units. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4226.968s">So</a>  that would mean they need to do 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4228.629s">So</a>  15%, so they'd have to require <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4234.522s">So</a>  15 units would be what they would need to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4240.287s">And</a>  so if they wanted to provide 18, which I think is 20%, then they could get a credit for that by providing more than is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4256.692s">Okay,</a>  so I suppose- Yeah, the language is, I mean, that's the intent of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4260.233s">We</a>  did discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4261.454s">We're</a>  like, okay, how do we word this? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4264.655s">We're</a>  all ears if there's clear language.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4268.036s">Okay,</a>  maybe I'll send a written comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4271.817s">Would</a>  you like to read my other written comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4273.497s">I</a>  can find it here otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4275.838s">I</a>  did send another, a second comment in advance of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4280.26s">I</a>  don't know, I actually haven't pulled up.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4282.749s">I'm</a>  happy to read it if you'd like.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4284.311s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4284.971s">That'd</a>  probably be a little easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4286.093s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4286.253s">So</a>  your first is about parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4288.456s">Parking</a>  minimums should be reduced to zero under the MBTA overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4291.659s">The</a>  overlay is intended to be a transit adjacent district. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4294.643s">Promoting</a>  transit is also part of the purpose of the MBTA Communities Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4298.267s">Promoting</a>  space for car storage also isn't consistent with our climate goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4302.592s">and</a>  then two was setback buffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4304.875s">Please</a>  consider allowing alternatives to setback buffers when a project under the overlay abuts a small residential building. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4311.583s">The</a>  buffers tend to be non-play screen space that can counterproductively set apart the new buildings from the rest of the community in a way that isn't necessarily any more aesthetically pleasing than simply having a large building next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4322.707s">I'm</a>  also concerned with the underlying attitude behind the idea that a large multifamily housing is a noxious use that needs to be buffered. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4329.954s">A</a>  step back such as a three story limit within 10 feet of the lot line seems like an option that could be allowed while still preventing excessive shadowing.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4350.97s">Danielle</a>  or Alicia, do you want to address either of those questions by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4356.033s">Navarre?</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4358.474s">We</a>  did talk about the parking minimums already. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4361.655s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4362.916s">I</a>  can look closer at the buffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4367.698s">Just</a>  look at that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4368.499s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4371.458s">I</a>  will say that when we are looking at the buffers and all, we were also looking at the reality of the location and there's very little of the various small amount of this is up against. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4385.235s">existing</a>  residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4388.159s">And</a>  I guess the big question is do we, is it realistic to think that these existing buildings are actually going to get torn down because they actually provide buffer between any new development? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4401.879s">and</a>  the currently existing residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4406.241s">So</a>  honestly, we didn't look at that very hard just simply because we didn't think that in this specific case, there would be any issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4416.704s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4420.805s">Yeah,</a>  some of these are taller than we're actually even thinking of allowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4425.887s">So</a>  we can see if we can see what the height of these.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4431.193s">And</a>  I think that was also to keep it from being a drive aisle or parking right next to someone's bedroom window or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4440.541s">I</a>  don't think it's necessarily the residential aspect of it, but what is on the edges of a lot that might not be desirable, like the car exhaust, someone idling and warming the car up in the morning, which people do that.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4463.127s">This</a>  court's over here.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4472.351s">Madam</a>  Chair, there is one other resident who has his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4479.373s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Matarazzo.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4482.867s">Thank</a>  you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4484.328s">I</a>  just provided a comment in the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4486.709s">Just</a>  asking if the city had looked at dispersing the capacity throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4492.753s">I</a>  believe you answered it with the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4495.354s">I</a>  know it's a challenge with the five-acre contiguous parcel requirement, but living in West Medford Square and visiting Medford Square frequently, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4506.16s">I</a>  would encourage the city, as you have a new consultant on board, to look at ways to increase opportunities for housing that will support the businesses in these districts in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4518.65s">As</a>  you embark on this journey of the MBTA zoning, as new housing is infused into the Wellington Station area, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4528.938s">I'm</a>  curious if there's going to be a correlation to transportation improvements as a result of this high density housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4537.643s">We</a>  all love this spaghetti as we fly through the Fellsway and the circle there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4544.527s">And</a>  are there opportunities to leverage this private investment to stimulate a transportation solution in the long term for this area? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4554.833s">and</a>  or leverage the development to maybe get get the developer to pay for design planning to develop a solution and maybe leverage maybe some tip projects or monies from from the state mass works and or any other opportunities available to address this transportation issue today not just for vehicles but for the many pedestrians that would that live there today or that would call this area home in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4585.96s">Thank</a>  you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4586.861s">I</a>  know this is challenging and I look forward to seeing this area infused with new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4594.263s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4600.225s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Matarazzo.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4603.646s">Madam</a>  Chair, do you want me to address one piece of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4612.529s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4614.455s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4615.956s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4617.877s">There's</a>  a lot of issues, but the biggest one is the Wellington Circle issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4622.979s">Are</a>  you aware of the Wellington Circle study being done by MassDOT right now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4631.373s">I</a>  am loosely following it just, but I'm glad that's ongoing and anything the city can do to leverage the backs of the private development to help move this project forward would be a welcome addition to all residents in the city and the region.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4647.168s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4648.149s">Just</a>  because I want to be careful about not over saying, so I just dropped a link into the chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4654.133s">So</a>  this study is, you can sign up to get study updates from the study directly, but they are moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4664.28s">There</a>  is a recommended solution for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4667.602s">And</a>  it is prioritizing walkability, bikeability, and rapid bus to come through this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4676.906s">So</a>  the solution that is being moved forward has no change to the level of service for vehicles, but does make significant improvements for walkability, bikeability, and buses to come through with the express bus lane in one of the directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4697.755s">So</a>  that's the biggest thing and I think that I believe that that is going to be moving forward and onto the tip regardless of any development in the area which is kind of lovely because then we can take developer funding and put it into other efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4712.588s">So</a>  we did put in <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4715.087s">the</a>  zoning some language about the interior roads, so that if there were changes to the interior roads, how that would be handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4725.119s">But</a>  that's the big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4726.941s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4728.394s">And</a>  just, I think that's excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4731.056s">And</a>  so as you shift the focus of maybe mitigation dollars, other opportunities to explore maybe accessing the water and the access of maybe water shuttles to connect to Somerville, Medford Square and points beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4745.324s">There's</a>  a renewed focus on the Mystic and accessibility to water and transportation as an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4753.168s">We</a>  have all this water frontage again. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4756.47s">something</a>  maybe to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4758.693s">I</a>  know there's been all types of interest in and aspirations of shuttles in the city, and with this density, it might be an opportunity to explore it further.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4768.142s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4768.562s">So</a>  one of the difficulties with the water shuttle is that this the river does need to be a low wake. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4775.489s">It's</a>  a low wake river because of the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4777.991s">So</a>  you can't have fast water transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4783.216s">We're</a>  also limited by the Amelia Earhart Dam. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4787.0s">I'll</a>  just zoom out a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4789.442s">And</a>  so this is the casino down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4794.946s">And</a>  as part of the casino discussions, there was actually money put into an account to do work on water transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4805.053s">However,</a>  and the casino is willing and they were doing, they're doing shuttles, water taxis to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4811.6s">The</a>  difficulty is because of the dam, none of their water taxis would fit through the Amelia Earhart locks. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4819.628s">And</a>  so anything that is going to pass this point in the river has to be a fairly small boat and they were going to have to be made custom made boats, which suddenly made this an extremely expensive proposition to have custom made boats that could come up to Medford but <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4837.285s">then</a>  might be too small for a lot of the main part of the harbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4842.487s">So</a>  really we're only looking at getting to Somerville's assembly row and station landing upstream with it, which suddenly made it not really a viable commercial enterprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4855.152s">One</a>  thing that's been suggested, and I'm just going to throw it out there for people to ruminate on, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4860.194s">is</a>  the idea of blue bikes for canoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4862.875s">So</a>  right now you can actually rent canoes and kayaks here in Somerville and then upstream just past Medford Square and it is the same company. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4874.78s">I</a>  don't know that they have one-way service but this was an idea that maybe there could be other locations that you could rent and then drop off boats up and down the river and would that be a <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4887.881s">Fascinating,</a>  interesting commercial idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4891.102s">So</a>  that's being floated by staff at the Mr. Rivership Association.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4895.164s">I</a>  love that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4898.805s">I</a>  like it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4899.525s">I</a>  take it downstream, not upstream.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4905.168s">Maybe</a>  we can get some other people to bring the boats back upstream sometimes, right?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4912.853s">There's</a>  one thing I think I should mention, and only because it's a public hearing and Mr. Matarazzo brought it up as far as leveraging private development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4920.116s">I</a>  just want to make a public disclaimer that myself being a senior program manager for the MassWorks Infrastructure Program, I am in no way consulting with the city on leveraging state grants administered by the Executive Office of Economic Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4933.662s">Just</a>  wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4935.263s">And</a>  also, Mr. Matarazzo, congratulations to you and the town of Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4939.524s">Bye.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4941.611s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4942.531s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4949.675s">Do</a>  we have any other public comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4961.621s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4962.121s">I'm</a>  going to close the public comment section. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4966.94s">And</a>  I'm going to come back to the board and see if you want to deliberate or just further discuss the drive zoning ordinance amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4974.666s">I'm</a>  not sure that we're prepared to vote or if even the city is asking for a vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4979.45s">So</a>  there is a couple of things that they want to get ironed out with Emily Enns, which is Emily Keyes Enns, who is the consultant for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4987.276s">But</a>  if there's any other questions that we want to give the city now, or we can email, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=4993.669s">But</a>  I guess we should get this date certain on the board if that's on the table.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5004.214s">You're</a>  welcome to decide to vote on this tonight and recommend your decisions, but we're expecting you want to take two meetings.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5014.079s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5015.712s">Yeah,</a>  I think that would be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5017.113s">This</a>  is just me as secretary trying to put together a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5025.259s">Do</a>  we need to have a motion to continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5029.161s">Or</a>  does that have anything attached to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5032.264s">Or</a>  can we just motion to continue and then kind of hold that we've been talking about these things and that we'll come back on either the 29th or the 6th <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5044.576s">new</a>  information or additional information.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5048.347s">So</a>  if you don't mind me answering, there are two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5052.209s">One</a>  is a simple motion to table it to a date certain is fine for that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5059.832s">For</a>  our staff sanity, it doesn't need to be part of the motion, but we would like to make sure that we are all on the same page about what are the things we're asking from the consultant, what is it that we're looking to change just so that we <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5075.998s">make</a>  sure that you get what you need before or at the next meeting and there isn't any confusion.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5084.841s">Yeah,</a>  so I'm trying to figure out what my marching orders are. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5089.483s">Was</a>  the consensus to keep the minimum at 0.8 or was it 0.8 spaces per unit with a five-story baseline height? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5105.035s">Or</a>  was there desire to lower that to 0.5 and then lowering the height to four stories? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5117.803s">What</a>  would you like us to present you two options?</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5125.727s">I</a>  think descriptively what we talked about was essentially seeing the two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5131.051s">Would</a>  that drive you all up a wall?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5135.697s">No,</a>  I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5136.817s">I</a>  think because I do think with lowering the parking minimums, then I do think that we have to lower the height so that we can make sure that folks would take advantage of those incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5153.442s">But</a>  they would still be the max of nine stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5161.284s">I</a>  feel like I don't have any <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5164.358s">like</a>  hard data to let me know what developers would seek for incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5173.22s">I</a>  feel like the market is always moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5175.1s">It's</a>  like interest rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5176.48s">It's</a>  costs of disposing of earth. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5182.402s">So</a>  many different things that I feel like if we keep the baseline low, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5192.337s">Because</a>  maybe we'll get more uptake of the incentives with the deeper affordability and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5202.964s">I</a>  don't know what you all think.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5209.629s">I</a>  think that seeing the, in terms of concrete things to bring to the next meeting at a date certain, would be to see that, <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5223.022s">parking</a>  minimum, two options with the 0.8 and the 0.5 with the five stories versus four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5231.196s">I</a>  think just to kind of spell out what we would be looking to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5237.993s">And</a>  the other thing I have written down is the parking maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5241.594s">I</a>  believe we said that wouldn't materially move the model. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5245.255s">So</a>  it doesn't, in terms of production of units, which is really what this particular ordinance is about, it's not something we need to look at.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5259.14s">But</a>  I would like us to look at it, if you can bring what that language <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5267.339s">Would</a>  there be anything other than us just saying instead of 1.5, 1.3? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5270.921s">Or</a>  whatever number we arrive at, I'm not saying that's what we will definitely arrive at.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5279.706s">And</a>  I could see what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5280.906s">So</a>  say if it was like, how many units do we think? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5285.188s">I'd</a>  have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5286.089s">I</a>  could send you guys the model. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5291.17s">for</a>  you to play around with on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5293.611s">And</a>  you can kind of adjust things. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5295.211s">It's</a>  really complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5300.112s">But</a>  if you have the desire to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5302.352s">Because</a>  it goes down parcel by parcel and spits out how many units each parcel will produce. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5317.596s">And</a>  so I could figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5321.142s">If</a>  the max parking was lowered, what is the effective reduction in parking spaces that could conceivably be built? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5335.954s">Maybe</a>  lowering the parking maximum would encourage the creation of a parking structure that could be used by more folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5351.305s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5351.645s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5356.606s">I</a>  mean, I think I would agree with Ari that at least that's something I'd be interested in seeing, if moving the parking maximum just for sake of argument or for sake of presentation of the data from 1.5 to 1.3 would move things meaningfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5377.111s">And</a>  if it doesn't or is inconclusive, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5387.016s">The</a>  city of Somerville has parking caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5388.796s">They</a>  have parking maximums on their line, on the orange line for Assembly Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5393.037s">I</a>  wonder how, but I guess that's more car dependent over there because it's a huge commercial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5401.819s">I'm</a>  just wondering. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5404.72s">Destination.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5405.62s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5406.98s">But</a>  even that, with that, they have parking caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5414.362s">Yeah,</a>  I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5417.669s">I'm</a>  not so much concerned with the maximum, the parking maximum, but if we can decrease it a little bit somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5423.853s">Then</a>  I guess I would be interested in knowing what the benefits are if there are any, but if there's not a significant incremental change, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5441.826s">I</a>  guess just so that the board is able to vote with confidence to supply that information, Danielle, so that board members can just look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5453.412s">Okay,</a>  so what... And I guess we can decide on the next date, and then between now and... <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5473.805s">Now</a>  and then we can send you other questions via email.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5479.727s">Yeah,</a>  and just make sure when you're emailing to not copy other board members because that would be a violation of open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5487.689s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5488.309s">Feel</a>  free to call me on the phone, email me. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5491.39s">You</a>  can ask as many questions as you want to staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5499.412s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5499.793s">Do</a>  you all feel like you need <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5502.745s">another</a>  meeting before the 6th? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5505.106s">Or</a>  do you think that this is kind of small stuff?</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5509.588s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I would be interested to hear the rest of the board's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5514.65s">But</a>  I personally, I don't think this is as much to rise to the level that we need another meeting other than the 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5524.535s">I</a>  think this is stuff we could get more information on the 6th and pretty simply vote on it on the 6th.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5534.177s">Yeah,</a>  any questions or suggested edits, as I agree with Peter, any questions or suggested edits should be able to be ironed out prior to, without another meeting.</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5553.305s">I'm</a>  inclined to agree.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5563.806s">Listen</a>  to the chair, do we need a motion then?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5566.689s">Do</a>  we need a motion to for a day starting to 12, to continue to 12, 6, 2023? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5572.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5572.534s">I'm</a>  going to start in alphabetical order here. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5580.841s">Sally</a>  Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5583.283s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5584.864s">Sharad</a>  Bajraj Sharir?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5609.953s">I</a>  don't really care, just pick a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5611.514s">I</a>  second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5612.934s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5613.795s">Was</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5614.135s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5618.45s">I</a>  know PETA made the motion, right?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5621.371s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5621.971s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5628.232s">The</a>  next item is approval of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5632.633s">Is</a>  there a motion to approve the draft minutes from 9.6 and 9.20 collectively? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5638.134s">Are</a>  there any edits or anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5639.574s">I</a>  motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5647.368s">Both</a>  960 and 920?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5652.169s">Is</a>  there a second motion?</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5656.13s">I</a>  second it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5656.71s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5659.791s">Roll</a>  call, Sally Akiki? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5663.412s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5664.773s">Sharad</a>  Basracharia?</p>

    <p>[O1CMBj7JDes_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5669.874s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5671.354s">Ari</a>  Fishman? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5672.815s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5673.862s">Pam</a>  Marianski? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5675.283s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5676.143s">And</a>  myself, Jackie McPherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5677.944s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5681.026s">So</a>  the next item, miscellaneous or any other updates that the city wants to provide or the board wants to discuss? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5692.192s">Besides</a>  looking forward to I-12-6 meeting for the continuation of the zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5698.895s">Danielle,</a>  is there anything coming down the pipeline that we need to know about?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5705.11s">that</a>  might be coming to the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5706.771s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5708.372s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5711.214s">The</a>  pit on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5717.578s">I</a>  expect to get a application from them at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5721.141s">They're</a>  revising the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5723.222s">They</a>  were working on different assumptions and we had to tell them that they had interpreted the zoning incorrectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5729.906s">So</a>  they're fixing it and it'll be much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5735.081s">Also,</a>  I'm expecting plan development, special permit and site plan review for Burden Bio, Walkland Court, and 100 Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5750.011s">Those</a>  should be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5750.932s">So</a>  we have three plan development districts that have been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5755.775s">So</a>  they'll be working through their process.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5761.619s">And</a>  there's a possibility that we'll be listening to them <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5765.683s">all</a>  at the same, because they're out at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5768.965s">I</a>  hope that they can be staggered.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5773.807s">And</a>  it was just implied by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5776.208s">Wachling</a>  Court's planned development district was passed unanimously by the city council last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5781.05s">And</a>  by unanimous, I mean 6-0. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5786.152s">One</a>  councillor has been absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5793.602s">And</a>  then there's the Criterion Project at MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5798.488s">They</a>  definitely are planning to come in with their permit application in the next two to three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5806.717s">Also,</a>  just as an FYI, so some of you may remember the project that we were calling the pit, the gravel pit, which was the blasting over by the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5817.646s">And</a>  this board approved the subdivision, which allowed the road to be built and for the retaining wall to be built and for the parcels, 10 parcels to be created. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5832.34s">If</a>  the developer decides to develop each parcel individually as a single family house, which has been his plan all along, then that would not come in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5843.525s">If</a>  he decided to, as one developer at one time, build all 10 houses, or six or more of the houses, that would come in front of this board as a development. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5854.75s">Right</a>  now I actually have in our permit software there is a building permit for one single family house on that road and I just wanted you all to be aware that as long as they are in fact building them as individual single family houses one at a time <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5871.592s">or</a>  even fewer than six at a time, they do not come in front of this board for site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5878.996s">I</a>  feel like you might as members of the CD board get questions about that, or you might wonder about it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5885.32s">They</a>  do come in front of our office, but I have very limited oversight in what I can shape as part of that process under our current zoning.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5896.686s">How</a>  many lots was that?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5898.487s">They're</a>  10.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5900.955s">And</a>  that was before our inclusionary.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5903.536s">Yeah,</a>  but again, if they build them one at a time.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5907.218s">It's</a>  written in, there's no segmentation.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5908.959s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5911.701s">Yeah,</a>  but it doesn't apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5913.702s">It's</a>  not applying to build 10 houses right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5916.783s">They're</a>  applying to build one.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/m2kzyUMwUOc&t=5918.704s">It</a>  would have been at the time of the subdivision.</p>
