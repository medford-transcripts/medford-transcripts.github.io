27
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:21,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I will read the public hearing announcement.

28
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:27,213

31
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:52,451
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of the amendment is to comply with Section 3A of MGL 40A, which is also known as MBTA Community Zoning Law, by establishing a zoning overlay within a half-mile radius of the Wellington MBTA Orange Line Station that would allow multifamily housing and mixed-use development as of right.

39
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so for, um, the city staff that's present, um, um, Danielle, you want to take the lead on the proposed ordinance?

40
00:03:59,156 --> 00:03:59,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

41
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:08,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I think everyone is familiar now with the, um, Section 3A of Chapter 48 of Mass General Law, but I'll go over it.

42
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:16,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, basically, um, several years ago, the Baker administration, under the Baker administration, the, um, 2020,

43
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,071
[SPEAKER_05]: One, I don't know, it seemed like a long time ago.

44
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:34,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a law passed requiring that all MBTA served communities adopt a zoning district that would allow multifamily by right.

45
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:42,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The language of the act was very sparse.

46
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities

47
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,485
[SPEAKER_05]: issued guidelines.

48
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:55,107
[SPEAKER_05]: They were updated several times, most recently in August.

49
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:59,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So every time they change, it's taken a bit of a catch up.

50
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:08,573
[SPEAKER_05]: But they determined the amount of units that have to be produced for each municipality.

51
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,193
[SPEAKER_05]: And Medford's is 6,443.

52
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And 75% of those have to be within

53
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:21,341
[SPEAKER_05]: a half mile of a station area, an eligible station area.

54
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:31,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the summer, we got a technical assistance grant to hire a consultant to crunch the numbers.

55
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:38,637
[SPEAKER_05]: The state created a compliance model where you would basically

56
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:56,195
[SPEAKER_05]: upload all of the city's parcel data, and then we would put in all the zoning inputs, and it would spit out how many units could be produced or they could be yielded in any of those districts.

57
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:02,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tested the station areas, all of the station areas in the city.

58
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:08,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of excluded land, other areas,

59
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:26,124
[SPEAKER_05]: big parks, Tufts, City of Somerville, which we can't count, because a lot of the stations are right on the line, that the only real place feasible area that would work is the Wellington Orange Line station.

60
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:37,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So we moved forward with that, taking the approach of creating an overlay, which would be superimposed over the base zoning.

61
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't touch the base zoning at all.

62
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:45,673
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to do that eventually to implement a comprehensive plan, but that's a bigger project.

63
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just doing an overlay.

64
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

65
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I can bring up the map.

66
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

67
00:06:58,355 --> 00:06:59,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share my screen.

68
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:07,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the button's all moved.

69
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:09,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

70
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Can folks see that?

71
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:41,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on some assumptions that we put into the model, the shaded or the blue parcels would be included in this overlay.

72
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:46,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't include some of these denser

73
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,061
[SPEAKER_05]: single and two-family homes.

74
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:58,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the existing station landing area that's built out.

75
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,325
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the mixed-use zoning district.

76
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,986
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the newly rezoned to the MUZ as well.

77
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:14,649
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the... What the heck is the name of that?

78
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,226
[SPEAKER_05]: the roast beef place, Kelly's Roast Beef.

79
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:22,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is all owned by the MBTA.

80
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:30,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is technically excluded because we can't, our zoning doesn't apply to them.

81
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:43,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And then up here is some existing apartments and then some other taller buildings, the Cappy's,

82
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,002
[SPEAKER_05]: The, yeah, this is the Cappy's here.

83
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the building with the tattoo shop, and there's some other stuff there.

84
00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:00,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is a piece of the Wellington Plaza over there.

85
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is based on,

86
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:25,800
[SPEAKER_05]: getting just a little bit over the number that we need to hit, the 6,443, based on, if you look at the zoning, minimum parking 0.8 per unit and five stories as the baseline.

87
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop sharing.

88
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:35,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the proposed, we're calling it the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District.

89
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:58,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of some of the limitations of the law, where we can't require mixed use, we can't require anything that would be construed as somehow dampening housing production, that the way that we approach this was through a series of incentives.

90
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:15,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So because we want this area to be walkable and there to be amenities for folks, rather than just a bunch of standalone apartment buildings, we'd like there to be corner stores and places to go about your daily errands.

91
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:28,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So we set the floor at five stories as the minimum or as the max height, but with incentives such as,

92
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:32,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I put this up so people can follow along?

93
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to share my screen again.

94
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:16,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see that?

95
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:19,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the text of the amendment?

96
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:23,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's very small.

97
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make it bigger.

98
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:36,026
[SPEAKER_04]: That's better, is that good enough for the members or should we zoom in further?

99
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:39,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that good?

100
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:40,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's good right there.

101
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so just to briefly go through this, we have this.

102
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:58,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So the state that they've been trying to make it as easy as possible by providing technical assistance and then they had some kind of like a framework of model zoning that we adapted for Medford.

103
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:08,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So just like with the outline, so like the purposes, you know, the applicability, then we had to add some new definitions that we didn't have already.

104
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:14,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, so the table of uses and parking regulations.

105
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:23,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So the uses, the residential uses that would be allowed by right would be senior housing facility and multifamily.

106
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently multifamily is not

107
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:39,129
[SPEAKER_05]: In our current zoning ordinance, we have class A and class B, multiple dwelling, and those are convoluted and associated with maximum heights.

108
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:46,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just took that out and created the new category multifamily for this district.

109
00:12:49,233 --> 00:13:00,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so some of the we were thinking about, okay, what other uses would we want to allow by right with site plan review in this district to have, you know, kind of like a live, work and play area.

110
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So community uses, some of the commercial uses like recreation, hotel, brewery or taproom, you know, some office uses, some of them we decided should be by special permit, because perhaps on certain

111
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:38,180
[SPEAKER_05]: streets it would make more sense to have more active uses and in other places it would be okay to have like a medical office or bank but we're trying to get away from banks and other insurance agencies from occupying like prime storefronts areas that could be more active.

112
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So retail sales

113
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:46,130
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhood retail, consumer services, all by right.

114
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive-thru is by special permit from the Community Development Board.

115
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:54,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently in the MUZ, there's a drive-thru for Walgreens.

116
00:13:55,413 --> 00:14:05,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to be able to keep that option if there was a site-specific location, then it would be appropriate.

117
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be, you know,

118
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:12,764
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be OK on a certain parcel, but we didn't want it to be by right across the board.

119
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:15,965
[SPEAKER_05]: In some parcels, it might not be appropriate.

120
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:29,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And then miscellaneous commercial uses, so parking areas or parking garages, but not surface parking lots standalone for themselves.

121
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:34,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Research and testing, home occupation, more child care,

122
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the scientific research development.

123
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm now just realizing that non-commercial greenhouse tool shed or similar accessory structure, we don't have anything in that column.

124
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to figure out what was supposed to be there.

125
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:58,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm imagining it was supposed to be a Y, yes.

126
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:01,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you recall, Alicia?

127
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:04,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how that.

128
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:14,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did, but at this point, anything that we want changed should actually come as a recommendation from the CD board to the city council.

129
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:22,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if it's in the other version that, sorry, yes, Emily sends us.

130
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,169
[SPEAKER_04]: My brain just blopped because Emily is on the board and Emily is our consultant.

131
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And just FYI, I did hear back from Emily and she's had something urgent come up and she can't make it.

132
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:53,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the dimensional standards, and so this is actually different than how most of the rest of our ordinance is treated where uses are tied to a dimensional standard rather than the zone.

133
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:57,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to get away from that.

134
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:02,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So this table reflects that.

135
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet.

136
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Maximum building coverage, 80%.

137
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:11,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, what is that?

138
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:20,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, and then the maximum height, minimum stories, two, maximum five.

139
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:23,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maximum with bonus incentives, nine.

140
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:27,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 80 feet, 140 feet.

141
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:28,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the setbacks, zero to 15.

142
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's

143
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:45,272
[SPEAKER_05]: some development standards of what can be within those front yard setbacks later on in this document, as we're trying to get away from front yard parking and other things like that.

144
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:52,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the setbacks, side yard or interior rear yard setbacks.

145
00:16:54,494 --> 00:17:01,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the table of development incentive bonuses,

146
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would love any feedback on this.

147
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So, some of the.

148
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Provisions that we thought to, we would like to see.

149
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:16,858
[SPEAKER_05]: In this.

150
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:30,704
[SPEAKER_05]: district that we can't require, but we would like to incentivize, is providing active ground floor space would get you an additional story added.

151
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:34,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could get six stories if your ground floor is active.

152
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:47,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Another way to get an additional story is to provide below market rent for a commercial tenant or nonprofit or local business under

153
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:58,734
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 employees, and we're trying to create a space where small businesses can thrive and don't get priced out.

154
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of experimental.

155
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:16,781
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how it works, but I've always wondered why we have affordable housing and subsidized housing, but we don't have subsidized commercial spaces for nonprofits and small businesses and things like that.

156
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,493
[SPEAKER_05]: can't compete with some of the bigger chains and banks and things like that.

157
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:30,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how this works out.

158
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:37,535
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of zoning is just testing it and seeing what sticks and if anything comes out of it.

159
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:44,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And then additional incentives is for deeper affordability of the units and increased affordability.

160
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:46,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently,

161
00:18:47,283 --> 00:19:04,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Our inclusionary zoning ordinance that we have is not allowed unless we can prove through a third party economic feasibility analysis that it won't stymie housing production.

162
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's currently being performed by MAPC.

163
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:13,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And they expect that the findings will be that our existing ordinance

164
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:18,818
[SPEAKER_05]: is economically feasible and will be able to apply it there.

165
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:22,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So currently we're operating under the assumption that we will be able to.

166
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now the state is saying the baseline is 10% of units at 80% AMI is allowed, but anything more than that, you need to prove that it's viable.

167
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:41,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of the other incentives

168
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:50,087
[SPEAKER_05]: are for if you have a net zero emissions building or build to different LEED certification.

169
00:19:52,149 --> 00:20:00,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Initially, we were going to require more things, but the city recently adopted the specialized stretch code.

170
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So folks are going to have to do them anyways.

171
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're like, what can we require that won't already be required?

172
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:11,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And our climate planner

173
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:25,520
[SPEAKER_05]: identified that these were feasible things that folks could do to achieve some density bonuses.

174
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:37,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And then so there'll be exceptions and exemptions from setbacks for certain things, like renewable energy installations,

175
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,102
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some exceptions from that, from going into setbacks or height.

176
00:20:44,403 --> 00:21:05,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for parking, we are proposing to use the same parking standards in the rest of the city for within half mile of high frequency transit, which is 0.8 spaces per dwelling unit for market rate and 0.5 for affordable dwelling units.

177
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:17,306
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the things that's different is that we actually putting a maximum parking on this so that you can only build one and a half spaces per dwelling unit.

178
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,066
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the max.

179
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:26,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So a developer can't say we really need two spaces per unit and build that.

180
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be allowed unless they got a variance.

181
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have some biking parking.

182
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:40,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Bike parking spaces, one per dwelling unit is the minimum.

183
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:46,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Bike storage, EV parking.

184
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:51,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this section is the design guidelines and development standards.

185
00:21:52,605 --> 00:22:04,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So this goes into different aspects of site design, which would supplement our site plan review criteria and performance standards elsewhere in our ordinance.

186
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:10,109
[SPEAKER_05]: to specifically speak to this district.

187
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And does anyone have any questions about any of these?

188
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:30,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This talks about like building placement and where parking should be.

189
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:34,817
[SPEAKER_05]: That is it.

190
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:39,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll stop sharing my screen for the moment.

191
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:42,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel, thank you.

192
00:22:43,316 --> 00:23:00,840
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the questions I wanted before you went through is, can you explain to the board and to the public exactly why this district was chosen and how it relates to, like for instance, why not West Medford?

193
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not Medford Square?

194
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it at Wellington?

195
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you answer that?

196
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:15,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to mention that we have the presentation that we had done for the public that has the map that shows those other areas.

197
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:19,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be helpful to have to illustrate your answer?

198
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:24,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize that I don't have it open on my computer, but I can get it up.

199
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:29,318
[SPEAKER_05]: First to the draw.

200
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to do it?

201
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, you can do it.

202
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually just talking to Clem that we should get these up onto our web page.

203
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize that we had not.

204
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:51,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Clem just sent me a link.

205
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I have also the presentation that we did.

206
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me.

207
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:10,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to share this.

208
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, what I want to do is just share this image.

209
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:17,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me share my screen.

210
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:31,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of this is what Danielle was talking about is, let me see if I can figure out a good way to, if I can view that into a little bit better.

211
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:34,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Fit to window, view.

212
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:52,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And Alicia, one of the things that I was hoping that can be illustrated here is myself as a planner and knowing more about the law, the MBTA law and how it is, I know, and just speaking with the city that moving it, moving it to another part of it, the city is not feasible with compliance.

213
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:57,151
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you can paint out what that looks like for the audience, for the public and for the board.

214
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:58,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

215
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:11,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a couple of things and what part of what you can see here is that huge swaths of the two Green Line stations, the half mile are actually in the Somerville area.

216
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:16,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge amounts of that is actually taken up by Tufts.

217
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,767
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this pink here is Tufts.

218
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:21,328
[SPEAKER_04]: land, all of that doesn't count.

219
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:27,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is you have to have reasonable minimum lot sizes.

220
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:37,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And almost all of this area, although I'm afraid this image doesn't show it either, are lots that are on the order of 5,000 square feet.

221
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like single family lots.

222
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it would be effectively not making a district because it would be extraordinarily hard to assemble any parcels to make multifamily housing in these areas.

223
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:58,258
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple of locations and we're starting to see those spring up.

224
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:06,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of it was all the very dense single and two-family housing in all of this area.

225
00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: In this area, it is all these very tiny lots all over the place.

226
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: There really isn't space for multi-family except for a very small area around the train station here.

227
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:26,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle, you want to add stuff to that as well?

228
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because when you

229
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:35,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Enter these into the model, even with a zero, or with no minimum lot size.

230
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,673
[SPEAKER_05]: The model tests real parcels.

231
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:43,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just land.

232
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a 3,000 square foot parcel, what could conceivably be built on that?

233
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:55,584
[SPEAKER_05]: with the push and pull of all the dimensionals.

234
00:26:55,624 --> 00:27:10,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have even like an 80% lot coverage, and then fitting in any kind of parking, and it's just, it starts to, you only get like a handful of units.

235
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:18,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it's the land area and keeping it contiguous, you just keep bumping up against things.

236
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And also one of the issues with,

237
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:30,329
[SPEAKER_05]: spreading it around is we lose a lot of the local control over what we can have here.

238
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:43,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So in West Medford, you have this village center that's very vibrant and walkable, and we're trying to make it more vibrant.

239
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:48,105
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't require retail or commercial

240
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:50,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't require mixed use.

241
00:27:51,436 --> 00:28:00,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So having a 3A overlay there wouldn't match the historic built environment of that village center.

242
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:06,023
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets difficult because of the things that we can't require.

243
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And also in the beginning,

244
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:13,967
[SPEAKER_05]: The first guidelines was you can't have inclusionary housing.

245
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have it at all.

246
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:18,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was outcry.

247
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:21,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote the senator, Jaylen, being like, this is nuts.

248
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:22,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be able to allow it.

249
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:30,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And then DHCD, as their name was at the time, kind of backpedaled on it.

250
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:36,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, OK, you can have your inclusionary zoning, but you can only do this if you already had it before.

251
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:41,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's still outcry, like, but we just adopted it and it wasn't in place then.

252
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:48,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was just a lot of uncertainty of what we could require it would be allowed to do.

253
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:55,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more it spread out, like, having different rules for different districts.

254
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:19,409
[SPEAKER_05]: started to get very complicated, especially since we're trying to embark on a full-fledged zoning overhaul that would change all of our base zoning and the overlays might not be appropriate in all of these different spaces.

255
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,332
[SPEAKER_05]: So the simplest and most straightforward one

256
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:39,467
[SPEAKER_05]: was feasible was Wellington because of the lot sizes, the land area, and what we could get there.

257
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:51,075
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just too much excluded land around the Tufts Station, not enough land around Ball, and the West Medford was also very complicated.

258
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:55,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It has excluded land too, but you have Playstead Park and then

259
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,834
[SPEAKER_05]: some of those very, very small parcels.

260
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:18,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I just want to touch on something that Danielle just said that I just think, I think that this board is very aware of, but I don't know that members of the public are, is that this is not like, oh, we have to take advantage of this bite at the apple to change zoning because it's so hard to change zoning in Medford.

261
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:34,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That is actually very true historically, but we actually have an RFP out right now to hire a zoning consultant jointly with the city council to do a full fledged redraft of zoning throughout the city of Medford.

262
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:46,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we really focused on here was the state is putting heavy pressure on us to pass this residential multifamily as of right by December 31st.

263
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do that and be in compliance.

264
00:30:52,372 --> 00:31:00,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And on Tuesday of next week, we are getting our bids back for hiring a zoning consultant jointly with the city council.

265
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:08,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our office and the city council are going to hire a zoning consultant with the intention of spending 18 months.

266
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:23,309
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at the entire city and how do we use our comprehensive plan and everything in our comprehensive plan that said what we wanted to see and how do we actually change because if you start digging into our zoning it's bizarre.

267
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:32,177
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really weird and so how do we just throw out all of it and start over clean and

268
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: For this, we wanted to, what can we do that is clean, straightforward, everybody can understand, shouldn't have any unintended consequences, and meets the regulations?

269
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that answer your question?

270
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to take the chair down.

271
00:31:52,721 --> 00:32:01,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So because this is one of the questions that I have, and I think one of the only other questions that I have,

272
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll open it up for the board for clarification.

273
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the parking minimums.

274
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:20,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're doing this in a transit oriented development and we have 0.5 at this point, and we can actually really go big and create more density.

275
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:22,314
[SPEAKER_07]: No parking minimums.

276
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:23,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Get rid of them.

277
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:25,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that feasible?

278
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:26,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something that

279
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm not mistaken, Danielle, you've ran the numbers.

280
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you share with the board what that would mean if we were to get rid of the parking limit?

281
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:46,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I ran the model with zero, with a parking minimum of zero spaces.

282
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:55,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And the number jumped up to, let's see here, it was 11,000

283
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:06,120
[SPEAKER_05]: 745 going from 0.8 to zero.

284
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing with that is we would want to bring down the height so that developers would actually take advantage of those incentives.

285
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:25,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Because instead of putting a couple floors of

286
00:33:28,922 --> 00:33:43,213
[SPEAKER_05]: parking wrapped with housing on top, then they would just build the housing without any of the other things that we're looking for.

287
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:48,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I ran it with 0.5 rather than 0.8, and that gets you

288
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:57,161
[SPEAKER_05]: a little over 7,000 units and dropping the height down, let's see.

289
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:57,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can even

290
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:12,047
[SPEAKER_04]: share this so you can.

291
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:24,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But while Dania's doing that, I actually just want to raise, like, do we think that allowing people to build housing there with no parking is actually a good idea in Medford?

292
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:27,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you believe that people would move into apartment buildings?

293
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:34,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look at it and I see it's right next to Route 16, Route 28, and it's about four blocks from 93.

294
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:37,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And they wouldn't buy cars.

295
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:38,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what would they do?

296
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:45,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they would live there and then they'd realize that they actually need a car to get to Medford Square and to do other things.

297
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:53,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, we have housing built with no parking that residents

298
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:59,888
[SPEAKER_04]: are buying cars and now they're parking them in the neighborhoods and in the parking lots and stuff.

299
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already seeing overflow parking in Hormel Stadium from the apartment buildings around it.

300
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,850
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my concern.

301
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Incentivizing fewer cars makes sense.

302
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:21,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very nervous about the developer that actually builds the building with no parking there.

303
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:25,955
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would be interested in hearing what the rest of the board thinks.

304
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess I'm not sure if I'm alone in this one.

305
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:40,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand your reservation on it, but we, our car dependency is the reason why we're in trouble with the house insurance now.

306
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:51,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just saw it as an opportunity just to not to be so car dependent, but I can also understand on the other side, because I happen to live in one of those apartment buildings near Homel that you just referenced.

307
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:57,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think there is a concern with

308
00:35:58,454 --> 00:35:59,675
[SPEAKER_03]: that and I don't know.

309
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:24,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a part of me that likes to think that if somebody is signing a lease or whatever for a building that they know doesn't have any parking or a unit that doesn't have a parking space attached to it, they know what they're getting into and they're not going to suddenly decide they need a car after the fact.

310
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,966
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't understand that that's not

311
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:29,192
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not always going to be the case.

312
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:35,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes people are going to do that and it's going to put a, you're going to, you're going to end up having a car with nowhere to go.

313
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:46,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I also do understand that concern, and I think there is an element of it.

314
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:55,309
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said, being connected to the Green Line does give access to most amenities that people starting leases would need.

315
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,930
[SPEAKER_09]: They may not all be in Medford.

316
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,911
[SPEAKER_09]: They might take the Green Line to, say, Somerville.

317
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:00,832
[SPEAKER_03]: The Orange Line?

318
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:02,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

319
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Wellington, not Ball Square.

320
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:05,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

321
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:15,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like the idea of at least lowering the parking minimum.

322
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:18,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe thinking about that 0.5 instead of 0.8.

323
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:28,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I am definitely excited about the idea of disincentivizing car ownership where it does not already exist.

324
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:46,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any other board input on parking minimums or anything else?

325
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:53,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there thoughts on the actual development incentive bonuses that Danielle wanted input on?

326
00:37:56,031 --> 00:38:01,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I think lowering the number of parkings is more acceptable in my mind.

327
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:07,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Not having a parking spot for guests, for instance, is okay, but for residents,

328
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:12,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if we want, for instance, families to be living in these multifamily housing.

329
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:24,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting from myself with my kids, it's very hard to imagine myself without a parking spot which is close by.

330
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:26,479
[SPEAKER_08]: to my home.

331
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:39,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we're planning to attract families also to this area and not only youth or young people, then definitely parking is required in my opinion.

332
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also in favor of keeping the parking minimum above zero.

333
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:51,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ran the model through the chair with 0.5

334
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would get you 0.5 spaces.

335
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:09,949
[SPEAKER_05]: And lowering the height to, let's see, four stories would get you 6,595.

336
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:19,988
[SPEAKER_05]: units, which is more than the minimum that we're required to do.

337
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:29,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the reason why lowering the height was to make sure that we could get some of the incentives, that developers would take advantage of those.

338
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:38,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can go up to nine stories if you incorporate those other provisions.

339
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:42,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we keep it five stories as the baseline,

340
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:57,102
[SPEAKER_05]: with 0.5 spaces as the minimum, I'm not sure that we'll get the other kind of development that moves forward all of our other goals as well.

341
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:10,232
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I think we should also keep in mind is the accessible parking spaces, like to ensure that individuals with special needs

342
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:16,840
[SPEAKER_08]: have convenient access and we're not excluding them from the multifamily too.

343
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:22,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, that's a good point.

344
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:24,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so

345
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:43,702
[SPEAKER_07]: against car dependency that one of the things that made it a little bit more humbling was I attended a conference where there was someone with a disability who had kept saying, you know, you keep talking about no parking, no parking, but what about my caretakers that come to take care of me?

346
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,101
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so it's currently at 0.5, Danielle, or?

347
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:08,322
[SPEAKER_05]: The draft zoning that you have is off of 0.8 as the minimum.

348
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:09,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And 1.5 is the max.

349
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:17,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, no, it's 0.8 for the market rate, 0.5 for the affordable units.

350
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:21,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same as it would be

351
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:28,364
[SPEAKER_05]: in the rest of the city if you're within half a mile of high frequency transit.

352
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:35,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with the one and a half spaces per dwelling unit would be the max.

353
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:40,129
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the comfort of the board with that?

354
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:45,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that definitely sends a message of don't over park these developments.

355
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:49,939
[SPEAKER_05]: if you build it, they will come.

356
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:58,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can, a lot of developers we talked to say, our market demands that we provide at least one per unit.

357
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:09,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they'll want to build that because either they can get more rent or the investors will get on board because they don't wanna see empty apartment complexes.

358
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will build more than what is required.

359
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's nothing,

360
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:23,918
[SPEAKER_05]: that would prevent developers from building up to that maximum one and a half.

361
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:32,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that there will be, and if we unbundle the parking from the units, that there could be X amount of parking.

362
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want it, you can pay for it.

363
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:43,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're a family and you have two cars, you could lease two spaces or purchase two spaces, say if it's a condo.

364
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:49,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't own a car, then that's unbundled from your rent and your housing costs.

365
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:54,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that people that would want the spaces couldn't get them.

366
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:03,463
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's enough housing production, then hopefully that there will be housing of all types.

367
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that makes sense.

368
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:13,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I especially like unbundling that from housing, because I know plenty of people who

369
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:20,678
[SPEAKER_03]: who don't own cars and have no use for a parking space and wouldn't want to pay for one in their rent.

370
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:33,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tell me more about the mechanism of unbundling it from the housing units?

371
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:34,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm certainly interested.

372
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:37,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not sure I've seen an example of it.

373
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:49,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I live, if you have, you can have two spaces per unit.

374
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, I don't know, there's different levels because we have a garage.

375
00:43:56,004 --> 00:43:59,586
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not part, it becomes part of my rent if I take it.

376
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:05,211
[SPEAKER_07]: If I don't want any, if I want no parking, then it's not part of my rent.

377
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:08,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm guessing that that's what the idea is.

378
00:44:12,726 --> 00:44:18,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess my question is in terms of the zoning, it makes sense to me in how it would be written into a lease.

379
00:44:18,453 --> 00:44:23,980
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm not sure of is how it plays into what we're writing, if that makes sense.

380
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:32,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we can refer that back to our consultant, but I don't think Danielle meant that we would require that.

381
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are seeing is that we're seeing more and more of that.

382
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:46,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually found out from one of the staff in City Hall that the big apartment building across from Wegmans, if you want to park on the surface parking outside, it's free.

383
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:48,606
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want a garage space, you have to pay $200 a month.

384
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he tells me is that there's not enough surface parking.

385
00:44:53,368 --> 00:44:58,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to be guaranteed a spot when you come home, you have to pay $200 a month.

386
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:06,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of interesting for me because this particular staff person actually bikes to City Hall fairly regularly, but he and his wife also have a car.

387
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:08,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

388
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:12,369
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're seeing it more and more.

389
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we can require it.

390
00:45:16,192 --> 00:45:18,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Dana, you can correct me if you think I'm wrong.

391
00:45:18,374 --> 00:45:23,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also just bump it to Emily just to check.

392
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:32,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can require that the parking not be associated with an individual unit.

393
00:45:35,987 --> 00:45:53,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that we want to research, but I don't think we're ready for it here, is that Somerville has some regulations written into their zoning and into their conditions about how the housing is marketed and how the parking is described and marketed.

394
00:45:53,682 --> 00:46:00,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they have to be explicit about whether or not you have parking, whether or not you're allowed to park on the street,

395
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:08,230
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, a lot of their new apartment buildings, you're not eligible for street permit parking.

396
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:20,133
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that's successful is that they actually enforce that you have to market in your apartment marketing that there is no street parking and that you're not eligible for it.

397
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,821
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been successful, but it's a chicken and an egg problem here too.

398
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: They have much better intra-city public transportation than we have, right?

399
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:38,445
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get all over Somerville and all over Cambridge and Boston, well, most of Boston, without a vehicle.

400
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:42,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And Medford, it's dramatically harder.

401
00:46:43,486 --> 00:46:47,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we would love to improve the MBTA services.

402
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:48,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually

403
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:59,772
[SPEAKER_04]: sidebar, asking MAPC for a technical assistance grant to start to pull together a group to look at these intra-city transportation issues.

404
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:09,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to be talking about that shortly, the MAPC and I. But it's this is this is a problem.

405
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:12,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We are seeing more people charging for it.

406
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:14,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it's something we can add here.

407
00:47:17,096 --> 00:47:38,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing, just to be clear with our timeline, and I do want to remind you, this is a public hearing, so we have to open to the public for comments as well, is that we've structured this so that it's easy for you guys to have a lot of questions and thoughts and stuff for us to run some more things by the consultants and for you all to vote on this at your next meeting.

408
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:40,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll have to talk about the timing of that.

409
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:45,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the city council public hearing was advertised for December 12th.

410
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: for them to give them two meetings to be able to talk about this as well.

411
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And if all of that works, we meet our deadlines.

412
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,593
[SPEAKER_04]: If that doesn't work, it's the prerogative of the board and the city council.

413
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,075
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't make you do anything.

414
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:06,580
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does mean that the state is going to be extremely unhappy with us about not making their timelines.

415
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually had a conversation with them today.

416
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:11,564
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have amazing sticks.

417
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:18,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But we like them to like us because then they give us grants and more assistance.

418
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know how else to phrase that.

419
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:32,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you, through the chair, if folks want to have three meetings for this, so tonight and then the 6th.

420
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:33,996
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to go there yet.

421
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:35,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just have the conversations.

422
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:41,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just saying so people don't feel like they're under the gun, that we could hold a special meeting on the 29th.

423
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,262
[SPEAKER_05]: because we will have to continue this to a date certain.

424
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:53,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll either be the 29th and you'll need to let us know if we can have a quorum that night or we continue to the sixth.

425
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:59,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's your prerogative, but I just wanna not feel, people feel rushed.

426
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:11,118
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank you, Danielle, because one of the things, and it does seem, and we understand where the city's, I understand where the city's situation is, but it's also very,

427
00:49:12,278 --> 00:49:18,204
[SPEAKER_07]: important and pertinent to let the board know that you're expecting to vote by 12-6-23.

428
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:23,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the case, then we're going to have to hold another special meeting because who's going to do Thanksgiving?

429
00:49:25,272 --> 00:49:25,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

430
00:49:26,753 --> 00:49:28,735
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just have one more meeting on the 6th.

431
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:42,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually our recommendation that if we are going to vote on the 6th, we actually have to turn around the decision to the city council the next day on the 7th.

432
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:55,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's our request that if you think things are going to change a lot the week, so what we'd like to know is all the stuff that you're interested in getting more information from.

433
00:49:56,514 --> 00:49:57,795
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take that to the consultant.

434
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:58,976
[SPEAKER_04]: She can run more models.

435
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:00,537
[SPEAKER_04]: She can draft additional language.

436
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:01,397
[SPEAKER_04]: She can make changes.

437
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:02,298
[SPEAKER_04]: She can do all that.

438
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:06,420
[SPEAKER_04]: She can be here on the 29th to meet with you all.

439
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: She is probably not available on the 6th.

440
00:50:12,644 --> 00:50:18,468
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we meet both times, then we could have stuff ready for the 6th.

441
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:20,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that help?

442
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was just more confusing.

443
00:50:26,228 --> 00:50:36,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also, rather than getting into the dates now, we also should talk, are there other things in the zoning that the board would like to think about or discuss?

444
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:51,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Given the conversation we just had, can we also get a model on changing the maximum, say, from 1.5 to 1.3 or 1.4?

445
00:50:51,836 --> 00:51:02,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that we probably feasibly can't go too low, but since they're going to be going above the minimum, thinking about the other places where we can move around.

446
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:06,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's for sure what we'll go for, but I would be interested in seeing that.

447
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:15,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So the model says how many units would be generated if this is built out to its max?

448
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: The max parking with the maximum number of units, it assumes all the developers build to the lowest number of park, like the lowest parking spaces and the furthest setbacks that you build out as much as you can.

449
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:45,521
[SPEAKER_04]: The maximum parking is just something we put in because we thought it was a good idea in Medford, but does not impact production,

450
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:47,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

451
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:49,786
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

452
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:54,789
[SPEAKER_09]: haven't drawn the connection to how the model works.

453
00:51:55,189 --> 00:51:58,751
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would be interested in other people's thoughts about playing with the maximum.

454
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:00,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like the idea.

455
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:03,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if anyone else is interested in playing around with it.

456
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:17,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like the idea of maybe leaving the minimum where it is and taking the maximum down to some above 1, but still less than 1.5 number.

457
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:29,542
[SPEAKER_03]: just because maybe that's where we can trim parking a little bit, if not at the minimum level, then at the maximum level.

458
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:50,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another thing that we could think about is, if we lower the parking and it's increasing the potential unit yield, we could shrink

459
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:55,129
[SPEAKER_05]: the zone to keep it all on the Wellington side of 28.

460
00:52:56,049 --> 00:53:08,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, because I feel like there could be pushback for parking with some of the neighborhood behind Cappy's.

461
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:10,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a thought.

462
00:53:10,673 --> 00:53:13,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

463
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:17,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I think coming to you live from behind Cappy's, I think we have plenty of parking.

464
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,255
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just me.

465
00:53:29,692 --> 00:53:39,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm being overambitious, but it seems like the spirit of the law is to kind of put in zoning to build a lot of housing.

466
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:42,320
[SPEAKER_09]: There is broad interest in Medford in building a lot of housing.

467
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:52,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's simplifying things enormously, but just throwing it out there.

468
00:53:54,499 --> 00:54:11,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So another thing that I've asked the consultant for, but she wasn't able to get it for tonight, is to do some visual modeling of what this would mean and what this could realistically mean.

469
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:13,289
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of development.

470
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if it would help this board at all for me to actually show the Google map of what's currently there, like the thing, and walk through what we think will actually get changed and redeveloped under this or what could, and what do we think is not changing in the next 30 years?

471
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:35,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's a helpful exercise.

472
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:37,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of expect it's going to be for the city council.

473
00:54:39,055 --> 00:54:41,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be really helpful, yeah.

474
00:54:41,836 --> 00:54:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my questions would be where exactly, like where do you think realistically development will occur?

475
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:51,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like station landing, I don't think much is going to change in station landing.

476
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:59,400
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the apartments behind Cappy's are pretty good as well.

477
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:05,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I see very low number of spots where development actually can happen.

478
00:55:06,855 --> 00:55:23,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other question is, I know there are a lot of places which has smaller lots, but there could be instances where two lots, one person could buy two lots and maybe demolish single families' houses and make a bigger house there.

479
00:55:23,158 --> 00:55:25,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that even be a possibility?

480
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:30,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the chair wants, I'll share my screen and walk through some of this.

481
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,561
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

482
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:44,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And to answer, sorry, just to answer Siraj's second question, so the model just speaks to existing parcels.

483
00:55:46,004 --> 00:55:49,129
[SPEAKER_05]: If parcel lines change or are combined, then.

484
00:55:50,464 --> 00:55:58,409
[SPEAKER_05]: they could potentially yield many more parcels because the model only looks at what's actually there, the constraints now.

485
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:06,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's nothing that would prevent merging parcels to- How about lowering the 10,000 square feet minimum to 8,000 maybe?

486
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:07,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

487
00:56:11,516 --> 00:56:12,517
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something we could look at.

488
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:24,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you that if you, there is a point at which you, no matter how small you make the parcel size, you can't actually put like a five-story building there unless it's a pencil, right?

489
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:32,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, although I am not an expert with those numbers, I think the model has actually some controls in it.

490
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:39,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you split it down to the parcel size of zero, it makes some assumptions about what your reasonable parcel size is.

491
00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:41,964
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a good question for Emily.

492
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:46,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the whole area that we're talking about.

493
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to zoom in a little more.

494
00:56:49,431 --> 00:56:52,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you, so this is Wellington Station.

495
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:58,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And this here, we actually are getting this is what was recently rezoned.

496
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:06,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a special permit site plan review application coming in for a multifamily building here.

497
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:16,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have it in my head, but my gut, I think it's like 250 units and it's like five stories to go here.

498
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually happening regardless of the zoning.

499
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:26,731
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the whole MBTA area and its change depends on the MBTA and the air rights.

500
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:32,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And nothing can be built as of right on this entire area, no matter what the zoning is.

501
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here, this is stations landing.

502
00:57:36,424 --> 00:57:37,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all new.

503
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not changing, but there is some space between stations landing and the MBTA here.

504
00:57:44,675 --> 00:57:46,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little less clear.

505
00:57:46,718 --> 00:57:48,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like the Kelly's roast beef parcel.

506
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:50,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's developable.

507
00:57:50,622 --> 00:57:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't heard anything.

508
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:55,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's approached us about it, but it's possible.

509
00:57:56,103 --> 00:58:00,804
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of surface parking here, but I don't know that it's really enough to make a difference.

510
00:58:01,464 --> 00:58:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe most of this may actually be owned by the MBTA.

511
00:58:05,345 --> 00:58:07,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, it's like popping up pictures for us.

512
00:58:08,966 --> 00:58:12,107
[SPEAKER_04]: The CAPI site, that is completely in play.

513
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:18,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually on the market and there is a housing developer that is very interested in building housing there.

514
00:58:19,898 --> 00:58:27,465
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a relatively, so then these apartment buildings, I think I can actually do the 3D thing here.

515
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:27,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

516
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Tilt view.

517
00:58:30,728 --> 00:58:33,030
[SPEAKER_04]: See if I can do this the way I think I can do it.

518
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and tilt this so you can actually see.

519
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:39,536
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

520
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:40,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant.

521
00:58:41,378 --> 00:58:42,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that brilliant?

522
00:58:44,211 --> 00:58:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can really see what I'm talking about.

523
00:58:45,872 --> 00:58:49,634
[SPEAKER_04]: The station's landing area, that is not changing.

524
00:58:50,015 --> 00:58:51,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Cappy's, it has potential.

525
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:56,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of this maybe, but this is owned by the MBTA.

526
00:58:56,298 --> 00:58:59,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is MBTA through here.

527
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:02,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Yacht Club, this is state-owned DCR.

528
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:07,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the pop-ups, I don't know how to stop that.

529
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:24,833
[SPEAKER_04]: So the CAPI site is in play, but these apartment buildings, it's really hard to think that somebody's going to do something else there, but those apartment buildings actually exist right now between the area we've been talking about and all the single and two-family homes.

530
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:40,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be quite a feat for somebody to buy up a bunch of these two-family homes and put a bigger apartment building on it, which is why we haven't even bothered to include these in this space.

531
00:59:42,473 --> 00:59:45,455
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a relatively new Wellington Place.

532
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a relatively new development.

533
00:59:48,477 --> 00:59:53,061
[SPEAKER_04]: In theory, with the right rules, somebody could come in and put

534
00:59:55,715 --> 01:00:04,045
[SPEAKER_04]: a building on their parking lot if they incorporated enough parking so that they didn't push Wellington Place out of compliance.

535
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Then is this section over here.

536
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a new multifamily building.

537
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:18,703
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a pretty good shape commercial building that's been doing some renovations and all.

538
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:31,792
[SPEAKER_04]: We see these two commercial buildings back here actually as being a potential for either conversion to housing or this giant parking lot.

539
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:40,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Could they incorporate a housing development into some of these two parking lots?

540
01:00:40,779 --> 01:00:41,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, not unheard of.

541
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:47,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I will just so you're aware, this up here is Rivers Edge.

542
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:54,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Rivers Edge has its own very weird zoning and regulation section.

543
01:00:54,391 --> 01:01:03,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to go into that tonight, but we left this out because we're not sure that we legally can mess with it right now.

544
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:06,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But that said, this is housing.

545
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:13,574
[SPEAKER_04]: This is housing, and they're planning to come in and do a development here as well.

546
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:24,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're actually talking to Rivers Edge and a developer about a housing project that they would like to bring in and file in the next couple of months to do housing there.

547
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: This one space, they're reserving for some additional commercial space, but they're not prepared to start development yet.

548
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:34,952
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really all of it.

549
01:01:35,052 --> 01:01:42,220
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other piece that's in play is where Danielle was talking about this section across the way here.

550
01:01:44,282 --> 01:01:46,004
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an interesting parcel.

551
01:01:46,465 --> 01:01:47,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It is all strip mall.

552
01:01:48,186 --> 01:01:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe there are some long leases in here and it might not be so easy to just redevelop it.

553
01:01:55,054 --> 01:02:05,702
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even try to touch this up here because the reality is they all have long-term leases that require crazy, crazy amounts of parking.

554
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:13,128
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been dealing with this property owner as she's been bringing in new businesses into her

555
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:14,620
[SPEAKER_04]: her building.

556
01:02:16,201 --> 01:02:21,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've talked about the fact that we'd like like a whole new, like, let's just redevelop the whole thing there.

557
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:26,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, because of their current leases, that's not on the table.

558
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:34,176
[SPEAKER_04]: But we would talk to them about rezoning as part of a bigger rezoning effort for the city.

559
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:42,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, oh, and in case anybody is wondering, people don't know, this little corner here, that's a state police station.

560
01:02:43,473 --> 01:02:44,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's state-owned land.

561
01:02:46,656 --> 01:02:47,416
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't touch it.

562
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:51,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that help?

563
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one other thing, we didn't include this one, which is actually in the residential zone.

564
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:59,226
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Bianco Sausage.

565
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the one other.

566
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:07,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that, yeah, so we didn't include that parcel.

567
01:03:10,515 --> 01:03:13,659
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the green space behind Felsbury Plaza?

568
01:03:16,715 --> 01:03:22,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this, that, that is a fascinating parcel of land.

569
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It is privately owned man-made wetland.

570
01:03:27,284 --> 01:03:30,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that it's been in existence for quite a while, we can't touch it.

571
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:38,533
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, and if you look really closely, you can see here the circle and a dot and a circle and a dot and the line through it.

572
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:41,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It was AM radio towers.

573
01:03:42,696 --> 01:03:44,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And back in the early,

574
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:51,944
[SPEAKER_04]: 1900s when they built AM radio towers, they had to surround them with water to reflect the radio signals off the water.

575
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:59,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where there are actually a lot of different storm drains that end up in this area that create this wetland.

576
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:01,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's protected.

577
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:18,508
[SPEAKER_04]: We have talked to some developers who would love to think big about redeveloping this whole area, including that, and then cleaning that area up and turning it into a beautiful wetland with boardwalks the way they have in Cambridge.

578
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would have to be part of a massive development to be able to afford something that cool.

579
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, any other questions?

580
01:04:53,713 --> 01:05:12,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you answered this in there somewhere, but just how does this play with the air rights at Wellington Station, which would fall in this zone but might fall into the Wellington Station, our zoning doesn't apply area?

581
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:18,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so the whole air rights is over the land that is owned by the MBTA.

582
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:21,716
[SPEAKER_04]: The MBTA is not bound by our zoning.

583
01:05:23,777 --> 01:05:28,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently we can't regulate them with zoning at all.

584
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:41,750
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to build above it, we have to work through the whole air rights process where we have to provide the parking and be above their stuff.

585
01:05:43,538 --> 01:05:45,319
[SPEAKER_04]: and work out that agreement.

586
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: This would facilitate that because what we would probably want to do would now not be against zoning if it fell into all of these categories and stuff we just described.

587
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:06,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We've always been under the assumption though that at the point that this actually went out for our

588
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:17,109
[SPEAKER_04]: P, there was a developer that in the end we might need to do a planned development district in order to accommodate whatever the end results of all of that is.

589
01:06:20,229 --> 01:06:29,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might make it easier, but I don't think you could do any of it as of right because of the weirdness of the property ownership.

590
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:32,653
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

591
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:33,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

592
01:06:52,937 --> 01:06:58,308
[SPEAKER_07]: While you have that up, Alicia, I think I'm going to open it up for public comment in case the public has any questions.

593
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:02,377
[SPEAKER_07]: If the board doesn't have any questions at this point.

594
01:07:06,227 --> 01:07:11,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

595
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:15,409
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.org.

596
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:17,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Individuals may have up to two minutes to provide comments.

597
01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:21,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

598
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:27,631
[SPEAKER_07]: A reminder to all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

599
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:34,953
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and city staff.

600
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:41,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters that the students received?

601
01:07:53,011 --> 01:07:54,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any hands.

602
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:56,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that we did receive

603
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:58,796
[SPEAKER_05]: some public comments.

604
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:05,983
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one, and the resident is present this evening.

605
01:08:06,043 --> 01:08:11,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you wanted to read his comment or have him read it, or I don't know how that works.

606
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:12,769
[SPEAKER_07]: William Nabari?

607
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:25,060
[SPEAKER_08]: A thing where you can just say it yourself, I guess.

608
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I see the opening it now.

609
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:42,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and congratulations William on your marriage.

610
01:08:44,393 --> 01:08:44,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

611
01:08:45,694 --> 01:08:46,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

612
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:48,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for recognizing me.

613
01:08:48,516 --> 01:08:56,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually sent in a written comment, which I can pull up if you want me to, but I actually raised my hand to ask a different question.

614
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:05,815
[SPEAKER_01]: The incentive it says provided additional 20% additional affordable units above the required number.

615
01:09:07,316 --> 01:09:13,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd argue that's pretty ambiguous because is that 20% of the required units?

616
01:09:13,562 --> 01:09:16,264
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you're required to put in 10 and then you put in 12.

617
01:09:18,035 --> 01:09:20,917
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that 20% of the entire development?

618
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:24,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're required to put in 10% and now you're gonna put in 30%.

619
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:37,548
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would argue that that language, maybe there's a legal, maybe a lawyer could tell us which it is, but I would argue that it should probably be understood by somebody who's just reading it.

620
01:09:38,188 --> 01:09:40,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So- I can tell you what the intention is.

621
01:09:41,628 --> 01:09:42,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did talk about that.

622
01:09:42,729 --> 01:09:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 20% or more than what is required.

623
01:09:47,033 --> 01:10:01,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's based on, if our current affordable housing requirements are approved by the state, then you would go by the table where, so say, of course I don't have this open right now.

624
01:10:05,237 --> 01:10:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so currently 10 to 24 lots or units is, you have to provide 10% as affordable.

625
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:17,443
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have 25 to 49 units, it's 13% and 80 or more, it's 15%.

626
01:10:18,043 --> 01:10:26,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So say, so you would run the calculation and like, so say, you know, it's a hundred units.

627
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:28,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would mean they need to do 15%.

628
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: So 15%, so they'd have to require

629
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:39,426
[SPEAKER_05]: So 15 units would be what they would need to provide.

630
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:55,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if they wanted to provide 18, which I think is 20%, then they could get a credit for that by providing more than is required.

631
01:10:56,692 --> 01:11:00,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I suppose- Yeah, the language is, I mean, that's the intent of the language.

632
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:01,414
[SPEAKER_05]: We did discuss this.

633
01:11:01,454 --> 01:11:03,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, okay, how do we word this?

634
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,335
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all ears if there's clear language.

635
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:11,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, maybe I'll send a written comment on that.

636
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:13,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to read my other written comment?

637
01:11:13,497 --> 01:11:14,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find it here otherwise.

638
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:19,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I did send another, a second comment in advance of this.

639
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I actually haven't pulled up.

640
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:23,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to read it if you'd like.

641
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:24,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

642
01:11:24,971 --> 01:11:26,073
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd probably be a little easier.

643
01:11:26,093 --> 01:11:26,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

644
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:28,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So your first is about parking minimums.

645
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:31,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Parking minimums should be reduced to zero under the MBTA overlay.

646
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:34,323
[SPEAKER_05]: The overlay is intended to be a transit adjacent district.

647
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:37,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Promoting transit is also part of the purpose of the MBTA Communities Act.

648
01:11:38,267 --> 01:11:41,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Promoting space for car storage also isn't consistent with our climate goals.

649
01:11:42,592 --> 01:11:44,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and then two was setback buffers.

650
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:51,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Please consider allowing alternatives to setback buffers when a project under the overlay abuts a small residential building.

651
01:11:51,583 --> 01:12:02,195
[SPEAKER_05]: The buffers tend to be non-play screen space that can counterproductively set apart the new buildings from the rest of the community in a way that isn't necessarily any more aesthetically pleasing than simply having a large building next door.

652
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:09,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also concerned with the underlying attitude behind the idea that a large multifamily housing is a noxious use that needs to be buffered.

653
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:16,800
[SPEAKER_05]: A step back such as a three story limit within 10 feet of the lot line seems like an option that could be allowed while still preventing excessive shadowing.

654
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:35,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle or Alicia, do you want to address either of those questions by Ms.

655
01:12:36,033 --> 01:12:36,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Navarre?

656
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:40,595
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk about the parking minimums already.

657
01:12:41,655 --> 01:12:41,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

658
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:44,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I can look closer at the buffers.

659
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:48,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look at that again.

660
01:12:48,499 --> 01:12:49,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

661
01:12:51,458 --> 01:13:02,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that when we are looking at the buffers and all, we were also looking at the reality of the location and there's very little of the various small amount of this is up against.

662
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:06,597
[SPEAKER_04]: existing residential.

663
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:21,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the big question is do we, is it realistic to think that these existing buildings are actually going to get torn down because they actually provide buffer between any new development?

664
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: and the currently existing residential.

665
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:36,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So honestly, we didn't look at that very hard just simply because we didn't think that in this specific case, there would be any issues.

666
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:39,885
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

667
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:45,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some of these are taller than we're actually even thinking of allowing.

668
01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:48,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can see if we can see what the height of these.

669
01:13:51,193 --> 01:14:00,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that was also to keep it from being a drive aisle or parking right next to someone's bedroom window or something.

670
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:19,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's necessarily the residential aspect of it, but what is on the edges of a lot that might not be desirable, like the car exhaust, someone idling and warming the car up in the morning, which people do that.

671
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:24,067
[SPEAKER_08]: This court's over here.

672
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:37,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Chair, there is one other resident who has his hand up.

673
01:14:39,373 --> 01:14:41,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. Matarazzo.

674
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:44,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you this evening.

675
01:14:44,328 --> 01:14:46,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I just provided a comment in the chat.

676
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:52,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Just asking if the city had looked at dispersing the capacity throughout the city.

677
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:54,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you answered it with the map.

678
01:14:55,354 --> 01:15:05,600
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a challenge with the five-acre contiguous parcel requirement, but living in West Medford Square and visiting Medford Square frequently,

679
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:17,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage the city, as you have a new consultant on board, to look at ways to increase opportunities for housing that will support the businesses in these districts in the future.

680
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:28,097
[SPEAKER_00]: As you embark on this journey of the MBTA zoning, as new housing is infused into the Wellington Station area,

681
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:36,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if there's going to be a correlation to transportation improvements as a result of this high density housing.

682
01:15:37,643 --> 01:15:44,507
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love this spaghetti as we fly through the Felsway and the circle there.

683
01:15:44,527 --> 01:15:53,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there opportunities to leverage this private investment to stimulate a transportation solution in the long term for this area?

684
01:15:54,833 --> 01:16:24,400
[SPEAKER_00]: and or leverage the development to maybe get get the developer to pay for design planning to develop a solution and maybe leverage maybe some tip projects or monies from from the state mass works and or any other opportunities available to address this transportation issue today not just for vehicles but for the many pedestrians that would that live there today or that would call this area home in the future.

685
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your work.

686
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:33,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is challenging and I look forward to seeing this area infused with new growth.

687
01:16:34,263 --> 01:16:34,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

688
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:41,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Matarazzo.

689
01:16:43,646 --> 01:16:50,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Chair, do you want me to address one piece of this?

690
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:52,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

691
01:16:54,455 --> 01:16:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

692
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

693
01:16:57,877 --> 01:17:02,899
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of issues, but the biggest one is the Wellington Circle issue.

694
01:17:02,979 --> 01:17:07,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you aware of the Wellington Circle study being done by MassDOT right now?

695
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:26,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loosely following it just, but I'm glad that's ongoing and anything the city can do to leverage the backs of the private development to help move this project forward would be a welcome addition to all residents in the city and the region.

696
01:17:27,168 --> 01:17:28,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

697
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:33,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I want to be careful about not over saying, so I just dropped a link into the chat.

698
01:17:34,133 --> 01:17:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So this study is, you can sign up to get study updates from the study directly, but they are moving this forward.

699
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,902
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a recommended solution for it.

700
01:17:47,602 --> 01:17:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is prioritizing walkability, bikeability, and rapid bus to come through this area.

701
01:17:56,906 --> 01:18:16,234
[SPEAKER_04]: So the solution that is being moved forward has no change to the level of service for vehicles, but does make significant improvements for walkability, bikeability, and buses to come through with the express bus lane in one of the directions.

702
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:31,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the biggest thing and I think that I believe that that is going to be moving forward and onto the tip regardless of any development in the area which is kind of lovely because then we can take developer funding and put it into other efforts.

703
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:33,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did put in

704
01:18:35,087 --> 01:18:43,417
[SPEAKER_04]: the zoning some language about the interior roads, so that if there were changes to the interior roads, how that would be handled.

705
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the big issue.

706
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:47,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

707
01:18:48,394 --> 01:18:50,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, I think that's excellent.

708
01:18:51,056 --> 01:19:05,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you shift the focus of maybe mitigation dollars, other opportunities to explore maybe accessing the water and the access of maybe water shuttles to connect to Somerville, Medford Square and points beyond.

709
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:12,548
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a renewed focus on the Mystic and accessibility to water and transportation as an opportunity.

710
01:19:13,168 --> 01:19:15,610
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all this water frontage again.

711
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,972
[SPEAKER_00]: something maybe to consider.

712
01:19:18,693 --> 01:19:27,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been all types of interest in and aspirations of shuttles in the city, and with this density, it might be an opportunity to explore it further.

713
01:19:28,142 --> 01:19:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

714
01:19:28,562 --> 01:19:35,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the difficulties with the water shuttle is that this the river does need to be a low wake.

715
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:37,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a low wake river because of the environment.

716
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:42,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't have fast water transportation.

717
01:19:43,216 --> 01:19:45,979
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also limited by the Amelia Earhart Dam.

718
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just zoom out a little bit.

719
01:19:49,442 --> 01:19:53,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is the casino down here.

720
01:19:54,946 --> 01:20:03,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And as part of the casino discussions, there was actually money put into an account to do work on water transportation.

721
01:20:05,053 --> 01:20:11,199
[SPEAKER_04]: However, and the casino is willing and they were doing, they're doing shuttles, water taxis to Boston.

722
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:19,108
[SPEAKER_04]: The difficulty is because of the dam, none of their water taxis would fit through the Amelia Earhart locks.

723
01:20:19,628 --> 01:20:36,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And so anything that is going to pass this point in the river has to be a fairly small boat and they were going to have to be made custom made boats, which suddenly made this an extremely expensive proposition to have custom made boats that could come up to Medford but

724
01:20:37,285 --> 01:20:41,427
[SPEAKER_04]: then might be too small for a lot of the main part of the harbor.

725
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:54,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So really we're only looking at getting to Somerville's assembly row and station landing upstream with it, which suddenly made it not really a viable commercial enterprise.

726
01:20:55,152 --> 01:20:59,354
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that's been suggested, and I'm just going to throw it out there for people to ruminate on,

727
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:02,235
[SPEAKER_04]: is the idea of blue bikes for canoes.

728
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now you can actually rent canoes and kayaks here in Somerville and then upstream just past Medford Square and it is the same company.

729
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:26,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that they have one-way service but this was an idea that maybe there could be other locations that you could rent and then drop off boats up and down the river and would that be a

730
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:31,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Fascinating, interesting commercial idea.

731
01:21:31,102 --> 01:21:35,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's being floated by staff at the Mr. Rivership Association.

732
01:21:35,164 --> 01:21:36,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that idea.

733
01:21:38,805 --> 01:21:39,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it too.

734
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:45,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it downstream, not upstream.

735
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:48,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can get some other people to bring the boats back upstream sometimes, right?

736
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:59,816
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one thing I think I should mention, and only because it's a public hearing and Mr. Matarazzo brought it up as far as leveraging private development.

737
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:13,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make a public disclaimer that myself being a senior program manager for the MassWorks Infrastructure Program, I am in no way consulting with the city on leveraging state grants administered by the Executive Office of Economic Development.

738
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:14,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to put that out there.

739
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:19,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, Mr. Matarazzo, congratulations to you and the town of Andover.

740
01:22:19,524 --> 01:22:19,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

741
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:22,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

742
01:22:22,531 --> 01:22:23,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

743
01:22:29,675 --> 01:22:31,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any other public comments?

744
01:22:41,621 --> 01:22:42,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

745
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:45,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to close the public comment section.

746
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:53,685
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to come back to the board and see if you want to deliberate or just further discuss the drive zoning ordinance amendment.

747
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:59,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that we're prepared to vote or if even the city is asking for a vote this evening.

748
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:06,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a couple of things that they want to get ironed out with Emily Enns, which is Emily Keyes Enns, who is the consultant for this.

749
01:23:07,276 --> 01:23:11,519
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there's any other questions that we want to give the city now, or we can email,

750
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:23,834
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess we should get this date certain on the board if that's on the table.

751
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:32,298
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome to decide to vote on this tonight and recommend your decisions, but we're expecting you want to take two meetings.

752
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:34,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

753
01:23:35,712 --> 01:23:36,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that would be fair.

754
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:42,897
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just me as secretary trying to put together a resolution.

755
01:23:45,259 --> 01:23:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need to have a motion to continue?

756
01:23:49,161 --> 01:23:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does that have anything attached to it?

757
01:23:52,264 --> 01:24:01,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Or can we just motion to continue and then kind of hold that we've been talking about these things and that we'll come back on either the 29th or the 6th

758
01:24:04,576 --> 01:24:06,716
[SPEAKER_03]: new information or additional information.

759
01:24:08,347 --> 01:24:11,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't mind me answering, there are two things.

760
01:24:12,209 --> 01:24:19,312
[SPEAKER_04]: One is a simple motion to table it to a date certain is fine for that piece of it.

761
01:24:19,832 --> 01:24:34,698
[SPEAKER_04]: For our staff sanity, it doesn't need to be part of the motion, but we would like to make sure that we are all on the same page about what are the things we're asking from the consultant, what is it that we're looking to change just so that we

762
01:24:35,998 --> 01:24:42,781
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that you get what you need before or at the next meeting and there isn't any confusion.

763
01:24:44,841 --> 01:24:48,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm trying to figure out what my marching orders are.

764
01:24:49,483 --> 01:25:03,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the consensus to keep the minimum at 0.8 or was it 0.8 spaces per unit with a five-story baseline height?

765
01:25:05,035 --> 01:25:15,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was there desire to lower that to 0.5 and then lowering the height to four stories?

766
01:25:17,803 --> 01:25:22,606
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you like us to present you two options?

767
01:25:25,727 --> 01:25:30,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I think descriptively what we talked about was essentially seeing the two options.

768
01:25:31,051 --> 01:25:32,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that drive you all up a wall?

769
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:36,797
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think so.

770
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:51,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think because I do think with lowering the parking minimums, then I do think that we have to lower the height so that we can make sure that folks would take advantage of those incentives.

771
01:25:53,442 --> 01:25:56,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But they would still be the max of nine stories.

772
01:26:01,284 --> 01:26:02,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I don't have any

773
01:26:04,358 --> 01:26:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: like hard data to let me know what developers would seek for incentives.

774
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the market is always moving.

775
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,280
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like interest rates.

776
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's costs of disposing of earth.

777
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:28,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So many different things that I feel like if we keep the baseline low,

778
01:26:32,337 --> 01:26:37,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Because maybe we'll get more uptake of the incentives with the deeper affordability and things like that.

779
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:45,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you all think.

780
01:26:49,629 --> 01:27:00,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that seeing the, in terms of concrete things to bring to the next meeting at a date certain, would be to see that,

781
01:27:03,022 --> 01:27:09,974
[SPEAKER_03]: parking minimum, two options with the 0.8 and the 0.5 with the five stories versus four stories.

782
01:27:11,196 --> 01:27:14,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just to kind of spell out what we would be looking to see.

783
01:27:17,993 --> 01:27:21,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing I have written down is the parking maximum.

784
01:27:21,594 --> 01:27:25,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we said that wouldn't materially move the model.

785
01:27:25,255 --> 01:27:34,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't, in terms of production of units, which is really what this particular ordinance is about, it's not something we need to look at.

786
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:46,022
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would like us to look at it, if you can bring what that language

787
01:27:47,339 --> 01:27:49,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Would there be anything other than us just saying instead of 1.5, 1.3?

788
01:27:50,921 --> 01:27:57,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Or whatever number we arrive at, I'm not saying that's what we will definitely arrive at.

789
01:27:59,706 --> 01:28:00,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see what that looks like.

790
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:04,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So say if it was like, how many units do we think?

791
01:28:05,188 --> 01:28:06,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to go through.

792
01:28:06,089 --> 01:28:10,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I could send you guys the model.

793
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:13,070
[SPEAKER_05]: for you to play around with on your own.

794
01:28:13,611 --> 01:28:15,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can kind of adjust things.

795
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:16,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really complicated.

796
01:28:20,112 --> 01:28:22,332
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have the desire to look at it.

797
01:28:22,352 --> 01:28:35,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it goes down parcel by parcel and spits out how many units each parcel will produce.

798
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:39,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I could figure out.

799
01:28:41,142 --> 01:28:55,794
[SPEAKER_05]: If the max parking was lowered, what is the effective reduction in parking spaces that could conceivably be built?

800
01:28:55,954 --> 01:29:07,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe lowering the parking maximum would encourage the creation of a parking structure that could be used by more folks.

801
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:11,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

802
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:11,685
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

803
01:29:16,606 --> 01:29:33,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I would agree with Ari that at least that's something I'd be interested in seeing, if moving the parking maximum just for sake of argument or for sake of presentation of the data from 1.5 to 1.3 would move things meaningfully.

804
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:39,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't or is inconclusive, that's fine.

805
01:29:47,016 --> 01:29:48,776
[SPEAKER_07]: The city of Somerville has parking caps.

806
01:29:48,796 --> 01:29:52,937
[SPEAKER_07]: They have parking maximums on their line, on the orange line for Assembly Square.

807
01:29:53,037 --> 01:30:01,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how, but I guess that's more car dependent over there because it's a huge commercial area.

808
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering.

809
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Destination.

810
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

811
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,421
[SPEAKER_07]: But even that, with that, they have parking caps.

812
01:30:14,362 --> 01:30:14,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess.

813
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:23,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not so much concerned with the maximum, the parking maximum, but if we can decrease it a little bit somewhere.

814
01:30:23,853 --> 01:30:31,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I guess I would be interested in knowing what the benefits are if there are any, but if there's not a significant incremental change, then.

815
01:30:41,826 --> 01:30:53,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess just so that the board is able to vote with confidence to supply that information, Danielle, so that board members can just look at it.

816
01:30:53,412 --> 01:31:11,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so what... And I guess we can decide on the next date, and then between now and...

817
01:31:13,805 --> 01:31:17,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Now and then we can send you other questions via email.

818
01:31:19,727 --> 01:31:27,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and just make sure when you're emailing to not copy other board members because that would be a violation of open meeting law.

819
01:31:27,689 --> 01:31:27,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

820
01:31:28,309 --> 01:31:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to call me on the phone, email me.

821
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:33,291
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ask as many questions as you want to staff.

822
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:39,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

823
01:31:39,793 --> 01:31:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you all feel like you need

824
01:31:42,745 --> 01:31:44,386
[SPEAKER_05]: another meeting before the 6th?

825
01:31:45,106 --> 01:31:48,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you think that this is kind of small stuff?

826
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I would be interested to hear the rest of the board's opinion.

827
01:31:54,650 --> 01:32:04,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But I personally, I don't think this is as much to rise to the level that we need another meeting other than the 6th.

828
01:32:04,535 --> 01:32:10,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is stuff we could get more information on the 6th and pretty simply vote on it on the 6th.

829
01:32:14,177 --> 01:32:25,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, any questions or suggested edits, as I agree with Peter, any questions or suggested edits should be able to be ironed out prior to, without another meeting.

830
01:32:33,305 --> 01:32:34,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm inclined to agree.

831
01:32:43,806 --> 01:32:45,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the chair, do we need a motion then?

832
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:51,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need a motion to for a day starting to 12, to continue to 12, 6, 2023?

833
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:52,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

834
01:32:52,534 --> 01:33:00,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start in alphabetical order here.

835
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:01,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Sally Akiki?

836
01:33:03,283 --> 01:33:03,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

837
01:33:04,864 --> 01:33:06,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharad Bajraj Sharir?

838
01:33:08,007 --> 01:33:08,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

839
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:09,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Cowles?

840
01:33:10,809 --> 01:33:10,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

841
01:33:11,763 --> 01:33:13,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

842
01:33:13,784 --> 01:33:14,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

843
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:15,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Pam Mariowski?

844
01:33:16,706 --> 01:33:16,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

845
01:33:17,786 --> 01:33:19,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

846
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:20,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a yes.

847
01:33:21,388 --> 01:33:24,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, for the minutes, I didn't catch who seconded that motion.

848
01:33:29,953 --> 01:33:31,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care, just pick a name.

849
01:33:31,514 --> 01:33:32,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I second the motion.

850
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:33,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

851
01:33:33,795 --> 01:33:34,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?

852
01:33:34,135 --> 01:33:34,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

853
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:40,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I know PETA made the motion, right?

854
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:41,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

855
01:33:41,971 --> 01:33:47,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

856
01:33:48,232 --> 01:33:50,993
[SPEAKER_07]: The next item is approval of minutes.

857
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:57,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to approve the draft minutes from 9.6 and 9.20 collectively?

858
01:33:58,134 --> 01:33:59,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any edits or anything?

859
01:33:59,574 --> 01:34:06,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I motion to approve.

860
01:34:07,368 --> 01:34:08,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Both 960 and 920?

861
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:11,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Both 960 and 920.

862
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:13,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second motion?

863
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:16,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I second it.

864
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:19,651
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

865
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call, Sally Akiki?

866
01:34:23,412 --> 01:34:23,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

867
01:34:24,773 --> 01:34:26,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharad Basracharia?

868
01:34:27,133 --> 01:34:27,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

869
01:34:28,434 --> 01:34:29,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Kiles?

870
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:30,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

871
01:34:31,354 --> 01:34:32,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

872
01:34:32,815 --> 01:34:33,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

873
01:34:33,862 --> 01:34:34,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Pam Marianski?

874
01:34:35,283 --> 01:34:35,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

875
01:34:36,143 --> 01:34:37,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

876
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:38,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

877
01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:47,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next item, miscellaneous or any other updates that the city wants to provide or the board wants to discuss?

878
01:34:52,192 --> 01:34:58,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides looking forward to I-12-6 meeting for the continuation of the zoning amendment.

879
01:34:58,895 --> 01:35:01,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, is there anything coming down the pipeline that we need to know about?

880
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:06,071
[SPEAKER_05]: that might be coming to the board?

881
01:35:06,771 --> 01:35:07,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

882
01:35:08,372 --> 01:35:10,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

883
01:35:11,214 --> 01:35:13,856
[SPEAKER_05]: The pit on Salem Street.

884
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I expect to get a application from them at some point.

885
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:23,122
[SPEAKER_05]: They're revising the plans.

886
01:35:23,222 --> 01:35:29,746
[SPEAKER_05]: They were working on different assumptions and we had to tell them that they had interpreted the zoning incorrectly.

887
01:35:29,906 --> 01:35:33,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're fixing it and it'll be much better.

888
01:35:35,081 --> 01:35:48,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'm expecting plan development, special permit and site plan review for Burden Bio, Walkland Court, and 100 Winchester.

889
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:50,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Those should be coming in.

890
01:35:50,932 --> 01:35:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have three plan development districts that have been approved.

891
01:35:55,775 --> 01:35:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll be working through their process.

892
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:04,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a possibility that we'll be listening to them

893
01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:08,885
[SPEAKER_07]: all at the same, because they're out at the same time.

894
01:36:08,965 --> 01:36:10,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that they can be staggered.

895
01:36:13,807 --> 01:36:16,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just implied by that.

896
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Wachling Court's planned development district was passed unanimously by the city council last night.

897
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:22,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And by unanimous, I mean 6-0.

898
01:36:26,152 --> 01:36:28,594
[SPEAKER_04]: One councillor has been absent.

899
01:36:33,602 --> 01:36:37,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the Criterion Project at MBTA.

900
01:36:38,488 --> 01:36:43,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They definitely are planning to come in with their permit application in the next two to three weeks.

901
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:57,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, just as an FYI, so some of you may remember the project that we were calling the pit, the gravel pit, which was the blasting over by the high school.

902
01:36:57,646 --> 01:37:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And this board approved the subdivision, which allowed the road to be built and for the retaining wall to be built and for the parcels, 10 parcels to be created.

903
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:23,085
[SPEAKER_04]: If the developer decides to develop each parcel individually as a single family house, which has been his plan all along, then that would not come in front of you.

904
01:37:23,525 --> 01:37:33,429
[SPEAKER_04]: If he decided to, as one developer at one time, build all 10 houses, or six or more of the houses, that would come in front of this board as a development.

905
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:50,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I actually have in our permit software there is a building permit for one single family house on that road and I just wanted you all to be aware that as long as they are in fact building them as individual single family houses one at a time

906
01:37:51,592 --> 01:37:58,096
[SPEAKER_04]: or even fewer than six at a time, they do not come in front of this board for site plan review.

907
01:37:58,996 --> 01:38:04,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you might as members of the CD board get questions about that, or you might wonder about it yourself.

908
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:15,265
[SPEAKER_04]: They do come in front of our office, but I have very limited oversight in what I can shape as part of that process under our current zoning.

909
01:38:16,686 --> 01:38:17,867
[SPEAKER_05]: How many lots was that?

910
01:38:18,487 --> 01:38:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: They're 10.

911
01:38:20,955 --> 01:38:22,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was before our inclusionary.

912
01:38:23,536 --> 01:38:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but again, if they build them one at a time.

913
01:38:27,218 --> 01:38:28,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's written in, there's no segmentation.

914
01:38:28,959 --> 01:38:31,020
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

915
01:38:31,701 --> 01:38:33,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it doesn't apply.

916
01:38:33,702 --> 01:38:36,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not applying to build 10 houses right now.

917
01:38:36,783 --> 01:38:38,004
[SPEAKER_04]: They're applying to build one.

918
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been at the time of the subdivision.

919
01:38:41,225 --> 01:38:41,566
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

920
01:38:42,126 --> 01:38:44,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this is before that.

921
01:38:44,987 --> 01:38:47,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So that situation wouldn't happen again.

922
01:38:47,849 --> 01:38:49,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a theory.

923
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:56,906
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody doesn't know what we're talking about, we'll just have to discuss it over drinks sometime because that was a project.

924
01:38:58,748 --> 01:39:01,431
[SPEAKER_07]: The long-term blasting over there at Windsor Street?

925
01:39:02,532 --> 01:39:02,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

926
01:39:03,152 --> 01:39:06,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

927
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:10,320
[SPEAKER_04]: If any of you are familiar with this from any other communities, we actually don't have any regulation.

928
01:39:11,756 --> 01:39:16,479
[SPEAKER_04]: in the city of Medford regulating blasting because previously it was never considered cost effective.

929
01:39:16,879 --> 01:39:20,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we never, nobody ever tried to do real blasting.

930
01:39:21,441 --> 01:39:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We are concerned that other developers will do it again.

931
01:39:25,183 --> 01:39:35,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's on our to-do list, but not so high on it to find regulations on blasting from another community and adopt them.

932
01:39:35,848 --> 01:39:38,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anybody wants to recommend some, please send them our way.

933
01:39:39,586 --> 01:39:41,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can always add that as a condition.

934
01:39:42,647 --> 01:39:43,307
[SPEAKER_05]: No blasting.

935
01:39:43,767 --> 01:39:44,567
[SPEAKER_04]: No blasting.

936
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:48,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was that.

937
01:39:48,428 --> 01:39:55,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I did want to mention that I always feel like you should get a hiring update from us.

938
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:59,891
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing a second round interview for housing planner.

939
01:40:00,071 --> 01:40:01,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to hire for that.

940
01:40:03,752 --> 01:40:04,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It is hard to hire.

941
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:12,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And we I actually am asking our admin to set up interviews for economic development planner.

942
01:40:15,506 --> 01:40:21,191
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an economic development director interview that was amazing and the person decided to go a different way.

943
01:40:22,012 --> 01:40:30,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody want knows anybody who might want to leave their current role and come to Medford as an economic development director, please put the word out.

944
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,122
[SPEAKER_04]: We are still firing.

945
01:40:37,366 --> 01:40:42,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Felicia, I feel like I know that you use mass planners here and there, but I don't know.

946
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:48,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I feel loyal to the state that I'm not supposed to be, like, doing all this advertising for the city.

947
01:40:48,988 --> 01:40:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like if you use that, there's tons of people that will see it.

948
01:40:53,349 --> 01:40:57,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that you don't get enough chance, but they're always talking about it amongst themselves.

949
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:03,211
[SPEAKER_07]: The planners are talking about it across the state when you use that platform, the mass planners platform.

950
01:41:03,251 --> 01:41:04,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have to be better about that.

951
01:41:04,491 --> 01:41:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we haven't...

952
01:41:05,952 --> 01:41:07,353
[SPEAKER_05]: posted there recently?

953
01:41:07,893 --> 01:41:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't posted in a while.

954
01:41:09,654 --> 01:41:13,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I will post the economic development director position there now.

955
01:41:15,397 --> 01:41:18,759
[SPEAKER_04]: The planner one, I have three people we're going to interview.

956
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,661
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean if anybody knows somebody amazing, tell us.

957
01:41:23,262 --> 01:41:29,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually when we start interviewing, we kind of stop looking at new resumes.

958
01:41:31,046 --> 01:41:32,106
[SPEAKER_05]: We're fun to work with.

959
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:33,087
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a fun office.

960
01:41:33,107 --> 01:41:34,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise.

961
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I definitely can, I say it verbally, but I feel like, I don't know if I put it on my LinkedIn, like my friends hire and I don't know, I just, I don't think there's a conflict of interest there, but it's just, it just feels weird.

962
01:41:50,845 --> 01:41:52,046
[SPEAKER_04]: or I don't know.

963
01:41:52,086 --> 01:41:52,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

964
01:41:52,826 --> 01:41:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you did it for other communities, too?

965
01:41:55,968 --> 01:41:57,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to post just ours.

966
01:41:57,489 --> 01:41:59,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

967
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's not a conflict.

968
01:42:01,191 --> 01:42:07,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just to get more people working in the government sector.

969
01:42:08,095 --> 01:42:14,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you linked to people in the private world who want to come make the world more secure?

970
01:42:14,619 --> 01:42:15,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

971
01:42:18,148 --> 01:42:19,288
[SPEAKER_05]: The economy's a little shaky.

972
01:42:19,308 --> 01:42:20,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

973
01:42:21,029 --> 01:42:27,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys have posted on the Tufts UEP and GIS job listings?

974
01:42:28,412 --> 01:42:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, not in a while.

975
01:42:30,032 --> 01:42:32,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely posted the planner ones there.

976
01:42:32,533 --> 01:42:36,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not tell you definitively if we circulated the director position there.

977
01:42:38,002 --> 01:42:42,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that would be huge, only because as an alum, I get those updates all the time.

978
01:42:42,806 --> 01:42:47,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can tell you that if I do know of anyone, that's one of the first places I look.

979
01:42:47,489 --> 01:42:52,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Because UEP is really good about doing a blast for alums.

980
01:42:53,994 --> 01:42:54,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

981
01:42:54,595 --> 01:42:57,156
[SPEAKER_07]: For current and especially alums.

982
01:42:58,738 --> 01:42:59,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to ask them, Danielle.

983
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:00,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an alum.

984
01:43:03,301 --> 01:43:05,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have to be an alum to know?

985
01:43:06,657 --> 01:43:07,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell.

986
01:43:07,298 --> 01:43:08,699
[SPEAKER_04]: They all know me at UEP.

987
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: They would post it for me.

988
01:43:12,022 --> 01:43:15,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Just being with the city, that's your end.

989
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:27,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm literally drafting an email to Mass Planners that starts with, we're a fun office to work with, and we're doing a lot of very exciting projects here in Medford.

990
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:31,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it just wouldn't be great only because I keep seeing different communities go by me every day.

991
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:35,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So every time like, I wonder if Medford's using that because I'm like, Oh, Lexington is looking for something.

992
01:43:35,755 --> 01:43:36,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Burlington's looking for something.

993
01:43:36,775 --> 01:43:38,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, where's Medford?

994
01:43:38,196 --> 01:43:40,978
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Medford's not saying anything.

995
01:43:41,018 --> 01:43:45,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the problem is that we advertised and then I just got tired.

996
01:43:45,881 --> 01:43:46,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

997
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:46,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we get it.

998
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:47,702
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

999
01:43:50,043 --> 01:43:53,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so

1000
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anything else?

1001
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,081
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that we have.

1002
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:08,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where Ari comes in.

1003
01:44:09,143 --> 01:44:10,523
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Ari's favorite part.

1004
01:44:10,543 --> 01:44:12,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

1005
01:44:13,684 --> 01:44:20,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari, not to put you out there like that, because I guess it's probably at this point, especially with the long meet, and it's probably everyone, so I don't mean to throw you out there.

1006
01:44:23,987 --> 01:44:27,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'll present the motion to adjourn.

1007
01:44:28,923 --> 01:44:29,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second?

1008
01:44:30,024 --> 01:44:30,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded.

1009
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:31,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1010
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:32,505
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1011
01:44:32,565 --> 01:44:33,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Sally Akiki?

1012
01:44:36,908 --> 01:44:37,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1013
01:44:37,889 --> 01:44:38,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1014
01:44:39,329 --> 01:44:40,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirag Bajracharya?

1015
01:44:41,731 --> 01:44:42,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1016
01:44:43,092 --> 01:44:43,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Cowles?

1017
01:44:44,513 --> 01:44:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1018
01:44:45,653 --> 01:44:46,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari Fishman?

1019
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:47,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1020
01:44:47,835 --> 01:44:48,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Pam Marianski?

1021
01:44:49,295 --> 01:44:49,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1022
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:52,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1023
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:53,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

1024
01:44:53,318 --> 01:44:55,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Thanksgiving to everyone that celebrates.

1025
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:58,201
[SPEAKER_07]: You on the sixth.
