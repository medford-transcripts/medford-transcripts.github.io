    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=195.656s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=197.033s">I</a>  think he's here in person.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=197.974s">Oh,</a>  there you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=199.394s">I</a>  didn't see you back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=201.155s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=202.736s">My</a>  name is Owen Wartella, and my address is 34 Electric Avenue in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=210.46s">But</a>  I'm the city engineer, so.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=211.661s">Yeah,</a>  you can also, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=212.681s">In</a>  the future, you can just give your city hall address.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=214.322s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=214.963s">Please</a>  proceed.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=216.303s">So</a>  the conditions that I had were, this is something that I looked at back in July and June in a review, and <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=226.173s">Basically,</a>  the conditions of the road are currently in poor conditions, the sidewalks are in poor conditions, and this grant of location will be placing the new reinstalled main within the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=245.376s">And</a>  they will be replacing the sidewalk in kind afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=252.318s">The</a>  road work, we will probably do a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=257.226s">That's</a>  a permit access fee for work done because we're going to come in afterwards do water main work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=263.072s">So</a>  what we'll do is we'll acquire the money in the fund so then we'll be able to stretch tax dollars a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=272.882s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=273.683s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=274.985s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=275.806s">Just</a>  a question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=278.404s">I</a>  know that some companies have reached out and residents reached out that just wanted to replace their water mains. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=286.291s">And</a>  I know that Councilor Knight brought this forward with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=289.674s">That's</a>  why I'm bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=290.595s">Are</a>  we now having the companies now go curb to curb whenever they open the street?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=304.614s">Yes</a>  and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=306.496s">There's</a>  an engineering directive number three that was issued in July that gives an outline and we try to work with developers on a case-by-case basis to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=322.733s">do</a>  the resurfacing within the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=324.354s">Now</a>  this is a public utility company, so they kind of follow different rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=331.417s">They</a>  don't necessarily need to repave from curb to curb unless it's a moratorium on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=338.2s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=339.731s">In</a>  their defense, National Grid does always go above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=343.473s">They</a>  usually do a full lane.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=345.555s">I'll</a>  disagree with you there, just for the fact that what I did prior to your arrival, I had asked for a list back at least, I believe, two or three years on openings, approvals for openings, and who did those and who did the paving and did they do, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=367.233s">a</a>  just partial or complete or just a block. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=371.677s">And</a>  it was comical because when I got back, I got list of the addresses for the small businesses in the residential homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=381.906s">So</a>  I use one example, Tufts is one of the biggest companies we use for residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=386.49s">So</a>  you have Tufts paving or construction, whatever it's called, and then it says the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=392.175s">And</a>  then, so you can understand when we wanted that to see if the paving was done to specs of what we were told was gonna be acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=400.899s">But</a>  anything that had to do with our utilities, it was just basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=407.862s">We</a>  didn't know the address, we didn't know, it was actually useless for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=413.265s">And</a>  I think I'll ask that again down the line, because I think I'm gonna call for a special meeting for this for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=420.961s">You</a>  know, personally, on my end, the reason why I brought this up, High Street, at 10 o'clock at night, we had a utility job that the public utility hired an outside company to come in and repave. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=434.174s">Well,</a>  they came in at 10 o'clock at night on a school night and, you know, it was, they said they had permission from the entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=442.241s">So</a>  I think that- Are you on a public way or a private way? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=445.344s">I'm</a>  in a public way.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=446.265s">So</a>  this is something that I'll bring up later, but I just wanted to make sure that- I think moving forward, the engineering directive that I issued should take care of a lot of those issues.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=457.613s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=459.054s">The</a>  answer you gave is just a little alarming that our utilities have gone above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=465.058s">I</a>  believe that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=466.539s">I</a>  don't think they've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=467.68s">As</a>  I said, it's a public utility company and they kind of have their own guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=472.083s">I</a>  know, and what I'm saying is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=474.024s">those</a>  guidelines we have to find a way to change them because if you look at our roads a lot of it has to do with i'm not saying it's your fault this is not your fault this is years of of mismanagement of our roadway roadways that you know this is why these questions are coming up from council night that's why we appreciate you being here so thank you understand thank you very much any further questions for the council at this time</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=498.335s">So</a>  just as I understand it, with the approval of this rental location, what's going to happen is we're going to move some water pipes from the street to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=505.558s">We're</a>  going to get a brand new sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=506.879s">The</a>  city is going to go in, replace all the underground infrastructure, and then they're going to resurface the street curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=511.481s">Yes,</a>  and we'll replace the lead lines that are within Walnut Street as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=516.864s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=517.324s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, I do need to open that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=519.825s">So</a>  opening up the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=522.066s">Oh,</a>  it already opened up.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=524.267s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=526.753s">or</a>  do I need to, does the motion close it?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=530.875s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion and Councilor Knight, would you like that with the six day public comment period or? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=540.639s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve at the completion of the six day public comment period, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=556.048s">seconded</a>  by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=558.149s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.326s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.446s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.606s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=590.227s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=685.235s">If</a>  I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=686.556s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=688.867s">I</a>  propose a table this motion for the fact that in the past, just so the constituents know that especially people here in the chambers, when we have a question or concerns with legal background, city council usually has a city solicitor or assistant city solicitor that works with us to answer any questions that legally that we need to make sure that wherever we vote, we vote either as for or against that we are doing it <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=719.006s">with</a>  the proper form and not holding the city liable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=724.23s">I'll</a>  give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=725.812s">This</a>  council voted on a gas station to exclude a gas station for BJ's about a year ago, and we didn't have council here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=736.62s">So</a>  the reason for it was illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=739.883s">So</a>  BJ's took us to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=742.92s">and</a>  we were found to be in fault and it would have been a serious, it could have been if our acting solicitor at the time worked with BJ's to make sure that we had some language and understanding what the protocol was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=759.785s">So</a>  I tabled these, anything that you're gonna see with legal, I'll be honest with the city administration to all my constituents that anything with legal notification <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=771.234s">I</a>  don't feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=772.375s">I'm</a>  not, I don't have a legal background. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=774.637s">I</a>  want to make sure that I cross my T's and dot my I's when it comes to certain entities that we're not putting our decisions on putting a financial burden on our <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=787.843s">committee</a>  or community to fight a legal battle that we're going to lose because we weren't informed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=793.786s">So</a>  that's the reason that I asked because it's, you know, we asked a certain a few questions, one being that if there are 50 to 60 cars that are going to be housed in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=805.673s">Who</a>  is going to, where are they going to be housed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=808.356s">Are</a>  they going to pay excise tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=810.618s">At</a>  least will we get the tax revenue from that excise tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=815.062s">I</a>  believe the answer was that we will from Lyft. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=818.345s">I</a>  just want to make sure from our legal team, I wanted to ask that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=821.748s">There's</a>  some other questions, but I know that there was KP Law was supposed to be, is supposed to be here online tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=830.405s">I'd</a>  like to just, we can ask them some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=832.426s">I</a>  think that making sure that, you know, opening this up, I want to get some examples in the city that where this is similar to, so we can all understand on its basis, what it entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=847.135s">So</a>  we don't put ourselves by allowing this and then later opening up an issue that because of past practice, we might be doing something that's going to harm our community later. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=860.787s">If</a>  that's the question for our legal representation here.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=866.848s">We</a>  do have Attorney Jeffrey Blake from KP Law on the call right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=871.77s">Would</a>  any Councilors like to speak or ask questions before we hear from Attorney Blake?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=880.251s">I</a>  was chairing last week, so I don't know if I <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=883.271s">made</a>  my view on this clear, but to be quite frank, I think that the business model here is incredibly exploitative and not the kind of business we should be encouraging here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=893.561s">So</a>  I'm not supportive of this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=895.703s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=897.365s">Thank</a>  you, President Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=898.185s">So</a>  Attorney Blake, sorry, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=902.372s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell and thank you Attorney Blake for being here, my, and perhaps we'll get to this in your presentation but my concerns are similar to what Vice President Bears just expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=913.642s">And</a>  in the light of the example of BJS last year that Councilor Scarpelli alluded to I'm curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=922.808s">Are</a>  there, with this type of permit application, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons for denial that we need to know about before we take this vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=931.172s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=931.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=932.432s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=934.473s">Attorney</a>  Blake, I do believe that's the main question before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=936.574s">If</a>  there, as the special permit granting authority for this, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons which the council may vote or individual Councilors may vote or the council may vote to deny the permit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=947.939s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=949.299s">And</a>  thank you everyone for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=951.177s">My</a>  name is Jeff Blake, I'm with KP Law and I have reviewed your zoning ordinances and zoning ordinances are land use ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=961.504s">So</a>  typically they are not, they don't allow you to go beyond the normal land use objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=971.35s">You</a>  have in your ordinances, a criteria for special permits that are granted in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=979.215s">The</a>  special permit granting authority <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=981.334s">you</a>  unless specified herein, otherwise herein only upon its written determination that the adverse effects of the proposed use will not weigh its beneficial impact to the city or neighborhood in view of the particular characteristics of the site and the proposal in relationship to that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1004.549s">The</a>  determination shall include consideration of the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1009.715s">social,</a>  economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1015.158s">And</a>  I suggest that these have to have a land use type. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1018.701s">Traffic</a>  flow and safety, including parking and loading, the adequacy of utilities and other public services, compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood to the extent that this is actually a <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1037.815s">consideration</a>  with the current application before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1041.378s">Impacts</a>  on the natural environment and the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1050.884s">So</a>  those are the criteria that that are outlined in your zoning ordinance and those are the permissible areas that you are allowed to number one <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1067.32s">in</a>  denying and or linking with conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1073.544s">So</a>  to answer your question, the earlier question I think was, or a comment was, I don't like the business model. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1083.55s">I</a>  don't know that that has a sufficient tie to land use or use of the land such that it would be an <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1096.038s">it</a>  would allow you the ability to deny the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1100.481s">Now,</a>  I think you're probably saying, well, you just gave me criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1105.664s">Number</a>  one is talks about social, economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1111.427s">I</a>  suggest that that would be more toward looking at the particular use wherein a situation where you might want to grant a special permit <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1123.4s">for</a>  a use that has a particularly admirable, I keep going between screens, community need or economic or social need, rather than a objection to a possible business model.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1146.049s">So</a>  just to understand, and I think this is where it came up in BJ, so we would have to, if it were to be a vote to denial, we would have to cite a specific reason and that we as a body would have to agree upon that specific reason?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1159.197s">You</a>  would, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1161.218s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1162.599s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1163.26s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1164.981s">And</a>  this is, like I said, this is our concern as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1168.783s">In</a>  the past, I appreciate the council from KP Law coming in and stating our ordinance that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1176.025s">We</a>  read also what our city solicitor used to do is work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1182.325s">and</a>  help us understand past practice, what we've done with past businesses and how that negatively affected our community with our decision or the impact on how we can present it that is legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1198.952s">So</a>  again, I tabled it for the fact that we don't have a city solicitor that's working with us because I asked what I really wanted to know is to give us some examples that we as a council can, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1212.253s">can</a>  see tangible comparisons that we've done in the past that have both helped and then crippled us in a sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1221.921s">So</a>  when you look at this situation, I personally have a concern with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1227.305s">You're</a>  talking about 50, 60 cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1229.106s">If</a>  anybody's in that area, I know what the comment was from the company that we spoke with last week that said, oh no, they won't use the satellite program next to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1242.237s">in</a>  the Fellsway Plaza, they're going to park over at a parking lot in a parking garage across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1251.223s">I</a>  don't know what the proper answer is and what the safe answer is as a city councilor that doesn't have a background in legal jargon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1261.81s">So</a>  again, I can't vote for this or support it for the fact that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1271.041s">leaving</a>  it to table, not to the fact that right now I don't have an answer for it, whether it's a yes or no for this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1283.987s">I</a>  don't have an answer because I don't have any support from a city solicitor that I have in the past worked with to help me make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1294.272s">So</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1296.713s">I</a>  hope I'm making sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1300.931s">I</a>  don't know where I'm going to go I'd like to hear from my fellow Councilors before we make some motions, but I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1308.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1309.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1310.885s">Thank</a>  you President real I want to check my understanding here it sounds like from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1316.675s">description</a>  from Attorney Blake that per our zoning ordinance, we can make special exceptions for non-conforming land uses in the case of an exceptional community benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1329.501s">But</a>  it sounds like the interpretation is in a case such as this, we can't deny a technically conforming land use for a reason that doesn't fit within those bullet points that you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1343.727s">And</a>  I just wanna first check that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1346.814s">My</a>  understanding is correct there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1350.816s">This</a>  is attorney Blake again. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1352.518s">Your</a>  understanding is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1354.058s">And</a>  the bullet points are the criteria by which you can judge a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1359.882s">I</a>  mean, permits land use or otherwise class two licenses to the extent that we'll take those up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1366.686s">You'll</a>  also hear that there are criteria for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1369.428s">I</a>  mean, an applicant needs to be able to come in and understand the criteria that they have to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1374.631s">So</a>  to answer your question, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1376.666s">Those</a>  are the criteria that the council will have to identify an issue with the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1386.592s">And</a>  if they identify an issue that can't be conditioned, then they can deny the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1392.555s">With</a>  respect to the earlier speaker, the Councilor who talked about having a, I think the issue was whether or not we could require them to park the cars <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1406.119s">in</a>  a parking garage across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1408.102s">That</a>  can certainly be a condition of any special permit.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1411.266s">Does</a>  that answer your question, Councilor Collins?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1417.715s">It</a>  does, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1420.138s">Any</a>  further questions from the Council at this time?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1423.27s">I</a>  just like to point out, this is an existing business in the community already. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1427.875s">All</a>  right, they have about 50-60 employees here in this community that contribute to the circular flow of our local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1435.722s">The</a>  proposed use, in my opinion, is less detrimental than the current use. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1439.426s">I</a>  don't think that it really makes a big difference in terms of the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1443.289s">in</a>  traffic or safety in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1445.491s">And</a>  that's supported through the statements of our chief of police and our chief of fire in the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1452.116s">So</a>  when I look at this proposal that's before us, I see a business here that exists in our community, that's looking to expand in our community and invest in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1459.822s">And</a>  I think we should make it easy for them, not hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1462.224s">So</a>  I will support this paper in the statement.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1464.966s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1466.247s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1467.982s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Attorney Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1470.362s">So</a>  social economic benefits, or so only if there's an exceptional benefit, can we make an exception, not if we believe there's an exceptional cost?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1484.405s">The</a>  determination shall include consideration of each of the following, the social economic or community needs that are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1493.567s">So</a>  yes, in my reading of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1496.883s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1501.206s">Okay,</a>  and just from your reading of it on other points, I mean, it's not past it, so I assume we can't use it as justification now, but our comprehensive plan, I believe, has items in it that advocate for an increase in the number of good paying jobs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1519.78s">If</a>  the council were to believe that these jobs were not good paying jobs, would that be a justification for the denial of a special permit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1527.05s">It</a>  could certainly be a basis, the proposals compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1533.922s">That</a>  is a criteria for which you can judge the application.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1539.996s">Thank</a>  you, and then just last, I believe you mentioned environmental concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1545.18s">This</a>  lot is in proximity to a wetland, and it would also mean an increase in the number of vehicles and particulate emissions in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1552.425s">Would</a>  that be under the environmental section a justification for denial?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1557.569s">In</a>  my opinion, it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1560.13s">Obviously,</a>  you would have to have, yes, in my opinion, it would be.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1565.094s">Okay,</a>  well, then I have a few reasons to deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1567.716s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1570.391s">Could</a>  one argue that this is a ride share program and ride shares are designed to take cars off the street and therefore they have an environmental impact that's positive.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1578.697s">I'm</a>  not sure they execute what they're designed to do.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1583.74s">Again,</a>  if I wanted or not, these are great questions debate, sitting with a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1594.998s">no</a>  offense to Attorney Blake, but this is what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1598.899s">We're</a>  having an open debate about something that we should be talking about with our solicitor, making sure we get the questions answered correctly for the councils that have the opportunity to sit with former city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1612.402s">I</a>  do not forget what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1613.922s">This</a>  is what I implore you to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1617.123s">This</a>  is not about <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1619.747s">you</a>  know, whether I want to hinder a business to prosper in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1626.095s">We</a>  definitely have questions, and I appreciate Attorney Blake coming and answering questions, but the questions are our ordinance that we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1637.986s">Okay,</a>  so this isn't a strategy to understand for or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1644.351s">It's</a>  where we could understand with a city solicitor sitting in our community, working with us as a partner, figuring this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1653.037s">Again,</a>  I'm going to say no disrespect to KP law, but I don't see them as a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1658.261s">They</a>  are an employee for administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1662.504s">So</a>  again, thank you for time, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1666.663s">Any</a>  further comments from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1668.524s">Director</a>  Alicia Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1671.745s">Madam</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1673.066s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1676.407s">I</a>  was not actually here for this, and I will tell you that I have not seen this file, so I can't speak of any opinion on the specific application, but other boards and commissions, when considering traffic impacts on the city, do request a traffic study, and then our Director of Traffic and Transportation reviews that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1696.417s">and</a>  gives us a written opinion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1698.297s">And</a>  it seems to me that if there are concerns specifically about traffic and impacts on parking and the roads, then it would be appropriate to ask for a traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1708.579s">And</a>  also Director Blake will sometimes help with the scope of such a study in order to meet the needs of what the board needs to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1717.601s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that forward as a tool you might want to consider for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1721.842s">If</a>  you have one, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1724.665s">We'd</a>  be happy to review the application if it's helpful.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1727.286s">We</a>  have a statement from the chief of police saying that there is no anticipated traffic impact.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1736.768s">I</a>  just don't know what did he base that on number of vehicles coming and exiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1744.849s">That's</a>  usually we get for traffic impacts we get a traffic study and the director of traffic reviews it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1754.049s">pop</a>  procedures where these go to the chief of police for traffic impacts predates the fact the existence of the position of director of traffic and transportation in the city as far as I'm aware.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1765.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1768.062s">Any</a>  further questions of the council at this time I do have one person embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1773.747s">Attorney,</a>  Attorney Blake, could you speak to the timeframe so just <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1777.984s">hearing</a>  from what councils are saying, if the council were to move to table this again or to a date certain, what timeframe are we looking at that we must approve or deny this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1792.755s">Failure</a>  by the special permit granting authority to take final action within 90 days or extended time if applicable shall be deemed to be a grant of the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1803.182s">The</a>  90 days is after the conclusion of the public <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1807.343s">hearing,</a>  which we're having now, I have to assume that you began your hearing within the required 65 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1817.811s">So</a>  if you were to continue this hearing for more information, I think you're still well within your timeframe and the 90 days wouldn't start ticking until the hearing had closed.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1832.381s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1832.822s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1835.795s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1837.104s">It</a>  just sounds like the steps forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1839.81s">the</a>  range of steps forward, obviously, I have a position on it, Councilor Knight has a position on it, Councilor Scarpelli has a larger position about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1846.694s">General</a>  legal counsel, one would be to move forward tonight, which I think Councilor Knight seems to be of the mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1852.858s">Well,</a>  I mean, I'm thinking, why don't we close the public hearing, we've got 90 days to figure it out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1855.799s">We've</a>  got three months to figure it out, and at that point, we have to take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1859.702s">I</a>  think the other thing we could do is refer it to a committee of the whole to have the kind of discussions that Councilor Scarpelli has talked about having in the past, like we have had on other items where we could come to some sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1869.278s">you</a>  know, could reach a consensus, maybe there's a majority that wants to move forward, maybe there's a majority that could agree to a reason to deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1876.764s">You</a>  know, I think those are two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1878.025s">It</a>  also sounds like we could continue the public hearing and make that decision at a later time while we seek additional information such as traffic study.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1885.09s">Is</a>  failure to react within the 90 day window considered a constructive acceptance of the application?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1891.055s">It</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1892.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1893.797s">But</a>  the 90 day window doesn't start till we conclude the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1896.459s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1900.077s">So</a>  I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing it forward because, you know, with my hesitation, I would have tabled it, but if moving it toward a Committee of the Whole meeting where we have legal representation that if we had to adjourn in a confidential <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1921.9s">know,</a>  manner of like we have in the past with our city solicitor that I would feel more comfortable to understanding our process and that format. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1929.911s">So,</a>  um, I know you have questions before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1933.676s">Anybody</a>  else might have questions before I motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1936.019s">I</a>  think that that's a good idea to send this community holds.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1939.582s">And</a>  I didn't, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, what was your question earlier? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1942.003s">I</a>  didn't catch the first part.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1943.104s">It</a>  was just whether or not failure to act within the specified timeframe under state law would constitute a constructive acceptance of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1949.408s">So</a>  it'd be like a yes vote, or if it would be that they'd have to sue us to do something, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1953.35s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1954.671s">I</a>  just wanna have the things that go to committee and then never come out, and then have us put in a position where it's acceptance by inaction versus taking a vote.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1962.716s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1964.257s">So,</a>  Attorney Blake, just so I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1967.183s">we're</a>  doing this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1968.083s">If</a>  we were to move it to committee with that, we could continue the public hearing in committee or we would need to close it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1974.766s">That</a>  would start the time clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1977.447s">I</a>  think you could move it to the committee without closing the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1982.849s">I</a>  think that it's legitimate to ask for a traffic study and I'm sure the applicant would probably grant you additional, an extension of time so that you could get a traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1996.542s">and</a>  get the necessary information.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2000.224s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2002.585s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2004.345s">Any</a>  other my questions that satisfied this time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2006.846s">I</a>  moved to continue the public hearing referred and refer the paper to a meeting of committee of the whole with legal counsel and traffic and transportation director Blake.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2015.53s">We'd</a>  like to request a traffic study or</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2025.373s">I'm</a>  happy to add to that motion to request a traffic study from Traffic and Transportation Director Blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2030.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2032.018s">Do</a>  you have that language, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2039.743s">So,</a>  back to me.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2042.744s">This</a>  is without the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2047.928s">If</a>  the Chief has already signed off on this, why are we asking for another traffic study?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2055.122s">I</a>  think we just don't have the traffic study before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2058.684s">We</a>  have the sign off of no anticipated impact, but we don't have the actual report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2064.768s">I</a>  mean.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2065.789s">Just</a>  as cars will be parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2067.49s">I</a>  think that's not entirely.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2068.771s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2069.431s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2072.233s">I</a>  mean, if we want to adjust the language, like if a traffic study has not been completed to have it completed at this time.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2078.413s">I</a>  don't know if one is required for this either. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2080.914s">That's</a>  another question that should be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2083.635s">What's</a>  the traffic study required?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2089.777s">You</a>  mean for the original permit?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2091.217s">Yes,</a>  for the original permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2092.157s">I</a>  mean, for the permit, is one needed for this type of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2096.659s">I</a>  don't know either. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2097.519s">We</a>  can request it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2099.58s">I</a>  mean, I don't know if we can request it, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2103.041s">Again,</a>  legally, I don't know if it's required for this type of business either. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2107.297s">So</a>  that's another question that needs to be answered.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2109.439s">Well,</a>  Attorney Blake did say he believed it's within reason for us to request it, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2116.444s">You</a>  could certainly request it.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2121.347s">Mr.</a>  Parker, would you read back the motion to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2124.79s">Yes,</a>  my only question is <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2129.891s">Is</a>  vice president bears amendment or is vice president bears motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2133.672s">Does</a>  that include representatives lift of lift present or is that without public meeting?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2138.013s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2138.453s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2139.254s">I</a>  mean, I'm taking comments there.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2141.774s">So</a>  with them, you want that in the motion?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2144.455s">I</a>  don't think it's necessary, but feel free to include it.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2150.219s">So</a>  Vice President Bears moved to continue the public hearing and refer to the Committee of the Whole with legal counsel, with Traffic and Transportation Director Blake, and with a request for a traffic study, and also including representatives from Lyft.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2166.689s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Bears, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, do we need a roll call for this, yes, or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2175.395s">It's</a>  not approved, it's just moving through.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2177.976s">It</a>  is your option. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2180.473s">Let's</a>  go with a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2182.075s">So</a>  we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2185.697s">President</a>  again, that's our last roll call.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2188.039s">President</a>  again, that's the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2189.12s">I'll</a>  ask for the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2189.8s">I'll</a>  ask for it.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2190.161s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2191.081s">I'll</a>  ask for the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2191.862s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2194.224s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2195.024s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2196.225s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2197.006s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2197.866s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2198.547s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2199.167s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2199.808s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2200.288s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2201.069s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2201.649s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2202.249s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2202.67s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2205.912s">Madam</a>  President, before we move on, a question to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2210.085s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, why are we advertising in the Somerville Journal?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2652.087s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, if I may suggest, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2655.509s">not</a>  go to the same meeting, because we may be waiting for a traffic study at this point.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2659.21s">Okay,</a>  so maybe we could, you know, set a separate one maybe before the meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2664.212s">I</a>  know you have a busy schedule, Madam President, but I don't think this, it's just a few questions that we really need to solicit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2670.994s">That's</a>  why adding it there, it wouldn't take long. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2673.095s">But</a>  if we can have a committee of the whole meeting just to answer some of these questions and give us some guidance as we move forward, maybe a separate meeting for that, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2682.297s">Legal</a>  please, I think legal is important.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2684.83s">Yep,</a>  and that may, I appreciate that, and the timing may depend on availability of legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2690.754s">So</a>  we will, I will schedule with all due urgencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2694.536s">It's</a>  just sometimes we cannot get legal counsel within a timeframe we'd like, but I will absolutely work to schedule as quickly as soon as this motion passes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3242.598s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3244.179s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3247.221s">I</a>  think something this council has been incredibly focused on is expanding our capacity when it comes to planning development and housing support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3264.28s">you</a>  know, on larger issues, but this seems to me to be an area where we need more staff support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3271.203s">I'm</a>  supportive of having a senior planner position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3273.144s">I</a>  think we need more people working in planning and economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3277.646s">And</a>  so I'm generally supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3280.587s">My</a>  main objections to how these were being proposed in the past was that they were not coming with an appropriation request. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3286.75s">And</a>  that seemed to me to be in violation of Massachusetts general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3290.272s">This</a>  has come to us with an appropriation request. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3293.42s">So</a>  I am of the mind to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3296.662s">But</a>  again, I think when we're talking about having a comprehensive plan, talking about having a new zoning ordinance, talking about the sheer volume of great things that are gonna happen to this community because of the work of this council when it comes to our zoning recodification, I think it makes a lot of sense that we have the staff in place and planning to make sure that all of that fruit and labor can come to fruition as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3317.553s">So</a>  that's why I'm in support of this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3318.874s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3322.458s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3324.399s">So</a>  this is 55,032 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3327.802s">So</a>  what would be the full full salary for full year?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3332.405s">Sorry,</a>  I Madam President, I do have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3335.287s">So</a>  this is this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3337.369s">So</a>  it's appropriate for me to say this is this position at CAF at step five of CAF 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3346.595s">That</a>  is because we have somebody on staff <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3349.502s">who</a>  is currently at CAF 13, step five, who is highly qualified and has served this role in other communities, but she would not take the position at a reduction in salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3360.992s">It's</a>  currently the staff planner position is CAF 12.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3365.036s">She</a>  will not go from the 13 to a 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3369.68s">What</a>  is the salary of that position for a full year?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3373.584s">Sorry,</a>  it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3375.964s">Oh,</a>  I apologize, on my spreadsheet, I have the weekly salary, let me just multiply that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3385.351s">And</a>  then we still have that position that if that person moves up, they deserve that money, obviously, but I opposed and I tabled for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3401.17s">This</a>  council has openly talked about what we've been saying, what have we been asking for, and we haven't getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3409.016s">So</a>  unfortunately, until we see some movement where we have our unions that are coming to us that haven't had a contract, and we have some caps that were approved that we're still waiting on answers that we never approved, and then asking for money papers that we've asked for, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3430.532s">for,</a>  I don't know, Councilor, Councilor Mejia years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3434.173s">I'll</a>  get to that in my speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3435.233s">So</a>  I'm waiting to see with this situation, I'm gonna stand strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3441.134s">I</a>  understand, I respect Councilor Beaz's conversation with how important this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3450.156s">And</a>  I agree, I think we need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3451.696s">I</a>  don't think we don't need it, but right now, I don't think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3456.895s">We</a>  keep saying yes to all what's asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3460.777s">We</a>  are just a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3465.18s">We</a>  need answers, questions answered for us, for this question, to give us strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3471.884s">We</a>  keep voting yes, until they understand that no, we're not gonna vote on anything until we have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3478.468s">No,</a>  that we can't vote on money papers till there's respect for other unions or positions that haven't been filled yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3486.207s">We</a>  have positions in the city hall that haven't been filled that are vital positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3491.23s">This</a>  is adding another position that we already have a director and we have an assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3497.473s">So</a>  at least it's stable right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3500.315s">We're</a>  voting on something and moving more money to an entity that at least is stable in our stable definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3510.08s">So</a>  this is why I can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3511.741s">Nothing</a>  personal, I know how you work and I know how your team is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3516.224s">But</a>  again, this is fundamentally wrong to ask this until we have the entities in place that we can get answers, because we're not getting answers.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3532.242s">Madam</a>  President, if I just might, I've been involved in trying to hire for several of my peer positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3538.312s">is</a>  extremely hard to hire for municipal positions right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3541.674s">I</a>  personally am aware that Malden and Somerville are also hiring for city solicitors right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3552.16s">It's</a>  a very difficult hiring situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3556.082s">So</a>  we are trying to fill those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3558.524s">And</a>  while I can't speak on behalf of our chief of staff and our HR department, I've served on several of these hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3564.83s">committee</a>  is trying to find qualified people to fill these positions as well, which we think is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3571.051s">And</a>  I will say this is one of the few places where you actually have the power to adjust something. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3577.193s">We</a>  do have a position that has been open in my office for 16 months, and it's really putting a burden on the rest of the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3583.734s">We</a>  will be posting a full-time housing planner position and a full-time CPA position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3590.955s">The</a>  housing planner is a staff planner position, so that's on the CAF. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3594.668s">And</a>  both of those are funded off the general fund budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3597.61s">So</a>  as in one through CDBG and one through CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3601.492s">So</a>  that this will really help the burden on our staff at this time.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3605.654s">So</a>  Madam President, I appreciate that, but not just city solicitor, but I'm talking about other empty directors positions that we've had in a long time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3616.659s">That</a>  is some serious concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3618.24s">So</a>  I understand, I appreciate you sharing that with us with city solicitor, because I understand that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3622.601s">But</a>  like I said, there are other major needs that if we had to move, you know, CAF money around, I would rather move CAF money around to make sure we can bring in a qualified, you know, experienced city assessor or a qualified IT director. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3641.807s">This</a>  is what I'm saying to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3644.388s">If</a>  you need, if this is where we need to move some money to make sure we have it, this is where it should be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3650.174s">Right</a>  now, I don't think we have the stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3654.372s">in</a>  other locations to be approving capital, approving $88,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3658.735s">And</a>  we, you know, you want to talk about hurting, let's talk to those teachers that haven't gotten a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3665.099s">Let's</a>  talk about the fire and they're hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3668.1s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4020.516s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4021.557s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4022.297s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4025.832s">A</a>  few things here.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4029.814s">When</a>  it comes to fiscal stewardship, when it comes to this council doing its work and holding the administration accountable, sure, we've taken some votes in the past since June 30th to appropriate certain funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4046.765s">We've</a>  taken some votes not to, we've taken some votes to table things, we've taken some votes to approve things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4053.29s">In</a>  the totality of that, I think all seven of us have been incredibly clear about what we want from this administration and our demands for basic transparency and accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4064.098s">I</a>  think we've also been focused enough to take things on a case-by-case basis, look at the merits and the benefits and the costs of a specific case, and also factor that into our decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4079.815s">There</a>  are a bunch of papers on here tonight where we're gonna have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4084.151s">Again,</a>  it's the next paper, it's the, maybe not the paper after that, but it's the, and then, you know, there's like three more papers in the next, you know, however long it takes us, but we're gonna continue to have this conversation about finances and about caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4098.203s">The</a>  next one, even the mayor's own attorney says needs five votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4101.466s">So</a>  that one's not happening tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4103.288s">If</a>  it seems, you know, I don't wanna call a vote before we've called it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4106.911s">So</a>  we're not just giving a blank check. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4108.412s">We're</a>  not just saying yes to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4111.071s">This</a>  is actually an opportunity for us to help address the human resource nightmare that Councilor Knight is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4118.857s">In</a>  a functioning government, this would be a no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4122.82s">A</a>  mayor would come to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4125.302s">Well,</a>  thanks Siri, probably Googling no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4128.134s">a</a>  fully functioning, communicative, collaborative government, a mayor would come with this request to not appropriate new funds, not transfer funds from one department to another, but to adjust funding within an existing department to make sure that we can hire or keep a current staff member at a slightly higher position, a senior planner, and then hire someone to replace them in their current cap 12 role. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4149.779s">That</a>  should be a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4151.019s">We</a>  shouldn't even be having this argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4152.36s">Now</a>  we know why we are having this argument, because it's not a no-brainer, because the collaboration's not there and the transparency's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4158.942s">I</a>  accept all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4160.624s">I</a>  think we're going to have that conversation I think there's going to be votes where we try to hold the administration accountable later in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4166.15s">But</a>  I think on this specific issue where this person will be doing the work of implementing the good work that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4172.968s">where</a>  we're not appropriating new money, where we're basically saying, so we appropriated a land use planner at CAF 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4178.211s">It</a>  turns out we're probably gonna be better off having a senior planner at CAF 14, and then someone at CAF 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4184.015s">That's</a>  not not holding the administration accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4186.316s">It's</a>  not being a poor fiscal steward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4187.797s">The</a>  money's already been appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4189.438s">No</a>  new money is going towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4192.64s">You</a>  know, this one to me is one that I'm okay with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4196.163s">There's</a>  plenty of other things that have happened that I'm not okay with, and I think in this case, the specific case facts of this issue merit approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4206.63s">Maybe</a>  the next paper doesn't, but that doesn't mean we're not holding strong, that we're not trying to do whatever is within our power to make sure that this administration is accountable and that the people of Medford have the information that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4222.185s">So</a>  I would move to approve this paper as well as to, yeah, I would move to approve this paper.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4234.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4234.973s">Go</a>  ahead, Councilor Sanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4235.974s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4237.315s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4239.456s">I</a>  believe that there is a unanimous, there is a unanimous support behind the rails for financial accountability, for fiscal transparency, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4249.083s">I</a>  am for increasing leverage and to make sure our city is making the right financial choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4254.864s">But</a>  we also have to, in my opinion, realize the facts of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4261.006s">I</a>  fear that in our debate about this specific issue, we've fallen for a red herring that equates a very absolutist definition of accountability with <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4274.91s">fiscal</a>  responsibility, which I believe in this case the money has already been appropriated to your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4280.313s">We're</a>  not taking money out of free cash, you know, there's financially that's that's that's the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4288.759s">The</a>  other reality of the situation is as stable as things might currently be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4292.921s">We</a>  also know that municipalities around us are competing to hire more planners and <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4299.56s">I'm</a>  not saying this is what your office staff are thinking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4303.843s">But</a>  who's to say that in a few months or in a few years, they don't see a lack of opportunity to move forward in our community and they just leave for another community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4314.79s">We</a>  are also competitors in this market. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4317.725s">for</a>  planners, for city planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4320.265s">And</a>  I think that leads me to my ultimate question that I always ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4326.286s">When</a>  I take votes like this, and I think really, when we think about how the question of accountability, how we're gonna hold the administration to account, I think this is the question that's gonna guide me from item to item, is if this is gonna tangibly improve the lives of our residents.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4348.708s">Absolutely,</a>  it will to have an experienced senior planner doing the work of the senior plan that doing this planning work is absolutely going to improve the lives of our residents.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4359.831s">And</a>  that is I think ultimately the goal, the unified goal of the city council, you know we've, we've, I think there's a lot of agreement that we need to move forward on housing production on sustainability on the climate plan on phase two of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4376.995s">support</a>  like this in your office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4379.197s">To</a>  get our own priorities through. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4382.079s">And</a>  so for that reason, I know others might disagree with me, but that's why I would vote yes on this paper tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4390.406s">Again,</a>  it's item by item. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4392.908s">And</a>  I think we need to ask that question for everything before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4397.252s">But</a>  in this specific case, I believe that it ticks my boxes.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4405.678s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4406.739s">Councilor</a>  Ferraro.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4407.459s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4409.821s">I</a>  do want to support this tonight, because I think it's a valuable position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4413.803s">I</a>  think we do need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4415.224s">I</a>  work, I don't think anybody calls your office more than me, as far as our development, but you know, we talked a few weeks ago about being a partner with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4433.276s">Two</a>  weeks ago, we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4434.821s">but</a>  about being partners with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4438.124s">I</a>  don't see no partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4440.066s">All</a>  I see is things coming our way, things coming our way to approve, and we're getting nothing in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4447.752s">We</a>  send papers over, we make requests, and it's, I mean, I hate to say this, but this council is becoming a rubber stamp for the man. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4456.16s">That's</a>  all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4458.261s">And</a>  this is a valuable position, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4462.152s">There's</a>  gonna be a little give and take here with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4464.575s">There's</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4466.597s">Everything</a>  just ask, ask, ask, ask, ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4469.921s">And</a>  every time we ask for something in return, I don't see anything we're asking for coming back at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4479.593s">So,</a>  and I gotta say, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4483.297s">I</a>  mean, I probably will support this thing, you know, because, because I feel it's a real worthwhile position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4488.721s">I'm</a>  just, I'm just tired of, of, of no give and take with, with this, with these people here in this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4495.525s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4496.046s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Carballo. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4496.886s">Vice</a>  Senator Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4497.647s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4498.227s">I</a>  think Councilor Carballo's point is well taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4501.029s">And</a>  that's when I, my point was earlier about a fully functioning administration, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4505.052s">Again,</a>  this should be a no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4505.993s">This</a>  should be procedural and it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4507.554s">And</a>  the reasons for that are myriad. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4510.269s">I</a>  can say there's one office that does respond every time I call, and there's one office that has been coming down to our council meetings at Beck and call, you know, and it is the PDS office we've met on comp plan we've met on housing production plan we've met on climate plan I think we're working on the housing trust the housing stability ordinance so right, you know, I agree with you, city government and administration should work where it comes from the top down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4536.034s">This</a>  is working in spite of the failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4539.075s">And</a>  that, you know, it sucks to say, but you know, that's a reason I can support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4545.477s">This</a>  office is working well and apparently working well in spite of a lot of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4550.419s">So</a>  I think this is gonna help us have the resources we need to continue the work that we wanna do when it comes to planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4557.941s">And</a>  I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4561.843s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4562.763s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4565.942s">Is</a>  the position spoken for?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4568.083s">No</a>  position is ever final. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4569.804s">It</a>  will be posted publicly and there will be applications and there will be interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4575.466s">I</a>  am aware that there is a staff person on staff who will be applying for this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4581.829s">They</a>  are very qualified for this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4584.85s">So</a>  take that as you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4587.211s">I</a>  will interview if other, I have been advertising for the staff planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4590.973s">We've</a>  advertised that in paid locations over the past 16 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4595.434s">Yeah,</a>  I've interviewed four or five people and none of them have been qualified enough for us.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4600.818s">I'm</a>  going to invoke rule 20 from our city council rules, and this is a finance paper that's going to be laid on the table for one week's time, regardless of what happens tonight, because we have the right to do that as a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4614.03s">I</a>  was the first time I've seen this appropriation request on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4618.112s">And</a>  as such, I'm going to vote my rights under Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4620.754s">It's</a>  old Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4621.274s">I</a>  don't know what new rule is, but we leave them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4623.435s">We</a>  never got copies of the rules after we approved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4625.517s">I'll</a>  have them posted up on the website, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4627.958s">Oh,</a>  it is Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4628.538s">It's</a>  definitely Rule 20.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4632.841s">I</a>  do see Chief of... Thank you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4635.142s">And</a>  I do just see Chief of Staff, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4637.764s">Aaron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4638.124s">Did</a>  you have something you would like to add?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4641.098s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4642.359s">At</a>  this point, I mean, I know that there's not debate on invoking that rule that Councilor Knight invoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4649.062s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion and debate that's occurred this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4654.305s">I</a>  do want to add that, you know, there are, as I understand it, there's a number of resolutions that the city council passes that go before the mayor that get routed to the appropriate department and get responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4670.312s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, just want to let you know in particular that I'm presently working on a resolution that you had proposed most recently with regard to the IT department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4681.199s">I</a>  expect you'll see that resolution response within the week, if not shortly thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4687.522s">So</a>  I just want to mention that there is a collaborative attempt to respond to these resolutions that are passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4695.467s">And</a>  I want to note that we're working hard on a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4700.603s">Um,</a>  PDS director hunt with her comments with regard to the difficulty in hiring that it's not only with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4708.766s">It's</a>  with regard to a number of other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4710.907s">Councilor</a>  Scarapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4712.467s">Thank</a>  you for acknowledging that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4713.628s">I</a>  know you have that experience in your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4716.369s">There's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4717.129s">There's</a>  a lot going on in these number a number of different things, and I just wanted to provide some commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4722.031s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4753.939s">So</a>  we do have the motion from Councilor Knight to invoke rule <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4757.973s">20,</a>  it might be 23 now, or?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4760.975s">Madam</a>  President, may I just share like a clerical item? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4763.838s">I</a>  would just like the council to know that in two weeks at your next meeting, I will actually be either on an airplane, depending on the timing, or have just landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4771.984s">So</a>  if there's anything that people would like me to address this evening I'm here, I might be able to join via Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5729.991s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5732.893s">This</a>  is something that keeps coming every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5737.035s">Before</a>  they took these polls down, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5741.52s">We</a>  spent money to install the poles, to buy the poles, to put meat and the meat heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5746.705s">How</a>  much money do we spend on this for meat heads that we probably didn't need and installations of things that we didn't need, which is really disturbing to me that we even went that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5758.517s">But</a>  now if you go down, we have meters on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5764.298s">which</a>  is a residential street, far away from the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5769.882s">Bad</a>  enough, I've been getting calls from people that go to the library saying that they now have to pay meters to go to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5778.709s">Boynton</a>  Road is where parents pick up children from school, people go to church on Sundays and Saturdays and they go to things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5786.454s">No</a>  need to have meters on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5789.217s">Why</a>  don't we have meters on Forest Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5791.599s">Why</a>  don't we have meters on Governor's Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5793.641s">These</a>  are business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5795.302s">Boynton</a>  Road is not a business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5798.706s">Those</a>  should be taken out immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5800.167s">Again,</a>  poor planning on our parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5803.89s">And</a>  my one last thing is, I don't know if people are seeing these, our parking department is giving out paper visitor passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5811.612s">that</a>  you write your own address on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5813.814s">So</a>  all you gotta do is go to your local copy store and make a copy of the visitor pass, and you can have 10 for whatever house you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5824.361s">Why</a>  aren't the visitor passes being limited to per household with a number and with an address issued by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5832.327s">Not</a>  just say, here, go fill this out yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5835.309s">Again,</a>  a department out of control, we've asked for them to take a step back and figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5841.56s">where</a>  we're going with this department, mistake after mistake after mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5845.423s">It's</a>  not fair to these people, the people in this community that we're going through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5849.326s">And</a>  like I said, now we're putting meters in residential streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5854.13s">Shame</a>  on us.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5854.53s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5857.692s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5859.293s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5861.599s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5862.419s">I</a>  just want to note for the record, the parking department is not self-governing any more than any other department in our city, in my view, not any more than the assessor's office, the DPW, or any other department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5875.706s">They've</a>  been under a lot of fire since they were established. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5879.328s">And</a>  I'm glad that we're flagging resident concerns and that we're making sure that residents are being righted and made whole where appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5886.78s">But</a>  I just want to make the point that no department is an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5889.642s">The</a>  administration is responsible for creating the conditions for the parking department's success, same as any other department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5899.11s">These</a>  projects are being done at the administration's behest, and so I want to make sure that the administration is being held accountable for these issues that are affecting resident quality of life, and not just the people carrying them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5911.5s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5912.281s">Hey,</a>  Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5913.021s">And</a>  to that point, I did reach out to the mayor asking about the ones in front of the library specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5917.202s">And</a>  she said she asked them to remove the last time I drove by they were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5921.584s">I'm</a>  not sure why. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5922.524s">Yeah,</a>  and I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5924.184s">I</a>  mean, to Councilor Collins point why it's a surprise to the mayor that these things that one would assume she's shy and signed off on are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5931.066s">So</a>  it's very confusing.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5935.427s">Thank</a>  God this council's on top of this, because they'd be in front of the churches right now.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5940.869s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5942.788s">just</a>  to your point, President Morell, that it's kind of, I don't think city government should work on a whim, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5950.774s">It</a>  shouldn't be, oh, yeah, I'll get them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5953.696s">It's</a>  just like, there should be a plan and the plan should be implemented and it should be reviewed and approved and corrected before it's, that's, I can't believe it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5963.544s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5964.504s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Barros. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5965.905s">Did</a>  you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5971.057s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5972.438s">Yes,</a>  my name is Rita Bartolomeo I live at 135 High Street across from St. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5976.781s">Joseph</a>  school, and my house is one of the houses that were targeted with the meter in front of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5981.944s">And</a>  I think it's really unfair and no citizen no taxpayer homeowner should have to have a meter in front of their house, you know, we pay our taxes and now we have to pay a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5992.871s">I'm</a>  very grateful to Councilman Caraviello that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5995.992s">The</a>  issue got addressed and the meter is no longer in my in front of my house, however, you know, I know that we had tabled it from the last meeting to this meeting, and within a few days, the meters were being installed on Boynton Road and the heads were being put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6013.493s">And,</a>  you know, I've lived at my house for 38 years I see the parents coming and going dropping their kids off to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6020.457s">There's</a>  meters there's meters there in the afternoon to pick them up their social events at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6024.679s">Joseph's</a>  during the week it's it's, it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6028.521s">I</a>  get it, you know, the city needs money in the business zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6032.458s">But</a>  there aren't any meters as Mr. Caraviello said on hillside governors forest waiting is the only street that has the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6043.33s">And</a>  for me personally, when there is when the snow comes and we can't park and there's a parking man on high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6052.179s">I'm</a>  a corner house we have to park on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6055.488s">And</a>  if there's meters there and you don't have your, your car shoveled out and out by a certain time, are we going to get ticketed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6061.789s">Cause</a>  our cars are there bad enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6063.309s">Sometimes</a>  they told them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6065.11s">So</a>  it's sort of a, a double issue here that, you know, Boynton road is targeted, I think, you know, for the library and looking for extra funds for the city, but it's, it's just not a place we want people to come and enjoy the brand new library. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6079.392s">And</a>  now we're asking for them to, to pay, to, to come there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6084.12s">And</a>  there again you know when we do have the snow we can pop on the main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6088.184s">There's</a>  a lot of cars that need to get off that main street and waiting is one of the streets that we go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6094.39s">So,</a>  again, I'm thankful that the meter is gone in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6098.094s">I</a>  hope I don't wake up one day and find it there again. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6100.396s">I</a>  want to thank the council for addressing it and I hope we can resolve the meter situation.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6108.325s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. McFarland. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6109.346s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6109.886s">Madam</a>  President, so my question is, I would like an answer on the cost of installing these and not installing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6116.71s">How</a>  much money are we wasting on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6119.051s">When</a>  all this could have been done with just maybe a little thought and planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6123.854s">Again,</a>  this program has been given the bum's rush to get it up and out without any thought.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6131.538s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6132.839s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6138.842s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6141.504s">22-546</a>  offered by Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council support question four on the November ballot to preserve the Work and Family Mobility Act, which would allow all qualified residents to apply for a state driver's license regardless of immigration status and improve road safety outcomes for all communities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6157.757s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6159.359s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6161.721s">So</a>  this is a ballot question that all voters get to vote on on the November ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6167.88s">It</a>  would uphold the Work and Family Mobility Act, which passed the legislature this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6172.422s">It</a>  would ensure that all drivers who can present proof of residency and pass a road test can get a driver's license. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6178.104s">This</a>  ensures that all drivers are tested and licensed and insured, which it's demonstrated to make the road safer for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6185.527s">This</a>  bill is also supported by a coalition of law enforcement professionals because it is demonstrated to reduce hit and run accidents by as much as 10% in the states where it's implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6195.836s">This</a>  is why I'm putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6198.439s">I</a>  believe that the passage of this ballot question would materially benefit people of Medford by making our roads safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6204.804s">That's</a>  why I've been personally urging Medford voters to consider voting yes on four, and that's why I'm asking for my fellow councilors' consideration in endorsing this ballot question to make our roads safer for all vehicular drivers and pedestrians in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6218.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6219.433s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6220.134s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6221.154s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6222.555s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, for inviting me to co-sponsor this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6228.539s">I</a>  think you've really hit the heart of what's at stake here, which is public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6234.028s">And,</a>  you know, our job as elected representatives of the city and it's a major branch of our city is to be the stewards of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6243.936s">And,</a>  you know, when I'm on the road, I would, I would want all the drivers on the road to be tested insured and licensed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6252.67s">And</a>  I think that's, that's common sense, not just to prevent traffic accidents and to prevent situations where we might be driving on the road with people who aren't tested licensed or insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6267.342s">God</a>  forbid, if God forbid something were to happen, we want that trust with our police to be there as well, so that we prevent hit and runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6276.41s">And</a>  I think for that reason, as you've stated, a number of law enforcement officials across the state, including our chief police have endorsed and have supported question four, as we've put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6289.982s">And</a>  this is also supported by relevant <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6294.465s">by</a>  our relevant delegation in the state government as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6299.887s">So</a>  again, I thank you for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6302.347s">I</a>  think because this was added last minute onto the list of questions, a lot of voters don't know about this question yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6312.29s">And</a>  I think that's a big reason why it's important to, at the very least, put this on the agenda so more people are aware that you can flip your ballot initiative <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6321.872s">ballot</a>  and make sure that you answer questions three and four. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6325.333s">And</a>  if you live in Paul Donato, or I believe it's Paul Donato or Rep Barber's districts, there are two more questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6335.075s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6336.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6336.915s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6339.236s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6341.416s">Not</a>  that I don't support the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6344.437s">I</a>  don't think it's the city council's preview to be telling people how to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6350.258s">I</a>  do say in principle, I do support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6352.319s">I</a>  just don't think it's our job to be telling people how to vote.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6356.242s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6357.883s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6360.505s">Councilor</a>  Collins, Councilor Tseng, if I could just request the language be tweaked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6366.289s">Right</a>  now it says, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council support question four. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6369.711s">I</a>  would just, my suggestion would say express support of, just so it's not commanding anything it's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6379.152s">otherwise.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6380.153s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6386.676s">Would</a>  you like to make the amendment?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6390.798s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Medford City Council express support of question four, dot, dot, dot.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6515.228s">We're</a>  in a situation here in this community that's bordering on what I'd find to be a financial crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6521.652s">You</a>  know, when we talk about spending, we talk about the sharing of information, and more importantly, we talk about that letter that we received from the administration, October 25th at 1.40 p.m., which was today at 1.40 after several months of making requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6539.021s">I</a>  think it's very troubling and scary that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6542.556s">The</a>  city has a backlog of reconciliation reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6546.98s">They</a>  haven't been audited. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6548.901s">They're</a>  utilizing incomplete data. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6551.844s">And</a>  they cannot say that they have accurately designed reports for financial reporting here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6559.13s">And</a>  that's coming right from our CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6560.931s">That's</a>  troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6562.033s">That's</a>  very troubling, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6563.493s">So</a>  the administration is spending and spending and spending, but I see no efforts being made to right the ship, especially with this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6571.776s">And</a>  this body has extended multiple olive branches for a period of 36 months, trying to get to the bottom of this stuff and be a partner and we're not being brought to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6581.359s">Um,</a>  so, you know, as I stated a couple of weeks ago, when we talk about the financial health in this community, let's be real about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6587.421s">Um,</a>  we had no treasurer collector from, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6590.318s">January</a>  of 2020 to October 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6592.94s">We've</a>  had no budget director from July of 2020 to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6598.263s">We've</a>  had no CFO from September of 2021 to March of 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6601.244s">We've</a>  had <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6604.648s">no</a>  federal fund manager from 321 to 222. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6608.469s">And</a>  we've had no assessor from 522 to the present. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6613.031s">So</a>  when we sit down and we talk about our financial health in this community, we don't even have a finance team in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6619.754s">We</a>  haven't had a finance team in place, but we're still being asked to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6624.616s">And</a>  when we ask for the information that we need to make informed decisions, we're not being provided it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6628.669s">which</a>  leads me to believe that they have something to hide. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6631.93s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello has asked at least 30 times, how much money are we spending on outside legal counsel? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6638.192s">The</a>  administration spent something ridiculous like $65,000 to follow around an employee and put GPS on his car to get a report that comes back absolutely unfounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6649.415s">And</a>  the investigation starts off, I heard a rumor about a guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6653.516s">I</a>  mean, that's what we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6654.496s">We're</a>  spending $80,000 in taxpayer money to chase down rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6658.403s">Come</a>  on, let's get real. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6660.684s">So</a>  when I look at the circumstances in this community and what's going on, we need to stop the bleeding somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6666.907s">And</a>  I think that this is the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6669.769s">So</a>  I'd ask that we put a spending moratorium on until such time as we get our quarterly report from our financial director. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6676.872s">We</a>  get brought up to speed as to what's really going on in that finance office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6681.114s">The</a>  numbers don't add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6682.495s">If</a>  the numbers don't add up, we can't just keep on spending and spending and spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6688.598s">making</a>  assumptions off of inaccurate data and inaccurate estimations, how are we ever going to put the city in a position to succeed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6697.762s">You</a>  know, we have no tax assessors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6699.163s">We</a>  have nobody to levy taxes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6701.444s">We</a>  finally have a treasurer collective out this whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6703.865s">But</a>  for the first 10 months of the administration, we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6706.186s">We</a>  had some of those working part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6707.867s">Rumor</a>  has it the calls were getting wired to a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6709.788s">They</a>  weren't even coming in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6711.889s">We</a>  have people that are getting paid now outside the budget in acting positions that are also working in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6718.265s">All</a>  right, their vested interest and their loyalties don't lie here in the city of Medford any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6722.148s">All</a>  right, they're being paid for the city to comply with statute, not for any other reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6728.793s">All</a>  right, so we need to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6731.215s">And</a>  this is my next best solution that I could come up with based upon the plethora of resolutions that we filed, the number of questions that we've asked, the number of promises that have been made, but not fulfilled through the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6743.684s">We</a>  still don't have a city assistant city solicitor for the council and the position hasn't been posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6748.403s">So</a>  with that being said, I offer the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6751.505s">I</a>  don't anticipate it passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6752.966s">I</a>  don't want to hold the city financially hostage. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6755.388s">If</a>  good things are going to happen in this community, they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6758.37s">They</a>  should. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6759.151s">But</a>  at the same time, you can't ask us to keep spending money without telling us what the financial picture is, what our financial health and wellness is in this community.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6767.978s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6768.678s">Vice</a>  President Paris.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6796.264s">out</a>  there as my suggestion, I would propose a B paper to request that the finance director so part of the email that we sent us that the finance director feels like he could present a first quarter report in mid November, and that place warrant articles on the on the city council for based on the formal acceptance on a monthly basis based subject to their formal acceptance by the council their certification by the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6816.476s">So</a>  I would be paid propose a B paper to request that the finance director <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6821.577s">attend</a>  our November 22nd meeting to present a first quarter financial report and revenue comparison with prior fiscal year and revenue forecasting for fiscal year 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6838.08s">and</a>  further request that the finance director take whatever steps are necessary to place Warren articles on the council agenda for formal approval on a monthly basis beginning in November.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6853.964s">And</a>  if I could just add to that paper that the city council request the administration prepare an RFI for the city council to review relative to the hiring of an independent outside auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6871.088s">Council</a>  like would you mind repeating your men, please, the city administration produce an RFR an RF an RFR an RFP for the city council to review relative to the selection and hiring of an outside independent auditor.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6891.94s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6893.181s">Council,</a>  I think that was something I asked for months ago, but the outside independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6901.069s">We</a>  just asked the guy to do the finance to give us reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6905.351s">He's</a>  saying in his paper that he can't do reports because he doesn't have the staff and he doesn't, I say, just reading his letter here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6914.514s">He's</a>  got a backlog and how much more do we want this guy to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6919.616s">He</a>  has no assistant working with him either now.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6923.077s">He's</a>  on the line for a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6924.177s">Let's</a>  get him down here.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6926.476s">say</a>  he's saying he can't get okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6928.937s">He's</a>  saying that he doesn't have the staff or the time to give reports because he's overwhelmed on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6934.66s">And</a>  now we're asking him to do something that he's saying that he probably can't do.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6941.703s">Councilor</a>  Collins, I'm back to Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6944.584s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6945.705s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6949.367s">You</a>  know, I think we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6951.725s">I</a>  don't know if this counts as outside of the box, but we need to think outside the box about how to resolve heretofore intractable problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6958.831s">I</a>  think it's been frustrating for all of us to keep putting out requests for updates and requests that are simply germane to our responsibilities as councillors and not hear back and be kept in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6967.718s">And</a>  that affects our ability to be accountable to the people who put us in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6971.02s">And</a>  I think that that's something we all share. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6973.102s">I'm</a>  also not against drawing a line in the sand to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6977.827s">you</a>  know, continue to demonstrate to the administration that we are serious about being armed with the information that we need to forecast for this community's future and make responsible decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6991.097s">You</a>  know, I think sort of where my personal limits bump against that, I've demonstrated in some of my votes in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6999.564s">However,</a>  I think I'm willing to support this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7006.935s">was</a>  the one other thing I was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7009.097s">Second</a>  time tonight I've done that long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7012.441s">Oh,</a>  in terms of what we're asking for from the finance department, I just think that it needs to be emphasized, you know, that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7026.183s">It's</a>  not necessarily our best move to try to decrease what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7030.87s">We're</a>  asking for reasonable things from the administration because of lapses in staff capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7036.579s">It's</a>  our responsibility to ask for the policies that we know are in service of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7041.305s">And</a>  sometimes, I mean, we see it all throughout the community every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7044.887s">Those</a>  are not going to be enforced or implemented on the timetable that we'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7048.189s">That</a>  is a feature of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7050.931s">But</a>  that doesn't mean that we should not ask for and legislate for and advocate for the policies that our community deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7059.856s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7060.976s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7061.737s">Vice</a>  President Paris.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7062.877s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7063.858s">Councilor</a>  Collins said it incredibly well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7068.893s">I</a>  read this email, it says preliminary first quarter reports can be provided by mid-November. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7072.475s">This</a>  office can also provide revenue comparisons with the prior fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7075.817s">Warrant</a>  articles pertaining to city funds can be provided on a monthly basis subject to their formal acceptance by the council and certification by the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7082.501s">I</a>  say we take the guy up on his offer.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7085.883s">Right,</a>  well, I wouldn't mind going back to it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7091.826s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7098.32s">Well,</a>  I'm just saying that if he, if we want to go back to a regular system where we actually are voting, like this seems like the fiscal compliance that we would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7107.149s">So</a>  let's take them up on their offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7108.75s">If</a>  they can't meet it, then we pass the first resolution.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7112.173s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7120.447s">not</a>  get all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7121.627s">Um,</a>  I was gonna go back to the tape for some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7124.268s">But</a>  the B paper from Vice President Bears was a request that the finance director attend the November 22nd meeting to present the first quarter financial report and to take whatever steps necessary to place the warrant articles on the agenda for monthly approval on the, uh, on the 1st November meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7143.111s">But</a>  then there were there were some other actions take to be taken in the middle of that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7147.992s">just</a>  after first quarter financial report, um, at revenue comparison with prior fiscal year and revenue forecasting for fiscal year 2024.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7159.038s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7162.219s">And</a>  then there was a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7163.38s">Uh,</a>  there was a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7166.221s">Uh,</a>  well, that was your B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7168.142s">And</a>  then and then Council night had to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7170.544s">Yeah,</a>  Council night had a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7172.384s">Had</a>  it had a amendment to the B paper asking for the R five for the event of our otter are fire are far.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7181.879s">Is</a>  that address your questions, Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7184.24s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council at this time?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7189.202s">I</a>  appreciate the- I would welcome that because I would be, I'd be reluctant to vote for it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7206.408s">I</a>  know my tenure on the council is shorter than some, but I've been on it long enough to know that sometimes voting in absolutes <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7212.013s">absolutely</a>  comes back to bite you, and I would be reluctant to vote for something so broad, although I do appreciate the intent of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7218.857s">So</a>  we have a- So on the motion of Councilor Naito to sever the two papers and lay the A paper on the table for a time of 30 days as seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7233.586s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7234.286s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7235.066s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7235.887s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7236.687s">And</a>  then taking the B- <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7240.713s">Councilor</a>  Knight to move approval on the paper seconded by vice president bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7245.575s">Everyone</a>  feels comfortable with the language of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7255.819s">22-548</a>  offered by vice president bears be it so resolved by the Medford city council that the city council encourages residents to attend the November 2 bus network redesign meeting where the MBTA will be presenting its revised map of bus changes for Medford and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7269.168s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the city administration notify residents of the meeting particularly residents who communicated with the city or submitted comments regarding the bus network redesign using all available means. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7279.454s">Event</a>  information can be found at mbta.com slash events slash 2022-11 dash 02 slash public dash meetings dash bus dash network dash redesign dash virtual you love to make me read a URL. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7293.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7294.069s">Makes</a>  the whole meeting work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7300.476s">No,</a>  but thank you, Madam President, for reading that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7305.182s">We've</a>  had a lot of conversation about the proposed bus network redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7310.389s">I</a>  can first say that I believe that Medford Hillside was the number one neighborhood in the entire MBTA catchment area in terms of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7318.935s">So</a>  for the anger and frustration of residents who are deeply opposed to changes, that is good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7325.08s">I've</a>  also, I haven't seen a draft map. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7327.742s">I</a>  have not seen any draft routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7329.783s">I</a>  have heard rumblings that there will be improvements to the Medford map, which I think is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7336.528s">But</a>  it's definitely important that residents continue to stay actively engaged with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7340.87s">So</a>  please attend the November 2nd bus network redesign meeting via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7346.373s">And</a>  again, this does ask the city administration to notify residents about that meeting and especially communicate with all of the residents who submitted their contact information or comments or however else they communicated their issue to the city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7359.318s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7360.078s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7360.739s">And</a>  I do want to note that we did have residents that in Hillside that</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7364.125s">kind</a>  of the pavement to get comments from their neighbors so I just want to note that cancer say, um, I think President, President Raul really covered that point, I was I was just going to note that it is very substantial that medical side popped the top to the comment list. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7383.049s">Again,</a>  I haven't seen anything but I've heard rumblings that there might be positive changes and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7389.131s">If</a>  we do see those changes come about, it'll be because of the hard work of residents in our city and the hard work of our members of our city government, including my fellow colleagues for indulging in meetings about the bus network redesign as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7407.344s">So</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7408.085s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7409.806s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7411.207s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7415.965s">Councilor</a>  Tseng all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7417.086s">All</a>  those opposed motion passes to do dash 549 offered by by Susan bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7421.991s">It's</a>  a result by the Metro City Council that the city administration updates policies and procedures regarding see click fix to ensure that items requiring the input of or decision by the traffic commission are properly referred to that body for their response and review by Susan affairs.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7436.986s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7440.846s">There</a>  have been a number of issues regarding see quick fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7442.786s">I</a>  don't have to get into, but one of them has been that items that require the input of the traffic commission may not be being properly referred to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7452.788s">So</a>  people asking for signage or asking about specific conditions on a public way that needs to be updated or addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7460.05s">They</a>  may be going to the police department or to DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7463.11s">They</a>  really should be going to the traffic commission as it's in the traffic commission's jurisdiction to make those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7468.719s">It's</a>  basically a question of how they get marked as resolved on C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7473.781s">They're</a>  not getting marked as resolved and referred to traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7477.422s">They're</a>  just not really, they're just being marked as resolved or referred to a city department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7482.104s">And</a>  those departments don't actually have the final authority on those items. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7484.925s">So</a>  it's just a request that the city administration update how they're referring items using C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7491.347s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7492.367s">Thank</a>  you Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7493.307s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7495.343s">On</a>  the motion, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7498.528s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7499.189s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7499.689s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7500.451s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7501.932s">22-550</a>  offered by Councilor Collins, the it's so resolved the Medford City Council remind residents of the statewide ban on mattress disposal going into effect on November 1 resources for recycling or donating mattresses and box prints can be found at mass.gov slash service dash details, slash mattress dash recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7521.803s">Councilor</a>  Collins, sorry for the tongue twister.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7526.686s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that residents heard about this prior to November 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7531.229s">This</a>  is a statewide ban going into effect because the majority of mattress or box spring materials are recyclable, which is why they are now required to be recycled and divert them from landfills. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7542.618s">I</a>  also saw this update from the city just a couple days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7547.642s">A</a>  company called Hand Up is now offering mattress and box spring pickup in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7553.567s">So</a>  residents can schedule a pickup by going to handupmattress.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7559.773s">There</a>  is a charge for the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7563.076s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7682.449s">Councilor</a>  say, thank you, President Merle, this is a question that a lot of residents in our community have been asking, especially with the opening of the Green Line extension coming upon us very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7695.618s">more</a>  choices in terms of how to get to work in Cambridge Somerville in Boston, or just to travel to our neighboring municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7703.242s">Currently,</a>  there is a plan for the Somerville community bike path will open alongside the <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7712.306s">a</a>  green line extension to moon square station and a lot of residents have been wondering more specifically about how we might be able to as a city connected that the office of planning development and sustainability and engineering department have been so gracious to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7727.537s">give</a>  me a pretty thorough response about their plans so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7732.32s">On</a>  this specific point about working to extend the GLX community path, there are no plans so far and part of the problem is that the right-of-way in between adjacent private properties on either side of the railway looks significantly narrower in the Medford section than in the Somerville section, which doesn't mean it's impossible to do but just means it's quite difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7754.613s">However,</a>  our city is <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7757.585s">taking</a>  a look at connecting to this community path via on-street bike facilities, and they'll put this in the new citywide bike plan that's coming out soon, or when they're ready, and they're going to suggest placing these bike facilities along that path, with one example being around Medford Street and Dexter Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7782.063s">Another</a>  possibility for our city connecting to the community path is via an off-street path between the Mystic River Greenways and the GLX community path extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7793.631s">This</a>  would be more towards Assembly Square and then up by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7798.595s">A</a>  feasibility study was actually conducted two years ago, and there's quite a lot of detail for how we would implement this if our city deemed it to be the best path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7810.145s">Now,</a>  generally, residents might also be interested in bike path planning and power cities going about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7819.211s">While</a>  our city is space constrained in many places, our city's approach, and the approach of the planning department and the engineering department so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7829.518s">is</a>  to identify key routes that have the capacity for infrastructure and then to make design recommendations from a short-term perspective, so tackling what we can achieve with minimal changes and minimal resources and a long-term perspective where we look at things that we can build during larger roadway reconstruction projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7851.107s">The</a>  city is also prioritizing continuity between municipalities that's something we've heard in our climate plan meeting, and the comprehensive plan meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7860.998s">And</a>  they're meeting, making special note of on and off street connections to Somerville Arlington Malden, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7867.545s">And</a>  to make sure that we align our plans with their plans as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7870.808s">and</a>  the city is currently in the midst of developing a new bike, a citywide bike plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7878.513s">They</a>  will, when that starts, they'll launch a public outreach process with opportunities to get feedback and get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7885.277s">I</a>  assume at that point, the city council would love to relay feedback and to look at these changes as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7893.582s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7895.143s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7897.844s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng, it's seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7903.103s">Vice</a>  President Bears, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7904.483s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7905.764s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7906.444s">22-553</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the subcommittee on rules and ordinances meet to identify definitions within the code of ordinances for the roles of code enforcement officers and tree warden and report back on what definition exists and what updates need to be made for the tree ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7922.409s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7923.201s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7924.241s">This</a>  comes from a meeting of a subcommittee that we are on, the sustainability subcommittee, where we were looking at the tree protection ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7933.304s">And</a>  there were two sections, one section on defining code enforcement officer and one defining tree warden that were in the ordinance that we thought between <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7945.628s">between</a>  the council, between city staff, and between legal advice we thought would be best to sever, and to let people with more know-how on this issue decide what to do with it, since it was outside our scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7962.232s">And</a>  so the recommendation was that we send this to rules and ordinances and let that committee look at these definitions and decide whether we need to update our city or code of ordinances with them, since there is no definition currently, whether we need that for the tree ordinance and what the best path forward is.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7983.163s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7987.805s">In</a>  order to</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7991.666s">So</a>  the paper, so this is asking specifically about the definitions of two positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7996.109s">So</a>  I think, well, there are definitions that appear in other code enforcement officer appears throughout our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8004.114s">I</a>  mean, we can stay in the committee and we can figure out the definition that we want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8010.847s">It's</a>  just one of those weird things that we go into our code of ordinances, nowhere defined is a code enforcement officer.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8018.353s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8018.593s">And</a>  the advice was that we shouldn't put it under the tree ordinance section of the code of ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8023.957s">That'd</a>  be better placed under. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8025.138s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8030.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8030.863s">Do</a>  we want to refer to legal counsel instead of an actual subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8034.025s">Just</a>  legal counsel definition of these two.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8092.488s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8093.37s">I</a>  think this item is, this resolution is pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8100.243s">This</a>  is a monumental change to policy in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8105.584s">To</a>  have people who have student loan debt be able to apply for this relief really truly does make a difference in a lot of people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8114.865s">The</a>  form is super short. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8116.786s">It</a>  takes at most five minutes to fill out and is a way in which we can help residents and families throughout what might be a more difficult economic time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8130.908s">I</a>  like everything that's along these lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8134.869s">I</a>  think it's important for our city administration to reach out to as many residents as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8141.011s">Again,</a>  a lot bigger picture, we need to work on better ways to communicate with residents, but at the very least, I want as many people to know that you have before December 31st to apply for this and that you can apply in Spanish as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8158.84s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8159.701s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8163.884s">Councilor</a>  Tseng?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8164.604s">One</a>  other note is that it is currently in the court system right now, but it doesn't change the fact that you can apply for it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8173.671s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8175.272s">Vice</a>  President Bears?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8176.553s">Even</a>  Amy Coney Barrett didn't shoot it down, so we might have a chance on this one.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8182.558s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8187.081s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8188.432s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8190.453s">Going</a>  to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8192.595s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8195.596s">Bartholomew,</a>  you're on public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8197.217s">You</a>  spoke earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8197.738s">Would</a>  you like to speak again? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8198.638s">For</a>  public participation, do you want to speak again? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8204.201s">I</a>  know you spoke earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8205.062s">You're</a>  on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8205.943s">You're</a>  good, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8207.023s">I</a>  know we do have residents from Harvard Street here who also wanted to speak about no parking signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8212.787s">So</a>  whoever would like to speak, please come up and just name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8222.723s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8223.523s">Yeah,</a>  so my name is Sean Leonard I'm a resident at 180 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8230.726s">I</a>  just wanted to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8232.546s">I</a>  don't know if this is the right form to bring this up but I just wanted to get clarification on the changes on the parking on Harvard Street I just, I don't, I'm speaking for myself and a couple other residents I don't think I got any notification about a change or why chance being made so I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8250.445s">There</a>  is on the back end, but there seems to be, I've lived there for years, but there's always street parking on one side of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8260.432s">And</a>  there's currently signage up that's saying that's a tow zone now and not parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8264.054s">And</a>  then farther down the street, it's permit only. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8266.656s">It's</a>  never been a permit only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8269.117s">It's</a>  not really a problem for me, but to not have any parking there is, I'm just wondering why that is or if anyone knows.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8279.81s">I</a>  mean, I'm not sure the answer either but I don't know if you're going to say something I was going to say attention to what's going on here all things back and have been a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8288.234s">In</a>  terms of, you know, the media is that they're putting up on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8294.458s">Issues</a>  of tickets on streets that not permit streets and tickets that are going on guys that say they're on one street and they're on another street so <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8301.878s">In</a>  terms of our PACHA program and the application thereof, I don't think we're doing anybody a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8309.605s">As</a>  the program continues to mature and develop, I'm seeing a lot more signage and a lot more meters go up across the community, but I'm not really seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8320.839s">The</a>  data driven methodology as to why they're putting these in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8325.242s">I</a>  know that being common street with the development that's going to occur at Titan Gas Station at some point, the development that's going to occur up at Nathan Electric in the expansion of the Green Line, that area has been under particular scrutiny based upon what's going to happen when the Green Line comes active. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8348.539s">But</a>  in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8351.148s">who</a>  has the overall authority to implement and initiate those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8354.449s">It's</a>  really the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8355.91s">I'm</a>  not here in the city, but I know the city did something, because the end of Albion Street wasn't a mentioned project. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8361.392s">It</a>  was a simple project, but it was invented.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8363.693s">That's</a>  actually in Somerville.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8365.533s">But</a>  the house is invented, but the street right in front of it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8368.815s">Yeah,</a>  it's nuts.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8369.275s">I</a>  looked at the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8370.155s">Because</a>  it's a disaster what they've done over there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8372.216s">At</a>  Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8372.856s">Yeah,</a>  I looked at the map.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8373.997s">It's</a>  actually in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8374.817s">It's</a>  a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8379.173s">So</a>  yeah, that's the best I got for it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8380.894s">Do</a>  we still need to establish?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8387.737s">I</a>  was just gonna add, it is the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8391.319s">The</a>  city adopted a law in like 1958 that all parking, signage, traffic related decisions are made by the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8399.103s">You</a>  can access them through Alva Erickson at the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8402.164s">You</a>  can also go to the director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake, and that information is on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8409.023s">My</a>  guess is it's probably has a lot to do with what counts and I just said it also maybe is this the section of Harvard Street where folks are parking on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8417.025s">Oh</a>  yeah, it may be about that it may be a new update, relative to that, not being a practice that they want to encourage again I don't know, I wasn't at the meeting their minutes you should also be able to get traffic commission minutes to tell you when the decision was made and what the discussion was about.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8436.295s">And</a>  I do have your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8437.396s">I</a>  can reach out to some of those folks tomorrow to see if they're able to just give us a short answer as to the why. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8444.622s">I</a>  have, I think, Ellen, someone emailed on behalf, Ellen emailed on behalf of all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8448.625s">So</a>  I can reach out to, I'll probably reach out to Director Blake and probably Director Hunt as well, who also is on that, just to see if we can get a short answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8457.172s">I'm</a>  sure there's a very long answer too, but if we can get a short answer to you guys.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8466.974s">That</a>  would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8467.835s">Yeah,</a>  I was just, I was just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8470.856s">I</a>  was also worried it was just gonna, I mean, all those people are gonna put cars somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8474.819s">So</a>  where are they gonna go? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8477.16s">Good</a>  mess of the businesses that are on Main Street down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8482.203s">Yeah,</a>  that's also great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8483.404s">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8484.824s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8485.825s">It's</a>  a whole nother thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8486.846s">But</a>  yeah, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8487.646s">If</a>  you have information on that or something you can send us, that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8492.969s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8496.518s">Anyone</a>  else who would like to speak for public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8498.779s">Is</a>  there anyone on Zoom?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8503.58s">I'm</a>  sick of someone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8509.782s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8511.302s">Similar</a>  to him, kind of on the same topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8513.803s">I</a>  guess it was to my knowledge that this was done, kickstarted, I guess, by one person in the condos across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8524.646s">Shocking.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8527.082s">Somehow,</a>  I guess she pulled this whole thing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8529.523s">I</a>  don't know what she said or how she did it, but.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8534.584s">The</a>  council is familiar.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8537.545s">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8539.085s">Oh,</a>  they didn't say.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8539.666s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8540.206s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8541.066s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8542.666s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8559.214s">Yeah,</a>  and that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8561.336s">I</a>  mean, we're gonna have to.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8565.319s">Generally,</a>  just to that point, certainly individuals can kind of start or push for changes to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8576.047s">Something</a>  that is traffic commission policy is that if you could get 50% of the people on your street or on a certain section of your street to sign a petition, they will generally reconsider or at least look at reconsidering <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8589.278s">or</a>  look at making a change, a positive, you know, reconsidering a change they've made or looking at a different change. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8596.041s">Again,</a>  I did bring up the sidewalk thing because it may be a safety thing and it may have been past practice to just let it go. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8603.844s">And</a>  that may have changed, but traffic commission generally, and you'll want to talk to director Blake when Nicole connects, President Morell connects you with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8610.626s">There</a>  is a petitioning process for the traffic commission where they generally will look at things like that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8615.628s">Maybe</a>  we can get like a resident <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8618.715s">permit</a>  only for that whole street.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8621.156s">That</a>  is actually how you get permit parking right now in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8625.457s">50%</a>  of the residents on your street will sign a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8627.257s">I</a>  had to re-register my car, so yeah.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8630.198s">And</a>  if I could just get your name again for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8633.198s">Oh</a>  yeah, Peyton Mitchell, 168 Harwood Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8635.339s">Aiden?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8635.579s">Is</a>  that your first name?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8640.105s">Peyton</a>  like Manning Manning and the last thing Mitchell Mitchell got it like Mitchell as Mitchell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8649.989s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8650.589s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8651.109s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8653.09s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak for public participation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8655.031s">I</a>  saw that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8659.813s">Ellen</a>  Lonsdale 180 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8662.334s">So</a>  when they do they have to give any kind of public comment period? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8666.315s">Or</a>  can they just make these decisions?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8669.69s">no</a>  kind of oversight i do yeah okay gotcha</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8688.964s">I</a>  figured as much, but I think they generally try not to make such impactful decisions in one meeting, but statutorily, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8697.47s">I</a>  don't think there's a statutory requirement for notification.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8700.412s">Obviously</a>  it's affected people, so I think going to that body, the traffic commission, and then you obviously have support that, like Councilor Behr said, is now <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8714.827s">This,</a>  unfortunately, it was done right, embedded, everybody has a voice now, it has to be turned and divide the community and say, hey, now it's us versus you because we weren't notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8728.073s">So,</a>  unfortunately, and I apologize for that, but that's terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8732.315s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8732.515s">I</a>  appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8733.355s">Thank</a>  you, yeah, I'll follow up on that email tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8735.717s">Anyone</a>  else for public participation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8744.389s">do</a>  this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8745.47s">Say</a>  the, Oh no, you're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8746.811s">Are</a>  they going to start what is there like a timeline of when they're gonna start enforcing this since we did work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8752.616s">Yeah,</a>  last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8753.057s">They</a>  haven't yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8753.557s">So</a>  broken on all it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8768.665s">From</a>  what we've been told, enforcement is unpredictable, so plan on it being unpredictable.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8774.912s">And</a>  especially the Yale Street lot in the winter, is that also very strict enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8779.457s">Because</a>  last winter it wasn't.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8781.447s">There</a>  are specific rules for parking in public lots during snow emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8786.888s">Outside</a>  of a snow emergency, I would say that follow the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8790.029s">I</a>  can't.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8790.809s">I</a>  can add that to my questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8792.669s">I'm</a>  just trying to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8794.249s">No,</a>  I hear you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8796.57s">I'll</a>  add that to my questions to Director Blake just so, while we have him.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8801.111s">Best</a>  advice is to follow the rules as posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8806.072s">And</a>  that is a fair point.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8810.037s">Anyone</a>  else public participation either on zoom or in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8816.341s">Seeing</a>  none, I do believe we have hands in the favor of the clerk, which is on me to read so moving on to hands in favor of the clerk under suspension 22-566 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it so resolved the city council discuss the lack of communication dealing with school department issues and concerns Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8834.66s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8835.681s">And</a>  again, I do not want to at any time disrespect our colleagues on the school committee side. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8841.924s">But</a>  I think everybody has watched the news about the horrific attack on that young lady, a sophomore at Medford High School and the phone calls I've been getting and the conversation I've been having with Medford High School students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8864.242s">and</a>  not having the knowledge of what happened or how we can direct our <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8870.137s">young</a>  people for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8872.739s">Uh,</a>  we have kids that we have students that have come to me and said that they're afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8877.122s">I</a>  mean, they're legitimately afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8879.805s">We're</a>  talking about going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8881.226s">I've</a>  I've talked to teachers that have involved in fights that are horrified and frightened to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8888.551s">And</a>  when you see that, it's just another slap in the face and disrespect of this community that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8894.956s">You</a>  have a marine <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8896.773s">recruiter</a>  breaking up a fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8898.794s">And,</a>  uh, which leads to, um, questions we had with the superintendent about security. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8905.437s">They</a>  said they had security from now what I was told, you know, that the questions that is not being communicated correctly, and that's where the communication comes in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8913.28s">I</a>  think that they're more like door monitors and, um, and something has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8921.424s">I</a>  mean, this is <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8923.042s">you</a>  know, not only because I have a child here, but I talked to, I was at a recent school event that when I tell you former students and athletes that I've coached have come up to me and said, coach, we're scared, it's scary up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8938.855s">And</a>  Smithford High School, that's a place to go where you're gonna be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8943.278s">And</a>  not having the understanding of what I could tell them, because in normal cases, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8950.867s">situations</a>  when there is an issue this big. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8953.569s">We're</a>  informed that anybody here was anybody else, maybe I missed it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8958.091s">Did</a>  anybody, I actually I'm still waiting for the mayor to go yell at her superintendent like she yelled at Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8965.603s">because</a>  this issue right here is scary, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8968.885s">This</a>  isn't someone dropped something out of their pocket, it was found in the little theater by a custodian. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8973.107s">This</a>  is a student got assaulted, stalked, assaulted, tracked down, five adults, six adults, seven adults, nine adults, 10 adults watching, no one intervening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8983.314s">I'm</a>  waiting for the mayor to go and treat her superintendent like she treated Roy Belson.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8988.497s">Well,</a>  the situation is, and the resolution is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8993.647s">How</a>  do we find a ground with this communication that when we get the phone calls from parents and students that are asking for assistance and help, where do we direct them to? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9003.635s">Because</a>  they don't feel comfortable in what they're seeing and what paths that have happened so far and who they can reach out to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9014.524s">They</a>  feel alone and they're scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9019.227s">And</a>  if anybody, if you didn't see the video, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9022.037s">I</a>  wish you not look at the video because it's gonna change your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9025.039s">It's</a>  disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9027.66s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9029.481s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9032.363s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9034.384s">You</a>  know, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9037.566s">When</a>  something like this horrific thing happens, there's 14 elected officials in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9045.33s">How</a>  hard is it to notify 14 people <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9050.775s">of</a>  something of this happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9051.996s">So</a>  when we get the phone call, we know how to answer people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9055.378s">We</a>  know how to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9058.839s">I</a>  had to find out from two days later for people on the street asking me about, I'm saying, I don't even know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9064.762s">It's</a>  a shame that I say something of this nature happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9071.19s">Call</a>  us, call us, make a phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9073.151s">There's</a>  not that many people that you have to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9075.212s">Meanwhile,</a>  we get robocalls, we get all this other crap. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9079.275s">For</a>  everything else in the city, if something of this importance happens, none of us know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9083.137s">And</a>  there isn't anything worse than being an elected official and a constituent comes up to you and asks you about it, and you're saying, geez, I have no idea what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9095.164s">I</a>  mean, talk about looking like a fool in front of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9100.1s">That's</a>  probably the worst feeling I get from people when they ask me questions and I have no idea what they're even talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9108.185s">It's</a>  really insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9109.386s">There's</a>  only 14 elected officials in the state, no reason why people that this group and the school committee couldn't have notified us of this happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9119.532s">So</a>  we're informed when people ask us questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9126.169s">How</a>  would you like getting calls from out of state, friends, people you went to high school with, who don't live in the state anymore, that saw this on the national news? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9134.411s">Councilor</a>  Knight is right 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9138.452s">Where's</a>  the mayor screaming at the superintendent the same way when the gun clip happened?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9145.393s">Nobody</a>  got hurt with a gun clip.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9149.494s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9152.075s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9153.884s">I</a>  just, I mean, I'm thinking back to this whole situation where the mayor's at Fox 25 down in front of the school department over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9163.287s">She</a>  called them herself talking about the gun clip, calls for a press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9167.288s">The</a>  school committee comes, they put Roy Belson on the stage in the little theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9171.449s">And</a>  he sat there for four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9173.549s">And</a>  after 40 years of service to the city guard, his head beat it for hours and hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9178.451s">And</a>  the mayor led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9180.211s">The</a>  mayor led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9181.932s">She</a>  was like a raven lunatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9184.087s">getting</a>  up out of the crowd, running up to the microphone, yelling and screaming at people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9188.328s">It</a>  was nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9189.388s">And</a>  now to have something like this happen under her watch and to not hold her own people accountable to the same level and same accord is shameful, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9199.39s">If</a>  I can, Madam President, just I think more importantly, I know that the intent is really to have the understanding that the students are so <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9214.472s">custom</a>  to situations that have happened in the past, whether it was the issue last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9220.536s">And</a>  now what happened with this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9223.318s">I</a>  think they're a little bit lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9227.94s">So</a>  I'd like to know what the what this school administration is going to do to make the rest of the school feel like they're safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9239.307s">You</a>  know, I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9240.835s">I</a>  think that the communication to us, the most important pieces is from the school department to say, you know, this is what's going on, but asking, having an avenue that we can have the kids talk to the guidance councils or, you know, their, you know, teachers they feel comfortable with, because whenever they're, especially when I was on the school committee, the understanding that something big happened, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9271.092s">the</a>  first thing we did is rallied around the students that were impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9275.394s">And</a>  this, for instance, is all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9278.836s">And</a>  I asked if there was assemblies, how were the students notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9285.979s">How</a>  are they feeling safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9290.202s">They</a>  haven't been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9294.348s">from</a>  what I've been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9295.349s">Maybe</a>  it's different, but from what I've been told, they haven't been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9298.751s">So</a>  I think we need to stop listening to our children, listen to our students, because they were frightened. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9308.316s">So</a>  again, I don't wanna be a dead horse, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9312.319s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9314.1s">We</a>  have reached the end of our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9319.243s">It's</a>  under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9322.29s">because</a>  we took it up under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9323.751s">Well,</a>  I mean, what's the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9337.121s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9342.229s">Second</a>  by Vice Mayor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9343.832s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9344.453s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9345.674s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9346.416s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9348.038s">Second</a>  by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9349.781s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9350.542s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9352.765s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9353.346s">Meeting</a>  is adjourned.</p>
