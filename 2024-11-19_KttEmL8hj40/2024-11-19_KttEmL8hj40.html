    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=202.736s">My</a>  name is Owen Wartella, and my address is 34 Electric Avenue in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=210.46s">But</a>  I'm the city engineer, so.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=211.661s">Yeah,</a>  you can also, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=212.681s">In</a>  the future, you can just give your city hall address.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=214.322s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=214.963s">Please</a>  proceed.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=216.303s">So</a>  the conditions that I had were, this is something that I looked at back in July and June in a review, and <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=226.173s">Basically,</a>  the conditions of the road are currently in poor conditions, the sidewalks are in poor conditions, and this grant of location will be placing the new reinstalled main within the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=245.376s">And</a>  they will be replacing the sidewalk in kind afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=252.318s">The</a>  road work, we will probably do a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=257.226s">That's</a>  a permit access fee for work done because we're going to come in afterwards do water main work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=263.072s">So</a>  what we'll do is we'll acquire the money in the fund so then we'll be able to stretch tax dollars a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=272.882s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=273.683s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=274.985s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=275.806s">Just</a>  a question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=278.404s">I</a>  know that some companies have reached out and residents reached out that just wanted to replace their water mains. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=286.291s">And</a>  I know that Councilor Knight brought this forward with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=289.674s">That's</a>  why I'm bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=290.595s">Are</a>  we now having the companies now go curb to curb whenever they open the street?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=304.614s">Yes</a>  and no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=306.496s">There's</a>  an engineering directive number three that was issued in July that gives an outline and we try to work with developers on a case-by-case basis to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=322.733s">do</a>  the resurfacing within the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=324.354s">Now</a>  this is a public utility company, so they kind of follow different rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=331.417s">They</a>  don't necessarily need to repave from curb to curb unless it's a moratorium on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=338.2s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=339.731s">In</a>  their defense, National Grid does always go above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=343.473s">They</a>  usually do a full lane.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=345.555s">I'll</a>  disagree with you there, just for the fact that what I did prior to your arrival, I had asked for a list back at least, I believe, two or three years on openings, approvals for openings, and who did those and who did the paving and did they do, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=367.233s">a</a>  just partial or complete or just a block. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=371.677s">And</a>  it was comical because when I got back, I got list of the addresses for the small businesses in the residential homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=381.906s">So</a>  I use one example, Tufts is one of the biggest companies we use for residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=386.49s">So</a>  you have Tufts paving or construction, whatever it's called, and then it says the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=392.175s">And</a>  then, so you can understand when we wanted that to see if the paving was done to specs of what we were told was gonna be acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=400.899s">But</a>  anything that had to do with our utilities, it was just basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=407.862s">We</a>  didn't know the address, we didn't know, it was actually useless for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=413.265s">And</a>  I think I'll ask that again down the line, because I think I'm gonna call for a special meeting for this for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=420.961s">You</a>  know, personally, on my end, the reason why I brought this up, High Street, at 10 o'clock at night, we had a utility job that the public utility hired an outside company to come in and repave. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=434.174s">Well,</a>  they came in at 10 o'clock at night on a school night and, you know, it was, they said they had permission from the entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=442.241s">So</a>  I think that- Are you on a public way or a private way? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=445.344s">I'm</a>  in a public way.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=446.265s">So</a>  this is something that I'll bring up later, but I just wanted to make sure that- I think moving forward, the engineering directive that I issued should take care of a lot of those issues.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=457.613s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=459.054s">The</a>  answer you gave is just a little alarming that our utilities have gone above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=465.058s">I</a>  believe that's what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=466.539s">I</a>  don't think they've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=467.68s">As</a>  I said, it's a public utility company and they kind of have their own guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=472.083s">I</a>  know, and what I'm saying is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=474.024s">those</a>  guidelines we have to find a way to change them because if you look at our roads a lot of it has to do with i'm not saying it's your fault this is not your fault this is years of of mismanagement of our roadway roadways that you know this is why these questions are coming up from council night that's why we appreciate you being here so thank you understand thank you very much any further questions for the council at this time</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=498.335s">So</a>  just as I understand it, with the approval of this rental location, what's going to happen is we're going to move some water pipes from the street to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=505.558s">We're</a>  going to get a brand new sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=506.879s">The</a>  city is going to go in, replace all the underground infrastructure, and then they're going to resurface the street curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=511.481s">Yes,</a>  and we'll replace the lead lines that are within Walnut Street as well.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=516.864s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=517.324s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, I do need to open that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=519.825s">So</a>  opening up the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=522.066s">Oh,</a>  it already opened up.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=524.267s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=526.753s">or</a>  do I need to, does the motion close it?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=530.875s">Okay,</a>  so on the motion and Councilor Knight, would you like that with the six day public comment period or? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=540.639s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve at the completion of the six day public comment period, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=556.048s">seconded</a>  by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=558.149s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.326s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.446s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.606s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=589.787s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=590.227s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=685.235s">If</a>  I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=686.556s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=688.867s">I</a>  propose a table this motion for the fact that in the past, just so the constituents know that especially people here in the chambers, when we have a question or concerns with legal background, city council usually has a city solicitor or assistant city solicitor that works with us to answer any questions that legally that we need to make sure that wherever we vote, we vote either as for or against that we are doing it <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=719.006s">with</a>  the proper form and not holding the city liable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=724.23s">I'll</a>  give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=725.812s">This</a>  council voted on a gas station to exclude a gas station for BJ's about a year ago, and we didn't have council here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=736.62s">So</a>  the reason for it was illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=739.883s">So</a>  BJ's took us to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=742.92s">and</a>  we were found to be in fault and it would have been a serious, it could have been if our acting solicitor at the time worked with BJ's to make sure that we had some language and understanding what the protocol was. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=759.785s">So</a>  I tabled these, anything that you're gonna see with legal, I'll be honest with the city administration to all my constituents that anything with legal notification <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=771.234s">I</a>  don't feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=772.375s">I'm</a>  not, I don't have a legal background. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=774.637s">I</a>  want to make sure that I cross my T's and dot my I's when it comes to certain entities that we're not putting our decisions on putting a financial burden on our <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=787.843s">committee</a>  or community to fight a legal battle that we're going to lose because we weren't informed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=793.786s">So</a>  that's the reason that I asked because it's, you know, we asked a certain a few questions, one being that if there are 50 to 60 cars that are going to be housed in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=805.673s">Who</a>  is going to, where are they going to be housed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=808.356s">Are</a>  they going to pay excise tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=810.618s">At</a>  least will we get the tax revenue from that excise tax? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=815.062s">I</a>  believe the answer was that we will from Lyft. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=818.345s">I</a>  just want to make sure from our legal team, I wanted to ask that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=821.748s">There's</a>  some other questions, but I know that there was KP Law was supposed to be, is supposed to be here online tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=830.405s">I'd</a>  like to just, we can ask them some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=832.426s">I</a>  think that making sure that, you know, opening this up, I want to get some examples in the city that where this is similar to, so we can all understand on its basis, what it entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=847.135s">So</a>  we don't put ourselves by allowing this and then later opening up an issue that because of past practice, we might be doing something that's going to harm our community later. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=860.787s">If</a>  that's the question for our legal representation here.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=866.848s">We</a>  do have Attorney Jeffrey Blake from KP Law on the call right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=871.77s">Would</a>  any Councilors like to speak or ask questions before we hear from Attorney Blake?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=880.251s">I</a>  was chairing last week, so I don't know if I <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=883.271s">made</a>  my view on this clear, but to be quite frank, I think that the business model here is incredibly exploitative and not the kind of business we should be encouraging here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=893.561s">So</a>  I'm not supportive of this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=895.703s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=897.365s">Thank</a>  you, President Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=898.185s">So</a>  Attorney Blake, sorry, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=902.372s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell and thank you Attorney Blake for being here, my, and perhaps we'll get to this in your presentation but my concerns are similar to what Vice President Bears just expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=913.642s">And</a>  in the light of the example of BJS last year that Councilor Scarpelli alluded to I'm curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=922.808s">Are</a>  there, with this type of permit application, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons for denial that we need to know about before we take this vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=931.172s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=931.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=932.432s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=934.473s">Attorney</a>  Blake, I do believe that's the main question before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=936.574s">If</a>  there, as the special permit granting authority for this, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons which the council may vote or individual Councilors may vote or the council may vote to deny the permit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=947.939s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=949.299s">And</a>  thank you everyone for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=951.177s">My</a>  name is Jeff Blake, I'm with KP Law and I have reviewed your zoning ordinances and zoning ordinances are land use ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=961.504s">So</a>  typically they are not, they don't allow you to go beyond the normal land use objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=971.35s">You</a>  have in your ordinances, a criteria for special permits that are granted in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=979.215s">The</a>  special permit granting authority <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=981.334s">you</a>  unless specified herein, otherwise herein only upon its written determination that the adverse effects of the proposed use will not weigh its beneficial impact to the city or neighborhood in view of the particular characteristics of the site and the proposal in relationship to that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1004.549s">The</a>  determination shall include consideration of the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1009.715s">social,</a>  economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1015.158s">And</a>  I suggest that these have to have a land use type. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1018.701s">Traffic</a>  flow and safety, including parking and loading, the adequacy of utilities and other public services, compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood to the extent that this is actually a <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1037.815s">consideration</a>  with the current application before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1041.378s">Impacts</a>  on the natural environment and the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1050.884s">So</a>  those are the criteria that that are outlined in your zoning ordinance and those are the permissible areas that you are allowed to number one <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1067.32s">in</a>  denying and or linking with conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1073.544s">So</a>  to answer your question, the earlier question I think was, or a comment was, I don't like the business model. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1083.55s">I</a>  don't know that that has a sufficient tie to land use or use of the land such that it would be an <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1096.038s">it</a>  would allow you the ability to deny the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1100.481s">Now,</a>  I think you're probably saying, well, you just gave me criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1105.664s">Number</a>  one is talks about social, economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1111.427s">I</a>  suggest that that would be more toward looking at the particular use wherein a situation where you might want to grant a special permit <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1123.4s">for</a>  a use that has a particularly admirable, I keep going between screens, community need or economic or social need, rather than a objection to a possible business model.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1146.049s">So</a>  just to understand, and I think this is where it came up in BJ, so we would have to, if it were to be a vote to denial, we would have to cite a specific reason and that we as a body would have to agree upon that specific reason?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1159.197s">You</a>  would, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1161.218s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1162.599s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1163.26s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1164.981s">And</a>  this is, like I said, this is our concern as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1168.783s">In</a>  the past, I appreciate the council from KP Law coming in and stating our ordinance that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1176.025s">We</a>  read also what our city solicitor used to do is work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1182.325s">and</a>  help us understand past practice, what we've done with past businesses and how that negatively affected our community with our decision or the impact on how we can present it that is legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1198.952s">So</a>  again, I tabled it for the fact that we don't have a city solicitor that's working with us because I asked what I really wanted to know is to give us some examples that we as a council can, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1212.253s">can</a>  see tangible comparisons that we've done in the past that have both helped and then crippled us in a sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1221.921s">So</a>  when you look at this situation, I personally have a concern with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1227.305s">You're</a>  talking about 50, 60 cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1229.106s">If</a>  anybody's in that area, I know what the comment was from the company that we spoke with last week that said, oh no, they won't use the satellite program next to <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1242.237s">in</a>  the Fellsway Plaza, they're going to park over at a parking lot in a parking garage across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1251.223s">I</a>  don't know what the proper answer is and what the safe answer is as a city councilor that doesn't have a background in legal jargon. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1261.81s">So</a>  again, I can't vote for this or support it for the fact that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1271.041s">leaving</a>  it to table, not to the fact that right now I don't have an answer for it, whether it's a yes or no for this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1283.987s">I</a>  don't have an answer because I don't have any support from a city solicitor that I have in the past worked with to help me make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1294.272s">So</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1296.713s">I</a>  hope I'm making sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1300.931s">I</a>  don't know where I'm going to go I'd like to hear from my fellow Councilors before we make some motions, but I appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1308.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1309.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1310.885s">Thank</a>  you President real I want to check my understanding here it sounds like from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1316.675s">description</a>  from Attorney Blake that per our zoning ordinance, we can make special exceptions for non-conforming land uses in the case of an exceptional community benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1329.501s">But</a>  it sounds like the interpretation is in a case such as this, we can't deny a technically conforming land use for a reason that doesn't fit within those bullet points that you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1343.727s">And</a>  I just wanna first check that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1346.814s">My</a>  understanding is correct there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1350.816s">This</a>  is attorney Blake again. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1352.518s">Your</a>  understanding is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1354.058s">And</a>  the bullet points are the criteria by which you can judge a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1359.882s">I</a>  mean, permits land use or otherwise class two licenses to the extent that we'll take those up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1366.686s">You'll</a>  also hear that there are criteria for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1369.428s">I</a>  mean, an applicant needs to be able to come in and understand the criteria that they have to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1374.631s">So</a>  to answer your question, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1376.666s">Those</a>  are the criteria that the council will have to identify an issue with the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1386.592s">And</a>  if they identify an issue that can't be conditioned, then they can deny the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1392.555s">With</a>  respect to the earlier speaker, the Councilor who talked about having a, I think the issue was whether or not we could require them to park the cars <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1406.119s">in</a>  a parking garage across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1408.102s">That</a>  can certainly be a condition of any special permit.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1411.266s">Does</a>  that answer your question, Councilor Collins?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1417.715s">It</a>  does, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1420.138s">Any</a>  further questions from the Council at this time?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1423.27s">I</a>  just like to point out, this is an existing business in the community already. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1427.875s">All</a>  right, they have about 50-60 employees here in this community that contribute to the circular flow of our local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1435.722s">The</a>  proposed use, in my opinion, is less detrimental than the current use. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1439.426s">I</a>  don't think that it really makes a big difference in terms of the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1443.289s">in</a>  traffic or safety in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1445.491s">And</a>  that's supported through the statements of our chief of police and our chief of fire in the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1452.116s">So</a>  when I look at this proposal that's before us, I see a business here that exists in our community, that's looking to expand in our community and invest in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1459.822s">And</a>  I think we should make it easy for them, not hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1462.224s">So</a>  I will support this paper in the statement.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1464.966s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1466.247s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1467.982s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Attorney Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1470.362s">So</a>  social economic benefits, or so only if there's an exceptional benefit, can we make an exception, not if we believe there's an exceptional cost?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1484.405s">The</a>  determination shall include consideration of each of the following, the social economic or community needs that are served by the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1493.567s">So</a>  yes, in my reading of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1496.883s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1501.206s">Okay,</a>  and just from your reading of it on other points, I mean, it's not past it, so I assume we can't use it as justification now, but our comprehensive plan, I believe, has items in it that advocate for an increase in the number of good paying jobs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1519.78s">If</a>  the council were to believe that these jobs were not good paying jobs, would that be a justification for the denial of a special permit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1527.05s">It</a>  could certainly be a basis, the proposals compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1533.922s">That</a>  is a criteria for which you can judge the application.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1539.996s">Thank</a>  you, and then just last, I believe you mentioned environmental concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1545.18s">This</a>  lot is in proximity to a wetland, and it would also mean an increase in the number of vehicles and particulate emissions in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1552.425s">Would</a>  that be under the environmental section a justification for denial?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1557.569s">In</a>  my opinion, it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1560.13s">Obviously,</a>  you would have to have, yes, in my opinion, it would be.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1565.094s">Okay,</a>  well, then I have a few reasons to deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1567.716s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1570.391s">Could</a>  one argue that this is a ride share program and ride shares are designed to take cars off the street and therefore they have an environmental impact that's positive.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1578.697s">I'm</a>  not sure they execute what they're designed to do.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1583.74s">Again,</a>  if I wanted or not, these are great questions debate, sitting with a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1594.998s">no</a>  offense to Attorney Blake, but this is what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1598.899s">We're</a>  having an open debate about something that we should be talking about with our solicitor, making sure we get the questions answered correctly for the councils that have the opportunity to sit with former city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1612.402s">I</a>  do not forget what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1613.922s">This</a>  is what I implore you to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1617.123s">This</a>  is not about <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1619.747s">you</a>  know, whether I want to hinder a business to prosper in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1626.095s">We</a>  definitely have questions, and I appreciate Attorney Blake coming and answering questions, but the questions are our ordinance that we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1637.986s">Okay,</a>  so this isn't a strategy to understand for or against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1644.351s">It's</a>  where we could understand with a city solicitor sitting in our community, working with us as a partner, figuring this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1653.037s">Again,</a>  I'm going to say no disrespect to KP law, but I don't see them as a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1658.261s">They</a>  are an employee for administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1662.504s">So</a>  again, thank you for time, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1666.663s">Any</a>  further comments from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1668.524s">Director</a>  Alicia Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1671.745s">Madam</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1673.066s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1676.407s">I</a>  was not actually here for this, and I will tell you that I have not seen this file, so I can't speak of any opinion on the specific application, but other boards and commissions, when considering traffic impacts on the city, do request a traffic study, and then our Director of Traffic and Transportation reviews that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1696.417s">and</a>  gives us a written opinion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1698.297s">And</a>  it seems to me that if there are concerns specifically about traffic and impacts on parking and the roads, then it would be appropriate to ask for a traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1708.579s">And</a>  also Director Blake will sometimes help with the scope of such a study in order to meet the needs of what the board needs to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1717.601s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that forward as a tool you might want to consider for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1721.842s">If</a>  you have one, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1724.665s">We'd</a>  be happy to review the application if it's helpful.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1727.286s">We</a>  have a statement from the chief of police saying that there is no anticipated traffic impact.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1736.768s">I</a>  just don't know what did he base that on number of vehicles coming and exiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1744.849s">That's</a>  usually we get for traffic impacts we get a traffic study and the director of traffic reviews it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1754.049s">pop</a>  procedures where these go to the chief of police for traffic impacts predates the fact the existence of the position of director of traffic and transportation in the city as far as I'm aware.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1765.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1768.062s">Any</a>  further questions of the council at this time I do have one person embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1773.747s">Attorney,</a>  Attorney Blake, could you speak to the timeframe so just <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1777.984s">hearing</a>  from what councils are saying, if the council were to move to table this again or to a date certain, what timeframe are we looking at that we must approve or deny this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1792.755s">Failure</a>  by the special permit granting authority to take final action within 90 days or extended time if applicable shall be deemed to be a grant of the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1803.182s">The</a>  90 days is after the conclusion of the public <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1807.343s">hearing,</a>  which we're having now, I have to assume that you began your hearing within the required 65 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1817.811s">So</a>  if you were to continue this hearing for more information, I think you're still well within your timeframe and the 90 days wouldn't start ticking until the hearing had closed.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1832.381s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1832.822s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1835.795s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1837.104s">It</a>  just sounds like the steps forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1839.81s">the</a>  range of steps forward, obviously, I have a position on it, Councilor Knight has a position on it, Councilor Scarpelli has a larger position about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1846.694s">General</a>  legal counsel, one would be to move forward tonight, which I think Councilor Knight seems to be of the mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1852.858s">Well,</a>  I mean, I'm thinking, why don't we close the public hearing, we've got 90 days to figure it out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1855.799s">We've</a>  got three months to figure it out, and at that point, we have to take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1859.702s">I</a>  think the other thing we could do is refer it to a committee of the whole to have the kind of discussions that Councilor Scarpelli has talked about having in the past, like we have had on other items where we could come to some sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1869.278s">you</a>  know, could reach a consensus, maybe there's a majority that wants to move forward, maybe there's a majority that could agree to a reason to deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1876.764s">You</a>  know, I think those are two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1878.025s">It</a>  also sounds like we could continue the public hearing and make that decision at a later time while we seek additional information such as traffic study.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1885.09s">Is</a>  failure to react within the 90 day window considered a constructive acceptance of the application?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1891.055s">It</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1892.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1893.797s">But</a>  the 90 day window doesn't start till we conclude the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1896.459s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1900.077s">So</a>  I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing it forward because, you know, with my hesitation, I would have tabled it, but if moving it toward a Committee of the Whole meeting where we have legal representation that if we had to adjourn in a confidential <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1921.9s">know,</a>  manner of like we have in the past with our city solicitor that I would feel more comfortable to understanding our process and that format. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1929.911s">So,</a>  um, I know you have questions before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1933.676s">Anybody</a>  else might have questions before I motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1936.019s">I</a>  think that that's a good idea to send this community holds.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1939.582s">And</a>  I didn't, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, what was your question earlier? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1942.003s">I</a>  didn't catch the first part.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1943.104s">It</a>  was just whether or not failure to act within the specified timeframe under state law would constitute a constructive acceptance of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1949.408s">So</a>  it'd be like a yes vote, or if it would be that they'd have to sue us to do something, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1953.35s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1954.671s">I</a>  just wanna have the things that go to committee and then never come out, and then have us put in a position where it's acceptance by inaction versus taking a vote.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1962.716s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1964.257s">So,</a>  Attorney Blake, just so I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1967.183s">we're</a>  doing this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1968.083s">If</a>  we were to move it to committee with that, we could continue the public hearing in committee or we would need to close it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1974.766s">That</a>  would start the time clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1977.447s">I</a>  think you could move it to the committee without closing the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1982.849s">I</a>  think that it's legitimate to ask for a traffic study and I'm sure the applicant would probably grant you additional, an extension of time so that you could get a traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1996.542s">and</a>  get the necessary information.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2000.224s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2002.585s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2004.345s">Any</a>  other my questions that satisfied this time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2006.846s">I</a>  moved to continue the public hearing referred and refer the paper to a meeting of committee of the whole with legal counsel and traffic and transportation director Blake.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2015.53s">We'd</a>  like to request a traffic study or</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2025.373s">I'm</a>  happy to add to that motion to request a traffic study from Traffic and Transportation Director Blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2030.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2032.018s">Do</a>  you have that language, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2039.743s">So,</a>  back to me.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2042.744s">This</a>  is without the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2047.928s">If</a>  the Chief has already signed off on this, why are we asking for another traffic study?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2055.122s">I</a>  think we just don't have the traffic study before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2058.684s">We</a>  have the sign off of no anticipated impact, but we don't have the actual report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2064.768s">I</a>  mean.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2065.789s">Just</a>  as cars will be parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2067.49s">I</a>  think that's not entirely.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2068.771s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2069.431s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2072.233s">I</a>  mean, if we want to adjust the language, like if a traffic study has not been completed to have it completed at this time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2078.413s">I</a>  don't know if one is required for this either. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2080.914s">That's</a>  another question that should be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2083.635s">What's</a>  the traffic study required?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2089.777s">You</a>  mean for the original permit?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2091.217s">Yes,</a>  for the original permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2092.157s">I</a>  mean, for the permit, is one needed for this type of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2096.659s">I</a>  don't know either. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2097.519s">We</a>  can request it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2099.58s">I</a>  mean, I don't know if we can request it, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2103.041s">Again,</a>  legally, I don't know if it's required for this type of business either. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2107.297s">So</a>  that's another question that needs to be answered.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2109.439s">Well,</a>  Attorney Blake did say he believed it's within reason for us to request it, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2116.444s">You</a>  could certainly request it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2121.347s">Mr.</a>  Parker, would you read back the motion to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2124.79s">Yes,</a>  my only question is <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2129.891s">Is</a>  vice president bears amendment or is vice president bears motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2133.672s">Does</a>  that include representatives lift of lift present or is that without public meeting?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2138.013s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2138.453s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2139.254s">I</a>  mean, I'm taking comments there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2141.774s">So</a>  with them, you want that in the motion?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2144.455s">I</a>  don't think it's necessary, but feel free to include it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2150.219s">So</a>  Vice President Bears moved to continue the public hearing and refer to the Committee of the Whole with legal counsel, with Traffic and Transportation Director Blake, and with a request for a traffic study, and also including representatives from Lyft.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2166.689s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Bears, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, do we need a roll call for this, yes, or no? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2175.395s">It's</a>  not approved, it's just moving through.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2177.976s">It</a>  is your option. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2180.473s">Let's</a>  go with a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2182.075s">So</a>  we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2185.697s">President</a>  again, that's our last roll call.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2188.039s">President</a>  again, that's the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2189.12s">I'll</a>  ask for the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2189.8s">I'll</a>  ask for it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2190.161s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2191.081s">I'll</a>  ask for the roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2191.862s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2194.224s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2195.024s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2196.225s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2197.006s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2197.866s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2198.547s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2199.167s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2199.808s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2200.288s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2201.069s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2201.649s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2202.249s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2202.67s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2652.087s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, if I may suggest, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2655.509s">not</a>  go to the same meeting, because we may be waiting for a traffic study at this point.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2659.21s">Okay,</a>  so maybe we could, you know, set a separate one maybe before the meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2664.212s">I</a>  know you have a busy schedule, Madam President, but I don't think this, it's just a few questions that we really need to solicit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2670.994s">That's</a>  why adding it there, it wouldn't take long. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2673.095s">But</a>  if we can have a committee of the whole meeting just to answer some of these questions and give us some guidance as we move forward, maybe a separate meeting for that, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2682.297s">Legal</a>  please, I think legal is important.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2684.83s">Yep,</a>  and that may, I appreciate that, and the timing may depend on availability of legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2690.754s">So</a>  we will, I will schedule with all due urgencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2694.536s">It's</a>  just sometimes we cannot get legal counsel within a timeframe we'd like, but I will absolutely work to schedule as quickly as soon as this motion passes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3242.598s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3244.179s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3247.221s">I</a>  think something this council has been incredibly focused on is expanding our capacity when it comes to planning development and housing support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3264.28s">you</a>  know, on larger issues, but this seems to me to be an area where we need more staff support. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3271.203s">I'm</a>  supportive of having a senior planner position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3273.144s">I</a>  think we need more people working in planning and economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3277.646s">And</a>  so I'm generally supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3280.587s">My</a>  main objections to how these were being proposed in the past was that they were not coming with an appropriation request. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3286.75s">And</a>  that seemed to me to be in violation of Massachusetts general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3290.272s">This</a>  has come to us with an appropriation request. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3293.42s">So</a>  I am of the mind to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3296.662s">But</a>  again, I think when we're talking about having a comprehensive plan, talking about having a new zoning ordinance, talking about the sheer volume of great things that are gonna happen to this community because of the work of this council when it comes to our zoning recodification, I think it makes a lot of sense that we have the staff in place and planning to make sure that all of that fruit and labor can come to fruition as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3317.553s">So</a>  that's why I'm in support of this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3318.874s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3322.458s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3324.399s">So</a>  this is 55,032 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3327.802s">So</a>  what would be the full full salary for full year?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3332.405s">Sorry,</a>  I Madam President, I do have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3335.287s">So</a>  this is this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3337.369s">So</a>  it's appropriate for me to say this is this position at CAF at step five of CAF 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3346.595s">That</a>  is because we have somebody on staff <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3349.502s">who</a>  is currently at CAF 13, step five, who is highly qualified and has served this role in other communities, but she would not take the position at a reduction in salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3360.992s">It's</a>  currently the staff planner position is CAF 12.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3365.036s">She</a>  will not go from the 13 to a 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3369.68s">What</a>  is the salary of that position for a full year?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3373.584s">Sorry,</a>  it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3375.964s">Oh,</a>  I apologize, on my spreadsheet, I have the weekly salary, let me just multiply that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3385.351s">And</a>  then we still have that position that if that person moves up, they deserve that money, obviously, but I opposed and I tabled for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3401.17s">This</a>  council has openly talked about what we've been saying, what have we been asking for, and we haven't getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3409.016s">So</a>  unfortunately, until we see some movement where we have our unions that are coming to us that haven't had a contract, and we have some caps that were approved that we're still waiting on answers that we never approved, and then asking for money papers that we've asked for, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3430.532s">for,</a>  I don't know, Councilor, Councilor Mejia years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3434.173s">I'll</a>  get to that in my speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3435.233s">So</a>  I'm waiting to see with this situation, I'm gonna stand strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3441.134s">I</a>  understand, I respect Councilor Beaz's conversation with how important this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3450.156s">And</a>  I agree, I think we need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3451.696s">I</a>  don't think we don't need it, but right now, I don't think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3456.895s">We</a>  keep saying yes to all what's asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3460.777s">We</a>  are just a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3465.18s">We</a>  need answers, questions answered for us, for this question, to give us strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3471.884s">We</a>  keep voting yes, until they understand that no, we're not gonna vote on anything until we have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3478.468s">No,</a>  that we can't vote on money papers till there's respect for other unions or positions that haven't been filled yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3486.207s">We</a>  have positions in the city hall that haven't been filled that are vital positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3491.23s">This</a>  is adding another position that we already have a director and we have an assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3497.473s">So</a>  at least it's stable right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3500.315s">We're</a>  voting on something and moving more money to an entity that at least is stable in our stable definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3510.08s">So</a>  this is why I can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3511.741s">Nothing</a>  personal, I know how you work and I know how your team is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3516.224s">But</a>  again, this is fundamentally wrong to ask this until we have the entities in place that we can get answers, because we're not getting answers.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3532.242s">Madam</a>  President, if I just might, I've been involved in trying to hire for several of my peer positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3538.312s">is</a>  extremely hard to hire for municipal positions right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3541.674s">I</a>  personally am aware that Malden and Somerville are also hiring for city solicitors right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3552.16s">It's</a>  a very difficult hiring situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3556.082s">So</a>  we are trying to fill those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3558.524s">And</a>  while I can't speak on behalf of our chief of staff and our HR department, I've served on several of these hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3564.83s">committee</a>  is trying to find qualified people to fill these positions as well, which we think is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3571.051s">And</a>  I will say this is one of the few places where you actually have the power to adjust something. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3577.193s">We</a>  do have a position that has been open in my office for 16 months, and it's really putting a burden on the rest of the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3583.734s">We</a>  will be posting a full-time housing planner position and a full-time CPA position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3590.955s">The</a>  housing planner is a staff planner position, so that's on the CAF. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3594.668s">And</a>  both of those are funded off the general fund budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3597.61s">So</a>  as in one through CDBG and one through CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3601.492s">So</a>  that this will really help the burden on our staff at this time.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3605.654s">So</a>  Madam President, I appreciate that, but not just city solicitor, but I'm talking about other empty directors positions that we've had in a long time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3616.659s">That</a>  is some serious concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3618.24s">So</a>  I understand, I appreciate you sharing that with us with city solicitor, because I understand that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3622.601s">But</a>  like I said, there are other major needs that if we had to move, you know, CAF money around, I would rather move CAF money around to make sure we can bring in a qualified, you know, experienced city assessor or a qualified IT director. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3641.807s">This</a>  is what I'm saying to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3644.388s">If</a>  you need, if this is where we need to move some money to make sure we have it, this is where it should be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3650.174s">Right</a>  now, I don't think we have the stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3654.372s">in</a>  other locations to be approving capital, approving $88,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3658.735s">And</a>  we, you know, you want to talk about hurting, let's talk to those teachers that haven't gotten a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3665.099s">Let's</a>  talk about the fire and they're hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3668.1s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3669.581s">To</a>  be clear, this money is not being appropriated from free cash or any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3674.904s">This</a>  is money that is actually already in our office's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3679.867s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4020.516s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4021.557s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4022.297s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4025.832s">A</a>  few things here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4029.814s">When</a>  it comes to fiscal stewardship, when it comes to this council doing its work and holding the administration accountable, sure, we've taken some votes in the past since June 30th to appropriate certain funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4046.765s">We've</a>  taken some votes not to, we've taken some votes to table things, we've taken some votes to approve things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4053.29s">In</a>  the totality of that, I think all seven of us have been incredibly clear about what we want from this administration and our demands for basic transparency and accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4064.098s">I</a>  think we've also been focused enough to take things on a case-by-case basis, look at the merits and the benefits and the costs of a specific case, and also factor that into our decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4079.815s">There</a>  are a bunch of papers on here tonight where we're gonna have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4084.151s">Again,</a>  it's the next paper, it's the, maybe not the paper after that, but it's the, and then, you know, there's like three more papers in the next, you know, however long it takes us, but we're gonna continue to have this conversation about finances and about caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4098.203s">The</a>  next one, even the mayor's own attorney says needs five votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4101.466s">So</a>  that one's not happening tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4103.288s">If</a>  it seems, you know, I don't wanna call a vote before we've called it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4106.911s">So</a>  we're not just giving a blank check. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4108.412s">We're</a>  not just saying yes to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4111.071s">This</a>  is actually an opportunity for us to help address the human resource nightmare that Councilor Knight is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4118.857s">In</a>  a functioning government, this would be a no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4122.82s">A</a>  mayor would come to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4125.302s">Well,</a>  thanks Siri, probably Googling no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4128.134s">a</a>  fully functioning, communicative, collaborative government, a mayor would come with this request to not appropriate new funds, not transfer funds from one department to another, but to adjust funding within an existing department to make sure that we can hire or keep a current staff member at a slightly higher position, a senior planner, and then hire someone to replace them in their current cap 12 role. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4149.779s">That</a>  should be a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4151.019s">We</a>  shouldn't even be having this argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4152.36s">Now</a>  we know why we are having this argument, because it's not a no-brainer, because the collaboration's not there and the transparency's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4158.942s">I</a>  accept all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4160.624s">I</a>  think we're going to have that conversation I think there's going to be votes where we try to hold the administration accountable later in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4166.15s">But</a>  I think on this specific issue where this person will be doing the work of implementing the good work that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4172.968s">where</a>  we're not appropriating new money, where we're basically saying, so we appropriated a land use planner at CAF 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4178.211s">It</a>  turns out we're probably gonna be better off having a senior planner at CAF 14, and then someone at CAF 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4184.015s">That's</a>  not not holding the administration accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4186.316s">It's</a>  not being a poor fiscal steward. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4187.797s">The</a>  money's already been appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4189.438s">No</a>  new money is going towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4192.64s">You</a>  know, this one to me is one that I'm okay with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4196.163s">There's</a>  plenty of other things that have happened that I'm not okay with, and I think in this case, the specific case facts of this issue merit approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4206.63s">Maybe</a>  the next paper doesn't, but that doesn't mean we're not holding strong, that we're not trying to do whatever is within our power to make sure that this administration is accountable and that the people of Medford have the information that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4222.185s">So</a>  I would move to approve this paper as well as to, yeah, I would move to approve this paper.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4234.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4234.973s">Go</a>  ahead, Councilor Sanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4235.974s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4237.315s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4239.456s">I</a>  believe that there is a unanimous, there is a unanimous support behind the rails for financial accountability, for fiscal transparency, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4249.083s">I</a>  am for increasing leverage and to make sure our city is making the right financial choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4254.864s">But</a>  we also have to, in my opinion, realize the facts of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4261.006s">I</a>  fear that in our debate about this specific issue, we've fallen for a red herring that equates a very absolutist definition of accountability with <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4274.91s">fiscal</a>  responsibility, which I believe in this case the money has already been appropriated to your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4280.313s">We're</a>  not taking money out of free cash, you know, there's financially that's that's that's the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4288.759s">The</a>  other reality of the situation is as stable as things might currently be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4292.921s">We</a>  also know that municipalities around us are competing to hire more planners and <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4299.56s">I'm</a>  not saying this is what your office staff are thinking, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4303.843s">But</a>  who's to say that in a few months or in a few years, they don't see a lack of opportunity to move forward in our community and they just leave for another community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4314.79s">We</a>  are also competitors in this market. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4317.725s">for</a>  planners, for city planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4320.265s">And</a>  I think that leads me to my ultimate question that I always ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4326.286s">When</a>  I take votes like this, and I think really, when we think about how the question of accountability, how we're gonna hold the administration to account, I think this is the question that's gonna guide me from item to item, is if this is gonna tangibly improve the lives of our residents.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4348.708s">Absolutely,</a>  it will to have an experienced senior planner doing the work of the senior plan that doing this planning work is absolutely going to improve the lives of our residents.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4359.831s">And</a>  that is I think ultimately the goal, the unified goal of the city council, you know we've, we've, I think there's a lot of agreement that we need to move forward on housing production on sustainability on the climate plan on phase two of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4376.995s">support</a>  like this in your office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4379.197s">To</a>  get our own priorities through. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4382.079s">And</a>  so for that reason, I know others might disagree with me, but that's why I would vote yes on this paper tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4390.406s">Again,</a>  it's item by item. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4392.908s">And</a>  I think we need to ask that question for everything before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4397.252s">But</a>  in this specific case, I believe that it ticks my boxes.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4405.678s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4406.739s">Councilor</a>  Ferraro.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4407.459s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4409.821s">I</a>  do want to support this tonight, because I think it's a valuable position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4413.803s">I</a>  think we do need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4415.224s">I</a>  work, I don't think anybody calls your office more than me, as far as our development, but you know, we talked a few weeks ago about being a partner with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4433.276s">Two</a>  weeks ago, we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4434.821s">but</a>  about being partners with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4438.124s">I</a>  don't see no partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4440.066s">All</a>  I see is things coming our way, things coming our way to approve, and we're getting nothing in return. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4447.752s">We</a>  send papers over, we make requests, and it's, I mean, I hate to say this, but this council is becoming a rubber stamp for the man. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4456.16s">That's</a>  all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4458.261s">And</a>  this is a valuable position, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4462.152s">There's</a>  gonna be a little give and take here with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4464.575s">There's</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4466.597s">Everything</a>  just ask, ask, ask, ask, ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4469.921s">And</a>  every time we ask for something in return, I don't see anything we're asking for coming back at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4479.593s">So,</a>  and I gotta say, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4483.297s">I</a>  mean, I probably will support this thing, you know, because, because I feel it's a real worthwhile position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4488.721s">I'm</a>  just, I'm just tired of, of, of no give and take with, with this, with these people here in this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4495.525s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4496.046s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Carballo. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4496.886s">Vice</a>  Senator Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4497.647s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4498.227s">I</a>  think Councilor Carballo's point is well taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4501.029s">And</a>  that's when I, my point was earlier about a fully functioning administration, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4505.052s">Again,</a>  this should be a no brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4505.993s">This</a>  should be procedural and it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4507.554s">And</a>  the reasons for that are myriad. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4510.269s">I</a>  can say there's one office that does respond every time I call, and there's one office that has been coming down to our council meetings at Beck and call, you know, and it is the PDS office we've met on comp plan we've met on housing production plan we've met on climate plan I think we're working on the housing trust the housing stability ordinance so right, you know, I agree with you, city government and administration should work where it comes from the top down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4536.034s">This</a>  is working in spite of the failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4539.075s">And</a>  that, you know, it sucks to say, but you know, that's a reason I can support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4545.477s">This</a>  office is working well and apparently working well in spite of a lot of other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4550.419s">So</a>  I think this is gonna help us have the resources we need to continue the work that we wanna do when it comes to planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4557.941s">And</a>  I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4561.843s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4562.763s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4565.942s">Is</a>  the position spoken for?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4568.083s">No</a>  position is ever final. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4569.804s">It</a>  will be posted publicly and there will be applications and there will be interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4575.466s">I</a>  am aware that there is a staff person on staff who will be applying for this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4581.829s">They</a>  are very qualified for this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4584.85s">So</a>  take that as you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4587.211s">I</a>  will interview if other, I have been advertising for the staff planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4590.973s">We've</a>  advertised that in paid locations over the past 16 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4595.434s">Yeah,</a>  I've interviewed four or five people and none of them have been qualified enough for us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4600.818s">I'm</a>  going to invoke rule 20 from our city council rules, and this is a finance paper that's going to be laid on the table for one week's time, regardless of what happens tonight, because we have the right to do that as a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4614.03s">I</a>  was the first time I've seen this appropriation request on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4618.112s">And</a>  as such, I'm going to vote my rights under Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4620.754s">It's</a>  old Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4621.274s">I</a>  don't know what new rule is, but we leave them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4623.435s">We</a>  never got copies of the rules after we approved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4625.517s">I'll</a>  have them posted up on the website, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4627.958s">Oh,</a>  it is Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4628.538s">It's</a>  definitely Rule 20.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4632.841s">I</a>  do see Chief of... Thank you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4635.142s">And</a>  I do just see Chief of Staff, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4637.764s">Aaron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4638.124s">Did</a>  you have something you would like to add?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4641.098s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4642.359s">At</a>  this point, I mean, I know that there's not debate on invoking that rule that Councilor Knight invoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4649.062s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion and debate that's occurred this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4654.305s">I</a>  do want to add that, you know, there are, as I understand it, there's a number of resolutions that the city council passes that go before the mayor that get routed to the appropriate department and get responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4670.312s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, just want to let you know in particular that I'm presently working on a resolution that you had proposed most recently with regard to the IT department. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4681.199s">I</a>  expect you'll see that resolution response within the week, if not shortly thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4687.522s">So</a>  I just want to mention that there is a collaborative attempt to respond to these resolutions that are passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4695.467s">And</a>  I want to note that we're working hard on a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4700.603s">Um,</a>  PDS director hunt with her comments with regard to the difficulty in hiring that it's not only with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4708.766s">It's</a>  with regard to a number of other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4710.907s">Councilor</a>  Scarapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4712.467s">Thank</a>  you for acknowledging that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4713.628s">I</a>  know you have that experience in your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4716.369s">There's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4717.129s">There's</a>  a lot going on in these number a number of different things, and I just wanted to provide some commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4722.031s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4753.939s">So</a>  we do have the motion from Councilor Knight to invoke rule <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4757.973s">20,</a>  it might be 23 now, or?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4760.975s">Madam</a>  President, may I just share like a clerical item? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4763.838s">I</a>  would just like the council to know that in two weeks at your next meeting, I will actually be either on an airplane, depending on the timing, or have just landed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4771.984s">So</a>  if there's anything that people would like me to address this evening I'm here, I might be able to join via Zoom.</p>
