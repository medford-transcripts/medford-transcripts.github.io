22
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:36,825
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, so we were, we are in need of relocating or replacing some of our gas main on Walnut Street and Metcalfe Street to accommodate a new water project by the city of Medford.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Miss Cuddy, or over the public hearing any questions for Councilors by some bears, Madam President, could we have the city engineers with us could be described the conditions on the petition.

26
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:15,796
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

27
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:17,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's here in person.

28
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,314
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, there you are.

29
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,895
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't see you back there.

30
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,696
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

31
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:28,339
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Owen Wartella, and my address is 34 Electric Avenue in Somerville.

32
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,641
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm the city engineer, so.

33
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,661
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you can also, yeah.

34
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,202
[SPEAKER_25]: In the future, you can just give your city hall address.

35
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:34,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

36
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:35,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Please proceed.

37
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:44,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So the conditions that I had were, this is something that I looked at back in July and June in a review, and

38
00:03:46,173 --> 00:04:03,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the conditions of the road are currently in poor conditions, the sidewalks are in poor conditions, and this grant of location will be placing the new reinstalled main within the sidewalk.

39
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:09,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And they will be replacing the sidewalk in kind afterwards.

40
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,938
[SPEAKER_05]: The road work, we will probably do a spot.

41
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:22,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a permit access fee for work done because we're going to come in afterwards do water main work.

42
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:32,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we'll do is we'll acquire the money in the fund so then we'll be able to stretch tax dollars a little bit further.

43
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:33,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

44
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:34,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here.

45
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:35,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

46
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:36,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a question on that.

47
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:45,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that some companies have reached out and residents reached out that just wanted to replace their water mains.

48
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that Councilor Knight brought this forward with this project.

49
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:50,475
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm bringing it up.

50
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:59,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we now having the companies now go curb to curb whenever they open the street?

51
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:05,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes and no.

52
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:20,811
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an engineering directive number three that was issued in July that gives an outline and we try to work with developers on a case-by-case basis to

53
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,154
[SPEAKER_05]: do the resurfacing within the road.

54
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:30,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is a public utility company, so they kind of follow different rules.

55
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:37,800
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't necessarily need to repave from curb to curb unless it's a moratorium on the road.

56
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,520
[SPEAKER_05]: However,

57
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:43,393
[SPEAKER_05]: In their defense, National Grid does always go above and beyond.

58
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,494
[SPEAKER_05]: They usually do a full lane.

59
00:05:45,555 --> 00:06:06,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll disagree with you there, just for the fact that what I did prior to your arrival, I had asked for a list back at least, I believe, two or three years on openings, approvals for openings, and who did those and who did the paving and did they do,

60
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,976
[SPEAKER_06]: a just partial or complete or just a block.

61
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:21,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was comical because when I got back, I got list of the addresses for the small businesses in the residential homes.

62
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:25,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So I use one example, Tufts is one of the biggest companies we use for residential.

63
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have Tufts paving or construction, whatever it's called, and then it says the address.

64
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:40,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, so you can understand when we wanted that to see if the paving was done to specs of what we were told was gonna be acceptable.

65
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:47,362
[SPEAKER_06]: But anything that had to do with our utilities, it was just basic.

66
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:52,705
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't know the address, we didn't know, it was actually useless for us.

67
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:58,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I'll ask that again down the line, because I think I'm gonna call for a special meeting for this for the fact that

68
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:13,853
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, personally, on my end, the reason why I brought this up, High Street, at 10 o'clock at night, we had a utility job that the public utility hired an outside company to come in and repave.

69
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:22,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they came in at 10 o'clock at night on a school night and, you know, it was, they said they had permission from the entity.

70
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,024
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that- Are you on a public way or a private way?

71
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a public way.

72
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something that I'll bring up later, but I just wanted to make sure that- I think moving forward, the engineering directive that I issued should take care of a lot of those issues.

73
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:38,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

74
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:45,038
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer you gave is just a little alarming that our utilities have gone above and beyond.

75
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:46,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's what you said.

76
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they've done that.

77
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,582
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, it's a public utility company and they kind of have their own guidelines.

78
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, and what I'm saying is,

79
00:07:54,024 --> 00:08:17,587
[SPEAKER_06]: those guidelines we have to find a way to change them because if you look at our roads a lot of it has to do with i'm not saying it's your fault this is not your fault this is years of of mismanagement of our roadway roadways that you know this is why these questions are coming up from council night that's why we appreciate you being here so thank you understand thank you very much any further questions for the council at this time

80
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:25,538
[SPEAKER_15]: So just as I understand it, with the approval of this rental location, what's going to happen is we're going to move some water pipes from the street to the sidewalk.

81
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:26,819
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get a brand new sidewalk.

82
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,921
[SPEAKER_15]: The city is going to go in, replace all the underground infrastructure, and then they're going to resurface the street curb to curb.

83
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:35,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and we'll replace the lead lines that are within Walnut Street as well.

84
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:37,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

85
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:39,785
[SPEAKER_25]: So as this is a public hearing, I do need to open that up.

86
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:42,046
[SPEAKER_25]: So opening up the public hearing.

87
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,247
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, it already opened up.

88
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:44,307
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

89
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,634
[SPEAKER_13]: or do I need to, does the motion close it?

90
00:08:50,875 --> 00:09:00,619
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so on the motion and Councilor Knight, would you like that with the six day public comment period or?

91
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:14,845
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve at the completion of the six day public comment period,

92
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:17,469
[SPEAKER_25]: seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

104

105
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,747
[SPEAKER_25]: This was tabled last week as well.

106
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:23,112
[SPEAKER_25]: Do I have any questions from Councilors at this point?

107
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:24,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Merle?

108
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:24,974
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

109
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:25,675
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can.

110
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:26,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

111
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:57,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I propose a table this motion for the fact that in the past, just so the constituents know that especially people here in the chambers, when we have a question or concerns with legal background, city council usually has a city solicitor or assistant city solicitor that works with us to answer any questions that legally that we need to make sure that wherever we vote, we vote either as for or against that we are doing it

112
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:04,210
[SPEAKER_06]: with the proper form and not holding the city liable.

113
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you an example.

114
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:15,800
[SPEAKER_06]: This council voted on a gas station to exclude a gas station for BJ's about a year ago, and we didn't have council here.

115
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So the reason for it was illegal.

116
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,765
[SPEAKER_06]: So BJ's took us to court.

117
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:39,745
[SPEAKER_06]: and we were found to be in fault and it would have been a serious, it could have been if our acting solicitor at the time worked with BJ's to make sure that we had some language and understanding what the protocol was.

118
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:49,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So I tabled these, anything that you're gonna see with legal, I'll be honest with the city administration to all my constituents that anything with legal notification

119
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel comfortable.

120
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, I don't have a legal background.

121
00:12:54,637 --> 00:13:06,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure that I cross my T's and dot my I's when it comes to certain entities that we're not putting our decisions on putting a financial burden on our

122
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:13,746
[SPEAKER_06]: committee or community to fight a legal battle that we're going to lose because we weren't informed properly.

123
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:24,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the reason that I asked because it's, you know, we asked a certain a few questions, one being that if there are 50 to 60 cars that are going to be housed in Medford,

124
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is going to, where are they going to be housed?

125
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:30,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to pay excise tax?

126
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:34,581
[SPEAKER_06]: At least will we get the tax revenue from that excise tax?

127
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:38,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the answer was that we will from Lyft.

128
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:41,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure from our legal team, I wanted to ask that.

129
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:48,614
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some other questions, but I know that there was KP Law was supposed to be, is supposed to be here online tonight.

130
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to just, we can ask them some questions.

131
00:13:52,426 --> 00:14:07,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that making sure that, you know, opening this up, I want to get some examples in the city that where this is similar to, so we can all understand on its basis, what it entails.

132
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:20,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't put ourselves by allowing this and then later opening up an issue that because of past practice, we might be doing something that's going to harm our community later.

133
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:25,188
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the question for our legal representation here.

134
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:30,429
[SPEAKER_25]: We do have Attorney Jeffrey Blake from KP Law on the call right now.

135
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:39,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Would any Councilors like to speak or ask questions before we hear from Attorney Blake?

136
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I was chairing last week, so I don't know if I

137
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:53,461
[SPEAKER_07]: made my view on this clear, but to be quite frank, I think that the business model here is incredibly exploitative and not the kind of business we should be encouraging here in Medford.

138
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not supportive of this petition.

139
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:56,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

140
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:58,145
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, President Ferris.

141
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,848
[SPEAKER_25]: So Attorney Blake, sorry, Councilor Collins.

142
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:12,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell and thank you Attorney Blake for being here, my, and perhaps we'll get to this in your presentation but my concerns are similar to what Vice President Bears just expressed.

143
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:20,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And in the light of the example of BJS last year that Councilor Scarpelli alluded to I'm curious.

144
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:31,112
[SPEAKER_24]: Are there, with this type of permit application, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons for denial that we need to know about before we take this vote?

145
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:31,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

146
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:32,212
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

147
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,232
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

148
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,474
[SPEAKER_25]: Attorney Blake, I do believe that's the main question before us.

149
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:47,198
[SPEAKER_25]: If there, as the special permit granting authority for this, are there permissible versus non-permissible reasons which the council may vote or individual Councilors may vote or the council may vote to deny the permit?

150
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:48,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, sure.

151
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:50,780
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you everyone for having me.

152
00:15:51,177 --> 00:16:01,363
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Jeff Blake, I'm with KP Law and I have reviewed your zoning ordinances and zoning ordinances are land use ordinances.

153
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:10,749
[SPEAKER_22]: So typically they are not, they don't allow you to go beyond the normal land use objectives.

154
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:18,694
[SPEAKER_22]: You have in your ordinances, a criteria for special permits that are granted in the city.

155
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:20,936
[SPEAKER_22]: The special permit granting authority

156
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:43,128
[SPEAKER_22]: you unless specified herein, otherwise herein only upon its written determination that the adverse effects of the proposed use will not weigh its beneficial impact to the city or neighborhood in view of the particular characteristics of the site and the proposal in relationship to that site.

157
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,772
[SPEAKER_22]: The determination shall include consideration of the following.

158
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:54,458
[SPEAKER_22]: social, economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal.

159
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:58,000
[SPEAKER_22]: And I suggest that these have to have a land use type.

160
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:16,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading, the adequacy of utilities and other public services, compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood to the extent that this is actually a

161
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:20,737
[SPEAKER_22]: consideration with the current application before you.

162
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:30,244
[SPEAKER_22]: Impacts on the natural environment and the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.

163
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:43,213
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are the criteria that that are outlined in your zoning ordinance and those are the permissible areas that you are allowed to number one

164
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,002
[SPEAKER_22]: in denying and or linking with conditions.

165
00:17:53,544 --> 00:18:02,870
[SPEAKER_22]: So to answer your question, the earlier question I think was, or a comment was, I don't like the business model.

166
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:13,416
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know that that has a sufficient tie to land use or use of the land such that it would be an

167
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,060
[SPEAKER_22]: it would allow you the ability to deny the special permit.

168
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:25,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I think you're probably saying, well, you just gave me criteria.

169
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:31,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Number one is talks about social, economic, or community needs, which are served by the proposal.

170
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:42,833
[SPEAKER_22]: I suggest that that would be more toward looking at the particular use wherein a situation where you might want to grant a special permit

171
00:18:43,400 --> 00:19:03,587
[SPEAKER_22]: for a use that has a particularly admirable, I keep going between screens, community need or economic or social need, rather than a objection to a possible business model.

172
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:18,216
[SPEAKER_25]: So just to understand, and I think this is where it came up in BJ, so we would have to, if it were to be a vote to denial, we would have to cite a specific reason and that we as a body would have to agree upon that specific reason?

173
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:20,218
[SPEAKER_06]: You would, yes.

174
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:21,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

175
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Scarpelli.

176
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

177
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, like I said, this is our concern as a council.

178
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:35,147
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past, I appreciate the council from KP Law coming in and stating our ordinance that

179
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:41,264
[SPEAKER_06]: We read also what our city solicitor used to do is work with us.

180
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:58,332
[SPEAKER_06]: and help us understand past practice, what we've done with past businesses and how that negatively affected our community with our decision or the impact on how we can present it that is legal.

181
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I tabled it for the fact that we don't have a city solicitor that's working with us because I asked what I really wanted to know is to give us some examples that we as a council can,

182
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:21,881
[SPEAKER_06]: can see tangible comparisons that we've done in the past that have both helped and then crippled us in a sense.

183
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:26,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you look at this situation, I personally have a concern with traffic.

184
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,026
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about 50, 60 cars.

185
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:39,655
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody's in that area, I know what the comment was from the company that we spoke with last week that said, oh no, they won't use the satellite program next to

186
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:50,522
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Fellsway Plaza, they're going to park over at a parking lot in a parking garage across the street.

187
00:20:51,223 --> 00:21:01,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the proper answer is and what the safe answer is as a city councilor that doesn't have a background in legal jargon.

188
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:08,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I can't vote for this or support it for the fact that,

189
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:23,327
[SPEAKER_06]: leaving it to table, not to the fact that right now I don't have an answer for it, whether it's a yes or no for this permit.

190
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:33,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have an answer because I don't have any support from a city solicitor that I have in the past worked with to help me make these decisions.

191
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:36,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize.

192
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I'm making sense.

193
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:47,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where I'm going to go I'd like to hear from my fellow Councilors before we make some motions, but I appreciate it.

194
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:48,862
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

195
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:49,703
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

196
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:55,070
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you President real I want to check my understanding here it sounds like from that.

197
00:21:56,675 --> 00:22:08,740
[SPEAKER_24]: description from Attorney Blake that per our zoning ordinance, we can make special exceptions for non-conforming land uses in the case of an exceptional community benefit.

198
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:23,667
[SPEAKER_24]: But it sounds like the interpretation is in a case such as this, we can't deny a technically conforming land use for a reason that doesn't fit within those bullet points that you mentioned.

199
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,948
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just wanna first check that.

200
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:30,796
[SPEAKER_24]: My understanding is correct there.

201
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,937
[SPEAKER_22]: This is attorney Blake again.

202
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Your understanding is correct.

203
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:39,802
[SPEAKER_22]: And the bullet points are the criteria by which you can judge a special permit.

204
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:46,646
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, permits land use or otherwise class two licenses to the extent that we'll take those up.

205
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:48,928
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll also hear that there are criteria for those.

206
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:54,571
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, an applicant needs to be able to come in and understand the criteria that they have to meet.

207
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,132
[SPEAKER_22]: So to answer your question, yes.

208
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:05,711
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are the criteria that the council will have to identify an issue with the application.

209
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:11,115
[SPEAKER_22]: And if they identify an issue that can't be conditioned, then they can deny the permit.

210
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:25,483
[SPEAKER_22]: With respect to the earlier speaker, the Councilor who talked about having a, I think the issue was whether or not we could require them to park the cars

211
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,982
[SPEAKER_22]: in a parking garage across the street.

212
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:31,246
[SPEAKER_22]: That can certainly be a condition of any special permit.

213
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:37,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Does that answer your question, Councilor Collins?

214
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:38,296
[SPEAKER_24]: It does, thank you.

215
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:42,462
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further questions from the Council at this time?

216
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,554
[SPEAKER_15]: I just like to point out, this is an existing business in the community already.

217
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:54,481
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, they have about 50-60 employees here in this community that contribute to the circular flow of our local economy.

218
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:59,185
[SPEAKER_15]: The proposed use, in my opinion, is less detrimental than the current use.

219
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:02,829
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that it really makes a big difference in terms of the impact.

220
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,271
[SPEAKER_15]: in traffic or safety in the area.

221
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:10,775
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's supported through the statements of our chief of police and our chief of fire in the application.

222
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:19,802
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I look at this proposal that's before us, I see a business here that exists in our community, that's looking to expand in our community and invest in our community.

223
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:21,904
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we should make it easy for them, not hard.

224
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:23,645
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will support this paper in the statement.

225
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:25,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

226
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:26,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice Mayor Bears?

227
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, Attorney Blake.

228
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:39,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So social economic benefits, or so only if there's an exceptional benefit, can we make an exception, not if we believe there's an exceptional cost?

229
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:52,866
[SPEAKER_22]: The determination shall include consideration of each of the following, the social economic or community needs that are served by the proposal.

230
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,007
[SPEAKER_22]: So yes, in my reading of it,

231
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:58,464
[SPEAKER_22]: You are correct.

232
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:18,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and just from your reading of it on other points, I mean, it's not past it, so I assume we can't use it as justification now, but our comprehensive plan, I believe, has items in it that advocate for an increase in the number of good paying jobs in the community.

233
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,945
[SPEAKER_07]: If the council were to believe that these jobs were not good paying jobs, would that be a justification for the denial of a special permit?

234
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:33,902
[SPEAKER_22]: It could certainly be a basis, the proposals compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.

235
00:25:33,922 --> 00:25:38,670
[SPEAKER_22]: That is a criteria for which you can judge the application.

236
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, and then just last, I believe you mentioned environmental concerns.

237
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:51,864
[SPEAKER_07]: This lot is in proximity to a wetland, and it would also mean an increase in the number of vehicles and particulate emissions in our community.

238
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:57,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that be under the environmental section a justification for denial?

239
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,270
[SPEAKER_22]: In my opinion, it would be.

240
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,753
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously, you would have to have, yes, in my opinion, it would be.

241
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:07,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, then I have a few reasons to deny it.

242
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:07,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

243
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:18,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Could one argue that this is a ride share program and ride shares are designed to take cars off the street and therefore they have an environmental impact that's positive.

244
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:23,580
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure they execute what they're designed to do.

245
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:33,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if I wanted or not, these are great questions debate, sitting with a city solicitor.

246
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:38,819
[SPEAKER_06]: no offense to Attorney Blake, but this is what I'm saying.

247
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:51,441
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having an open debate about something that we should be talking about with our solicitor, making sure we get the questions answered correctly for the councils that have the opportunity to sit with former city solicitors.

248
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not forget what we've done.

249
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:57,043
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I implore you to understand.

250
00:26:57,123 --> 00:26:58,183
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not about

251
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:05,534
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, whether I want to hinder a business to prosper in our community.

252
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:16,186
[SPEAKER_06]: We definitely have questions, and I appreciate Attorney Blake coming and answering questions, but the questions are our ordinance that we know.

253
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:23,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this isn't a strategy to understand for or against it.

254
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:32,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where we could understand with a city solicitor sitting in our community, working with us as a partner, figuring this out.

255
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:37,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm going to say no disrespect to KP law, but I don't see them as a partner.

256
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:40,823
[SPEAKER_06]: They are an employee for administration.

257
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:45,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, thank you for time, Madam President.

258
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:48,504
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further comments from the council at this time?

259
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:50,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Director Alicia Hunt.

260
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:52,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, thank you.

261
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:56,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the city.

262
00:27:56,407 --> 00:28:15,976
[SPEAKER_20]: I was not actually here for this, and I will tell you that I have not seen this file, so I can't speak of any opinion on the specific application, but other boards and commissions, when considering traffic impacts on the city, do request a traffic study, and then our Director of Traffic and Transportation reviews that,

263
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,937
[SPEAKER_20]: and gives us a written opinion on it.

264
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:28,019
[SPEAKER_20]: And it seems to me that if there are concerns specifically about traffic and impacts on parking and the roads, then it would be appropriate to ask for a traffic study.

265
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:37,301
[SPEAKER_20]: And also Director Blake will sometimes help with the scope of such a study in order to meet the needs of what the board needs to consider.

266
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:41,722
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to put that forward as a tool you might want to consider for this evening.

267
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,162
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have one, I apologize.

268
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:47,266
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd be happy to review the application if it's helpful.

269
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:55,047
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a statement from the chief of police saying that there is no anticipated traffic impact.

270
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:04,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't know what did he base that on number of vehicles coming and exiting.

271
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:11,651
[SPEAKER_20]: That's usually we get for traffic impacts we get a traffic study and the director of traffic reviews it.

272
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:24,178
[SPEAKER_20]: pop procedures where these go to the chief of police for traffic impacts predates the fact the existence of the position of director of traffic and transportation in the city as far as I'm aware.

273
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,101
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

274
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:33,607
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further questions of the council at this time I do have one person embarrassed.

275
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:37,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Attorney, Attorney Blake, could you speak to the timeframe so just

276
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:49,492
[SPEAKER_25]: hearing from what councils are saying, if the council were to move to table this again or to a date certain, what timeframe are we looking at that we must approve or deny this?

277
00:29:52,755 --> 00:30:02,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Failure by the special permit granting authority to take final action within 90 days or extended time if applicable shall be deemed to be a grant of the special permit.

278
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:06,805
[SPEAKER_22]: The 90 days is after the conclusion of the public

279
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:17,570
[SPEAKER_22]: hearing, which we're having now, I have to assume that you began your hearing within the required 65 days.

280
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:31,200
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you were to continue this hearing for more information, I think you're still well within your timeframe and the 90 days wouldn't start ticking until the hearing had closed.

281
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:32,601
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

282
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:33,082
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

283
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:36,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

284
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It just sounds like the steps forward.

285
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:46,014
[SPEAKER_07]: the range of steps forward, obviously, I have a position on it, Councilor Knight has a position on it, Councilor Scarpelli has a larger position about it.

286
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:52,838
[SPEAKER_07]: General legal counsel, one would be to move forward tonight, which I think Councilor Knight seems to be of the mind.

287
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:55,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I'm thinking, why don't we close the public hearing, we've got 90 days to figure it out, right?

288
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,401
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got three months to figure it out, and at that point, we have to take a vote on it.

289
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:08,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the other thing we could do is refer it to a committee of the whole to have the kind of discussions that Councilor Scarpelli has talked about having in the past, like we have had on other items where we could come to some sort of

290
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,862
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, could reach a consensus, maybe there's a majority that wants to move forward, maybe there's a majority that could agree to a reason to deny it.

291
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:18,005
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think those are two options.

292
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:24,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It also sounds like we could continue the public hearing and make that decision at a later time while we seek additional information such as traffic study.

293
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:30,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Is failure to react within the 90 day window considered a constructive acceptance of the application?

294
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,415
[SPEAKER_22]: It is.

295
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:32,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

296
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,439
[SPEAKER_07]: But the 90 day window doesn't start till we conclude the public hearing.

297
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:36,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

298
00:31:40,077 --> 00:32:00,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing it forward because, you know, with my hesitation, I would have tabled it, but if moving it toward a Committee of the Whole meeting where we have legal representation that if we had to adjourn in a confidential

299
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:09,891
[SPEAKER_06]: know, manner of like we have in the past with our city solicitor that I would feel more comfortable to understanding our process and that format.

300
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I know you have questions before me.

301
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else might have questions before I motion.

302
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's a good idea to send this community holds.

303
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:21,983
[SPEAKER_25]: And I didn't, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, what was your question earlier?

304
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:22,864
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't catch the first part.

305
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:29,368
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just whether or not failure to act within the specified timeframe under state law would constitute a constructive acceptance of the application.

306
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:33,070
[SPEAKER_15]: So it'd be like a yes vote, or if it would be that they'd have to sue us to do something, you know what I mean?

307
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,131
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, thank you.

308
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:41,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanna have the things that go to committee and then never come out, and then have us put in a position where it's acceptance by inaction versus taking a vote.

309
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

310
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:46,558
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Attorney Blake, just so I know,

311
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,023
[SPEAKER_25]: we're doing this the right way.

312
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:54,586
[SPEAKER_25]: If we were to move it to committee with that, we could continue the public hearing in committee or we would need to close it here.

313
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,966
[SPEAKER_25]: That would start the time clock.

314
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:02,409
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you could move it to the committee without closing the hearing.

315
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:15,854
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that it's legitimate to ask for a traffic study and I'm sure the applicant would probably grant you additional, an extension of time so that you could get a traffic study.

316
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,323
[SPEAKER_22]: and get the necessary information.

317
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

318
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

319
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Any other my questions that satisfied this time.

320
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:34,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I moved to continue the public hearing referred and refer the paper to a meeting of committee of the whole with legal counsel and traffic and transportation director Blake.

321
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,811
[SPEAKER_25]: We'd like to request a traffic study or

322
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:49,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to add to that motion to request a traffic study from Traffic and Transportation Director Blank.

323
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:50,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

324
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:53,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have that language, Mr. Clerk?

325
00:33:59,743 --> 00:34:01,123
[SPEAKER_13]: So, back to me.

326
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:03,865
[SPEAKER_02]: This is without the language.

327
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:11,550
[SPEAKER_02]: If the Chief has already signed off on this, why are we asking for another traffic study?

328
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:18,644
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we just don't have the traffic study before us.

329
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:24,368
[SPEAKER_25]: We have the sign off of no anticipated impact, but we don't have the actual report out.

330
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:25,048
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean.

331
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:27,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as cars will be parked.

332
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's not entirely.

333
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:29,411
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I'm not sure.

334
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:31,573
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

335
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:37,977
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, if we want to adjust the language, like if a traffic study has not been completed to have it completed at this time.

336
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:40,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if one is required for this either.

337
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another question that should be asked.

338
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:44,935
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the traffic study required?

339
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,157
[SPEAKER_25]: You mean for the original permit?

340
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:52,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for the original permit.

341
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:56,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for the permit, is one needed for this type of business?

342
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know either.

343
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We can request it.

344
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if we can request it, but I don't know.

345
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, legally, I don't know if it's required for this type of business either.

346
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:09,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another question that needs to be answered.

347
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:15,483
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, Attorney Blake did say he believed it's within reason for us to request it, so.

348
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:17,685
[SPEAKER_22]: You could certainly request it.

349
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:24,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Parker, would you read back the motion to me?

350
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, my only question is

351
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:33,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Is vice president bears amendment or is vice president bears motion.

352
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:37,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that include representatives lift of lift present or is that without public meeting?

353
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:38,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

354
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:38,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

355
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:41,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm taking comments there.

356
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So with them, you want that in the motion?

357
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's necessary, but feel free to include it.

358
00:35:50,219 --> 00:36:04,968
[SPEAKER_11]: So Vice President Bears moved to continue the public hearing and refer to the Committee of the Whole with legal counsel, with Traffic and Transportation Director Blake, and with a request for a traffic study, and also including representatives from Lyft.

359
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:14,074
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, do we need a roll call for this, yes, or no?

360
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:17,356
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not approved, it's just moving through.

361
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:18,817
[SPEAKER_11]: It is your option.

362
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:21,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go with a roll call.

363
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:22,495
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have it.

364
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,999
[SPEAKER_13]: President again, that's our last roll call.

365
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,100
[SPEAKER_02]: President again, that's the roll call.

366
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask for the roll call.

367
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask for it.

368
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:31,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

369
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:31,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll ask for the roll call.

370
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:32,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

371
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:34,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Bears.

372
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:35,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

373
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:36,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

374
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:37,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

375
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:38,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

376
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:38,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

377
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:39,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

378
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:39,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

379
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:40,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

380
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:41,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

381
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:42,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

382
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:42,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

383
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

384
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,530
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

385
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,212
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm gonna defer as the negative motion passes.

386
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, before we move on, a question to the clerk.

387
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:53,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, why are we advertising in the Somerville Journal?

[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Vice-President Bears.

414
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:21,031
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

415
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,653
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

416
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:23,553
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

417
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:29,078
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations.

418
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:33,883
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-556, petition for secondhand articles licensed by Thomas O'Leary, 60 Otis Street, Somerville, Mass.

419
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,425
[SPEAKER_25]: 02154 and Marybeth Coughlin, 82 Bromfield Road,

420
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:40,238
[SPEAKER_25]: Somerville Mass 02144 for Medford Jewelry Inc.

421
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:43,859
[SPEAKER_25]: doing business as Roland's Jewelers, 70 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

422
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,300
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we have the petitioner with us?

423
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,321
[SPEAKER_25]: Please come up and then turning over to Councilor Sparapelle once again.

424
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:51,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

425
00:39:51,862 --> 00:40:02,545
[SPEAKER_13]: To get into this on a similar basis, Roland's has been an absolute backbone business partner

426
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:19,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Turning, turning over new ownership and the business is going to stay the same.

427
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:22,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I was saying the same, same employees.

428
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's great.

429
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,341
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great because I know that we might, we found out that when we were closed, it,

430
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:39,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It was around Christmas time, I think, and it was devastating for us, because it's easy for a lazy husband to buy his jewelry at once, and the quality's phenomenal.

431
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:46,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate your business, your respect to our community, and I see everything in order, Madam President, so I will move forward.

432
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:47,953
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

433
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:48,253
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

434
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:48,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

435
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:49,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

436
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:49,254
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

437
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:14,738
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-557 petition for secondhand articles licensed by Kamzen, Javado, 43 Gold Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02132 for pro repair, 19 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

438
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:16,699
[SPEAKER_25]: Is the petitioner with us?

439
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,862
[SPEAKER_25]: Please come up and I will once again turn to Councilor Scarpelli.

440
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:25,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thank you, Madam President.

441
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:26,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here this evening.

442
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:29,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is similar to the conversation I'm having with Lyft.

443
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:30,985
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a new business, correct?

444
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

445
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:37,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have some questions that I really needed to be answered by a city solicitor.

446
00:41:38,493 --> 00:41:46,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that this would fall in the same category if you, you know, if you persuade me differently but I just want you to be aware it's not personal.

447
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:54,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not I have questions but I don't have the person to answer them just yet so maybe we can add this to the, the, the.

448
00:41:55,919 --> 00:42:17,013
[SPEAKER_19]: community of the whole meeting if that's appropriate but while you're here right now can you give us a description what this business is so so this business is about uh fixing smart devices including phones tablets ipads and laptops and also we're gonna sell uh phones too so that's what it's about okay president bears

449
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:18,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

450
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed in here, this is 19 Salem Street.

451
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:24,635
[SPEAKER_07]: This used to be Medford Electronics, John Costa's location.

452
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that was a transfer in here.

453
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:36,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're gonna be repairing small electronics and selling mobile devices and stuff like, is there, you know, I hadn't been in Medford Electronics for a while.

454
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that significantly different than what Mr. Costas was doing?

455
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:40,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's significantly different.

456
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:40,861
[SPEAKER_07]: With the sales?

457
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, Mr. Costas did a lot with audio.

458
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:50,924
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not.

459
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:52,485
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the second store that he owns.

460
00:42:52,725 --> 00:42:53,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

461
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,767
[SPEAKER_02]: He owns two different properties there.

462
00:42:54,987 --> 00:42:55,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

463
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:55,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

464
00:42:56,228 --> 00:43:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, again, so the questions I would have is, you know, moving forward, what can be sold as, you know, what's titled the, where is it?

465
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:09,764
[SPEAKER_06]: secondhand articles.

466
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:14,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's, that's what the question that I need answered, then what is second.

467
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:25,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we grant this petition, and the business falls through, it would start with cell phones, then all of a sudden, no disrespect to you, then we have chainsaws and, and power tools.

468
00:43:25,357 --> 00:43:29,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these are the questions that I have with our city solicitor, making sure that

469
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,544
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that it fits the neighborhood.

470
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:40,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that's important so I would, I would ask the table this and reference this again at the committee the whole meeting if that's okay.

471
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:41,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

472
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:42,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

473
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:46,124
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion any further discussion on the council.

474
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,215
[SPEAKER_25]: the table and to move to that same committee, the whole Councilor Scarpelli?

475
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:53,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

476
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:54,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to make this.

477
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:56,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to drag this out.

478
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that we have answered the questions.

479
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And if those questions are acceptable, that we move forward and have you open and prosper here in Medford.

480
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:07,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure we do our due diligence.

481
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:12,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So please forgive me that I'm delaying this a little bit, but I want to make sure we have the right questions answered.

482
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:14,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, if I may suggest,

483
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:19,170
[SPEAKER_07]: not go to the same meeting, because we may be waiting for a traffic study at this point.

484
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:24,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so maybe we could, you know, set a separate one maybe before the meeting next week.

485
00:44:24,212 --> 00:44:30,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you have a busy schedule, Madam President, but I don't think this, it's just a few questions that we really need to solicit.

486
00:44:30,994 --> 00:44:33,035
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why adding it there, it wouldn't take long.

487
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:41,097
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we can have a committee of the whole meeting just to answer some of these questions and give us some guidance as we move forward, maybe a separate meeting for that, that'd be great.

488
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:43,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal please, I think legal is important.

489
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:50,734
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep, and that may, I appreciate that, and the timing may depend on availability of legal counsel.

490
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:54,016
[SPEAKER_25]: So we will, I will schedule with all due urgencies.

491
00:44:54,536 --> 00:45:02,381
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just sometimes we cannot get legal counsel within a timeframe we'd like, but I will absolutely work to schedule as quickly as soon as this motion passes.

492
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:05,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

493
00:45:06,143 --> 00:45:06,343
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

494
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council?

495
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:13,508
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to move this paper to a committee of the whole,

496
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:21,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so the motion to table and also move this paper to me the whole seconded by second Councilor Knight all those in favor.

497
00:45:22,163 --> 00:45:23,324
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed.

498
00:45:23,364 --> 00:45:23,744
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

499
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:49,097
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-558, petition for class two auto dealer license by Tiago Sertori-Murciano, 132 Moore Street Revere, Massachusetts 02155 for Icon Motors Groups, Inc.

[SPEAKER_25]: 357 Mystic Avenue, Medford, Mass.

502
00:45:55,825 --> 00:45:58,567
[SPEAKER_25]: Please come up, and then I'll also refer to Councilor Scarpelli.

503
00:45:58,627 --> 00:45:59,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

504
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:12,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that Icon Motors is actually still, if we can, if Mr. Marciano can tell us that it's, the business is still staying the same.

505
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:12,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

506
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:18,179
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just the ownership is, you're now gonna be the sole owner, I know it was Partners, correct?

507
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, now it's Partners, and you'll be the sole owner, and it decides to have a new name.

508
00:46:22,662 --> 00:46:33,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Right new corporation in order to have that I need to apply for the new license under the icon name Okay, and so just changing the icon to icon and I know that um, I know that

509
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:37,705
[SPEAKER_06]: hope the practices stay the same and your support to our community.

510
00:46:38,185 --> 00:46:44,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've been very active with our youth organizations and donating and being active as a member of our community.

511
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:48,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that a lot of people from Medford work for you and we appreciate that.

512
00:46:48,711 --> 00:47:02,859
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that there was one concern I think that I mentioned to you that the parking off street, I know that you have a big lot, but I think the concerns whenever, you know, that especially not as much on Mystic Ave, but as the parking of,

513
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:06,128
[SPEAKER_06]: vehicles on the street.

514
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that happen too often?

515
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:15,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it something that we're gonna make sure that we can keep an eye on that and make sure that it's under control and we're not taking advantage of that?

516
00:47:15,112 --> 00:47:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

517
00:47:16,452 --> 00:47:18,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I see everything in order.

518
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:25,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another well-run, respectable entity here in this community and I would support to move forward.

519
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:26,376
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

520
00:47:26,396 --> 00:47:27,417
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello.

521
00:47:27,437 --> 00:47:28,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, ma'am.

522
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:30,058
[SPEAKER_02]: How many employees you got at this?

523
00:47:30,258 --> 00:47:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I see on the box it says unemployed, but there's no-

524
00:47:34,169 --> 00:47:34,629
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 employees.

525
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:39,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a workman's comp policy.

526
00:47:39,632 --> 00:47:41,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Workman's compensation policy.

527
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:45,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I put it on the file when I send an application.

528
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:51,559
[SPEAKER_17]: So if it's not there, I can provide one, two, three, because I do have it.

529
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:52,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a workman's comp policy.

530
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that the employees are covered in the event of an accident or something.

531
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:03,616
[SPEAKER_25]: It does say on the agenda that I know it's not here but it says that we do have it on file.

532
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:08,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you can make sure that the clerk has one on file.

533
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:10,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh sure, that'd be great.

534
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:12,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you can just put it with this.

535
00:48:12,864 --> 00:48:13,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

536
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:15,146
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an affidavit and a policy number.

537
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:16,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Three pages.

538
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, four pages for the back and search your halfway guard.

539

583
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:07,000

585

00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:23,809

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

608
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:03,061
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

609
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:07,840
[SPEAKER_25]: No, really affirmative for the negative the motion fails.

610
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:21,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Going back to 22-560 regarding the appropriation request for a new senior planner position day October 19 2022 respectfully request use of available funds in the amount of $55,267 and planning development and sustainability salaries

611
00:52:24,562 --> 00:52:35,651
[SPEAKER_25]: account 0102975110 to establish the new position of senior planner or request is before you to add the senior planner position to cap 14 paper number 22-502.

612
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:43,077
[SPEAKER_25]: The appropriation funds the position for a total of 32.4 weeks in FY 23 with an expected higher date of November 15 2022.

613
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:43,838
[SPEAKER_25]: As discussed in the September 9

614
00:52:47,603 --> 00:53:02,455
[SPEAKER_25]: 2022 memo from myself and PDS director Alicia Hunt explaining the cap amendment request, that position will be funded using the available salary for the land use planner position included in FY23 PDS budget, a petition that is currently vacant and which PDS will not fill that senior planner position is approved.

615
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:03,456
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

616
00:53:03,476 --> 00:53:09,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Hunt is available to speak to this request as well as paper 22-502 and answer any questions you may have.

617
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

618
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:13,764
[SPEAKER_25]: Director Hunt.

619
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:24,895
[SPEAKER_20]: staff planner for quite a long time now.

620
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:30,097
[SPEAKER_20]: And we are looking to put a new position in the CAF system.

621
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:35,579
[SPEAKER_20]: We would keep the position of staff planner because we do have people who fill that role.

622
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:39,121
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we would create a new position called senior planner.

623
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:43,322
[SPEAKER_20]: The open vacant staff planner position would not be filled.

624
00:53:43,782 --> 00:53:45,763
[SPEAKER_20]: And this position would be advertised.

625
00:53:46,948 --> 00:53:49,330
[SPEAKER_20]: We have reason to believe that we can fill this position.

626
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:59,256
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm wondering if I should go on on that, but we've reason to believe that it would be filled in a very timely manner if it was posted as a senior planner position.

627
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:01,598
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

628
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:02,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice Mayor Bears.

629
00:54:02,598 --> 00:54:03,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

630
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:05,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Director Hunt for bringing this forward.

631
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:14,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I think something this council has been incredibly focused on is expanding our capacity when it comes to planning development and housing support.

632
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:30,443
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, on larger issues, but this seems to me to be an area where we need more staff support.

633
00:54:31,203 --> 00:54:33,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm supportive of having a senior planner position.

634
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need more people working in planning and economic development.

635
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:39,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm generally supportive of this.

636
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:46,690
[SPEAKER_07]: My main objections to how these were being proposed in the past was that they were not coming with an appropriation request.

637
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And that seemed to me to be in violation of Massachusetts general law.

638
00:54:50,272 --> 00:54:52,373
[SPEAKER_07]: This has come to us with an appropriation request.

639
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,721
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am of the mind to approve it.

640
00:54:56,662 --> 00:55:17,513
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I think when we're talking about having a comprehensive plan, talking about having a new zoning ordinance, talking about the sheer volume of great things that are gonna happen to this community because of the work of this council when it comes to our zoning recodification, I think it makes a lot of sense that we have the staff in place and planning to make sure that all of that fruit and labor can come to fruition as quickly as possible.

641
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:18,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I'm in support of this tonight.

642
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:19,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

643
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,039
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

644
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:26,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is 55,032 weeks.

645
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:30,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So what would be the full full salary for full year?

646
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:35,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I Madam President, I do have that.

647
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:37,349
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is this position.

648
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:46,095
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's appropriate for me to say this is this position at CAF at step five of CAF 14.

649
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:48,977
[SPEAKER_20]: That is because we have somebody on staff

650
00:55:49,502 --> 00:56:00,492
[SPEAKER_20]: who is currently at CAF 13, step five, who is highly qualified and has served this role in other communities, but she would not take the position at a reduction in salary.

651
00:56:00,992 --> 00:56:04,235
[SPEAKER_20]: It's currently the staff planner position is CAF 12.

652
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:09,240
[SPEAKER_06]: She will not go from the 13 to a 12.

653
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,643
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the salary of that position for a full year?

654
00:56:13,584 --> 00:56:14,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, it's here.

655
00:56:15,964 --> 00:56:24,731
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I apologize, on my spreadsheet, I have the weekly salary, let me just multiply that.

656
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:24,731
$58,621.

657
00:56:25,351 --> 00:56:39,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we still have that position that if that person moves up, they deserve that money, obviously, but I opposed and I tabled for the fact that

658
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:47,375
[SPEAKER_06]: This council has openly talked about what we've been saying, what have we been asking for, and we haven't getting it.

659
00:56:49,016 --> 00:57:09,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, until we see some movement where we have our unions that are coming to us that haven't had a contract, and we have some caps that were approved that we're still waiting on answers that we never approved, and then asking for money papers that we've asked for,

660
00:57:10,532 --> 00:57:13,013
[SPEAKER_06]: for, I don't know, Councilor, Councilor Mejia years.

661
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:15,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get to that in my speech.

662
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:21,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm waiting to see with this situation, I'm gonna stand strong.

663
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:30,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand, I respect Councilor Beaz's conversation with how important this is.

664
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree, I think we need it.

665
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:35,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we don't need it, but right now, I don't think that,

666
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:39,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep saying yes to all what's asked for.

667
00:57:40,777 --> 00:57:43,019
[SPEAKER_06]: We are just a rubber stamp.

668
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:51,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We need answers, questions answered for us, for this question, to give us strength.

669
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:58,388
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep voting yes, until they understand that no, we're not gonna vote on anything until we have a city solicitor.

670
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:05,272
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that we can't vote on money papers till there's respect for other unions or positions that haven't been filled yet.

671
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:10,469
[SPEAKER_06]: We have positions in the city hall that haven't been filled that are vital positions.

672
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: This is adding another position that we already have a director and we have an assistant.

673
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:18,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least it's stable right now.

674
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:28,939
[SPEAKER_06]: We're voting on something and moving more money to an entity that at least is stable in our stable definition.

675
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is why I can't support it.

676
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:35,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing personal, I know how you work and I know how your team is working.

677
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:48,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, this is fundamentally wrong to ask this until we have the entities in place that we can get answers, because we're not getting answers.

678
00:58:49,779 --> 00:58:50,119
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not.

679
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:57,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, if I just might, I've been involved in trying to hire for several of my peer positions.

680
00:58:58,312 --> 00:59:01,574
[SPEAKER_20]: is extremely hard to hire for municipal positions right now.

681
00:59:01,674 --> 00:59:11,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I personally am aware that Malden and Somerville are also hiring for city solicitors right now.

682
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,202
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a very difficult hiring situation.

683
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:18,464
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are trying to fill those positions.

684
00:59:18,524 --> 00:59:24,347
[SPEAKER_20]: And while I can't speak on behalf of our chief of staff and our HR department, I've served on several of these hiring

685
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:29,971
[SPEAKER_20]: committee is trying to find qualified people to fill these positions as well, which we think is very important.

686
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:36,692
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will say this is one of the few places where you actually have the power to adjust something.

687
00:59:37,193 --> 00:59:43,194
[SPEAKER_20]: We do have a position that has been open in my office for 16 months, and it's really putting a burden on the rest of the staff.

688
00:59:43,734 --> 00:59:49,855
[SPEAKER_20]: We will be posting a full-time housing planner position and a full-time CPA position.

689
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:54,056
[SPEAKER_20]: The housing planner is a staff planner position, so that's on the CAF.

690
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:57,550
[SPEAKER_20]: And both of those are funded off the general fund budget.

691
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,751
[SPEAKER_20]: So as in one through CDBG and one through CPA.

692
01:00:01,492 --> 01:00:05,253
[SPEAKER_20]: So that this will really help the burden on our staff at this time.

693
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:16,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So Madam President, I appreciate that, but not just city solicitor, but I'm talking about other empty directors positions that we've had in a long time here.

694
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:17,880
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some serious concerns.

695
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand, I appreciate you sharing that with us with city solicitor, because I understand that as well.

696
01:00:22,601 --> 01:00:40,887
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I said, there are other major needs that if we had to move, you know, CAF money around, I would rather move CAF money around to make sure we can bring in a qualified, you know, experienced city assessor or a qualified IT director.

697
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:43,468
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I'm saying to my colleagues.

698
01:00:44,388 --> 01:00:50,074
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need, if this is where we need to move some money to make sure we have it, this is where it should be needed.

699
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:53,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I don't think we have the stability.

700
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:57,394
[SPEAKER_06]: in other locations to be approving capital, approving $88,000.

701
01:00:58,735 --> 01:01:04,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, you know, you want to talk about hurting, let's talk to those teachers that haven't gotten a contract.

702
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:07,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the fire and they're hurting.

703
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

704
01:01:09,581 --> 01:01:14,884
[SPEAKER_20]: To be clear, this money is not being appropriated from free cash or any other.

705
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:18,407
[SPEAKER_20]: This is money that is actually already in our office's budget.

706
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:20,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight.

707
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:28,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Our city is an absolute human resource nightmare.

708
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:37,004
[SPEAKER_15]: That's been clear, it's been well documented across many, many news media outlets, social media, and the like, right?

709
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,525
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can all agree, human resources is a problem here in the city.

710
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:47,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And financially, financially this administration practices absolutely zero fiscal constraint.

711
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,712
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, zero fiscal constraint.

712
01:01:50,092 --> 01:02:03,843
[SPEAKER_15]: For literal years, literal years, not weeks, not months, literal years, this council has been begging for quarterly reports from our auditor outlining the financial health and well-being of this community.

713
01:02:05,745 --> 01:02:09,308
[SPEAKER_16]: The city council, which is responsible for the appropriation of funds, right?

714
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:13,291
[SPEAKER_15]: The Harry Truman function of government, the buck stops here, right?

715
01:02:14,637 --> 01:02:16,938
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been asking for these documents for literal years.

716
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:21,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Meetings about the financial health and well-being of the city, and we can't get that.

717
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:22,241
[SPEAKER_15]: All right?

718
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:28,784
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been asking for copies of the monthly Warren articles, which are documents that show where our money's being spent.

719
01:02:29,324 --> 01:02:30,085
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't get that.

720
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:37,349
[SPEAKER_15]: I get a response in my email today from our city auditor, our CFO, our finance director.

721
01:02:37,909 --> 01:02:46,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Due to our current staffing levels and the backlog of conciliations, our reports would be based on unaudited and possibly incomplete data.

722
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:50,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Every effort is being made to bring this data up to date.

723
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:57,477
[SPEAKER_16]: This office cannot say that these desired reports would be accurate to any degree expected.

724
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's spend more money though.

725
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:02,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go spend more money, create more jobs.

726
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,392
[SPEAKER_16]: A job, by the way, that it sounds like the position's already spoken for.

727
01:03:06,172 --> 01:03:08,774
[SPEAKER_09]: A job that doesn't exist, that's already spoken for.

728
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:22,065
[SPEAKER_16]: With a report from our CFO that pretty much says, I'd love to give you an update on the financial well-being of this community, but if I did it, it's garbage in, garbage out.

729
01:03:23,005 --> 01:03:24,627
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not gonna be based on accurate information.

730
01:03:26,288 --> 01:03:29,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But the administration has the audacity to come up to us and continue to ask us to spend.

731
01:03:33,565 --> 01:03:35,026
[SPEAKER_09]: continue to ask us to spend.

732
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:38,169
[SPEAKER_16]: The buck has to stop somewhere.

733
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:41,612
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying this isn't a position that's a good position.

734
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:43,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying it's a position that's warranted.

735
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:46,996
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's as important as an assistant city solicitor to the Metro City Council.

736
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,239
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's as important as a city assessor.

737
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:53,381
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's as important as assistant city assessor.

738
01:03:53,942 --> 01:03:58,345
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we can only put cones up on every intersection around the city so many times, people are gonna run out of things to do.

739
01:03:59,157 --> 01:04:02,778
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so ultimately, I find this to be fiscally irresponsible.

740
01:04:03,518 --> 01:04:06,879
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, how can we as a body sit here and take vote after vote, multiple votes?

741
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:08,759
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not talking one vote or two votes or three votes.

742
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,359
[SPEAKER_15]: We've taken dozens of votes on this.

743
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:17,881
[SPEAKER_16]: We've asked the city solicitor to come up with an ordinance mandating the administration to provide us with this information because they refuse to do it.

744
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:25,402
[SPEAKER_16]: But here we are being asked again to create a new job, to spend more money.

745
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:28,223
[SPEAKER_16]: I want us to all think back to that night.

746
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:43,376
[SPEAKER_16]: In late June, when we sat here, and the mayor was taking money out of the public utilities account to keep the lights on, to move money around, to provide this council with the demands that we made.

747
01:04:44,717 --> 01:04:46,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was the only way we could do it, because there's no more money.

748
01:04:47,578 --> 01:04:49,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Count the number of appropriation requests that have come since that time.

749
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:55,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be fiscal stewards.

750
01:04:55,942 --> 01:04:56,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be responsible.

751
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:58,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't support this paper this evening.

752
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:00,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

753
01:05:03,456 --> 01:05:04,276
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell.

754
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:05,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Alicia, for being here.

755
01:05:05,817 --> 01:05:10,919
[SPEAKER_24]: I support this paper.

756
01:05:11,439 --> 01:05:17,281
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that some of my councilors won't feel heard that I'm saying that, and I regret that.

757
01:05:18,702 --> 01:05:22,163
[SPEAKER_24]: I do hear you on this issue in particular.

758
01:05:22,183 --> 01:05:25,264
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear you about the buck has to stop somewhere.

759
01:05:25,484 --> 01:05:27,645
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear you that we need to find what leverage we can

760
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:33,661
[SPEAKER_24]: to get the reports that we have been asking for, to get the level of accountability that we have been asking for.

761
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:47,252
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope you look at my past actions and know that I agree with you and that my metric for what I can support and what affects to our city departments I can condone just happened to be different and that is not personal.

762
01:05:48,513 --> 01:05:54,277
[SPEAKER_24]: In this case, this is not an appropriation from Greek cash that makes a difference to me.

763
01:05:54,437 --> 01:05:56,359
[SPEAKER_24]: It already exists within the OPDS budget.

764
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:06,272
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition, you know, I mean, I think that we'd all agree that the, you know, in many ways, the situation here in City Hall is not stable, as Councilor Knight alluded to.

765
01:06:07,993 --> 01:06:22,717
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I've spoken to staff in City Hall who, you know, despite their commitment to this community and to public service, they too are feeling the pull to leave, to go to the private sector, to find jobs in other municipalities, because they feel there is no future for them here.

766
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:25,049
[SPEAKER_24]: No opportunity for growth or promotion.

767
01:06:26,271 --> 01:06:32,101
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't be creating additional reasons for the qualified staff that we do have to leave.

768
01:06:34,603 --> 01:06:43,868
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, and just circling back to what I feel is the broader issue, you know, to me, the foundational issue, this is, you know, we're a community, putting the HR problems aside, we're going through growing pains.

769
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:50,951
[SPEAKER_24]: This is the type of work and role that will help us evolve thoughtfully and appropriately and intentionally and plan for the future that we want.

770
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:57,915
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to hold our future hostage to the problems that we as a body cannot solve on our own.

771
01:06:59,036 --> 01:06:59,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

772
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,437
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

773
01:07:01,557 --> 01:07:02,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice Mayor Bears.

774
01:07:02,297 --> 01:07:03,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President.

775
01:07:05,832 --> 01:07:06,713
[SPEAKER_13]: A few things here.

776
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:25,885
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to fiscal stewardship, when it comes to this council doing its work and holding the administration accountable, sure, we've taken some votes in the past since June 30th to appropriate certain funds.

777
01:07:26,765 --> 01:07:31,068
[SPEAKER_07]: We've taken some votes not to, we've taken some votes to table things, we've taken some votes to approve things.

778
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:43,457
[SPEAKER_07]: In the totality of that, I think all seven of us have been incredibly clear about what we want from this administration and our demands for basic transparency and accountability.

779
01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:59,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've also been focused enough to take things on a case-by-case basis, look at the merits and the benefits and the costs of a specific case, and also factor that into our decision-making.

780
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:03,100
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a bunch of papers on here tonight where we're gonna have this conversation.

781
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:17,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's the next paper, it's the, maybe not the paper after that, but it's the, and then, you know, there's like three more papers in the next, you know, however long it takes us, but we're gonna continue to have this conversation about finances and about caps.

782
01:08:18,203 --> 01:08:21,446
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one, even the mayor's own attorney says needs five votes.

783
01:08:21,466 --> 01:08:23,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So that one's not happening tonight.

784
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:26,170
[SPEAKER_07]: If it seems, you know, I don't wanna call a vote before we've called it.

785
01:08:26,911 --> 01:08:28,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not just giving a blank check.

786
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,034
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not just saying yes to everything.

787
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:36,916
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually an opportunity for us to help address the human resource nightmare that Councilor Knight is talking about.

788
01:08:38,857 --> 01:08:41,339
[SPEAKER_07]: In a functioning government, this would be a no brainer.

789
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,602
[SPEAKER_07]: A mayor would come to the city council.

790
01:08:45,302 --> 01:08:47,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks Siri, probably Googling no brainer.

791
01:08:48,134 --> 01:09:09,299
[SPEAKER_07]: a fully functioning, communicative, collaborative government, a mayor would come with this request to not appropriate new funds, not transfer funds from one department to another, but to adjust funding within an existing department to make sure that we can hire or keep a current staff member at a slightly higher position, a senior planner, and then hire someone to replace them in their current cap 12 role.

792
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,539
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be a no-brainer.

793
01:09:11,019 --> 01:09:12,220
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't even be having this argument.

794
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:17,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we know why we are having this argument, because it's not a no-brainer, because the collaboration's not there and the transparency's not there.

795
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:19,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I accept all of that.

796
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:25,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to have that conversation I think there's going to be votes where we try to hold the administration accountable later in this meeting.

797
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:32,077
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think on this specific issue where this person will be doing the work of implementing the good work that we've done.

798
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:38,131
[SPEAKER_07]: where we're not appropriating new money, where we're basically saying, so we appropriated a land use planner at CAF 13.

799
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: It turns out we're probably gonna be better off having a senior planner at CAF 14, and then someone at CAF 12.

800
01:09:44,015 --> 01:09:46,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not not holding the administration accountable.

801
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:47,777
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not being a poor fiscal steward.

802
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:49,118
[SPEAKER_07]: The money's already been appropriated.

803
01:09:49,438 --> 01:09:51,339
[SPEAKER_07]: No new money is going towards this.

804
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,542
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this one to me is one that I'm okay with.

805
01:09:56,163 --> 01:10:05,289
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of other things that have happened that I'm not okay with, and I think in this case, the specific case facts of this issue merit approval.

806
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:21,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the next paper doesn't, but that doesn't mean we're not holding strong, that we're not trying to do whatever is within our power to make sure that this administration is accountable and that the people of Medford have the information that they need.

807
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:32,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would move to approve this paper as well as to, yeah, I would move to approve this paper.

808
01:10:34,073 --> 01:10:34,913
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

809
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:35,934
[SPEAKER_25]: Go ahead, Councilor Sanders.

810
01:10:35,974 --> 01:10:36,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello.

811
01:10:37,315 --> 01:10:39,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

812
01:10:39,456 --> 01:10:48,442
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe that there is a unanimous, there is a unanimous support behind the rails for financial accountability, for fiscal transparency,

813
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:54,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I am for increasing leverage and to make sure our city is making the right financial choices.

814
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:59,365
[SPEAKER_21]: But we also have to, in my opinion, realize the facts of the situation.

815
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:14,109
[SPEAKER_21]: I fear that in our debate about this specific issue, we've fallen for a red herring that equates a very absolutist definition of accountability with

816
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:19,853
[SPEAKER_21]: fiscal responsibility, which I believe in this case the money has already been appropriated to your department.

817
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:27,158
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not taking money out of free cash, you know, there's financially that's that's that's the reality of the situation.

818
01:11:28,759 --> 01:11:32,481
[SPEAKER_21]: The other reality of the situation is as stable as things might currently be.

819
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:38,125
[SPEAKER_21]: We also know that municipalities around us are competing to hire more planners and

820
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,803
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not saying this is what your office staff are thinking, right?

821
01:11:43,843 --> 01:11:54,530
[SPEAKER_21]: But who's to say that in a few months or in a few years, they don't see a lack of opportunity to move forward in our community and they just leave for another community, right?

822
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,272
[SPEAKER_21]: We are also competitors in this market.

823
01:11:57,725 --> 01:11:59,745
[SPEAKER_21]: for planners, for city planners.

824
01:12:00,265 --> 01:12:04,826
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that leads me to my ultimate question that I always ask.

825
01:12:06,286 --> 01:12:25,430
[SPEAKER_21]: When I take votes like this, and I think really, when we think about how the question of accountability, how we're gonna hold the administration to account, I think this is the question that's gonna guide me from item to item, is if this is gonna tangibly improve the lives of our residents.

826
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:39,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely, it will to have an experienced senior planner doing the work of the senior plan that doing this planning work is absolutely going to improve the lives of our residents.

827
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:54,715
[SPEAKER_21]: And that is I think ultimately the goal, the unified goal of the city council, you know we've, we've, I think there's a lot of agreement that we need to move forward on housing production on sustainability on the climate plan on phase two of zoning.

828
01:12:56,995 --> 01:12:59,077
[SPEAKER_21]: support like this in your office, right?

829
01:12:59,197 --> 01:13:01,259
[SPEAKER_21]: To get our own priorities through.

830
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:09,826
[SPEAKER_21]: And so for that reason, I know others might disagree with me, but that's why I would vote yes on this paper tonight.

831
01:13:10,406 --> 01:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, it's item by item.

832
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:17,172
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we need to ask that question for everything before us.

833
01:13:17,252 --> 01:13:24,018
[SPEAKER_21]: But in this specific case, I believe that it ticks my boxes.

834
01:13:25,678 --> 01:13:26,719
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

835
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:27,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Ferraro.

836
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:28,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

837
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:33,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to support this tonight, because I think it's a valuable position.

838
01:13:33,803 --> 01:13:34,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we do need it.

839
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:50,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I work, I don't think anybody calls your office more than me, as far as our development, but you know, we talked a few weeks ago about being a partner with the administration.

840
01:13:53,276 --> 01:13:54,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks ago, we talked about that.

841
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:57,263
[SPEAKER_02]: but about being partners with him.

842
01:13:58,124 --> 01:13:59,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see no partnership.

843
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:06,291
[SPEAKER_02]: All I see is things coming our way, things coming our way to approve, and we're getting nothing in return.

844
01:14:07,752 --> 01:14:16,140
[SPEAKER_02]: We send papers over, we make requests, and it's, I mean, I hate to say this, but this council is becoming a rubber stamp for the man.

845
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,561
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

846
01:14:18,261 --> 01:14:20,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a valuable position,

847
01:14:22,152 --> 01:14:24,555
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be a little give and take here with this administration.

848
01:14:24,575 --> 01:14:26,537
[SPEAKER_02]: There's none.

849
01:14:26,597 --> 01:14:29,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.

850
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:38,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time we ask for something in return, I don't see anything we're asking for coming back at us.

851
01:14:39,593 --> 01:14:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I gotta say,

852
01:14:43,297 --> 01:14:48,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I probably will support this thing, you know, because, because I feel it's a real worthwhile position.

853
01:14:48,721 --> 01:14:53,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm just tired of, of, of no give and take with, with this, with these people here in this administration.

854
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:55,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

855
01:14:56,046 --> 01:14:56,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Carballo.

856
01:14:56,886 --> 01:14:57,467
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice Senator Bears.

857
01:14:57,647 --> 01:14:58,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

858
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilor Carballo's point is well taken.

859
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:04,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when I, my point was earlier about a fully functioning administration, right?

860
01:15:05,052 --> 01:15:05,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this should be a no brainer.

861
01:15:05,993 --> 01:15:07,414
[SPEAKER_07]: This should be procedural and it's not.

862
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:09,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reasons for that are myriad.

863
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:34,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say there's one office that does respond every time I call, and there's one office that has been coming down to our council meetings at Beck and call, you know, and it is the PDS office we've met on comp plan we've met on housing production plan we've met on climate plan I think we're working on the housing trust the housing stability ordinance so right, you know, I agree with you, city government and administration should work where it comes from the top down.

864
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:38,095
[SPEAKER_07]: This is working in spite of the failure.

865
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:45,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And that, you know, it sucks to say, but you know, that's a reason I can support this.

866
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:50,319
[SPEAKER_07]: This office is working well and apparently working well in spite of a lot of other issues.

867
01:15:50,419 --> 01:15:57,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is gonna help us have the resources we need to continue the work that we wanna do when it comes to planning and development.

868
01:15:57,941 --> 01:16:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll leave it at that.

869
01:16:01,843 --> 01:16:02,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

870
01:16:02,763 --> 01:16:05,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

871
01:16:05,942 --> 01:16:06,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the position spoken for?

872
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:09,564
[SPEAKER_20]: No position is ever final.

873
01:16:09,804 --> 01:16:14,926
[SPEAKER_20]: It will be posted publicly and there will be applications and there will be interviews.

874
01:16:15,466 --> 01:16:21,369
[SPEAKER_20]: I am aware that there is a staff person on staff who will be applying for this position.

875
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:24,030
[SPEAKER_20]: They are very qualified for this position.

876
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,551
[SPEAKER_20]: So take that as you will.

877
01:16:27,211 --> 01:16:30,933
[SPEAKER_20]: I will interview if other, I have been advertising for the staff planner.

878
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:34,615
[SPEAKER_20]: We've advertised that in paid locations over the past 16 months.

879
01:16:35,434 --> 01:16:40,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I've interviewed four or five people and none of them have been qualified enough for us.

880
01:16:40,818 --> 01:16:53,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to invoke rule 20 from our city council rules, and this is a finance paper that's going to be laid on the table for one week's time, regardless of what happens tonight, because we have the right to do that as a Councilor.

881
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:57,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I was the first time I've seen this appropriation request on the council floor.

882
01:16:58,112 --> 01:17:00,514
[SPEAKER_15]: And as such, I'm going to vote my rights under Rule 20.

883
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:01,234
[SPEAKER_15]: It's old Rule 20.

884
01:17:01,274 --> 01:17:03,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what new rule is, but we leave them around.

885
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:05,477
[SPEAKER_15]: We never got copies of the rules after we approved them.

886
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:07,097
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll have them posted up on the website, I don't think.

887
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:08,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it is Rule 20.

888
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:10,419
[SPEAKER_15]: It's definitely Rule 20.

889
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:15,122
[SPEAKER_25]: I do see Chief of... Thank you, Councilor.

890
01:17:15,142 --> 01:17:17,684
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do just see Chief of Staff, Ms.

891
01:17:17,764 --> 01:17:18,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Aaron.

892
01:17:18,124 --> 01:17:20,245
[SPEAKER_25]: Did you have something you would like to add?

893
01:17:21,098 --> 01:17:21,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Morell.

894
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:28,262
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, I mean, I know that there's not debate on invoking that rule that Councilor Knight invoked.

895
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:33,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the discussion and debate that's occurred this evening.

896
01:17:34,305 --> 01:17:49,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to add that, you know, there are, as I understand it, there's a number of resolutions that the city council passes that go before the mayor that get routed to the appropriate department and get responded to.

897
01:17:50,312 --> 01:18:00,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Caraviello, just want to let you know in particular that I'm presently working on a resolution that you had proposed most recently with regard to the IT department.

898
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,822
[SPEAKER_12]: I expect you'll see that resolution response within the week, if not shortly thereafter.

899
01:18:07,522 --> 01:18:15,427
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to mention that there is a collaborative attempt to respond to these resolutions that are passed.

900
01:18:15,467 --> 01:18:18,969
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to note that we're working hard on a number of things.

901
01:18:20,603 --> 01:18:28,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, PDS director hunt with her comments with regard to the difficulty in hiring that it's not only with the city solicitor.

902
01:18:28,766 --> 01:18:30,667
[SPEAKER_12]: It's with regard to a number of other positions.

903
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:32,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarapelli.

904
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:33,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for acknowledging that.

905
01:18:33,628 --> 01:18:35,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you have that experience in your work.

906
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:36,949
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot.

907
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:41,971
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot going on in these number a number of different things, and I just wanted to provide some commentary.

908
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:42,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

909
01:18:43,811 --> 01:18:47,693
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanted to offer you the opportunity on this paper, even though it was off motion to be tabled.

910
01:18:49,303 --> 01:18:53,266
[SPEAKER_25]: We're gonna stop the debate on this now, but I would appreciate you keeping comments to the paper before us.

911
01:18:53,766 --> 01:18:55,667
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello.

912
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:56,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

913
01:18:57,048 --> 01:19:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you for working on the, I think that more important to me is for the last three years, I've asked for the legal bills of this community.

914
01:19:09,236 --> 01:19:10,076
[SPEAKER_09]: When am I gonna see that?

915
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:16,941
[SPEAKER_25]: So we do have the motion from Councilor Knight to invoke rule

916
01:19:17,973 --> 01:19:19,895
[SPEAKER_25]: 20, it might be 23 now, or?

917
01:19:20,975 --> 01:19:23,597
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, may I just share like a clerical item?

918
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:31,744
[SPEAKER_20]: I would just like the council to know that in two weeks at your next meeting, I will actually be either on an airplane, depending on the timing, or have just landed.

919
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:38,629
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there's anything that people would like me to address this evening I'm here, I might be able to join via Zoom.

920
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:42,432
[SPEAKER_25]: So our next regular meeting will be on the 15th because- That's the night that I'm traveling.

921
01:19:42,452 --> 01:19:43,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I just want to know that, okay.

922
01:19:43,733 --> 01:19:46,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I just want you to know that in case there's anything you wanted me to address

923
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:57,320
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also happy to address anything in advance in writing, but I didn't want anybody to feel that I was being disrespectful by not being here, but I am gonna be on an airplane that evening.

924
01:19:58,661 --> 01:19:59,581
[SPEAKER_20]: In the city, I do.

925
01:20:00,742 --> 01:20:01,542
[SPEAKER_20]: In this building.

926
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:06,124
[SPEAKER_20]: My husband and my son believe I live here in the building.

927
01:20:14,702 --> 01:20:15,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you so much.

928
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:28,687
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Naito to invoke rule 21 to lay the paper on the table for one week, the first time introducing a finance paper, it is undebatable and we don't need to vote on that because it's our rule to just automatically lay it on the table, correct?

929
01:20:30,207 --> 01:20:32,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

930
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:33,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

931
01:20:34,148 --> 01:20:35,069
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice Chair Bears.

932
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,711
[SPEAKER_25]: We are still under communications from the mayor.

933
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:46,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins and motion to take all communications with the mayor.

934
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:47,472
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yeah.

935
01:20:50,554 --> 01:21:01,898
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we would all to do that 561 to present a formal and honorable members of the Medford City Council from Mayor Brad O'Connor regarding appropriation request for finance director.

936
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:18,531
[SPEAKER_25]: and respectfully request use of available funds in the amount of $1,205 in finance salaries account 010135510 to provide for a step increase for the finance director associated with the request before you to change the finance director position from a cap 20 to a cap 21.

937
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:26,018
[SPEAKER_25]: The finance director was hired at cap 20 step five and due to receive a step increase on the one year anniversary of his hire date, April 25, 2022.

938
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:48,641
[SPEAKER_25]: The appropriation request provides for an increase in the weekly salary for the position of cap 21 step five, starting April 23 2025, through the end of fiscal year 23 the appropriation will be funded using available funds and the finance salaries account that have accumulated due to vacancy in the assistant finance director budget manager position is there and is available to speak to this request 21.

939
01:21:51,435 --> 01:21:55,097
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a motion from Councilor Knight to put forth rule 21.

940
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:58,979
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is not debatable as a council rule to lay the paper on the table for one week.

941
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,760
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it a finance paper that we're seeing for the first time?

942
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:15,627
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do just wanna know for those folks watching, our next meeting will be on, our next regular meeting is November 15th, because we will not be having a regular meeting on the eighth, because of election day, we will be having regular meetings on Tuesday, November 15th, as well as Tuesday, November 22nd.

943
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:25,229
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-562, to President Nicole Morell and honorable members of the Medford City Council, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, propose wage amendment for library union.

1101
01:32:33,355 --> 01:32:35,696
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1102
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:36,956
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins, then Councilor Knight.

1103
01:32:37,883 --> 01:32:47,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell, I had the opportunity to meet Steve via the Solid Waste Task Force and I can say he's already very much missed on that body and elsewhere throughout the Metro community.

1104
01:32:47,447 --> 01:32:50,109
[SPEAKER_24]: So sending our deepest condolences to his family and many friends.

1105
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:51,609
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1106
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

1107
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1108
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:56,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Steve was a dear friend of mine.

1109
01:32:57,532 --> 01:33:03,575
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the first people to ever come up and volunteer to work on my first campaign.

1110
01:33:04,194 --> 01:33:17,185
[SPEAKER_15]: back in 2013 and I met him through politics going back 20 years and he was always a gentleman that I held in high regard and someone who over that period of time I was able to develop a great friendship with.

1111
01:33:17,946 --> 01:33:26,293
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to express my deep sincere condolences to the family, to Christine especially, on this sudden and tragic loss.

1112
01:33:27,433 --> 01:33:31,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Steve was a lot of things to a lot of people here in Medford and the Medford Housing Authority is evident

1113
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:35,841
[SPEAKER_15]: by the number of residents that attended his memorial service.

1114
01:33:36,622 --> 01:33:41,126
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was a lot more than that, the people that he called family and friends.

1115
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:48,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Medford is not better off today than it was yesterday with the loss of someone like Steve Gattaro.

1116
01:33:49,434 --> 01:33:53,358
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could all be a little bit more like Steve Gattaro, I think Medford is moving in the right direction.

1117
01:33:53,578 --> 01:33:54,199
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

1118
01:33:55,226 --> 01:33:56,207
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor.

1119
01:33:56,227 --> 01:33:56,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1120
01:33:56,948 --> 01:33:58,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Councilor Knight.

1121
01:33:58,089 --> 01:33:59,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you hit the nail on the head.

1122
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:17,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve is just all I can say is that anytime you talk to Steve, even if you just pass Steve and walk past Steve and passing and driving by him, he had the most calming, peaceful, welcoming face that you can ever have.

1123
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:19,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's someone that is definitely missed.

1124
01:34:19,766 --> 01:34:22,669
[SPEAKER_06]: He's truly one of the good guys in this community.

1125
01:34:25,002 --> 01:34:27,003
[SPEAKER_06]: condolences to his family, he will be missed.

1126
01:34:27,043 --> 01:34:29,003
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1127
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,124
[SPEAKER_25]: Any discussion from the council.

1128
01:34:32,224 --> 01:34:39,226
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor carb yellow, we could just dedicate tonight's meeting on Steve's memory, Madam President, based upon as he has a service to our community.

1129
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:47,368
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of tonight, second, my Councilor Scarpelli all those in favor, all those opposed motion passes.

1130
01:35:03,382 --> 01:35:08,206
[SPEAKER_25]: Motions, orders and resolutions 22-545, offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1131
01:35:09,426 --> 01:35:19,794
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the parking administration provide the cost of installing extra and removing the wrongly placed meter poles on High Street, along with the cost of purchasing extra meter heads.

1132
01:35:20,474 --> 01:35:28,860
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it further resolved that the parking administration explain to the council why meter poles have been placed on Boynton Road, which is a residential street away from the Medford Square Commercial District.

1133
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello.

1134
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:31,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1135
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:35,014
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that keeps coming every meeting.

1136
01:35:37,035 --> 01:35:39,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they took these polls down,

1137
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:46,305
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent money to install the poles, to buy the poles, to put meat and the meat heads.

1138
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:58,457
[SPEAKER_02]: How much money do we spend on this for meat heads that we probably didn't need and installations of things that we didn't need, which is really disturbing to me that we even went that far.

1139
01:35:58,517 --> 01:36:03,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But now if you go down, we have meters on Boynton Road.

1140
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:08,861
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a residential street, far away from the business district.

1141
01:36:09,882 --> 01:36:17,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad enough, I've been getting calls from people that go to the library saying that they now have to pay meters to go to the library.

1142
01:36:18,709 --> 01:36:25,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Boynton Road is where parents pick up children from school, people go to church on Sundays and Saturdays and they go to things there.

1143
01:36:26,454 --> 01:36:28,877
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to have meters on Boynton Road.

1144
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we have meters on Forest Street?

1145
01:36:31,599 --> 01:36:33,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we have meters on Governor's Avenue?

1146
01:36:33,641 --> 01:36:34,962
[SPEAKER_02]: These are business districts.

1147
01:36:35,302 --> 01:36:38,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Boynton Road is not a business district.

1148
01:36:38,706 --> 01:36:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Those should be taken out immediately.

1149
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:43,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, poor planning on our parking lot.

1150
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:50,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And my one last thing is, I don't know if people are seeing these, our parking department is giving out paper visitor passes.

1151
01:36:51,612 --> 01:36:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: that you write your own address on there.

1152
01:36:53,814 --> 01:37:02,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you gotta do is go to your local copy store and make a copy of the visitor pass, and you can have 10 for whatever house you want.

1153
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:11,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't the visitor passes being limited to per household with a number and with an address issued by the city?

1154
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just say, here, go fill this out yourself.

1155
01:37:15,309 --> 01:37:20,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, a department out of control, we've asked for them to take a step back and figure out

1156
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,923
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're going with this department, mistake after mistake after mistake.

1157
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:28,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair to these people, the people in this community that we're going through this.

1158
01:37:29,326 --> 01:37:33,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, now we're putting meters in residential streets.

1159
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:34,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame on us.

1160
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:37,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1161
01:37:37,692 --> 01:37:39,153
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the Council?

1162
01:37:39,293 --> 01:37:39,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins.

1163
01:37:41,599 --> 01:37:42,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell.

1164
01:37:42,419 --> 01:37:54,766
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to note for the record, the parking department is not self-governing any more than any other department in our city, in my view, not any more than the assessor's office, the DPW, or any other department.

1165
01:37:55,706 --> 01:37:59,248
[SPEAKER_24]: They've been under a lot of fire since they were established.

1166
01:37:59,328 --> 01:38:06,252
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm glad that we're flagging resident concerns and that we're making sure that residents are being righted and made whole where appropriate.

1167
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,162
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just want to make the point that no department is an island.

1168
01:38:09,642 --> 01:38:14,866
[SPEAKER_24]: The administration is responsible for creating the conditions for the parking department's success, same as any other department.

1169
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:31,179
[SPEAKER_24]: These projects are being done at the administration's behest, and so I want to make sure that the administration is being held accountable for these issues that are affecting resident quality of life, and not just the people carrying them out.

1170
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:31,740
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1171
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:32,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, Councilor Collins.

1172
01:38:33,021 --> 01:38:37,142
[SPEAKER_25]: And to that point, I did reach out to the mayor asking about the ones in front of the library specifically.

1173
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:40,163
[SPEAKER_25]: And she said she asked them to remove the last time I drove by they were there.

1174
01:38:41,584 --> 01:38:42,504
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure why.

1175
01:38:42,524 --> 01:38:44,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, and I'm not sure.

1176
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:50,986
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, to Councilor Collins point why it's a surprise to the mayor that these things that one would assume she's shy and signed off on are there.

1177
01:38:51,066 --> 01:38:52,667
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's very confusing.

1178
01:38:55,427 --> 01:38:58,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God this council's on top of this, because they'd be in front of the churches right now.

1179
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:01,709
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion?

1180
01:39:02,788 --> 01:39:10,594
[SPEAKER_07]: just to your point, President Morell, that it's kind of, I don't think city government should work on a whim, right?

1181
01:39:10,774 --> 01:39:13,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be, oh, yeah, I'll get them out.

1182
01:39:13,696 --> 01:39:23,524
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, there should be a plan and the plan should be implemented and it should be reviewed and approved and corrected before it's, that's, I can't believe it.

1183
01:39:23,544 --> 01:39:23,724
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1184
01:39:24,504 --> 01:39:25,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Vice President Barros.

1185
01:39:25,905 --> 01:39:27,667
[SPEAKER_25]: Did you want to speak?

1186
01:39:31,057 --> 01:39:32,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

1187
01:39:32,438 --> 01:39:36,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, my name is Rita Bartolomeo I live at 135 High Street across from St.

1188
01:39:36,781 --> 01:39:41,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph school, and my house is one of the houses that were targeted with the meter in front of it.

1189
01:39:41,944 --> 01:39:52,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really unfair and no citizen no taxpayer homeowner should have to have a meter in front of their house, you know, we pay our taxes and now we have to pay a meter.

1190
01:39:52,871 --> 01:39:55,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very grateful to Councilman Caraviello that

1191
01:39:55,992 --> 01:40:12,771
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue got addressed and the meter is no longer in my in front of my house, however, you know, I know that we had tabled it from the last meeting to this meeting, and within a few days, the meters were being installed on Boynton Road and the heads were being put in.

1192
01:40:13,493 --> 01:40:19,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've lived at my house for 38 years I see the parents coming and going dropping their kids off to school.

1193
01:40:20,457 --> 01:40:24,659
[SPEAKER_01]: There's meters there's meters there in the afternoon to pick them up their social events at St.

1194
01:40:24,679 --> 01:40:27,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph's during the week it's it's, it's just not right.

1195
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:31,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it, you know, the city needs money in the business zones.

1196
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:42,569
[SPEAKER_01]: But there aren't any meters as Mr. Caraviello said on hillside governors forest waiting is the only street that has the meters.

1197
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:50,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me personally, when there is when the snow comes and we can't park and there's a parking man on high street.

1198
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:54,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a corner house we have to park on Boynton Road.

1199
01:40:55,488 --> 01:41:01,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's meters there and you don't have your, your car shoveled out and out by a certain time, are we going to get ticketed?

1200
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:03,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause our cars are there bad enough.

1201
01:41:03,309 --> 01:41:04,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they told them.

1202
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:18,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of a, a double issue here that, you know, Boynton road is targeted, I think, you know, for the library and looking for extra funds for the city, but it's, it's just not a place we want people to come and enjoy the brand new library.

1203
01:41:19,392 --> 01:41:22,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're asking for them to, to pay, to, to come there.

1204
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And there again you know when we do have the snow we can pop on the main street.

1205
01:41:28,184 --> 01:41:33,389
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cars that need to get off that main street and waiting is one of the streets that we go to.

1206
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, I'm thankful that the meter is gone in front of my house.

1207
01:41:38,094 --> 01:41:40,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I don't wake up one day and find it there again.

1208
01:41:40,396 --> 01:41:47,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the council for addressing it and I hope we can resolve the meter situation.

1209
01:41:48,325 --> 01:41:49,125
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. McFarland.

1210
01:41:49,346 --> 01:41:49,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello.

1211
01:41:49,886 --> 01:41:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, so my question is, I would like an answer on the cost of installing these and not installing them.

1212
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:57,950
[SPEAKER_02]: How much money are we wasting on this?

1213
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:02,893
[SPEAKER_02]: When all this could have been done with just maybe a little thought and planning.

1214
01:42:03,854 --> 01:42:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this program has been given the bum's rush to get it up and out without any thought.

1215
01:42:11,538 --> 01:42:12,359
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1216
01:42:12,839 --> 01:42:18,042
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor.

1217
01:42:18,842 --> 01:42:21,484
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1218
01:42:21,504 --> 01:42:37,717
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-546 offered by Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council support question four on the November ballot to preserve the Work and Family Mobility Act, which would allow all qualified residents to apply for a state driver's license regardless of immigration status and improve road safety outcomes for all communities in Massachusetts.

1219
01:42:37,757 --> 01:42:38,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins.

1220
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:40,420
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell.

1221
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:46,945
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is a ballot question that all voters get to vote on on the November ballot.

1222
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,682
[SPEAKER_24]: It would uphold the Work and Family Mobility Act, which passed the legislature this spring.

1223
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:57,604
[SPEAKER_24]: It would ensure that all drivers who can present proof of residency and pass a road test can get a driver's license.

1224
01:42:58,104 --> 01:43:04,587
[SPEAKER_24]: This ensures that all drivers are tested and licensed and insured, which it's demonstrated to make the road safer for everybody.

1225
01:43:05,527 --> 01:43:15,816
[SPEAKER_24]: This bill is also supported by a coalition of law enforcement professionals because it is demonstrated to reduce hit and run accidents by as much as 10% in the states where it's implemented.

1226
01:43:15,836 --> 01:43:18,419
[SPEAKER_24]: This is why I'm putting this forward.

1227
01:43:18,439 --> 01:43:23,904
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that the passage of this ballot question would materially benefit people of Medford by making our roads safer.

1228
01:43:24,804 --> 01:43:38,413
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I've been personally urging Medford voters to consider voting yes on four, and that's why I'm asking for my fellow councilors' consideration in endorsing this ballot question to make our roads safer for all vehicular drivers and pedestrians in our community.

1229
01:43:38,453 --> 01:43:38,753
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1230
01:43:39,433 --> 01:43:40,114
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1231
01:43:40,134 --> 01:43:40,574
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Tseng.

1232
01:43:41,154 --> 01:43:42,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

1233
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:47,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, for inviting me to co-sponsor this resolution.

1234
01:43:48,539 --> 01:43:52,301
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you've really hit the heart of what's at stake here, which is public safety.

1235
01:43:54,028 --> 01:44:03,175
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, our job as elected representatives of the city and it's a major branch of our city is to be the stewards of public safety.

1236
01:44:03,936 --> 01:44:11,542
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, when I'm on the road, I would, I would want all the drivers on the road to be tested insured and licensed.

1237
01:44:12,670 --> 01:44:24,580
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that's, that's common sense, not just to prevent traffic accidents and to prevent situations where we might be driving on the road with people who aren't tested licensed or insured.

1238
01:44:27,342 --> 01:44:35,869
[SPEAKER_21]: God forbid, if God forbid something were to happen, we want that trust with our police to be there as well, so that we prevent hit and runs.

1239
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:48,760
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think for that reason, as you've stated, a number of law enforcement officials across the state, including our chief police have endorsed and have supported question four, as we've put it.

1240
01:44:49,982 --> 01:44:53,545
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is also supported by relevant

1241
01:44:54,465 --> 01:44:59,266
[SPEAKER_21]: by our relevant delegation in the state government as well.

1242
01:44:59,887 --> 01:45:02,327
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, I thank you for putting this on the agenda.

1243
01:45:02,347 --> 01:45:12,170
[SPEAKER_21]: I think because this was added last minute onto the list of questions, a lot of voters don't know about this question yet.

1244
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:20,652
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that's a big reason why it's important to, at the very least, put this on the agenda so more people are aware that you can flip your ballot initiative

1245
01:45:21,872 --> 01:45:25,273
[SPEAKER_21]: ballot and make sure that you answer questions three and four.

1246
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:35,035
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you live in Paul Donato, or I believe it's Paul Donato or Rep Barber's districts, there are two more questions as well.

1247
01:45:35,075 --> 01:45:35,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1248
01:45:36,235 --> 01:45:36,875
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1249
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:38,416
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council?

1250
01:45:39,236 --> 01:45:40,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1251
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I don't support the question.

1252
01:45:44,437 --> 01:45:48,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's the city council's preview to be telling people how to vote.

1253
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:52,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I do say in principle, I do support it.

1254
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think it's our job to be telling people how to vote.

1255
01:45:56,242 --> 01:45:56,982
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1256
01:45:57,883 --> 01:45:59,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the Council?

1257
01:46:00,505 --> 01:46:05,869
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins, Councilor Tseng, if I could just request the language be tweaked.

1258
01:46:06,289 --> 01:46:09,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Right now it says, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council support question four.

1259
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:17,837
[SPEAKER_25]: I would just, my suggestion would say express support of, just so it's not commanding anything it's saying.

1260
01:46:19,152 --> 01:46:19,552
[SPEAKER_25]: otherwise.

1261
01:46:20,153 --> 01:46:23,294
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1262
01:46:26,676 --> 01:46:27,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Would you like to make the amendment?

1263
01:46:30,798 --> 01:46:39,122
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council express support of question four, dot, dot, dot.

1264
01:46:40,043 --> 01:46:40,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1265
01:46:40,943 --> 01:46:43,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council?

1266
01:46:43,164 --> 01:46:47,326
[SPEAKER_25]: I did see a hand up on Zoom, but then it went back down.

1267
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:47,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, we're back.

1268
01:46:49,497 --> 01:46:51,317
[SPEAKER_25]: Paul Geraghty, name and address for the record.

1269
01:46:51,357 --> 01:46:53,378
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

1270
01:46:53,838 --> 01:46:54,938
[SPEAKER_25]: Just asking you to unmute.

1271
01:46:56,239 --> 01:47:01,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Paul Geraghty, 40th Street Road, Medford.

1272
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:09,342
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be controversy over the fact that the referendum didn't make it into the printed copy.

1273
01:47:09,362 --> 01:47:18,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that perhaps the city clerk could put on the website that the citizens could look at voteinma.com

1274
01:47:19,547 --> 01:47:28,153
[SPEAKER_00]: click on 2022 valid questions and then click on go to and find question four so they can examine it themselves and have some time to look at it.

1275
01:47:31,175 --> 01:47:32,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for noting that.

1276
01:47:37,519 --> 01:47:38,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion from the council?

1277
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you bring up the chief of police's support of this measure or not?

1278
01:47:44,965 --> 01:47:50,731
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Collins, as amended by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1279
01:47:51,652 --> 01:47:52,333
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favour?

1280
01:47:52,353 --> 01:47:54,135
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1281
01:47:54,616 --> 01:47:55,296
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1282
01:47:55,316 --> 01:47:56,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

1283
01:48:01,443 --> 01:48:04,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Influencing people's individual ballot question rolls with the ballot box.

1284
01:48:10,004 --> 01:48:11,686
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1285
01:48:11,706 --> 01:48:22,119
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-547 offered by Councilor Knight be it so resolved that the Medford City Council enact a spending moratorium until such time as the city administration response to council papers related to spending, warrant articles, and the city's financial health.

1286
01:48:22,259 --> 01:48:22,720
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

1287
01:48:35,228 --> 01:48:40,211
[SPEAKER_15]: We're in a situation here in this community that's bordering on what I'd find to be a financial crisis.

1288
01:48:41,652 --> 01:48:57,800
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when we talk about spending, we talk about the sharing of information, and more importantly, we talk about that letter that we received from the administration, October 25th at 1.40 p.m., which was today at 1.40 after several months of making requests.

1289
01:48:59,021 --> 01:49:01,242
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's very troubling and scary that, you know,

1290
01:49:02,556 --> 01:49:05,498
[SPEAKER_15]: The city has a backlog of reconciliation reports.

1291
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,161
[SPEAKER_15]: They haven't been audited.

1292
01:49:08,901 --> 01:49:10,823
[SPEAKER_15]: They're utilizing incomplete data.

1293
01:49:11,844 --> 01:49:19,110
[SPEAKER_15]: And they cannot say that they have accurately designed reports for financial reporting here in our community.

1294
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:20,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's coming right from our CFO.

1295
01:49:20,931 --> 01:49:21,472
[SPEAKER_15]: That's troubling.

1296
01:49:22,033 --> 01:49:23,093
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very troubling, right?

1297
01:49:23,493 --> 01:49:31,656
[SPEAKER_15]: So the administration is spending and spending and spending, but I see no efforts being made to right the ship, especially with this body.

1298
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:40,779
[SPEAKER_15]: And this body has extended multiple olive branches for a period of 36 months, trying to get to the bottom of this stuff and be a partner and we're not being brought to the table.

1299
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:46,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so, you know, as I stated a couple of weeks ago, when we talk about the financial health in this community, let's be real about it.

1300
01:49:47,421 --> 01:49:49,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we had no treasurer collector from,

1301
01:49:50,318 --> 01:49:52,819
[SPEAKER_15]: January of 2020 to October 2020.

1302
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:57,022
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had no budget director from July of 2020 to date.

1303
01:49:58,263 --> 01:50:01,184
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had no CFO from September of 2021 to March of 22.

1304
01:50:01,244 --> 01:50:01,624
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had

1305
01:50:04,648 --> 01:50:08,269
[SPEAKER_15]: no federal fund manager from 321 to 222.

1306
01:50:08,469 --> 01:50:12,271
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've had no assessor from 522 to the present.

1307
01:50:13,031 --> 01:50:19,374
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we sit down and we talk about our financial health in this community, we don't even have a finance team in place.

1308
01:50:19,754 --> 01:50:23,495
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't had a finance team in place, but we're still being asked to spend.

1309
01:50:24,616 --> 01:50:27,997
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we ask for the information that we need to make informed decisions, we're not being provided it.

1310
01:50:28,669 --> 01:50:31,070
[SPEAKER_15]: which leads me to believe that they have something to hide.

1311
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:37,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello has asked at least 30 times, how much money are we spending on outside legal counsel?

1312
01:50:38,192 --> 01:50:48,875
[SPEAKER_15]: The administration spent something ridiculous like $65,000 to follow around an employee and put GPS on his car to get a report that comes back absolutely unfounded.

1313
01:50:49,415 --> 01:50:52,756
[SPEAKER_15]: And the investigation starts off, I heard a rumor about a guy.

1314
01:50:53,516 --> 01:50:54,476
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's what we're doing now.

1315
01:50:54,496 --> 01:50:57,417
[SPEAKER_15]: We're spending $80,000 in taxpayer money to chase down rumors.

1316
01:50:58,403 --> 01:50:59,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, let's get real.

1317
01:51:00,684 --> 01:51:05,707
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I look at the circumstances in this community and what's going on, we need to stop the bleeding somehow.

1318
01:51:06,907 --> 01:51:08,908
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that this is the best way to do it.

1319
01:51:09,769 --> 01:51:16,552
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd ask that we put a spending moratorium on until such time as we get our quarterly report from our financial director.

1320
01:51:16,872 --> 01:51:21,074
[SPEAKER_15]: We get brought up to speed as to what's really going on in that finance office.

1321
01:51:21,114 --> 01:51:21,995
[SPEAKER_15]: The numbers don't add up.

1322
01:51:22,495 --> 01:51:26,697
[SPEAKER_15]: If the numbers don't add up, we can't just keep on spending and spending and spending.

1323
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:35,521
[SPEAKER_15]: making assumptions off of inaccurate data and inaccurate estimations, how are we ever going to put the city in a position to succeed?

1324
01:51:37,762 --> 01:51:39,123
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we have no tax assessors.

1325
01:51:39,163 --> 01:51:40,884
[SPEAKER_15]: We have nobody to levy taxes in this community.

1326
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,325
[SPEAKER_15]: We finally have a treasurer collective out this whole time.

1327
01:51:43,865 --> 01:51:46,046
[SPEAKER_15]: But for the first 10 months of the administration, we didn't.

1328
01:51:46,186 --> 01:51:47,327
[SPEAKER_15]: We had some of those working part-time.

1329
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:49,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Rumor has it the calls were getting wired to a house.

1330
01:51:49,788 --> 01:51:50,809
[SPEAKER_15]: They weren't even coming in the office.

1331
01:51:51,889 --> 01:51:57,572
[SPEAKER_15]: We have people that are getting paid now outside the budget in acting positions that are also working in other communities.

1332
01:51:58,265 --> 01:52:01,648
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, their vested interest and their loyalties don't lie here in the city of Medford any longer.

1333
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:07,852
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, they're being paid for the city to comply with statute, not for any other reason.

1334
01:52:08,793 --> 01:52:10,754
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so we need to do something.

1335
01:52:11,215 --> 01:52:23,304
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is my next best solution that I could come up with based upon the plethora of resolutions that we filed, the number of questions that we've asked, the number of promises that have been made, but not fulfilled through the administration.

1336
01:52:23,684 --> 01:52:27,767
[SPEAKER_15]: We still don't have a city assistant city solicitor for the council and the position hasn't been posted.

1337
01:52:28,403 --> 01:52:30,625
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I offer the paper.

1338
01:52:31,505 --> 01:52:32,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't anticipate it passing.

1339
01:52:32,966 --> 01:52:35,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to hold the city financially hostage.

1340
01:52:35,388 --> 01:52:37,470
[SPEAKER_15]: If good things are going to happen in this community, they should.

1341
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:38,791
[SPEAKER_15]: They should.

1342
01:52:39,151 --> 01:52:46,737
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, you can't ask us to keep spending money without telling us what the financial picture is, what our financial health and wellness is in this community.

1343
01:52:47,978 --> 01:52:48,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1344
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:49,319
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Paris.

1345
01:53:16,264 --> 01:53:35,755
[SPEAKER_07]: out there as my suggestion, I would propose a B paper to request that the finance director so part of the email that we sent us that the finance director feels like he could present a first quarter report in mid November, and that place warrant articles on the on the city council for based on the formal acceptance on a monthly basis based subject to their formal acceptance by the council their certification by the city clerk's office.

1346
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:40,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would be paid propose a B paper to request that the finance director

1347
01:53:41,577 --> 01:53:55,087
[SPEAKER_07]: attend our November 22nd meeting to present a first quarter financial report and revenue comparison with prior fiscal year and revenue forecasting for fiscal year 2024.

1348
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:12,023
[SPEAKER_07]: and further request that the finance director take whatever steps are necessary to place Warren articles on the council agenda for formal approval on a monthly basis beginning in November.

1349
01:54:13,964 --> 01:54:25,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I could just add to that paper that the city council request the administration prepare an RFI for the city council to review relative to the hiring of an independent outside auditor.

1350
01:54:31,088 --> 01:54:51,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Council like would you mind repeating your men, please, the city administration produce an RFR an RF an RFR an RFP for the city council to review relative to the selection and hiring of an outside independent auditor.

1351
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:52,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1352
01:54:53,181 --> 01:54:59,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Council, I think that was something I asked for months ago, but the outside independent.

1353
01:55:01,069 --> 01:55:04,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We just asked the guy to do the finance to give us reports.

1354
01:55:05,351 --> 01:55:14,474
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying in his paper that he can't do reports because he doesn't have the staff and he doesn't, I say, just reading his letter here.

1355
01:55:14,514 --> 01:55:19,016
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a backlog and how much more do we want this guy to do?

1356
01:55:19,616 --> 01:55:23,037
[SPEAKER_02]: He has no assistant working with him either now.

1357
01:55:23,077 --> 01:55:24,137
[SPEAKER_15]: He's on the line for a raise.

1358
01:55:24,177 --> 01:55:24,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get him down here.

1359
01:55:26,476 --> 01:55:28,137
[SPEAKER_02]: say he's saying he can't get okay.

1360
01:55:28,937 --> 01:55:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying that he doesn't have the staff or the time to give reports because he's overwhelmed on the job.

1361
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:38,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're asking him to do something that he's saying that he probably can't do.

1362
01:55:41,703 --> 01:55:43,244
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins, I'm back to Vice President Bears.

1363
01:55:44,584 --> 01:55:45,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell.

1364
01:55:45,705 --> 01:55:49,347
[SPEAKER_24]: And I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this forward.

1365
01:55:49,367 --> 01:55:50,087
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I think we need to

1366
01:55:51,725 --> 01:55:58,090
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if this counts as outside of the box, but we need to think outside the box about how to resolve heretofore intractable problems.

1367
01:55:58,831 --> 01:56:07,658
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's been frustrating for all of us to keep putting out requests for updates and requests that are simply germane to our responsibilities as councillors and not hear back and be kept in the dark.

1368
01:56:07,718 --> 01:56:10,400
[SPEAKER_24]: And that affects our ability to be accountable to the people who put us in office.

1369
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:12,281
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that that's something we all share.

1370
01:56:13,102 --> 01:56:17,045
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm also not against drawing a line in the sand to

1371
01:56:17,827 --> 01:56:29,256
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, continue to demonstrate to the administration that we are serious about being armed with the information that we need to forecast for this community's future and make responsible decisions.

1372
01:56:31,097 --> 01:56:36,922
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I think sort of where my personal limits bump against that, I've demonstrated in some of my votes in the past.

1373
01:56:39,564 --> 01:56:43,006
[SPEAKER_24]: However, I think I'm willing to support this this evening.

1374
01:56:46,935 --> 01:56:48,316
[SPEAKER_24]: was the one other thing I was going to say.

1375
01:56:49,097 --> 01:56:50,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Second time tonight I've done that long day.

1376
01:56:52,441 --> 01:57:04,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, in terms of what we're asking for from the finance department, I just think that it needs to be emphasized, you know, that it's

1377
01:57:06,183 --> 01:57:10,810
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not necessarily our best move to try to decrease what we're asking for.

1378
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:16,418
[SPEAKER_24]: We're asking for reasonable things from the administration because of lapses in staff capacity.

1379
01:57:16,579 --> 01:57:20,304
[SPEAKER_24]: It's our responsibility to ask for the policies that we know are in service of our community.

1380
01:57:21,305 --> 01:57:24,847
[SPEAKER_24]: And sometimes, I mean, we see it all throughout the community every day.

1381
01:57:24,887 --> 01:57:28,149
[SPEAKER_24]: Those are not going to be enforced or implemented on the timetable that we'd like to see.

1382
01:57:28,189 --> 01:57:30,430
[SPEAKER_24]: That is a feature of our community.

1383
01:57:30,931 --> 01:57:39,175
[SPEAKER_24]: But that doesn't mean that we should not ask for and legislate for and advocate for the policies that our community deserves.

1384
01:57:39,856 --> 01:57:40,136
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1385
01:57:40,976 --> 01:57:41,697
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1386
01:57:41,737 --> 01:57:42,337
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Paris.

1387
01:57:42,877 --> 01:57:43,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1388
01:57:43,858 --> 01:57:46,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins said it incredibly well.

1389
01:57:48,893 --> 01:57:52,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I read this email, it says preliminary first quarter reports can be provided by mid-November.

1390
01:57:52,475 --> 01:57:55,337
[SPEAKER_07]: This office can also provide revenue comparisons with the prior fiscal year.

1391
01:57:55,817 --> 01:58:01,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Warrant articles pertaining to city funds can be provided on a monthly basis subject to their formal acceptance by the council and certification by the clerk's office.

1392
01:58:02,501 --> 01:58:03,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I say we take the guy up on his offer.

1393
01:58:05,883 --> 01:58:11,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, well, I wouldn't mind going back to it.

1394
01:58:11,826 --> 01:58:11,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1395
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:27,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm just saying that if he, if we want to go back to a regular system where we actually are voting, like this seems like the fiscal compliance that we would like to see.

1396
01:58:27,149 --> 01:58:28,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's take them up on their offer.

1397
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:30,812
[SPEAKER_07]: If they can't meet it, then we pass the first resolution.

1398
01:58:32,173 --> 01:58:34,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council?

1399
01:58:40,447 --> 01:58:41,127
[SPEAKER_11]: not get all of this.

1400
01:58:41,627 --> 01:58:44,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I was gonna go back to the tape for some of it.

1401
01:58:44,268 --> 01:59:02,491
[SPEAKER_11]: But the B paper from Vice President Bears was a request that the finance director attend the November 22nd meeting to present the first quarter financial report and to take whatever steps necessary to place the warrant articles on the agenda for monthly approval on the, uh, on the 1st November meeting.

1402
01:59:03,111 --> 01:59:06,612
[SPEAKER_11]: But then there were there were some other actions take to be taken in the middle of that.

1403
01:59:07,992 --> 01:59:16,597
[SPEAKER_07]: just after first quarter financial report, um, at revenue comparison with prior fiscal year and revenue forecasting for fiscal year 2024.

1404
01:59:19,038 --> 01:59:19,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

1405
01:59:22,219 --> 01:59:23,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was a B paper.

1406
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, there was a B paper.

1407
01:59:26,221 --> 01:59:28,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, well, that was your B paper.

1408
01:59:28,142 --> 01:59:30,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And then and then Council night had to be.

1409
01:59:30,544 --> 01:59:31,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Council night had a B paper.

1410
01:59:32,384 --> 01:59:37,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Had it had a amendment to the B paper asking for the R five for the event of our otter are fire are far.

1411
01:59:41,879 --> 01:59:43,420
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that address your questions, Councilor Tseng?

1412
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:46,081
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council at this time?

1413
01:59:49,202 --> 02:00:06,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the- I would welcome that because I would be, I'd be reluctant to vote for it.

1414
02:00:06,408 --> 02:00:11,470
[SPEAKER_25]: I know my tenure on the council is shorter than some, but I've been on it long enough to know that sometimes voting in absolutes

1415
02:00:12,013 --> 02:00:17,716
[SPEAKER_25]: absolutely comes back to bite you, and I would be reluctant to vote for something so broad, although I do appreciate the intent of it.

1416
02:00:18,857 --> 02:00:33,165
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have a- So on the motion of Councilor Naito to sever the two papers and lay the A paper on the table for a time of 30 days as seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1417
02:00:33,586 --> 02:00:34,266
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1418
02:00:34,286 --> 02:00:34,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1419
02:00:35,066 --> 02:00:35,807
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1420
02:00:35,887 --> 02:00:36,667
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1421
02:00:36,687 --> 02:00:38,508
[SPEAKER_25]: And then taking the B-

1422
02:00:40,713 --> 02:00:44,875
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight to move approval on the paper seconded by vice president bears.

1423
02:00:45,575 --> 02:00:47,796
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone feels comfortable with the language of the paper.

1424
02:00:55,819 --> 02:01:08,567
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-548 offered by vice president bears be it so resolved by the Medford city council that the city council encourages residents to attend the November 2 bus network redesign meeting where the MBTA will be presenting its revised map of bus changes for Medford and other communities.

1425
02:01:09,168 --> 02:01:18,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it further resolved that the city administration notify residents of the meeting particularly residents who communicated with the city or submitted comments regarding the bus network redesign using all available means.

1426
02:01:19,454 --> 02:01:33,508
[SPEAKER_25]: Event information can be found at mbta.com slash events slash 2022-11 dash 02 slash public dash meetings dash bus dash network dash redesign dash virtual you love to make me read a URL.

1427
02:01:33,568 --> 02:01:33,889
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1428
02:01:34,069 --> 02:01:37,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes the whole meeting work.

1429
02:01:40,476 --> 02:01:44,661
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but thank you, Madam President, for reading that resolution.

1430
02:01:45,182 --> 02:01:48,706
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a lot of conversation about the proposed bus network redesign.

1431
02:01:50,389 --> 02:01:58,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I can first say that I believe that Medford Hillside was the number one neighborhood in the entire MBTA catchment area in terms of comments.

1432
02:01:58,935 --> 02:02:04,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the anger and frustration of residents who are deeply opposed to changes, that is good news.

1433
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:07,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also, I haven't seen a draft map.

1434
02:02:07,742 --> 02:02:09,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not seen any draft routes.

1435
02:02:09,783 --> 02:02:15,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I have heard rumblings that there will be improvements to the Medford map, which I think is a good thing.

1436
02:02:16,528 --> 02:02:20,750
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's definitely important that residents continue to stay actively engaged with the process.

1437
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:25,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So please attend the November 2nd bus network redesign meeting via Zoom.

1438
02:02:26,373 --> 02:02:39,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this does ask the city administration to notify residents about that meeting and especially communicate with all of the residents who submitted their contact information or comments or however else they communicated their issue to the city government.

1439
02:02:39,318 --> 02:02:39,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1440
02:02:40,078 --> 02:02:40,719
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Bears.

1441
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:43,540
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do want to note that we did have residents that in Hillside that

1442
02:02:44,125 --> 02:03:01,589
[SPEAKER_21]: kind of the pavement to get comments from their neighbors so I just want to note that cancer say, um, I think President, President Raul really covered that point, I was I was just going to note that it is very substantial that medical side popped the top to the comment list.

1443
02:03:03,049 --> 02:03:07,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I haven't seen anything but I've heard rumblings that there might be positive changes and I think

1444
02:03:09,131 --> 02:03:26,704
[SPEAKER_21]: If we do see those changes come about, it'll be because of the hard work of residents in our city and the hard work of our members of our city government, including my fellow colleagues for indulging in meetings about the bus network redesign as well.

1445
02:03:27,344 --> 02:03:28,065
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you so much.

1446
02:03:28,085 --> 02:03:28,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1447
02:03:29,806 --> 02:03:31,187
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council?

1448
02:03:31,207 --> 02:03:34,630
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by

1449
02:03:35,965 --> 02:03:37,066
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

1450
02:03:37,086 --> 02:03:41,371
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed motion passes to do dash 549 offered by by Susan bears.

1451
02:03:41,991 --> 02:03:55,284
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a result by the Metro City Council that the city administration updates policies and procedures regarding see click fix to ensure that items requiring the input of or decision by the traffic commission are properly referred to that body for their response and review by Susan affairs.

1452
02:03:56,986 --> 02:03:57,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1453
02:04:00,846 --> 02:04:02,746
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been a number of issues regarding see quick fix.

1454
02:04:02,786 --> 02:04:12,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to get into, but one of them has been that items that require the input of the traffic commission may not be being properly referred to the traffic commission.

1455
02:04:12,788 --> 02:04:19,229
[SPEAKER_07]: So people asking for signage or asking about specific conditions on a public way that needs to be updated or addressed.

1456
02:04:20,050 --> 02:04:23,070
[SPEAKER_07]: They may be going to the police department or to DPW.

1457
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:27,471
[SPEAKER_07]: They really should be going to the traffic commission as it's in the traffic commission's jurisdiction to make those changes.

1458
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:33,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a question of how they get marked as resolved on C-Click Fix.

1459
02:04:33,781 --> 02:04:37,382
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not getting marked as resolved and referred to traffic commission.

1460
02:04:37,422 --> 02:04:41,523
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just not really, they're just being marked as resolved or referred to a city department.

1461
02:04:42,104 --> 02:04:44,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And those departments don't actually have the final authority on those items.

1462
02:04:44,925 --> 02:04:51,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a request that the city administration update how they're referring items using C-Click Fix.

1463
02:04:51,347 --> 02:04:51,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1464
02:04:52,367 --> 02:04:53,207
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you Vice President Bears.

1465
02:04:53,307 --> 02:04:54,108
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion?

1466
02:04:55,343 --> 02:04:58,468
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1467
02:04:58,528 --> 02:04:59,169
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1468
02:04:59,189 --> 02:04:59,569
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1469
02:04:59,689 --> 02:05:00,390
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1470
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:01,071
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1471
02:05:01,932 --> 02:05:21,042
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-550 offered by Councilor Collins, the it's so resolved the Medford City Council remind residents of the statewide ban on mattress disposal going into effect on November 1 resources for recycling or donating mattresses and box prints can be found at mass.gov slash service dash details, slash mattress dash recycling.

1472
02:05:21,803 --> 02:05:24,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins, sorry for the tongue twister.

1473
02:05:26,686 --> 02:05:30,829
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to make sure that residents heard about this prior to November 1.

1474
02:05:31,229 --> 02:05:42,598
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a statewide ban going into effect because the majority of mattress or box spring materials are recyclable, which is why they are now required to be recycled and divert them from landfills.

1475
02:05:42,618 --> 02:05:46,080
[SPEAKER_24]: I also saw this update from the city just a couple days ago.

1476
02:05:47,642 --> 02:05:53,067
[SPEAKER_24]: A company called Hand Up is now offering mattress and box spring pickup in Medford.

1477
02:05:53,567 --> 02:05:58,171
[SPEAKER_24]: So residents can schedule a pickup by going to handupmattress.com.

1478
02:05:59,773 --> 02:06:02,696
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a charge for the service.

1479
02:06:03,076 --> 02:06:03,376
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1480
02:06:04,137 --> 02:06:04,858
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1481
02:06:04,878 --> 02:06:05,598
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello.

1482
02:06:05,779 --> 02:06:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1483
02:06:06,679 --> 02:06:08,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank my Councilor for putting this on.

1484
02:06:08,981 --> 02:06:12,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like a copy of this be sent to Tufts University.

1485
02:06:13,903 --> 02:06:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: for all the off-campus people, because we know what happens here at the end of school and the beginning of school, where there's mattresses all over the city.

1486
02:06:23,505 --> 02:06:30,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that this be sent to them and ask them if they could send it to students living off campus.

1487
02:06:31,147 --> 02:06:40,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both moving in and moving out at the beginning of the year and the end of the year, because every year we get inundated with mattress calls.

1488
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:41,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1489
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:42,770
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion?

1490
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:49,204
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Collins as amended by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1491
02:06:49,224 --> 02:06:49,944
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1492
02:06:50,765 --> 02:06:51,265
[SPEAKER_25]: Opposed?

1493
02:06:51,325 --> 02:06:52,005
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1494
02:06:52,025 --> 02:06:55,267
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-551 offered by Councilor Collins.

1495
02:06:55,367 --> 02:07:05,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it so resolved that Medford City Council recommend that the administration advertise its open positions on the Mass Municipal Association's Municipal Marketplace Job Board in order to help spur more applications.

1496
02:07:05,332 --> 02:07:06,073
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Collins.

1497
02:07:06,893 --> 02:07:07,754
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Morell.

1498
02:07:07,794 --> 02:07:18,441
[SPEAKER_24]: So I peruse this website a couple times a month just for general updates, and I was surprised to see a lot of open positions in the city of Medford not listed on the job board when I checked there last.

1499
02:07:18,521 --> 02:07:27,127
[SPEAKER_24]: I did actually hear from Director Osborne just earlier today and said that they do frequently use this service to advertise the jobs that we are trying to fill.

1500
02:07:27,188 --> 02:07:30,310
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just that they're taken down after 30 days, so I'm glad it's being used.

1501
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:41,336
[SPEAKER_24]: And I hope that it's continued to be used consistently as, you know, obviously this is a place where people qualified for municipal work are looking around and we have a great and urgent need.

1502
02:07:41,896 --> 02:07:42,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1503
02:07:42,657 --> 02:07:43,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1504
02:07:44,018 --> 02:07:48,380
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1505
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:49,101
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1506
02:07:49,261 --> 02:07:49,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1507
02:07:49,661 --> 02:07:50,982
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1508
02:07:51,262 --> 02:07:52,202
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1509
02:07:52,222 --> 02:07:53,263
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-552 offered by Councilor Tseng.

1510
02:07:53,825 --> 02:08:01,969
[SPEAKER_25]: These are resolved City Council asked the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability if their plans for method to connect to the Somerville community bike path along the Green Line extension.

1511
02:08:02,449 --> 02:08:12,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor say, thank you, President Merle, this is a question that a lot of residents in our community have been asking, especially with the opening of the Green Line extension coming upon us very soon.

1512
02:08:15,618 --> 02:08:23,102
[SPEAKER_21]: more choices in terms of how to get to work in Cambridge Somerville in Boston, or just to travel to our neighboring municipalities.

1513
02:08:23,242 --> 02:08:31,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Currently, there is a plan for the Somerville community bike path will open alongside the

1514
02:08:32,306 --> 02:08:47,137
[SPEAKER_21]: a green line extension to moon square station and a lot of residents have been wondering more specifically about how we might be able to as a city connected that the office of planning development and sustainability and engineering department have been so gracious to

1515
02:08:47,537 --> 02:08:50,959
[SPEAKER_21]: give me a pretty thorough response about their plans so far.

1516
02:08:52,320 --> 02:09:13,393
[SPEAKER_21]: On this specific point about working to extend the GLX community path, there are no plans so far and part of the problem is that the right-of-way in between adjacent private properties on either side of the railway looks significantly narrower in the Medford section than in the Somerville section, which doesn't mean it's impossible to do but just means it's quite difficult to do.

1517
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:16,134
[SPEAKER_21]: However, our city is

1518
02:09:17,585 --> 02:09:40,612
[SPEAKER_21]: taking a look at connecting to this community path via on-street bike facilities, and they'll put this in the new citywide bike plan that's coming out soon, or when they're ready, and they're going to suggest placing these bike facilities along that path, with one example being around Medford Street and Dexter Street.

1519
02:09:42,063 --> 02:09:52,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Another possibility for our city connecting to the community path is via an off-street path between the Mystic River Greenways and the GLX community path extension.

1520
02:09:53,631 --> 02:09:57,534
[SPEAKER_21]: This would be more towards Assembly Square and then up by the Mystic.

1521
02:09:58,595 --> 02:10:09,543
[SPEAKER_21]: A feasibility study was actually conducted two years ago, and there's quite a lot of detail for how we would implement this if our city deemed it to be the best path forward.

1522
02:10:10,145 --> 02:10:18,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, generally, residents might also be interested in bike path planning and power cities going about it.

1523
02:10:19,211 --> 02:10:28,638
[SPEAKER_21]: While our city is space constrained in many places, our city's approach, and the approach of the planning department and the engineering department so far.

1524
02:10:29,518 --> 02:10:49,105
[SPEAKER_21]: is to identify key routes that have the capacity for infrastructure and then to make design recommendations from a short-term perspective, so tackling what we can achieve with minimal changes and minimal resources and a long-term perspective where we look at things that we can build during larger roadway reconstruction projects.

1525
02:10:51,107 --> 02:10:59,776
[SPEAKER_21]: The city is also prioritizing continuity between municipalities that's something we've heard in our climate plan meeting, and the comprehensive plan meeting as well.

1526
02:11:00,998 --> 02:11:06,323
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're meeting, making special note of on and off street connections to Somerville Arlington Malden, etc.

1527
02:11:07,545 --> 02:11:10,248
[SPEAKER_21]: And to make sure that we align our plans with their plans as well.

1528
02:11:10,808 --> 02:11:17,312
[SPEAKER_21]: and the city is currently in the midst of developing a new bike, a citywide bike plan.

1529
02:11:18,513 --> 02:11:24,917
[SPEAKER_21]: They will, when that starts, they'll launch a public outreach process with opportunities to get feedback and get involved.

1530
02:11:25,277 --> 02:11:32,321
[SPEAKER_21]: I assume at that point, the city council would love to relay feedback and to look at these changes as well.

1531
02:11:33,582 --> 02:11:34,322
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1532
02:11:35,143 --> 02:11:35,923
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion?

1533
02:11:37,844 --> 02:11:40,166
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, it's seconded by

1534
02:11:43,103 --> 02:11:44,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Bears, all those in favor?

1535
02:11:44,483 --> 02:11:45,724
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed?

1536
02:11:45,764 --> 02:11:46,424
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1537
02:11:46,444 --> 02:12:02,349
[SPEAKER_25]: 22-553 offered by Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the subcommittee on rules and ordinances meet to identify definitions within the code of ordinances for the roles of code enforcement officers and tree warden and report back on what definition exists and what updates need to be made for the tree ordinance.

1538
02:12:02,409 --> 02:12:02,849
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Tseng.

1539
02:12:03,201 --> 02:12:04,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Morell.

1540
02:12:04,241 --> 02:12:12,784
[SPEAKER_21]: This comes from a meeting of a subcommittee that we are on, the sustainability subcommittee, where we were looking at the tree protection ordinance.

1541
02:12:13,304 --> 02:12:24,167
[SPEAKER_21]: And there were two sections, one section on defining code enforcement officer and one defining tree warden that were in the ordinance that we thought between

1542
02:12:25,628 --> 02:12:40,642
[SPEAKER_21]: between the council, between city staff, and between legal advice we thought would be best to sever, and to let people with more know-how on this issue decide what to do with it, since it was outside our scope.

1543
02:12:42,232 --> 02:13:02,343
[SPEAKER_21]: And so the recommendation was that we send this to rules and ordinances and let that committee look at these definitions and decide whether we need to update our city or code of ordinances with them, since there is no definition currently, whether we need that for the tree ordinance and what the best path forward is.

1544
02:13:03,163 --> 02:13:03,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1545
02:13:07,805 --> 02:13:10,227
[SPEAKER_13]: In order to

1546
02:13:11,666 --> 02:13:16,049
[SPEAKER_25]: So the paper, so this is asking specifically about the definitions of two positions.

1547
02:13:16,109 --> 02:13:24,014
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think, well, there are definitions that appear in other code enforcement officer appears throughout our ordinances.

1548
02:13:24,114 --> 02:13:29,938
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, we can stay in the committee and we can figure out the definition that we want to.

1549
02:13:30,847 --> 02:13:38,173
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just one of those weird things that we go into our code of ordinances, nowhere defined is a code enforcement officer.

1550
02:13:38,353 --> 02:13:38,553
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1551
02:13:38,593 --> 02:13:43,917
[SPEAKER_21]: And the advice was that we shouldn't put it under the tree ordinance section of the code of ordinances.

1552
02:13:43,957 --> 02:13:45,118
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be better placed under.

1553
02:13:45,138 --> 02:13:45,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

1554
02:13:50,502 --> 02:13:50,743
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1555
02:13:50,863 --> 02:13:53,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we want to refer to legal counsel instead of an actual subcommittee?

1556
02:13:54,025 --> 02:13:55,726
[SPEAKER_25]: Just legal counsel definition of these two.

1557
02:13:55,967 --> 02:13:56,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1558
02:13:56,267 --> 02:13:56,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do that.

1559
02:13:56,887 --> 02:13:57,188
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1560
02:13:57,308 --> 02:13:57,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

1561
02:13:58,797 --> 02:14:26,927
[SPEAKER_25]: for the chair of the other subcommittee so um so you want to refer to legal counsel for definition so on the motion of councillor saying as amended by councillor saying seconded by vices and affairs all those in favor all those opposed motion passes two two dash five five four oh good another url offered by councillor saying be it so resolved to the city administration reach out to residents to apply

1562
02:14:27,955 --> 02:14:40,707
[SPEAKER_25]: for federal student loan debt relief before December 31st, 2022 at https://studentaid.gov slash debt dash relief slash application.

1563
02:14:41,228 --> 02:14:48,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Federal Pell Grant recipients may be eligible for up to 20,000 in debt relief and other federal student loan borrowers may be eligible for up to 10,000 in debt relief.

1564
02:14:48,795 --> 02:14:51,557
[SPEAKER_25]: The application is available in both English and Spanish.

1565
02:14:51,617 --> 02:14:52,058
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Tseng.

1566
02:14:52,488 --> 02:14:53,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Morell.

1567
02:14:53,370 --> 02:14:57,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I think this item is, this resolution is pretty self-explanatory.

1568
02:15:00,243 --> 02:15:04,244
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a monumental change to policy in our country.

1569
02:15:05,584 --> 02:15:14,025
[SPEAKER_21]: To have people who have student loan debt be able to apply for this relief really truly does make a difference in a lot of people's lives.

1570
02:15:14,865 --> 02:15:15,966
[SPEAKER_21]: The form is super short.

1571
02:15:16,786 --> 02:15:29,648
[SPEAKER_21]: It takes at most five minutes to fill out and is a way in which we can help residents and families throughout what might be a more difficult economic time.

1572
02:15:30,908 --> 02:15:34,629
[SPEAKER_21]: I like everything that's along these lines.

1573
02:15:34,869 --> 02:15:40,251
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's important for our city administration to reach out to as many residents as possible.

1574
02:15:41,011 --> 02:15:57,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, a lot bigger picture, we need to work on better ways to communicate with residents, but at the very least, I want as many people to know that you have before December 31st to apply for this and that you can apply in Spanish as well.

1575
02:15:58,840 --> 02:15:59,581
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1576
02:15:59,701 --> 02:16:03,203
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council on the motion?

1577
02:16:03,884 --> 02:16:04,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Tseng?

1578
02:16:04,604 --> 02:16:12,791
[SPEAKER_21]: One other note is that it is currently in the court system right now, but it doesn't change the fact that you can apply for it.

1579
02:16:13,671 --> 02:16:14,332
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1580
02:16:15,272 --> 02:16:16,373
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Bears?

1581
02:16:16,553 --> 02:16:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Amy Coney Barrett didn't shoot it down, so we might have a chance on this one.

1582
02:16:22,558 --> 02:16:27,061
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1583
02:16:27,081 --> 02:16:27,642
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1584
02:16:28,432 --> 02:16:30,033
[SPEAKER_25]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1585
02:16:30,453 --> 02:16:32,575
[SPEAKER_25]: Going to public participation.

1586
02:16:32,595 --> 02:16:32,635
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1587
02:16:35,596 --> 02:16:37,177
[SPEAKER_25]: Bartholomew, you're on public participation.

1588
02:16:37,217 --> 02:16:37,718
[SPEAKER_25]: You spoke earlier.

1589
02:16:37,738 --> 02:16:38,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Would you like to speak again?

1590
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:44,161
[SPEAKER_25]: For public participation, do you want to speak again?

1591
02:16:44,201 --> 02:16:45,042
[SPEAKER_25]: I know you spoke earlier.

1592
02:16:45,062 --> 02:16:45,882
[SPEAKER_25]: You're on the agenda.

1593
02:16:45,943 --> 02:16:47,003
[SPEAKER_25]: You're good, okay.

1594
02:16:47,023 --> 02:16:52,707
[SPEAKER_25]: I know we do have residents from Harvard Street here who also wanted to speak about no parking signs.

1595
02:16:52,787 --> 02:16:56,649
[SPEAKER_25]: So whoever would like to speak, please come up and just name and address for the record.

1596
02:17:02,723 --> 02:17:03,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1597
02:17:03,523 --> 02:17:08,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so my name is Sean Leonard I'm a resident at 180 Harvard Street.

1598
02:17:10,726 --> 02:17:11,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to get.

1599
02:17:12,546 --> 02:17:28,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this is the right form to bring this up but I just wanted to get clarification on the changes on the parking on Harvard Street I just, I don't, I'm speaking for myself and a couple other residents I don't think I got any notification about a change or why chance being made so I wanted to.

1600
02:17:30,445 --> 02:17:39,651
[SPEAKER_03]: There is on the back end, but there seems to be, I've lived there for years, but there's always street parking on one side of it.

1601
02:17:40,432 --> 02:17:44,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's currently signage up that's saying that's a tow zone now and not parking.

1602
02:17:44,054 --> 02:17:46,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And then farther down the street, it's permit only.

1603
02:17:46,656 --> 02:17:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been a permit only street.

1604
02:17:49,117 --> 02:17:56,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a problem for me, but to not have any parking there is, I'm just wondering why that is or if anyone knows.

1605
02:17:59,810 --> 02:18:07,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm not sure the answer either but I don't know if you're going to say something I was going to say attention to what's going on here all things back and have been a disaster.

1606
02:18:08,234 --> 02:18:14,097
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of, you know, the media is that they're putting up on Boynton Road.

1607
02:18:14,458 --> 02:18:21,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Issues of tickets on streets that not permit streets and tickets that are going on guys that say they're on one street and they're on another street so

1608
02:18:21,878 --> 02:18:28,904
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of our PACHA program and the application thereof, I don't think we're doing anybody a service.

1609
02:18:29,605 --> 02:18:39,252
[SPEAKER_15]: As the program continues to mature and develop, I'm seeing a lot more signage and a lot more meters go up across the community, but I'm not really seeing

1610
02:18:40,839 --> 02:18:44,201
[SPEAKER_15]: The data driven methodology as to why they're putting these in.

1611
02:18:45,242 --> 02:19:07,558
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that being common street with the development that's going to occur at Titan Gas Station at some point, the development that's going to occur up at Nathan Electric in the expansion of the Green Line, that area has been under particular scrutiny based upon what's going to happen when the Green Line comes active.

1612
02:19:08,539 --> 02:19:09,440
[SPEAKER_15]: But in terms of

1613
02:19:11,148 --> 02:19:14,429
[SPEAKER_15]: who has the overall authority to implement and initiate those changes.

1614
02:19:14,449 --> 02:19:15,670
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really the traffic commission.

1615
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:21,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not here in the city, but I know the city did something, because the end of Albion Street wasn't a mentioned project.

1616
02:19:21,392 --> 02:19:23,133
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a simple project, but it was invented.

1617
02:19:23,693 --> 02:19:25,453
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually in Somerville.

1618
02:19:25,533 --> 02:19:28,795
[SPEAKER_15]: But the house is invented, but the street right in front of it.

1619
02:19:28,815 --> 02:19:29,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's nuts.

1620
02:19:29,275 --> 02:19:30,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I looked at the map.

1621
02:19:30,155 --> 02:19:31,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's a disaster what they've done over there.

1622
02:19:32,216 --> 02:19:32,836
[SPEAKER_07]: At Winchester.

1623
02:19:32,856 --> 02:19:33,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I looked at the map.

1624
02:19:33,997 --> 02:19:34,797
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually in Somerville.

1625
02:19:34,817 --> 02:19:35,697
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a disaster.

1626
02:19:39,173 --> 02:19:40,834
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, that's the best I got for it.

1627
02:19:40,894 --> 02:19:46,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we still need to establish?

1628
02:19:47,737 --> 02:19:50,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just gonna add, it is the traffic commission.

1629
02:19:51,319 --> 02:19:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The city adopted a law in like 1958 that all parking, signage, traffic related decisions are made by the traffic commission.

1630
02:19:59,103 --> 02:20:02,064
[SPEAKER_07]: You can access them through Alva Erickson at the police department.

1631
02:20:02,164 --> 02:20:07,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also go to the director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake, and that information is on the city website.

1632
02:20:09,023 --> 02:20:16,645
[SPEAKER_07]: My guess is it's probably has a lot to do with what counts and I just said it also maybe is this the section of Harvard Street where folks are parking on the sidewalk.

1633
02:20:17,025 --> 02:20:33,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it may be about that it may be a new update, relative to that, not being a practice that they want to encourage again I don't know, I wasn't at the meeting their minutes you should also be able to get traffic commission minutes to tell you when the decision was made and what the discussion was about.

1634
02:20:36,295 --> 02:20:37,356
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do have your email.

1635
02:20:37,396 --> 02:20:44,021
[SPEAKER_25]: I can reach out to some of those folks tomorrow to see if they're able to just give us a short answer as to the why.

1636
02:20:44,622 --> 02:20:48,585
[SPEAKER_25]: I have, I think, Ellen, someone emailed on behalf, Ellen emailed on behalf of all of you.

1637
02:20:48,625 --> 02:20:57,152
[SPEAKER_25]: So I can reach out to, I'll probably reach out to Director Blake and probably Director Hunt as well, who also is on that, just to see if we can get a short answer.

1638
02:20:57,172 --> 02:21:01,275
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure there's a very long answer too, but if we can get a short answer to you guys.

1639
02:21:06,974 --> 02:21:07,695
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make sense.

1640
02:21:07,835 --> 02:21:10,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just, I was just curious.

1641
02:21:10,856 --> 02:21:14,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also worried it was just gonna, I mean, all those people are gonna put cars somewhere.

1642
02:21:14,819 --> 02:21:16,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So where are they gonna go?

1643
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:21,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Good mess of the businesses that are on Main Street down there.

1644
02:21:22,203 --> 02:21:23,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's also great.

1645
02:21:23,404 --> 02:21:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1646
02:21:24,824 --> 02:21:25,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

1647
02:21:25,825 --> 02:21:26,766
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole nother thing.

1648
02:21:26,846 --> 02:21:27,586
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, thanks.

1649
02:21:27,646 --> 02:21:31,568
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have information on that or something you can send us, that would be helpful.

1650
02:21:32,969 --> 02:21:33,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1651
02:21:36,518 --> 02:21:38,759
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyone else who would like to speak for public participation?

1652
02:21:38,779 --> 02:21:43,480
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there anyone on Zoom?

1653
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:49,702
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sick of someone.

1654
02:21:49,782 --> 02:21:50,022
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1655
02:21:51,302 --> 02:21:52,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Similar to him, kind of on the same topic.

1656
02:21:53,803 --> 02:22:02,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it was to my knowledge that this was done, kickstarted, I guess, by one person in the condos across the street.

1657
02:22:04,646 --> 02:22:05,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Shocking.

1658
02:22:07,082 --> 02:22:09,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow, I guess she pulled this whole thing together.

1659
02:22:09,523 --> 02:22:13,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what she said or how she did it, but.

1660
02:22:14,584 --> 02:22:16,825
[SPEAKER_25]: The council is familiar.

1661
02:22:17,545 --> 02:22:18,005
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

1662
02:22:19,085 --> 02:22:19,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they didn't say.

1663
02:22:19,666 --> 02:22:20,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1664
02:22:20,206 --> 02:22:20,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1665
02:22:21,066 --> 02:22:22,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1666
02:22:22,666 --> 02:22:22,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1667
02:22:39,214 --> 02:22:41,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that's okay.

1668
02:22:41,336 --> 02:22:43,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're gonna have to.

1669
02:22:45,319 --> 02:22:54,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Generally, just to that point, certainly individuals can kind of start or push for changes to be made.

1670
02:22:56,047 --> 02:23:07,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that is traffic commission policy is that if you could get 50% of the people on your street or on a certain section of your street to sign a petition, they will generally reconsider or at least look at reconsidering

1671
02:23:09,278 --> 02:23:15,040
[SPEAKER_07]: or look at making a change, a positive, you know, reconsidering a change they've made or looking at a different change.

1672
02:23:16,041 --> 02:23:22,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I did bring up the sidewalk thing because it may be a safety thing and it may have been past practice to just let it go.

1673
02:23:23,844 --> 02:23:30,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And that may have changed, but traffic commission generally, and you'll want to talk to director Blake when Nicole connects, President Morell connects you with them.

1674
02:23:30,626 --> 02:23:35,348
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a petitioning process for the traffic commission where they generally will look at things like that.

1675
02:23:35,628 --> 02:23:37,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can get like a resident

1676
02:23:38,715 --> 02:23:40,896
[SPEAKER_08]: permit only for that whole street.

1677
02:23:41,156 --> 02:23:45,437
[SPEAKER_07]: That is actually how you get permit parking right now in the city.

1678
02:23:45,457 --> 02:23:47,217
[SPEAKER_07]: 50% of the residents on your street will sign a petition.

1679
02:23:47,257 --> 02:23:49,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to re-register my car, so yeah.

1680
02:23:50,198 --> 02:23:53,138
[SPEAKER_25]: And if I could just get your name again for the record.

1681
02:23:53,198 --> 02:23:55,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Peyton Mitchell, 168 Harwood Street.

1682
02:23:55,339 --> 02:23:55,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Aiden?

1683
02:23:55,499 --> 02:23:55,479
168.

1684
02:23:55,579 --> 02:23:56,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that your first name?

1685
02:24:00,105 --> 02:24:07,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Peyton like Manning Manning and the last thing Mitchell Mitchell got it like Mitchell as Mitchell.

1686
02:24:09,989 --> 02:24:10,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1687
02:24:10,589 --> 02:24:10,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

1688
02:24:11,109 --> 02:24:11,589
[SPEAKER_25]: Appreciate it.

1689
02:24:13,090 --> 02:24:15,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyone else would like to speak for public participation?

1690
02:24:15,031 --> 02:24:19,432
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw that question.

1691
02:24:19,813 --> 02:24:21,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Ellen Lonsdale 180 Harvard Street.

1692
02:24:22,334 --> 02:24:26,295
[SPEAKER_18]: So when they do they have to give any kind of public comment period?

1693
02:24:26,315 --> 02:24:28,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Or can they just make these decisions?

1694
02:24:29,690 --> 02:24:34,655
[SPEAKER_13]: no kind of oversight i do yeah okay gotcha

1695
02:24:48,964 --> 02:24:57,450
[SPEAKER_25]: I figured as much, but I think they generally try not to make such impactful decisions in one meeting, but statutorily, I don't know.

1696
02:24:57,470 --> 02:25:00,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's a statutory requirement for notification.

1697
02:25:00,412 --> 02:25:14,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously it's affected people, so I think going to that body, the traffic commission, and then you obviously have support that, like Councilor Behr said, is now

1698
02:25:14,827 --> 02:25:28,053
[SPEAKER_06]: This, unfortunately, it was done right, embedded, everybody has a voice now, it has to be turned and divide the community and say, hey, now it's us versus you because we weren't notified.

1699
02:25:28,073 --> 02:25:31,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately, and I apologize for that, but that's terrible.

1700
02:25:32,315 --> 02:25:32,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1701
02:25:32,515 --> 02:25:33,335
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate your time.

1702
02:25:33,355 --> 02:25:35,576
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, yeah, I'll follow up on that email tomorrow morning.

1703
02:25:35,717 --> 02:25:38,378
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyone else for public participation?

1704
02:25:44,389 --> 02:25:44,830
[SPEAKER_08]: do this again.

1705
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:46,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Say the, Oh no, you're good.

1706
02:25:46,811 --> 02:25:52,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they going to start what is there like a timeline of when they're gonna start enforcing this since we did work.

1707
02:25:52,616 --> 02:25:53,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, last week.

1708
02:25:53,057 --> 02:25:53,537
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't yet.

1709
02:25:53,557 --> 02:25:55,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So broken on all it.

1710
02:26:08,665 --> 02:26:14,892
[SPEAKER_25]: From what we've been told, enforcement is unpredictable, so plan on it being unpredictable.

1711
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:19,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially the Yale Street lot in the winter, is that also very strict enforcement?

1712
02:26:19,457 --> 02:26:20,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Because last winter it wasn't.

1713
02:26:21,447 --> 02:26:26,248
[SPEAKER_07]: There are specific rules for parking in public lots during snow emergencies.

1714
02:26:26,888 --> 02:26:30,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Outside of a snow emergency, I would say that follow the rules.

1715
02:26:30,029 --> 02:26:30,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.

1716
02:26:30,809 --> 02:26:31,869
[SPEAKER_25]: I can add that to my questions.

1717
02:26:32,669 --> 02:26:34,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to park.

1718
02:26:34,249 --> 02:26:35,730
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I hear you.

1719
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:40,811
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll add that to my questions to Director Blake just so, while we have him.

1720
02:26:41,111 --> 02:26:45,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Best advice is to follow the rules as posted.

1721
02:26:46,072 --> 02:26:47,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a fair point.

1722
02:26:50,037 --> 02:26:52,659
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyone else public participation either on zoom or in person.

1723
02:26:56,341 --> 02:27:14,073
[SPEAKER_25]: Seeing none, I do believe we have hands in the favor of the clerk, which is on me to read so moving on to hands in favor of the clerk under suspension 22-566 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it so resolved the city council discuss the lack of communication dealing with school department issues and concerns Councilor Scarpelli.

1724
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:15,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1725
02:27:15,681 --> 02:27:21,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I do not want to at any time disrespect our colleagues on the school committee side.

1726
02:27:21,924 --> 02:27:41,994
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think everybody has watched the news about the horrific attack on that young lady, a sophomore at Medford High School and the phone calls I've been getting and the conversation I've been having with Medford High School students.

1727
02:27:44,242 --> 02:27:49,533
[SPEAKER_06]: and not having the knowledge of what happened or how we can direct our

1728
02:27:50,137 --> 02:27:52,019
[SPEAKER_06]: young people for support.

1729
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:57,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we have kids that we have students that have come to me and said that they're afraid.

1730
02:27:57,122 --> 02:27:59,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're legitimately afraid.

1731
02:27:59,805 --> 02:28:01,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about going to school.

1732
02:28:01,226 --> 02:28:07,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I've I've talked to teachers that have involved in fights that are horrified and frightened to go to work.

1733
02:28:08,551 --> 02:28:14,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you see that, it's just another slap in the face and disrespect of this community that you have.

1734
02:28:14,956 --> 02:28:15,697
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a marine

1735
02:28:16,773 --> 02:28:18,514
[SPEAKER_06]: recruiter breaking up a fight.

1736
02:28:18,794 --> 02:28:25,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, which leads to, um, questions we had with the superintendent about security.

1737
02:28:25,437 --> 02:28:33,240
[SPEAKER_06]: They said they had security from now what I was told, you know, that the questions that is not being communicated correctly, and that's where the communication comes in place.

1738
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:41,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they're more like door monitors and, um, and something has to be done.

1739
02:28:41,424 --> 02:28:41,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is

1740
02:28:43,042 --> 02:28:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, not only because I have a child here, but I talked to, I was at a recent school event that when I tell you former students and athletes that I've coached have come up to me and said, coach, we're scared, it's scary up here.

1741
02:28:58,855 --> 02:29:02,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And Smithford High School, that's a place to go where you're gonna be safe.

1742
02:29:03,278 --> 02:29:09,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And not having the understanding of what I could tell them, because in normal cases,

1743
02:29:10,867 --> 02:29:12,968
[SPEAKER_06]: situations when there is an issue this big.

1744
02:29:13,569 --> 02:29:17,051
[SPEAKER_06]: We're informed that anybody here was anybody else, maybe I missed it.

1745
02:29:18,091 --> 02:29:24,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Did anybody, I actually I'm still waiting for the mayor to go yell at her superintendent like she yelled at Mr. Belson.

1746
02:29:25,603 --> 02:29:28,845
[SPEAKER_15]: because this issue right here is scary, all right?

1747
02:29:28,885 --> 02:29:32,607
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't someone dropped something out of their pocket, it was found in the little theater by a custodian.

1748
02:29:33,107 --> 02:29:43,274
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a student got assaulted, stalked, assaulted, tracked down, five adults, six adults, seven adults, nine adults, 10 adults watching, no one intervening.

1749
02:29:43,314 --> 02:29:46,816
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting for the mayor to go and treat her superintendent like she treated Roy Belson.

1750
02:29:48,497 --> 02:29:52,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the situation is, and the resolution is, you know,

1751
02:29:53,647 --> 02:30:03,595
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we find a ground with this communication that when we get the phone calls from parents and students that are asking for assistance and help, where do we direct them to?

1752
02:30:03,635 --> 02:30:14,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they don't feel comfortable in what they're seeing and what paths that have happened so far and who they can reach out to.

1753
02:30:14,524 --> 02:30:18,026
[SPEAKER_06]: They feel alone and they're scared.

1754
02:30:19,227 --> 02:30:21,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anybody, if you didn't see the video,

1755
02:30:22,037 --> 02:30:24,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you not look at the video because it's gonna change your life.

1756
02:30:25,039 --> 02:30:26,820
[SPEAKER_06]: It's disgusting.

1757
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:29,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1758
02:30:29,481 --> 02:30:32,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1759
02:30:32,363 --> 02:30:34,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

1760
02:30:34,384 --> 02:30:36,565
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's great.

1761
02:30:37,566 --> 02:30:44,710
[SPEAKER_02]: When something like this horrific thing happens, there's 14 elected officials in the city of Medford.

1762
02:30:45,330 --> 02:30:47,691
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is it to notify 14 people

1763
02:30:50,775 --> 02:30:51,936
[SPEAKER_02]: of something of this happening.

1764
02:30:51,996 --> 02:30:55,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we get the phone call, we know how to answer people.

1765
02:30:55,378 --> 02:30:56,458
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how to answer.

1766
02:30:58,839 --> 02:31:04,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to find out from two days later for people on the street asking me about, I'm saying, I don't even know what you're talking about.

1767
02:31:04,762 --> 02:31:09,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame that I say something of this nature happens.

1768
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:12,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Call us, call us, make a phone call.

1769
02:31:13,151 --> 02:31:14,972
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not that many people that you have to call.

1770
02:31:15,212 --> 02:31:19,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, we get robocalls, we get all this other crap.

1771
02:31:19,275 --> 02:31:23,037
[SPEAKER_02]: For everything else in the city, if something of this importance happens, none of us know about it.

1772
02:31:23,137 --> 02:31:35,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And there isn't anything worse than being an elected official and a constituent comes up to you and asks you about it, and you're saying, geez, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1773
02:31:35,164 --> 02:31:39,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, talk about looking like a fool in front of people.

1774
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:47,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the worst feeling I get from people when they ask me questions and I have no idea what they're even talking about.

1775
02:31:48,185 --> 02:31:49,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really insane.

1776
02:31:49,386 --> 02:31:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only 14 elected officials in the state, no reason why people that this group and the school committee couldn't have notified us of this happening.

1777
02:31:59,532 --> 02:32:04,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're informed when people ask us questions.

1778
02:32:06,169 --> 02:32:13,371
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you like getting calls from out of state, friends, people you went to high school with, who don't live in the state anymore, that saw this on the national news?

1779
02:32:14,411 --> 02:32:16,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight is right 100%.

1780
02:32:18,452 --> 02:32:23,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the mayor screaming at the superintendent the same way when the gun clip happened?

1781
02:32:25,393 --> 02:32:26,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody got hurt with a gun clip.

1782
02:32:29,494 --> 02:32:30,314
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1783
02:32:32,075 --> 02:32:33,155
[SPEAKER_25]: Any further discussion from the council?

1784
02:32:33,884 --> 02:32:43,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I mean, I'm thinking back to this whole situation where the mayor's at Fox 25 down in front of the school department over here.

1785
02:32:43,287 --> 02:32:47,208
[SPEAKER_15]: She called them herself talking about the gun clip, calls for a press conference.

1786
02:32:47,288 --> 02:32:50,769
[SPEAKER_15]: The school committee comes, they put Roy Belson on the stage in the little theater.

1787
02:32:51,449 --> 02:32:52,969
[SPEAKER_15]: And he sat there for four hours.

1788
02:32:53,549 --> 02:32:58,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And after 40 years of service to the city guard, his head beat it for hours and hours and hours.

1789
02:32:58,451 --> 02:32:59,471
[SPEAKER_15]: And the mayor led the charge.

1790
02:33:00,211 --> 02:33:01,111
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor led the charge.

1791
02:33:01,932 --> 02:33:03,052
[SPEAKER_15]: She was like a raven lunatic.

1792
02:33:04,087 --> 02:33:07,808
[SPEAKER_15]: getting up out of the crowd, running up to the microphone, yelling and screaming at people.

1793
02:33:08,328 --> 02:33:08,828
[SPEAKER_15]: It was nuts.

1794
02:33:09,388 --> 02:33:17,590
[SPEAKER_15]: And now to have something like this happen under her watch and to not hold her own people accountable to the same level and same accord is shameful, in my opinion.

1795
02:33:19,390 --> 02:33:32,753
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, Madam President, just I think more importantly, I know that the intent is really to have the understanding that the students are so

1796
02:33:34,472 --> 02:33:39,535
[SPEAKER_06]: custom to situations that have happened in the past, whether it was the issue last year.

1797
02:33:40,536 --> 02:33:43,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And now what happened with this situation.

1798
02:33:43,318 --> 02:33:47,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're a little bit lost.

1799
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:58,147
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to know what the what this school administration is going to do to make the rest of the school feel like they're safe.

1800
02:33:59,307 --> 02:34:00,068
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I know that

1801
02:34:00,835 --> 02:34:29,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the communication to us, the most important pieces is from the school department to say, you know, this is what's going on, but asking, having an avenue that we can have the kids talk to the guidance councils or, you know, their, you know, teachers they feel comfortable with, because whenever they're, especially when I was on the school committee, the understanding that something big happened,

1802
02:34:31,092 --> 02:34:34,994
[SPEAKER_06]: the first thing we did is rallied around the students that were impacted.

1803
02:34:35,394 --> 02:34:37,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, for instance, is all of our students.

1804
02:34:38,836 --> 02:34:44,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked if there was assemblies, how were the students notified?

1805
02:34:45,979 --> 02:34:48,161
[SPEAKER_06]: How are they feeling safe?

1806
02:34:50,202 --> 02:34:52,803
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't been addressed.

1807
02:34:54,348 --> 02:34:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: from what I've been told.

1808
02:34:55,349 --> 02:34:58,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's different, but from what I've been told, they haven't been addressed.

1809
02:34:58,751 --> 02:35:07,836
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we need to stop listening to our children, listen to our students, because they were frightened.

1810
02:35:08,316 --> 02:35:11,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I don't wanna be a dead horse, but thank you.

1811
02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:13,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1812
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:16,041
[SPEAKER_25]: We have reached the end of our agenda.

1813
02:35:19,243 --> 02:35:20,464
[SPEAKER_25]: It's under suspension.

1814
02:35:22,290 --> 02:35:23,531
[SPEAKER_25]: because we took it up under suspension.

1815
02:35:23,751 --> 02:35:32,057
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I mean, what's the motion?

1816
02:35:37,121 --> 02:35:40,204
[SPEAKER_25]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive in place on file.

1817
02:35:42,229 --> 02:35:43,812
[SPEAKER_25]: Second by Vice Mayor Bears.

1818
