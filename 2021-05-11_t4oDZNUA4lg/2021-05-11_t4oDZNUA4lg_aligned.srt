1
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:14,678
I believe that everyone is muted at this point, but it's always the start of a zoom meeting where I wonder if I'm if I have audio so.

2
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:17,263
Good evening.

3
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,315
Good evening, everyone.

4
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,617
I'm going to wait till 5 after.

5
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,301
Hi.

6
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,123
I can't change my name right now.

7
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,086
That's a little bit of a problem.

8
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,913
You should be good to go now.

9
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:36,109
Couple minutes.

10
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:52,652
All right, I got four after, but want to get started?

11
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:57,295
All right, call the meeting to order.

12
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,576
Seth, do you still have background noise?

13
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:15,283
That was just incidental stuff that you were unmuted and I could hear you, so some folks seemed

14
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:24,154
to question whether or not we're able to hear, but it was just background noise.

15
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,115
It wasn't bothering or anything.

16
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,115
All right, all right, okay.

17
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:31,116
I'm in a room, quiet room by myself, so okay.

18
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,696
All right, thank you.

19
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:35,037
All right, we're gonna get started.

20
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:45,760
Tonight's format, I think instead of the open format, we'll raise hands to be recognized.

21
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:56,824
and can I get a volunteer to just point out to me if I don't see the raised hands, just say there's someone with a hand up so I don't miss anybody.

22
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:01,686
Would anybody like to do that for me?

23
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:03,566
I can try to do it.

24
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:05,047
Okay, thank you.

25
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:06,347
I don't mind either.

26
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,568
If you see a hand raised, just let me know.

27
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:10,069
All right.

28
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:10,669
All right.

29
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:13,489
uh, point of information.

30
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:18,794
Are we actually physically raising our hands or are we trying to use the, uh, the zoom reaction?

31
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,196
Well, either off is good for me.

32
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:25,900
I could see you raising hand, but the zoom reaction, I might miss that.

33
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,902
I'll see if I guess I'd see it.

34
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:29,123
Fair enough.

35
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:29,884
Okay.

36
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:33,808
I think some people didn't have the zoom reaction in the last meeting either.

37
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,149
So, okay.

38
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,170
I'll look for both.

39
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:36,830
All right.

40
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,391
Thank you.

41
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:38,292
Thanks.

42
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:39,485
All right.

43
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,607
And it only gets cumbersome if we have more than one page of people.

44
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,789
Right now we only have one page, so it's a little bit easier.

45
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:45,689
Okay.

46
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,252
All right.

47
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,173
The first is the packet.

48
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:52,454
It was brought to my attention.

49
00:07:53,014 --> 00:08:01,019
We should have all received an open meeting laws packet originally when we all got appointed.

50
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,702
So there would have been no questions about what the emails that went back and forth.

51
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:12,097
We have sent out packets for everyone to read and sign and acknowledge that they understand.

52
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:18,981
So please sign your copy and get it back the sooner the better, but you know, as soon as possible.

53
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:21,283
All right.

54
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:24,444
Has everyone had a chance to review the minutes of the previous meeting?

55
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:29,387
They were put on, I think yesterday or today.

56
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:36,692
Are there any corrections in the minutes or can I get an approval to accept the minutes?

57
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,833
Somebody like to make a motion to approve the minutes?

58
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,435
Point of order, Mr. Chair.

59
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:59,642
I think Lisa had said something about the notes not being able to be approved this week because it was not posted as part of the- So Lisa said she couldn't post them until I got them approved.

60
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:06,315
So that's why they were sent out to you to read so that tonight you could approve them.

61
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:07,355
Okay, great.

62
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,396
So then they will be posted, official.

63
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,276
Excellent.

64
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:11,597
Okay, thank you.

65
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:13,618
I think, Lisa, do you have your hand up?

66
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,922
Yeah, I just, Jim, you should probably just do a roll call to see who's in before you do anything else.

67
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,623
Okay, thank you.

68
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,305
I mean, I have an alpha list or if you want, whatever.

69
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:31,431
I have a list, I just have to take it out.

70
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:32,512
No problem.

71
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:35,094
Thank you, because we're Zoom, we should.

72
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,558
Okay, can I take attendance, please?

73
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,220
Brie Brothers?

74
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:43,822

Beth Fuller?

80
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:00,303
I think Beth had a conflict, right?

81
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:01,264
So Beth's not here.

82
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:05,307
Great, excuse me.

83
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,948
She's here, she's muted.

84
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:08,229
All right, I'm sorry.

85
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,951
Oh, I see, she's here, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:11,912
Thank you, Beth is here.

87
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:13,834

88
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,435
Hi, I'm here.

Melissa McGill.

107
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:52,228
Present.

Kaitlin Shaughnessy.

121
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,352
I don't see her.

122
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:22,273
I think she might be late again tonight.

123
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:23,233
Okay.

124
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:25,034
Thank you.

125
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,996

Here.

129
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:35,684
All right, thank you.

130
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:40,145
So everybody but Caitlin right now.

131
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,466
Okay, thank you.

132
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:46,767
Back to the minutes.

133
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,887
Everyone's had a chance to read the minutes.

134
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:53,609
Can I get a motion to approve the minutes?

135
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,349
Motion to approve.

136
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,790
Can I get a second?

137
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,450
Second.

138
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,824
All right, all those in favor?

139
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,145
I'm sorry, I have to interrupt.

140
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:15,209
Whoever approved, can you say your name and the second, because I have to record that and I, I'm sorry, everybody yet, okay?

141
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,150
All right, so the motion was made.

142
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,791
We'll have to take a roll call.

143
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:19,931
Okay, sorry, bye.

144
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:23,233
That's all right.

145
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:24,513
Lou, did you make the motion?

146
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,374
I did, Lou Antwapa.

147
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:27,995
And you seconded it?

148
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:28,895
I seconded it.

149
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,033
I'm sorry, who seconded the motion?

150
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,493
Paul Donato Jr.

151
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:34,434
Thank you, Paul.

152
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:38,496
Okay, now I'll go down the list for a roll call, I guess.

153
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:42,498
Mr. Chair, I have a correction to make to the minutes though.

154
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:43,679
Yes.

155
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,442
The motion that I made was not captured.

156
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,983
It looks like it's a partial motion.

157
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:53,284
Who is that?

158
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:57,930
What's that?

159
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:59,672
Who's speaking right now?

160
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:01,393
This is Patrick McCabe speaking.

161
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:01,934
Okay.

162
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:10,881
If you can send me what you'd like added, um, Grace sent me hers and Laura sent me hers.

163
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,084
And that's what I've done with school committee as well.

164
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:22,972
So if you can send me the, uh, the motion, the way you want it, I will, um, do, I will amend it in the notes and you guys can.

165
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:33,329
choose to accept it with that amendment, or you can table the notes and, um, I, I, I, I, I withdraw that proposed amendment.

166
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,431
I just, I, we need, we need to keep things moving.

167
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:40,735
I just, uh, I'll, um, yeah, let's keep it moving motion.

168
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:45,459
The committee, please take a roll call.

169
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:46,660
No words.

170
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Okay.

171
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:49,382
Okay.

172
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:50,243
Roll call.

173
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:50,483
Right?

174
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:51,744
Yes.

175
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:53,783
Lisa, you're coming in broken.

176
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:55,764
I'm getting high for what you're saying, sorry.

177
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:59,527
I think because I shut my, because I played with the mute button.

178
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:09,413
No, I just mean in the future and every meeting, just so everybody's aware, if you make a motion, please send me your wording after the meeting so it's appropriate in the notes, okay?

179
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,434
All right, sounds good, thank you.

180
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,315
Thank you.

181
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,517
Okay, so on the motion to approve the minutes.

182
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,018
Reed brothers?

183
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,340
Yes.

184
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,901
Dan Puccio?

185
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:30,738
Dan Puccio.

186
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:32,979
He's giving the thumbs up.

187
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:33,979
Give me a thumbs up.

188
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,421
I don't see him on my screen.

190
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,582
Aaron Genia.

191
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,583
I think he needs to be made a co-host.

192
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:41,764
OK, someone just did that.

193
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:43,745
Yes.

194
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:47,027
Beth Fuller.

195
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:47,807
Yes.

196
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,008
Grace Caldera.

197
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:51,869
Yes.

198
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,270
Hendrick.

199
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:01,527
Yes.

200
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:02,627
I missed that.

201
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:03,068
Okay.

202
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,268
Henry, can you pronounce your last name for me?

203
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:05,668
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,369
I'm afraid to.

205
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,249
Sure.

206
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,689
It's Gideons.

207
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:13,531
So just put your thumb over the E and then it makes much more sense.

208
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:14,251
Okay.

209
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,411
The E is pesky.

210
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:15,991
Gideons.

211
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:16,672
All right.

212
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:17,712
Thank you.

213
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:19,472
Yep.

214
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:20,273
Tachibot.

215
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:20,633
Yes.

216
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:21,933
Kenneth Mallon.

217
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:23,074
Yes.

218
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:24,914
Kristen Scalise.

219
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:26,215
Yes.

220
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:27,695
Laura Rotolo.

221
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

222
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,881
Laura Ritolo.

223
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:38,462
Laura's muted.

224
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,462
Thank you.

225
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:42,043
I wasn't able to unmute for a minute.

226
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,824
It was telling me the host has disabled that, but yes.

227
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:46,784
Okay.

228
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:47,425
Thank you.

229
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:48,945
Lou and Tapa.

230
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:49,525
Yes.

231
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:50,966
Maria Rocha.

232
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:52,526
Yes.

233
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:53,867
Melissa Miguel.

234
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:02,430
She gave a thumbs up.

235
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,190
Okay.

236
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:05,305
Patrick?

237
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:06,146
Aye.

238
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,666
Paul?

239
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:08,907
Yes.

240
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:09,928
Ronald?

241
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:10,868
Yes.

242
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:11,788
Seth?

243
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:14,030
Yes.

244
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,170
Kathy?

245
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:16,631
Yes.

246
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:17,771
Matthew?

247
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:18,772
Yes.

248
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:20,433
Caitlin?

249
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,493
She's not here.

250
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,033
Janelle?

251
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:23,194
Yes.

252
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:24,295
Josie?

253
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:25,735
Yes.

254
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:26,716
Okay.

255
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,777
I don't know if you called me, but yes.

256
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:31,098
Thank you.

257
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,008
All right.

258
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:41,930
All right, the rubric's results were out today.

259
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,671
Before I get into that, there was a mistake.

260
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:58,114
I'm responsible for, Arthur De La Russo was taken off the list before we moved that list.

261
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:04,315
There's an Arthur De La Russo and a Frederick De La Russo, and they were both past mayors of the city of Medford.

262
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:10,677
And there was some confusion as to Alfred, who's still alive.

263
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,139
And that's why the names were taken off.

264
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,960
The name was taken off the list.

265
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:28,429
So I would ask that in all fairness, after we come up with a top seven or eight, that we add Arthur De La Russo's name back to the list for further consideration.

266
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:31,251
Does anyone have a problem with that?

267
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:41,497
Under information, it was my understanding that we had come up with a list of top 15 per the resolution we voted on.

268
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,077
We can agree on 15, that's fine.

269
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,798
I mean, did you see the way the grades worked out?

270
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,059
We had a top 10, but we can talk 15.

271
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:49,700
I have no problem with that.

272
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,422
And I'll raise my hand, sorry.

273
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:54,922
Yes.

274
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,332
Yeah, so I think the way that the top 15 falls out is there's three people tied for 15, so there's no tiebreaker.

275
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,553
So that would give us 17.

276
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:15,476
And I guess I think that's a smart way to look at it, Jim, is that we just automatically put Al De La Russo.

277
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:20,798
So my recommendation, I'd say, I'd like to make a motion that we have 18

278
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:31,181
names, the top 15, which turns out to be 17, and then L. de la Russo gets added to that list for our discussion.

279
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:37,983
Okay, so it's for clarification, it's Arthur de la Russo was the name submitted.

280
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,303
Arthur, yes.

281
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:43,765
And you know, there is also a Frederick that was mayor, but we're talking about Arthur, so.

282
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,926
So my motion would be to

283
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:55,390
include the top 17 on the score sheet and then Arthur Delarusso for the consideration for the rest of the night.

284
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:56,911
Okay.

285
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,111
Is there a point?

286
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,791
Seconds, I'm sorry.

287
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:11,693
Just a point of information for folks to reference the sheet.

288
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,474
That would take us up to

289
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:20,452
Pache Sulo, those 17.

290
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:27,177
Can we, before we do that, can we, let me get a second if this is gonna go and then we'll discuss it, okay?

291
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:28,518
Who made the motion?

292
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:29,960
Patrick McCabe.

293
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,481
Patrick McCabe.

294
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,864
Am I able to ask a question about the list?

295
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:39,388
Let me get a second first and then we will discuss it.

296
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:42,744
Okay, I can tell you.

297
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,925
Okay, we have a second.

298
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:45,005
Point of information.

299
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:45,565
Yes.

300
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:49,887
There's a resolution on our agenda that addresses part of this piece.

301
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:59,772
So in order of, I think we should separate the Arthur DelaRusso being added as a finalist resolution from what number we're gonna settle on.

302
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:03,473
So that would be my suggestion.

303
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,374
I think we should just separate.

304
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:06,535
That would be an amendment to this motion that I would say.

305
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:15,399
Well, I would say if somebody wants to make a resolution that Arthur DelaRusso is automatically a finalist, whatever number it is, we should be able to vote on that.

306
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:21,285
So why don't we vote, yeah, why don't we have a motion for the 15?

307
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:27,351
to be 17, and then Arthur was added after the fact.

308
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:29,472
So why don't we vote on Arthur first?

309
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:32,734
Point of information, I don't want to make this any lengthier.

310
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:38,037
There's a resolution on the agenda that talks about 10.

311
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:43,360
So I don't want to jump the gun here, but the resolution talks about 10.

312
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:51,545
If we vote on 15, I just think we need to do the Arthur de la Ruzo thing, and then we can come together on a number that we want.

313
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:55,217
And I do have a point of information as well.

314
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:59,520
It wasn't one of my names to vet, but I did see a Dela Russo on the list.

315
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,321
Was that not the one we're talking about?

316
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:06,584
It is, but it came off when we were talking about living in the city.

317
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,425
It was not assigned to a member, is the way.

318
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:10,205
Oh, OK.

319
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:11,606
To be rated.

320
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:14,108
OK.

321
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,369
Maria has her hand up.

322
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,930
Hold on, Pat.

323
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:20,951
Who had their hand up?

324
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,152
Maria does.

325
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,450
Maria.

326
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:31,415
I don't understand why we would be automatically adding Dela Russo to the finalists.

327
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:39,039
I feel as though we had a procedure in terms of research and I understand not wanting to prolong this process.

328
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:50,666
However, it feels unwise for us to just simply add a name because it got cut off and that can get dicey in terms of like other names.

329
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:51,907
So we left off accidentally.

330
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:56,690
left off accidentally, and a remedy would be to add it at this point.

331
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,031
Another remedy would be to scrap the whole thing and do it over.

332
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,052
Point of information, Mr. Lister?

333
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:03,692
Yes.

334
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:07,034
I just want to clarify.

335
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:09,915
You're saying was left off on the final?

336
00:22:10,515 --> 00:22:12,676
Was mistakenly taken off as living.

337
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,737
OK, I understand.

338
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:18,458
But are you saying that he actually made this list of top 15, a.k.a. 17?

339
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:22,850
Did he make that list, that top list?

340
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,052
He wasn't even on the list of people to be vetted because he was eliminated before.

341
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:29,793
Okay.

342
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:32,134
That's all.

343
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:33,555
I'm just, you know.

344
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:35,356
Sure.

345
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:37,436
I see you, Ron.

346
00:22:38,477 --> 00:22:39,658
I also have my hand up.

347
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:43,819
I think my question is similar to the one that was just asked.

348
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,422
So what I'm hearing is that he hasn't been scored at all, and it does seem a little bit odd to add him into the scoring.

349
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:54,391
if he has not been scored at all, considering that everybody else has been scored.

350
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:56,398
correct.

351
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:02,300
So the reason why I'm putting forward that motion is in the spirit of moving forward as quickly as possible.

352
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,462
I think that, you know, the only alternative, I don't think the only alternative is scrapping.

353
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:17,205
I mean, we could assign five people randomly and they can go off and rank this person, but we're going to lose 15, 20, 30 minutes while five people

354
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:22,927
go back and rank this person.

355
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:34,052
So that's the alternative that I see is to spend 15 to 30 minutes for five people to do their assessment of him.

356
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:39,275
Ryan had his hand up.

357
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:41,576
Go ahead.

358
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:50,314
I'm just thinking for the general public here and the person that we're missing.

359
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:58,558
Irregardless of who the person was, it kind of voids the whole process because someone was taken out inappropriately.

360
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:09,503
The only resolutions to my mind are what Jim has suggested, because we're gonna have to, you know, the people on the top 15, some of us,

361
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:13,188
did not have any say on how they got to the 15th.

362
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:21,169
So they're on the list, whether you like them or not, we don't even know because only 25% of everybody got to vet that person.

363
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:30,052
So the Arthur DelaRusso omission is the only way to fix this is by putting them on as a finalist and go through the process just as another name.

364
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:34,933
Otherwise you are looking at scrapping it because it's just, it's completely invalid.

365
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:36,973
Right.

366
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:38,074
Can we vote on

367
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,285
The motion that we have to be 18.

368
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:48,769
Is everybody all set with that?

369
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:49,890
We can move this motion.

370
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:55,955
Did I get a second?

371
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:01,320
Second, Grace.

372
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,040
Thank you, Grace.

373
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:03,822
Thank you.

374
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:05,964
Any more discussion?

375
00:25:06,244 --> 00:25:07,305
We're all set on discussion.

376
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:17,018
The motion on the table is that instead of 15 we have a top.

377
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,224
18, including Arthur deliver so or not including, so it would be.

378
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:34,995
If you look at the list, if you look at the score for number 15, it's the same score as number 16 and number 17, like Seth had said, down to Achilles Sulu.

379
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:40,837
So those would be 17, and then we would add De La Russo, so we would have 18 finalists.

380
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:59,194
So then I would have an amendment, a proposed amendment to Mr. Lister's motion would be that in the next few days we assign randomly five people to- But there's no, you can't propose any amendments now because it's a motion on the floor.

381
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:02,597
All right, so then this is just discussion, I suppose.

382
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:21,012
Another idea would be to assign five people randomly to rank Arthur de la Russo, and if he receives a nine or above, which would be tied, right, for the bottom three, that he would be put automatically into the list, but only if he receives a nine or above.

383
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:25,355
Thank you, Laura.

384
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,617
I see Ron waving and raising.

385
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,639
Right.

386
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,321
So, I have two points.

387
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:38,524
First off, it doesn't cost anything to put out the dollar was on the list.

388
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:42,927
Number one, number two is I don't know if you all looked at the schedule but

389
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:49,058
you know, to get to the end of the month and have a decision, this adds another piece to the prize.

390
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:54,520
You know, we'd have to come back, we'd have to vote on the list, then we'd have to open it up to the public.

391
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:06,082
But I'm also concerned that the way, you know, there is a resolution on our agenda that should come before any of this discussion about 17, 18, 19, 20.

392
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:16,699
So again, my resolution, I think the resolution should be, does Arthur DelaRusso become a finalist?

393
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,179
That's one vote.

394
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,440
Then we can move on through the agenda.

395
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,061
I think on the other one, Ron, I'm sorry, I'm going out of order.

396
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,401
I think Josie had her hand up.

397
00:27:28,502 --> 00:27:29,102
Josie here.

398
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:45,932
Well, it was my understanding that the next like step in the process was to, was for us to like, look through the names that made the top 15, 18, and we would like vote through those.

399
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:51,033
So the whole committee would score them, sorry, whole committee would score them.

400
00:27:51,173 --> 00:28:00,915
And, um, so if we added Arthur Delarosa's name onto it, I think it would be fine because we're still scoring him along with the names.

401
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:02,588
Thank you.

402
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:14,570
So there's three motion, three resolutions on the floor tonight that also we did the rubrics.

403
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:26,812
Now the next resolution involves, it's another exercise in looking at the names.

404
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,733
And then there's two more that are offered that are,

405
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:37,059
exercises in survey and in, I believe the fourth one was to let the kids at the school vote.

406
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,425
So I think they all play into, I really, I don't want to get into debating the first list until we've had the other three exercises.

407
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:50,568
So let's vote up this first one.

408
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:57,773
We're in the middle of voting this, the 18, by inserting out of the De La Rosa number 18.

409
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:03,048
Can we go through and vote this, and then we'll get on to the next resolution?

410
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:07,431
As a point of information, I mean, I'm just trying to understand the rules.

411
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:12,754
Last week, we went in order by resolution, and we took Dr. Grace's resolution first.

412
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:18,238
This supersedes my resolution, so I have a concern with talking about 17 and 18.

413
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,581
That may be the number, but there's a resolution out here that should be followed first.

414
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,413
Uh, point of order.

415
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:43,261
Are you, um, is Ron, are you asking that we postpone this discussion until after your resolution has been voted on or are we severing the motion?

416
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:47,043
So we have to vote the motion.

417
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:48,124
It would be a no.

418
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:55,548
If you don't want to go through with the 18 and then we'll go to the next resolution.

419
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,543
just point of information.

420
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,710
I'm saying that procedurally we're in error.

421
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:04,298
I don't care what the result is, but going forward, I think

422
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:16,995
you know, we should be talking about severing the issue of Arthur DelaRusso being a finalist, then move to my resolution, which will accomplish what all of you are looking for, which is settling on a number.

423
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:21,337
But to jump my resolution, I just think is out of procedure from what we did last week.

424
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:33,642
The point of order, we need to go in what is already listed on the agenda, and thus we need to maintain that current order, which has,

425
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:41,688
First to collect aggregate rubric evaluations from the community and then discuss how to solicit public information.

426
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:46,092
Then it comes to your resolution and then resolution on public participation.

427
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:55,400
So we can move to sever the current resolution and

428
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:01,886
take up yours out of order or we continue this discussion.

429
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:07,850
Point of order, the old business comes before new business.

430
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:13,173
So the 17 is just a clarification of the motion that we made last week.

431
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,674
The motion we made last week was for the top 15.

432
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:21,396
So if you cut it off at the score where the top 15 is, there's two other people that are tied.

433
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:22,816
There's three people that are tied.

434
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:30,937
So it's just a clarification of the motion from last week is what the 17 is.

435
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,818
So, I mean, I think you're right.

436
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:45,140
I mean, as far as the argument about adding De La Russo being new business before the committee, but the 17 is just a clarification of the motion from last week.

437
00:31:49,868 --> 00:32:03,778
So I, you know, if you want to, I can sever it, but I mean, I, I think it's totally in order for us to go down to 17, just to clarify that last week we said 15 and 16 and 17 are tied.

438
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:05,139
They're all tied for 15.

439
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,961
So can, can someone show me in the resolution?

440
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:13,324
I don't have it in front of me where it says the rating system will be binding to the top 15.

441
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:14,265
I don't see that.

442
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,537
I don't think, I don't think it, maybe I'm talking out of order.

443
00:32:19,597 --> 00:32:22,600
I don't think it says that it's binding, but- Nothing's binding.

444
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:32,751
Well, just for the fact that we're making the top 17 those people, that means that that rating system was binding, does it not?

445
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,813
Well, in that exercise.

446
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:44,795
So let me say that in that exercise, we're gonna have- There's no resolution on the table yet that says the top 15 ranked there is the list.

447
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:46,116
We don't have that.

448
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:59,664
There doesn't need to be, excuse me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that since we already voted on this previous resolution that stated the top 15 or an event of a tie, this is what happens.

449
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:05,248
That is a binding resolution that is bringing us forward and that is what we're following.

450
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:15,385
Until the resolution no longer exists, which it currently does as we voted it in last week.

451
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:17,829
And so that is what we're moving on.

452
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:19,773
Point of information.

453
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:30,316
I just would like someone to show me where the resolution says that the fact that I did not get to rate all people on that list, that that list becomes binding.

454
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,537
I don't remember seeing it.

455
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,917
If somebody wants to show me that we voted on it.

456
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:35,438
Everything we're doing is non-binding.

457
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,278
This whole committee is non-binding.

458
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:43,500
No, I got it, but I don't remember it saying, I understand the exercise.

459
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,321
The final piece was the top 15 that were ranked,

460
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:52,957
we're not necessarily gonna be binding, right?

461
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:59,341
So now you're saying that we're gonna make 17, 18 of the top of that rating system binding.

462
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:00,382
That's my point.

463
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:02,764
Point of order.

464
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:10,530
So I'm just going to read from the resolution that we passed last week.

465
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:14,133
whether or not the information is binding or not.

466
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:21,197
Yes, we could put forward any names, but from a parliamentary procedure, this is what we passed.

467
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:30,462
And number five, the 15 submissions receiving the highest average score advanced to consideration by the whole advisory committee.

468
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:31,723
We will then

469
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:45,049
So we're going to, all of the committee is going to review all of the names that advance.

470
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:51,994
Number six, the advisory committee conducts additional research and solicits public input.

471
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:53,635
Number seven.

472
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:55,096
I withdraw my motion.

473
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:56,457
I withdraw my motion.

474
00:34:56,477 --> 00:35:01,181
The motion of the, the, what we passed last week does bring us down to 17.

475
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,562
Thank you for clarifying.

476
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:04,183
Thank you.

477
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,463
All right, we're back to Ata De La Rucha.

478
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:20,194
We wanna hold him and go to the next resolution, because it's part of Ron's resolution.

479
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:24,559
Anybody's hand up?

480
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:34,826
So can we... I don't see any hands, but the glare on my screen has gotten horrible.

481
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:37,747
So we can move to Ron's resolution.

482
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:40,908
Can I ask a question?

483
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,549
Yes.

484
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:47,371
Especially with these, the local figures, there is not a lot about them.

485
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:55,674
And I struggled to find information on some of the people whom I was assigned and was not that familiar with, but I was able to.

486
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:58,895
I was just doing a search for Mr. De La Russo.

487
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,777
and I can find practically nothing.

488
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:07,702
So I don't even know how, you know, we're expected to vote on some of these.

489
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:18,130
The most information is on a website that looks like it was made by a, it's a nice way to say it, a muckraker.

490
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:28,859
It's not, obviously not a legitimate source of information and I wouldn't want to use that in my research, but how would we even go about

491
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,249
you know, I struggle with that.

492
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:43,132
And if we're going to put another person on to rank who there's not a lot of information about online or how are we going to rank it?

493
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:47,273
Before we rank more, how should I, how should we rank?

494
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:57,815
If we left him off inadvertently, if we put him back on, then through the process, he won't rise to the top of the list.

495
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:58,695
He'll just get his,

496
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,716
viewing and research as best as we can.

497
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:06,678
I think I saw Lisa's hand.

498
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,360
Lisa.

499
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:14,846
If I could, Arthur de la Russo was a mayor.

500
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:20,731
So information would be available in the city clerk's office in the historical society.

501
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:23,694
The family itself has been here since forever.

502
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:30,531
I think Arthur was one of the founding people for the Delrus Funeral Home.

503
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:32,532
So you could trace it.

504
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:36,634
It's just a little bit extra on whomever gets assigned it.

505
00:37:38,295 --> 00:37:43,118
But the family, Arthur and Fred were both mayors.

506
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:46,300
And I believe, I know Fred was a state representative.

507
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:54,445
So that kind of, that stuff you can follow through governmental channels if you really need to get the background on paper.

508
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:59,864
somebody has to have it because they served on the office and took an oath.

509
00:38:00,884 --> 00:38:01,304
Thank you.

510
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:15,709
Um, I don't, I don't know if this would be considered a motion or what it would be considered, but would it be possible for however many people were in a group to randomly put people in a breakout room right now and do the research and then come back to us?

511
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,010
Or is that not legal?

512
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:23,372
I don't know if that's legal right now.

513
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:28,734
I see Dan's hand.

514
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:45,763
So I, my family has a pretty good history with the Della Russo family and at the Della Russo, just so everyone knows was the first Italian American alderman and mayor of Medford.

515
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:54,988
I believe Frederick was his cousin and Frederick's son more recently served on our city council for a numerous amount of years.

516
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:08,089
My feeling personally is to eliminate or leave him off any list is a great disservice to that family who has been a part of MedFed for, like Lisa said, forever.

517
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:19,177
So if some folks don't know about the De La Russo family, maybe you're not qualified to vet that rubric on them.

518
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,200
That's my feeling.

519
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:25,782
I don't think we should move forward without that name on the list.

520
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:33,165
So I think whatever we need to do to make it happen would be a good thing.

521
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:34,865
It'd be the right thing to do.

522
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:36,286
I agree.

523
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:40,727
Can I get a motion to add it to the list?

524
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,768
Motion to add to the list.

525
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,649
We have more people with hands up.

526
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,330
Can I get, wait, let's, we got a motion.

527
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,091
Can I get a second?

528
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:49,991
And then we'll discuss it.

529
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:51,468
Patrick seconds.

530
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:52,969
Thank you, Patrick.

531
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:53,350
All right.

532
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,530
Discussion hands up.

533
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,232
We run.

534
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:06,777
Um, my only point is putting him on is not a liability.

535
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:14,842
Keeping him off in open meeting laws and the city of Medford public is leaves us open to a lot of issues.

536
00:40:14,902 --> 00:40:17,043
So I don't think there's another other.

537
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:19,205
I don't think there's another resolution besides

538
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,120
Putting them on the list.

539
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:22,181
Okay.

540
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:26,824
Anybody else have some other hands that aren't up again now that Maria is.

541
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:28,364
All right, Maria.

542
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:38,230
Well, I don't understand why we would just simply add a name to the list without having researched and vetted it preliminarily.

543
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:41,565
as we voted to in a motion.

544
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:45,830
When it was explained, it was accidentally left off.

545
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,895
I mean, other than doing the whole thing all over again, what's your answer?

546
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:57,903
I understand that it was left off accidentally, yet I do not believe that we should just be adding

547
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:06,005
this name to the next step based off of the personal feelings of a few people on the committee.

548
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:18,173
And it does not make sense to me why we could not just have a group of five, as we did with every other name, research independently.

549
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,835
I understand that that might add a little time to the process, but

550
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:25,218
Well, it is only fair.

551
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:41,988
It does not make any sense why we would allow Dello Russo to jump the process when no other name did, even if it was out of an oversight, a logistical oversight.

552
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:45,270
Would you like to start the process all over again?

553
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:46,351
No.

554
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,512
So we have a motion, we have a second.

555
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,553
Is there any more discussion?

556
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:53,142
I see Seth's hand.

557
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:55,845
I mean, there are other hands up, so I see Seth's hand.

558
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:56,566
Okay.

559
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:58,528
I saw them and then I didn't see them.

560
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,811
I think he took them down.

561
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:03,013
Seth.

562
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,116
Oh, Hendrick and Seth, Ron.

563
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:05,636
Okay.

564
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,198
Seth, go ahead.

565
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:08,740
Yeah.

566
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,400
Hi.

567
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,121
Seth Hill speaking.

568
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:10,622
So

569
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,702
Parliamentary procedure is there to make things easier.

570
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:23,245
It's not necessarily there to fully prevent mistakes.

571
00:42:24,046 --> 00:42:27,488
So there was a mistake made, we can fix it.

572
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:35,713
But I think we also in good faith need to address how to make it more fair.

573
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:40,376
So I think putting it on the list and perhaps also either

574
00:42:43,049 --> 00:43:00,553
assigning five people to where, whether or not, if those five randomly assigned folks come up with a score that doesn't necessarily meet the threshold that we're talking about now, that name will then drop.

575
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:08,395
We also, whatever the next list that we are progressing with,

576
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:23,346
All of us, all 23 members will be running the rubric according to my understanding of the motion passed last week.

577
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:30,310
All 23 of us will be running the rubric on all 17 or 18 names.

578
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,031
I wasn't aware we were re-rubriced.

579
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,221
That doesn't feel like we're doing it again.

580
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:43,124
Number six, the advisory committee conducts additional research and solicits public input.

581
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:46,746
Yes, that doesn't necessarily mean read rubric.

582
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:54,930
Please, number seven, all members of the advisory committee evaluate the remaining submissions according to the rubric.

583
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,992
Evaluations previously made in step number four cannot be modified.

584
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:06,221
That was what we passed.

585
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:07,302
Yes.

586
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:15,085
We have other hands up.

587
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,486
Um, yeah, I'm just reading that to me.

588
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:19,647
That doesn't say we read rubric though.

589
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:33,253
That's taken the original, original rubric and discussing along with other inputs from the public, other resolutions that we made or other exercises that we may take on.

590
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,354
All right, who's hands up?

591
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:38,074
Patrick.

592
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:39,735
Patrick.

593
00:44:41,716 --> 00:44:42,516
Patrick, go ahead.

594
00:44:43,096 --> 00:44:44,077
Yeah, I think.

595
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:48,618
Patrick, you're muted.

596
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,900
Thank you.

597
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,262
The issue is whether or not we have five of us look at this

598
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:03,221
and then potentially 23 of us look at it or just have 23 of us look at it now.

599
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:10,931
So I guess my question to, I think it was Maria and Laura were talking about scoring them.

600
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:14,696
I mean, what's the timeline in your head?

601
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:15,717
When does that happen?

602
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:21,823
as far as the process.

603
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:23,905
I understand your concern.

604
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:27,668
It's just my concern as well is not to be held up another week.

605
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:33,193
We wanted to get this done as quickly as possible in a fair way.

606
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:39,999
So that's the question for Laura or Maria.

607
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,261
What's the timeline that you're talking about?

608
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,804
Do we lose a week doing it the way that you're talking about?

609
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:47,764
And I was hoping we could do it in the next few days.

610
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:53,625
But now hearing Lisa evangelist to say that we need to build like a paper records.

611
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,967
It might be a little tougher, since there isn't something very easy to find online.

612
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:00,847
No, I didn't.

613
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:03,968
But certainly for the next all the city clerk's office.

614
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:16,920
I mean, they would probably send you an email if you needed it, but same thing with the state legislature, they could probably email you something, but yeah, you would probably have to get on the phone for it, for the information.

615
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:27,211
He did serve in the early 30s or 40s, so it is gonna be paper, unless the history society has something in writing on their website.

616
00:46:27,807 --> 00:46:32,891
I would say in the next, you know, two days or so, if possible, I know that we all did.

617
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:35,493
We researched 14 people in just a few days.

618
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:40,136
So I think we can certainly do it before the next meeting, maybe the next two or three days.

619
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:58,057
I'd also like to state that, quite literally in the time that we've spent discussing this, we could have had five people go and research and rubric, and I am in no way advocating that we delay the process.

620
00:46:59,258 --> 00:47:21,488
And simply speaking that in terms of fairness, it seems absurd to me that we would have this name just simply added to the top 15, especially if now we're introducing the question of whether or not we're going to re-rubric as an entire committee, because that was my understanding of the motion that we passed last week.

621
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:26,771
Any more discussion?

622
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:31,355
Ryan's hand is up, and I believe there is a motion.

623
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,096
Did you say there is a motion on the floor?

624
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:34,998
Motion for, yep, seconded.

625
00:47:35,498 --> 00:47:36,839
And Matt is waving too.

626
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:37,960
Matt's waving.

627
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,640
Go, Ryan.

628
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:46,605
Yeah, just, you know, it doesn't have to be the Della Russo name.

629
00:47:46,665 --> 00:47:54,130
Put anybody's name in there, one of your top three, and assume what we would do because we failed to follow the process.

630
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,252
What's just, we are all,

631
00:47:56,806 --> 00:48:01,849
Again, all of us are going to vet every one of the finalists.

632
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:07,252
We are all gonna have input from the public coming to influence that.

633
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:25,804
I just don't understand why one of the name on that list, whoever it is, I don't care what the name is, we've failed the process and now we're saying, a process that is shaky to begin with, in my opinion, but now we're saying, okay, what do we do with this guy?

634
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:41,302
And, you know, if you want to do, if you want to go and do the research in the next hour, which I think is fair that you would take at least an hour, then I have another motion that would extend this beyond May 24.

635
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,948
I mean, I don't want to do this because it's fast.

636
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:53,430
I want to do it because that name was left off this process and easily to add him on the process, it doesn't influence anything.

637
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,231
He could be number 18th when we vote.

638
00:48:55,751 --> 00:49:03,333
It's just, you know, I just don't understand what the issue is and take out the Dela Russo name, put any name in there that is in your top three.

639
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:05,874
And then let's figure out how we would do that.

640
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:16,759
Oh, I just wanted to mention that we didn't get our list of names to research anyway until what, Friday or something like that.

641
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,561
So we met Tuesday, we didn't get to Friday.

642
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:27,070
I'm sure Laura or whatever people are assigned to this name, it can happen in 48 hours and we can have it in the group of 17 or 18 people.

643
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,794
I don't see it really delaying the process much at all.

644
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,240
Yeah, so that's all I really want to say.

645
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,181
I don't think it would delay much.

646
00:49:35,401 --> 00:49:36,501
I think it's a good idea.

647
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:43,444
But I also have to say that I feel a little uneasy about people who do the riskless family buying from them, with all due respect.

648
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:45,905
There's nobody here talking about Bloomberg.

649
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:58,749
So I just want to make sure that we understand that some people are uncomfortable about people who know people really well in those families, regardless of how important they are to the history of America.

650
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:02,990
Okay, all right, we have a motion on the floor.

651
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:04,811
Can we vote this up or down?

652
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,611
Maybe then we can table.

653
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:17,355
If we vote it down, we'll table Arthur DelaRusso until we can have a random generated, five generated, and then some scores submitted.

654
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,836
Somebody read the motion.

655
00:50:20,296 --> 00:50:21,496
Are there hands up?

656
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:23,057
There are two hands up.

657
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:29,327
Can I just pop in information with the rubric itself?

658
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:40,698
The original motion does have the whole committee, again, kind of use the rubric in order to evaluate the rest of the remaining names.

659
00:50:41,419 --> 00:50:44,122
So adding the name,

660
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:49,641
is not a big deal because it will be evaluated again.

661
00:50:49,661 --> 00:50:56,443
And since it didn't hit that original evaluation, it should be evaluated.

662
00:50:57,023 --> 00:51:05,346
And in an effort to try and move this forward, this, you know, I'm perfectly fine with adding the name to the list.

663
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:08,527
It gets evaluated anyways, and we can move on from there.

664
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:12,969
Thank you, Dr. Grace.

665
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:13,429
Seth?

666
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:16,274
Uh, thank you.

667
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:18,235
One other option.

668
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:24,458
Um, and I'm fine either way, but one other option is to, uh, just.

669
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:38,344
Assigned by people and advance it, uh, if it hits it, and I think we could make, uh, uh, you know, if, if it's, uh,

670
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,493
If the name score is nine or above, then it's going to be 18.

671
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:43,575
If it doesn't, then it's going to be 17.

672
00:51:43,715 --> 00:51:50,259
I think we could probably pass a dependent resolution on that for our next step.

673
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:06,610
We'll add the name if five people that are randomly assigned through the rubric come up with an average score above nine within the next

674
00:52:08,828 --> 00:52:09,288
48 hours.

675
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:18,930
Um, and then after that, uh, we will have, uh, the rest of the week, um, to evaluate either 17 or 18 names.

676
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:20,691
All right.

677
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:21,531
Thank you.

678
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:26,052
We have a motion on the floor to add them to the list.

679
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:32,133
You would take to vote them up or down, and then we would go to the next, if it's voted down Patrick.

680
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:33,748
Maybe hand up.

681
00:52:34,249 --> 00:52:57,560
Yeah, so I think to reinforce what Dr. Caldera was saying, I mean, it's, if this person, if Mr. De La Russo is gonna come in at number 30 on our list and get very few points when five people do it, the odds of that, him then coming in and it's top three with the rest of the group is infinitesimal.

682
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,342
So I think us, you know, if he's worthy,

683
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:07,587
to be in the top three, he would clearly clear the bar for top 15.

684
00:53:08,327 --> 00:53:14,012
If he's not, then when we evaluate everyone, then he won't make top three.

685
00:53:14,132 --> 00:53:17,295
So there's no harm in bringing him in here.

686
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:29,305
And I think the other part that Dan had brought up is that part of what we're trying to do here is bring people together within the city and to have very prominent Italian American

687
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:36,807
excluded from consideration because we made a clerical error to hold up the process because we made a clerical error.

688
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:48,632
I think, you know, the harm that's done by doing those things is much greater than, you know, what we're doing as far as moving, you know, moving him forward with the group of 17.

689
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,373
Thank you.

690
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:52,793
Nicely said.

691
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:55,334
On the motion.

692
00:53:56,835 --> 00:53:57,715
No more hands raised.

693
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,507
On the motion to add them to the list.

694
00:54:02,347 --> 00:54:07,512
Can I ask, sorry, can I ask a question?

695
00:54:07,892 --> 00:54:16,600
I think it would be helpful for me to understand, you know, in my vote here, what the process will be for the next step.

696
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:22,125
Because if we are gonna be re-rubricing everybody, then that's one thing.

697
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:24,988
But if there is additional process that will happen,

698
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:39,584
that will bring in additional considerations or other processes into deciding whether this person's name will be on the list, then that to me seems like a different process.

699
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:41,565
So how will that work?

700
00:54:41,985 --> 00:54:55,350
What is the... So I'm hoping this exercise, and there's a resolution on the floor, on the agenda tonight to, I believe, give each

701
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:03,441
person on the board, the ability to speak for a couple minutes on their top three or their top one.

702
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:25,485
And then I believe there's another resolution to go back out instead of having an open meeting with the public speaking for three minutes a piece, it's to have another survey done, let people write 250 word essays and submit it to the superintendent again to do

703
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:30,093
a survey to the city to see what their feeling is.

704
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:48,560
And then the last resolution was to have the principal, Kathy, have the students do an election of who they think would make the right name from our top 15 or 10 or whatever we come down to for conclusion.

705
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,562
And then I would hope after those, two of those would be completed through the following week,

706
00:55:55,766 --> 00:56:21,665
And then after we've got all that, I would say next week we debate all these lists and all these suggestions and come up with our final three, five, I don't know, start off final 10, then maybe final three to put forth to the school committee that we've taken everyone in the cities that we can get opinion without opening up to giving everybody three minutes.

707
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:26,710
I think the survey, that's a motion tonight, a resolution.

708
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:39,377
That's what we're trying to work towards so that we have, we include everybody, we get everybody's opinion, not get tied up in what we're tied up in now, adding one name because it was left off.

709
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,237
I'm sorry for that.

710
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:45,200
But if he's meant to be there, he'll rise to the top.

711
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,281
If he isn't, he won't rise.

712
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,343
He'll stay where he is at the bottom of the list.

713
00:56:51,369 --> 00:57:02,057
Jim, just for clarification, the top 15 or whatever you guys decide, those are the names that would be submitted for the survey for the general public, right?

714
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:04,679
That we're not starting from scratch with them again, correct?

715
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,102
So correct, I would think.

716
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:11,704
That's what I thought the resolution was gonna say.

717
00:57:11,885 --> 00:57:20,171
Right, and then like the next resolution would address, and there may be somebody that's not on the list that they wanna talk about,

718
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:27,615
Yes, the top 15, and because there's a tie, it's gonna be 18, I guess.

719
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:35,219
So the motion is to add Arthur DelaRusso to the list.

720
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:38,581
He would be number 18 for further consideration.

721
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:40,401
I'm gonna go through the roll call.

722
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:41,722
Is there any, there's no more hands up.

723
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,390
Just a point of information.

724
00:57:46,351 --> 00:57:59,815
So the committee would, as a whole, evaluate all of the 18 names and also consider other factors to make that decision for the final three, according to the resolution we passed.

725
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:00,235
Correct.

726
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:00,895
Correct.

727
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:02,695
Correct.

728
00:58:02,775 --> 00:58:11,938
And those other considerations are our resolutions that we have on the floor and the agenda tonight.

729
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:16,290
Okay, all right, so let me go through the roll call.

730
00:58:17,511 --> 00:58:18,191
Reed Brothers.

731
00:58:19,592 --> 00:58:19,832
Yes.

732
00:58:21,393 --> 00:58:22,874
Daniel Bianpuccio.

733
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:23,835
Yes.

734
00:58:24,976 --> 00:58:25,736
Erin Genia.

735
00:58:27,657 --> 00:58:28,478
Yeah, yeah.

736
00:58:29,959 --> 00:58:30,639
Beth Fuller.

737
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,304
Beth, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

738
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:38,004
Yes.

739
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:38,325
Yes.

740
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:40,606
Grace.

741
00:58:41,347 --> 00:58:41,707
Yes.

742
00:58:42,868 --> 00:58:43,268
Hendrick.

743
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:44,243
Yes.

744
00:58:46,084 --> 00:58:47,264
Jim, myself, yes.

745
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:48,545
Kenneth.

746
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:49,485
Yes.

747
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:51,026
Kristen.

748
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:52,466
Yes.

749
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:53,987
Laura.

750
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:55,147
Yes.

751
00:58:56,168 --> 00:58:56,688
Leroy.

752
00:58:58,428 --> 00:58:58,689
Yes.

753
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:00,189
Lou.

754
00:59:00,629 --> 00:59:00,909
Yes.

755
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:02,430
Maria.

756
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:04,011
Yes.

757
00:59:04,891 --> 00:59:05,391
Melissa.

758
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:06,712
Yes.

759
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:07,712
Patrick.

760
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:08,492
Yes.

761
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:09,353
Paul.

762
00:59:09,953 --> 00:59:10,313
Yes.

763
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:11,333
Ron.

764
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:12,234
Yes.

765
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:13,034
Seth.

766
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:15,189
Yes.

767
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:16,930
Kathy.

768
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:17,730
Yes.

769
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:19,871
Matthew.

770
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:20,772
Yes.

771
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:23,773
Caitlin showing up yet.

772
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:24,253
Caitlin.

773
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:24,993
Yep.

774
00:59:25,434 --> 00:59:25,734
I vote.

775
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:25,994
Yes.

776
00:59:26,594 --> 00:59:27,014
Thank you.

777
00:59:28,155 --> 00:59:28,615
Janelle.

778
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:29,915
Yes.

779
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:31,016
And Josie.

780
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:32,257
Yes.

781
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:33,357
Okay.

782
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:33,937
Thank you.

783
00:59:38,419 --> 00:59:39,039
So the next.

784
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,542
So the discussion on the rubrics.

785
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:57,050
Can we hold any further discussion and go through the three resolutions and then discuss the rubrics, the top 15?

786
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,231
Does anyone have an objection to that?

787
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:10,135
No, okay, thank you.

788
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:16,158
So the next resolution, I believe Ron,

789
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:19,247
Would you read your resolution, please?

790
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:20,167
Yep.

791
01:00:21,648 --> 01:00:31,612
Whereas the committee has begun its ranking system using the scoring rubric, whereas the committee will compile the list and rank the results, I'm going to strike the next line.

792
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:41,409
I move that each committee members submit up to three, their top three picks from the entire citizen submitted names.

793
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:44,451
I move that the vote be tabulated by the chair.

794
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:49,814
And from there we have 10 or whatever number of nominees you want for a finalist list.

795
01:00:55,638 --> 01:00:58,200
Can I get a motion for the resolution?

796
01:01:00,881 --> 01:01:01,682
Drawing your motion.

797
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:03,360
You motion our resolution?

798
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,760
You want a second?

799
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,440
You mean a second?

800
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,161
You want a second?

801
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:07,401
No, you're on the motion.

802
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:09,542
I need a second now, not from you.

803
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:11,323
Excuse me, sorry.

804
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:14,044
Ron, what did you X out of your resolution?

805
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:16,505
I Xed out the non-binding part.

806
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:17,966
That'll be another issue later.

807
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:23,248
So just take out that line, whereas this is a non-binding system?

808
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:24,109
Yeah.

809
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:25,229
Thank you.

810
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:26,870
I have a question, sorry.

811
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,552
We need a second first, sorry, and then we'll go into discussion.

812
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:32,675
Okay.

813
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:35,217
All right.

814
01:01:35,637 --> 01:01:37,038
Can I get a second on that motion.

815
01:01:42,642 --> 01:01:43,082
I'll second it.

816
01:01:44,182 --> 01:01:45,143
Okay, Lou second.

817
01:01:45,403 --> 01:01:46,364
All right, discussion.

818
01:01:46,384 --> 01:01:46,784
Go ahead.

819
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:50,366
I just, I just want to ask one.

820
01:01:50,426 --> 01:01:50,607
So,

821
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:58,032
The third line, I moved that each committee member submit up the three top names from the entire list of citizens.

822
01:01:58,332 --> 01:02:02,213
So that's kind of superseding the rubric we voted on, correct?

823
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:03,734
Correct.

824
01:02:04,294 --> 01:02:04,594
Correct.

825
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:11,056
So in other words, all members of the advisory committee evaluate the remaining submissions, 17 or 18, according to the rubric.

826
01:02:11,676 --> 01:02:19,179
So if we pass this resolution, we're not doing that anymore, which is why Ron was saying, you know, this resolution will take care of Ron's.

827
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:22,676
Well, it's going the other direction, yes.

828
01:02:22,756 --> 01:02:27,879
It's going the other direction if we vote on Ron's resolution in the affirmative.

829
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,242
If you would allow me just to give you a couple of comments of this resolution.

830
01:02:32,722 --> 01:02:33,363
Okay.

831
01:02:34,223 --> 01:02:36,565
If that's, I mean, Matt, are you, I don't want to.

832
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:43,709
Through the chair, I'm sorry, go ahead.

833
01:02:43,749 --> 01:02:44,710
Go ahead, Ron.

834
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,811
Okay.

835
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,653
So, so far in our process,

836
01:02:49,595 --> 01:02:53,918
Each one of us has been given 25% of the names to rank.

837
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:02,865
Each one of the 23 of us has been appointed here to have a vote on who the name should be.

838
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:12,332
The reason why you're all been appointed is because we trust that you will gather the information, you'll listen to the input of the public, and we'll have a vote, and we'll make a vote.

839
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:18,506
not a rating system that I have nothing, that this is why I voted against it last week.

840
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:28,510
The rating system needs, if we wanna go with the rating system, then I would propose that we have another long discussion so we all understand how to rate everything.

841
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,190
I don't think that's happened yet.

842
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:36,313
So my point is this, we all have, we should have, I mean, maybe not, maybe I just have,

843
01:03:37,336 --> 01:03:41,158
a top three to five in mind that we think fits.

844
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:49,901
And we're yet to hear from the public on some, as someone mentioned, I don't know that person and there's not a lot of information on that person.

845
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,582
So we need to have that input from the public.

846
01:03:54,293 --> 01:04:03,675
I just believe that we need to stand up, each name, each one of us by name, and stand in front of the Zoom screen and say, I voted for this.

847
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:07,395
Not that we all ranked and here's the average ranking.

848
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:18,337
I just don't understand the difference between the rating system and actually standing up in a democratic way and saying, this is what I voted for, up to three names.

849
01:04:18,457 --> 01:04:19,437
That's my point of this.

850
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:22,058
And you guys can vote it up or down, but that's my point.

851
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:31,452
Any more discussion?

852
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:33,833
There are hands, Jim.

853
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:36,354
Five hands.

854
01:04:37,315 --> 01:04:37,935
I gotta find them.

855
01:04:38,455 --> 01:04:39,176
Yeah, maybe more.

856
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:41,177
Maria is in my top left.

857
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:41,877
All right, here we go.

858
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:43,038
I'm sorry.

859
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:44,719
Hendrik first.

860
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,799
I got Hendrik at the top.

861
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,880
Hi, this is Hendrik.

862
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:54,592
From my perspective, what we are doing here is service to the community.

863
01:04:55,532 --> 01:05:04,576
We said we wanted to help with this process to find the name that was the right name for Medford for this school.

864
01:05:06,016 --> 01:05:09,778
And we're not here because

865
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:18,117
We think that our belief is the most important belief and that we should be able to choose who we want.

866
01:05:18,657 --> 01:05:23,058
We're here to do a job, which is the service to this community.

867
01:05:23,738 --> 01:05:26,459
We already voted how we are doing this.

868
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:36,262
And the fact that we're doing this motion now, after we already decided how we are gonna do this, is a step backwards.

869
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:38,543
It means that everyone wasted their time.

870
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:53,910
The whole point of the rubric and having things assigned randomly was to allow the people who submitted names that we didn't know a chance to be evaluated on their own merits.

871
01:05:54,931 --> 01:06:06,176
I found out two or three super interesting people that I'd never heard of that were really worthy of consideration.

872
01:06:07,237 --> 01:06:09,318
And because we were doing it

873
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:18,952
randomly, that was the only way that I was able to find out about those people.

874
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:22,893
Pauline Young was amazing to me.

875
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:27,154
This is not about us.

876
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:29,115
This is about what's best for Medford.

877
01:06:29,515 --> 01:06:30,415
This is service.

878
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:32,555
And I don't want to go backwards.

879
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:33,616
I want to go forwards.

880
01:06:36,777 --> 01:06:38,637
Maria, thank you, Henry.

881
01:06:41,139 --> 01:07:08,032
I truly cannot comprehend why at this point after we spent a week deliberating in terms of the randomization, in terms of our research, why we would just go and completely wash that out for the sake of getting to pick our favorite names from the whole list.

882
01:07:08,693 --> 01:07:09,313
It does not,

883
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:21,380
It does not make sense to me why we would have spent a week of our time when we already have a tight timeline, essentially wasting our time.

884
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:37,774
And that we would, rather than considering this in a very objective way with a set rubric that has considerations that ultimately

885
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:42,041
people may or may not think of when they think of their favorites.

886
01:07:43,242 --> 01:07:59,572
One thing that stands out to me is important or representative of marginalized groups, because that is an essential aspect of the work that we're doing, making sure that this is representative of all of Medford.

887
01:08:00,373 --> 01:08:06,617
And so to just have this piecemeal decision of, oh, these are my favorites,

888
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:09,207
just seems unwise.

889
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:13,348
It does not align with the work that we're supposed to be doing here.

890
01:08:13,368 --> 01:08:21,330
And I, I, it does not make sense to me why we would vote to pass this.

891
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:25,732
Thank you, Laura.

892
01:08:27,372 --> 01:08:28,393
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

893
01:08:28,493 --> 01:08:31,996
I do want to appreciate Ron's resolution.

894
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:39,142
I think there's many different ways we could have gotten to this, many different rubrics or methods we could have chosen.

895
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:43,326
I do really like what we chose at our last meeting.

896
01:08:43,606 --> 01:08:54,375
And the two reasons are that, first of all, it's really transparent because we do have a rubric that the public has seen, and we are grading them all as best as we can according to that rubric.

897
01:08:55,356 --> 01:09:00,218
having that out to the public to see really allows everyone to see what everyone's being judged on.

898
01:09:00,818 --> 01:09:13,542
But secondly, I think we do get to one what Ron is talking about in number eight in the resolution we passed, which is when we will be deliberating to select three names and trying to get to a consensus.

899
01:09:13,642 --> 01:09:18,664
By then we will have all looked at all of the top 15 names.

900
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:19,704
We will have

901
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:22,085
put them through the rubric again.

902
01:09:22,105 --> 01:09:23,725
We will have heard from the public.

903
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,326
And then in an open meeting, we're going to get to discuss our top three.

904
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,647
I'm not ready to pick a top three right now.

905
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:33,088
I've learned a great deal over this past weekend about people I didn't know.

906
01:09:33,108 --> 01:09:43,972
And I really am looking forward to doing more of a deep dive into those 15 or 18 people that we are going to be looking at so that we can actually have that deliberation.

907
01:09:44,012 --> 01:09:45,772
I think that is what Ron was envisioning.

908
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,313
And I agree that that's important.

909
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,333
I think we'll get there anyway.

910
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:51,995
Can I just say something next?

911
01:09:52,015 --> 01:09:52,336
Thank you.

912
01:09:54,639 --> 01:10:03,126
Just for clarification here, I know we voted for the rubric, but the rubric to me was one exercise in this.

913
01:10:03,186 --> 01:10:10,493
I mean, we have other things we're supposed to reach out to the public and we're gonna do a survey, and then we're gonna reach out to the students.

914
01:10:10,553 --> 01:10:14,036
So this rubric is one exercise.

915
01:10:14,917 --> 01:10:19,941
I mean, Ron is proposing another exercise, and then there's two more to be proposed.

916
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:21,702
And then we'll deliberate

917
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:23,586
We'll have our top 15.

918
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:30,570
If we make any changes to that, I don't know, but we hopefully will get our list smaller.

919
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:38,675
But I think that my feelings on Ron's is that we're just trying to incorporate more

920
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:45,213
thought into the process and to eliminate that we might've made a mistake through the rubric.

921
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:57,179
Just a point of information, the rubric on the resolution we voted in last time, the rubric is in fact used again as another evaluation tool for the rest of the names.

922
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:59,361
So it wasn't just a one-time use.

923
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:05,224
I understand that, but it wasn't voted to be the exclusive reading process.

924
01:11:05,604 --> 01:11:06,604
Point of information.

925
01:11:07,065 --> 01:11:08,986
If I could just, I don't want to jump everybody.

926
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:11,288
Sorry, go ahead, Ron.

927
01:11:11,788 --> 01:11:12,308
Oh, sorry.

928
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,569
All right, let me go back to my hands raised, then I'll get back to you.

929
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:16,649
Seth.

930
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:24,691
Yeah, I mean, I just kind of want to echo some of the other things that people have been saying.

931
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:33,692
I mean, Dr. Caldera's point that what we voted on last week has 10 different steps to it.

932
01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:36,373
That is what we had adopted.

933
01:11:38,617 --> 01:12:06,547
you know, with, there is some, I mean, as a body we can do whatever we want to do, but I don't think that we need to necessarily go over something again that is going to just create additional points of information that aren't relevant.

934
01:12:07,608 --> 01:12:08,148
We have,

935
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:28,065
Names that were submitted by the public as a body, we decided how we were going to go through those names and voted on it and adopted it and now are moving forward.

936
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:30,706
Point of order, Mr. Chair.

937
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,821
Point of order, Mr. Chair.

938
01:12:32,901 --> 01:12:38,786
I feel that this is a backdoor way of, it's a reconsideration.

939
01:12:38,846 --> 01:12:41,648
It's a motion to reconsider is what this is.

940
01:12:41,728 --> 01:12:50,595
If we're taking a motion to reconsider, then we need a two thirds vote before we reconsider the motion that we passed last week.

941
01:12:51,616 --> 01:12:53,477
I mean, this is not an additional motion.

942
01:12:53,517 --> 01:12:58,041
This is not an addition to what we agreed to.

943
01:12:58,121 --> 01:13:00,563
This is a reversal of what we agreed to last week.

944
01:13:01,553 --> 01:13:03,535
Ron, would you like to reword your motion?

945
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:08,320
I'll withdraw my motion.

946
01:13:09,441 --> 01:13:11,603
Would you withdraw or reword?

947
01:13:13,044 --> 01:13:13,545
Withdraw.

948
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:15,607
Okay.

949
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:19,571
Thank you.

950
01:13:20,152 --> 01:13:20,392
All right.

951
01:13:21,226 --> 01:13:37,804
I do want to put a point of personal privilege, though, to say that you're not understanding my point is at this point, we are creating a list based on a bunch of candidates that I had 25% input on, number one.

952
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:39,927
That bothers me.

953
01:13:41,307 --> 01:13:45,269
I do know that the final decision, the deliberations will happen.

954
01:13:45,749 --> 01:13:48,811
And I just don't think we've deliberated enough on how this rubric works.

955
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:53,173
And at the end, it's all coming down to everybody standing up and taking that vote.

956
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:59,496
Incorporating the great rubric that's been created, the input from the city and whatever other research you've done.

957
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:04,839
So, to not understand what I'm saying is, that concerns me.

958
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:20,828
But, you know, I get you know I'm fine with moving to that step but step eight of the process is what I'm asking to do too so I'm just trying to protect somebody who has done some research, and by the way I've done research on every single candidate nominees name.

959
01:14:22,803 --> 01:14:23,704
I know the names.

960
01:14:24,945 --> 01:14:27,106
I don't think, my point is just procedural.

961
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:31,029
I don't think the names are gonna change if we vote or if we don't vote on it.

962
01:14:31,269 --> 01:14:38,934
So I'm withdrawing based on that and hoping that all of your top three or whatever number you have in your head appear on those 18s.

963
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:40,035
That's all.

964
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:44,858
Kristin's hand is still up and I see Brie.

965
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,120
Kristin, please.

966
01:14:49,130 --> 01:15:07,319
Well, I guess it's not as necessary to say if Ron withdrew the motion, but I think the good thing of the, you know, the good way that we looked at it through the rubric was, I think the point was, and what it did for me was to eliminate my personal biases.

967
01:15:07,459 --> 01:15:11,881
I could give you my top three people, but how does that

968
01:15:12,566 --> 01:15:15,030
serve the city of Medford.

969
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:27,768
They submitted people and I think we took a mathematically sound way to divide it in such a way that the work that it was going to be randomized and

970
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:34,862
you know, spread out enough so that wouldn't be people getting the choices that they, you know, preconceived notion that they wanted.

971
01:15:35,142 --> 01:15:41,284
And, you know, I got to learn a lot about the people on my list that I previously didn't know about.

972
01:15:41,524 --> 01:15:49,906
And I think it was good for me to have to do research on people that weren't as familiar to me and that weren't my top three.

973
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:52,967
I feel like that maybe it's not as good for me.

974
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:56,028
Maybe I don't get my vote, but this isn't about me.

975
01:15:56,088 --> 01:15:56,868
This is about

976
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,188
Medford and the kids getting a name for their new school.

977
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:07,071
So I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out, and I think it helped me learn a lot.

978
01:16:09,312 --> 01:16:09,672
Thank you.

979
01:16:11,453 --> 01:16:12,533
Did I see one more hand?

980
01:16:13,494 --> 01:16:14,254
Breeze, who is that?

981
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:15,495
Bree.

982
01:16:15,515 --> 01:16:17,756
Hi, Bree speaking here.

983
01:16:17,776 --> 01:16:19,397
I was just

984
01:16:20,871 --> 01:16:26,753
Kristen actually summarized that pretty well, but I don't really care about my top three.

985
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:29,074
I don't want Medford to care about my top three.

986
01:16:29,094 --> 01:16:35,556
Like I said, this isn't really about what I want.

987
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:44,239
And you said at the beginning, Ron, that like we were chosen as part of a democratic process to do careful research.

988
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:46,186
on all of these names.

989
01:16:46,546 --> 01:17:00,994
And if we really trust that that was happening, we would trust that everyone here did that quality research and that each one of us would not have to individually research 67, 68, however many names.

990
01:17:01,114 --> 01:17:05,216
I think it's really awesome that you did that.

991
01:17:06,857 --> 01:17:11,679
But I mean, if we truly believe that we're all here for the same purpose,

992
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:15,384
That shouldn't be necessary.

993
01:17:15,524 --> 01:17:17,766
And like I said, I don't, I don't have a top three.

994
01:17:18,427 --> 01:17:21,089
The name that I picked originally isn't even on here.

995
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,371
And I'm just, I'm, I'm learning a lot.

996
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:31,277
My top three have changed if I had to pick, but I don't think I don't care.

997
01:17:31,937 --> 01:17:32,458
So to speak.

998
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:36,121
Okay.

999
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:36,541
Thank you.

1000
01:17:39,183 --> 01:17:42,386
I just want to, I want to remind everybody of, you know, uh,

1001
01:17:44,373 --> 01:18:12,240
public through submissions through the original survey had made us you know how many times some names were submitted just they should probably be in our top list and I think they all are so I'm not sure that well I don't know but that would be the only thing is the public talking is this how many times a name was submitted needs to be

1002
01:18:12,742 --> 01:18:15,463
reviewed and compared to our rubrics.

1003
01:18:16,663 --> 01:18:17,684
Jim Lister, may I?

1004
01:18:17,784 --> 01:18:18,064
Yes.

1005
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,865
So I just want to make a point on what you just said.

1006
01:18:23,105 --> 01:18:30,168
So there's a lot of people in the city that knew a certain person that's topless, a lot of family members, a lot of co-workers and stuff.

1007
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:40,951
One wonders, for me anyway, like people who are deceased and their families are a long time ago, maybe like some past person who lived here a couple hundred years ago.

1008
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:47,685
So we're going to get a lot of people that comment on a certain candidate that knew that person.

1009
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:59,755
And so when you're saying that, that has to be considered the number of times that they're submitted is directly relational to how the people are living here right now.

1010
01:19:00,596 --> 01:19:03,538
But we're trying to do something about the past as well.

1011
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:05,280
Does that make sense?

1012
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,964
I understand, but we're trying to, when this is done,

1013
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:12,409
We want a celebration.

1014
01:19:12,689 --> 01:19:14,732
We want a win-win situation.

1015
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,754
We don't want to lose-lose situation.

1016
01:19:16,834 --> 01:19:27,887
And, you know, we need to involve as many of the public as we can, not just have some name set in our head, but go with it.

1017
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:31,358
So I hope we're all open-minded and we all listen.

1018
01:19:31,778 --> 01:19:39,026
And I think that's what Ron's motion was, not necessarily a favorite three, but just to let each member here speak for peace.

1019
01:19:39,406 --> 01:19:42,509
Point of information, Mr. Chairman, the motion has been taken down.

1020
01:19:42,549 --> 01:19:43,770
I would suggest a discussion.

1021
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:44,812
Thank you.

1022
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:47,360
All right, anything else?

1023
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,681
We'll go to the next motion.

1024
01:19:49,262 --> 01:19:49,882
Oh, there's a hand up.

1025
01:19:49,922 --> 01:19:51,443
I actually have something to say.

1026
01:19:51,463 --> 01:19:52,964
All right, sorry, I didn't say it.

1027
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:54,205
Hendrick, yes.

1028
01:19:54,766 --> 01:20:09,918
The other problem with paying attention to the number of times that people submitted certain names is there was a few people that submitted the same name over and over again on that list.

1029
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:18,411
And that is not in the spirit of public participation.

1030
01:20:19,251 --> 01:20:28,999
And the reason that I suggested doing an essay is it requires people to put more thought in it.

1031
01:20:29,922 --> 01:20:47,897
And it also means that they understand that they have an opportunity to say the reason that they feel that person is valuable and why they would be honored by having the school named for them.

1032
01:20:48,478 --> 01:20:52,181
Okay, I'm sorry, can I stop you for one second?

1033
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:53,262
Can you read your motion?

1034
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:54,303
Because this is your motion.

1035
01:20:55,613 --> 01:20:57,794
Your resolution, could you read your resolution?

1036
01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:04,297
I'm actually not speaking about my resolution right this second.

1037
01:21:04,978 --> 01:21:11,321
What I'm saying is paying attention to the submissions from the public.

1038
01:21:12,538 --> 01:21:34,549
The numbers, this is still based on that ranking idea that we kind of threw out, is that we can't listen to the number of people that submitted for one name or another name from the previous submissions, because those lists

1039
01:21:35,592 --> 01:21:38,034
are invalid because people cheated.

1040
01:21:38,054 --> 01:21:42,398
They submitted the same name over and over again.

1041
01:21:42,418 --> 01:21:53,048
There was a number of instances where people made a vote for the same name, but then had every member of their family's name.

1042
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:56,631
Like that's not, to me, that's not fair.

1043
01:21:57,492 --> 01:22:00,794
public participation that's stacking the scales.

1044
01:22:01,094 --> 01:22:03,755
Point of order, Mr. Chair.

1045
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:05,296
There's no motion right now.

1046
01:22:05,396 --> 01:22:08,978
So, I mean, we need to have a motion to have discussion, so.

1047
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:10,719
Okay.

1048
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:17,483
Hendrick, would you like to read your motion, your resolution?

1049
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:20,264
Yeah, just give me one second to pull it up.

1050
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,847
It's going to take me a sec.

1051
01:22:31,598 --> 01:22:33,259
Hendrick, would you mind if I read it?

1052
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,961
Absolutely, that'd be swell.

1053
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:35,681
Sure.

1054
01:22:37,983 --> 01:22:49,552
Be it resolved that one, once the committee has chosen the 15 candidates from the public submissions, the committee will issue one public input survey to solicit feedback.

1055
01:22:50,353 --> 01:22:58,640
Two, the survey shall be available as a Google form and as a paper version available at Medford High School.

1056
01:22:59,529 --> 01:23:03,652
Three, there will be one week for the public to respond to the survey.

1057
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:15,342
Four, publicity of the survey shall be made through the administration via the channels that are already approved for publicity.

1058
01:23:16,963 --> 01:23:23,248
Five, the survey shall include the name of the resident, address of the resident, which of the 15 names,

1059
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:36,708
They are writing to support and an essay of no more than 250 words addressing why the committee should include their candidate in the group of three submissions to the school committee.

1060
01:23:37,568 --> 01:23:45,593
Six survey results shall not be considered votes, but will be considered individually on their own merits.

1061
01:23:47,414 --> 01:23:47,794
Thank you.

1062
01:23:49,215 --> 01:23:49,496
All right.

1063
01:23:50,396 --> 01:23:51,397
That's his resolution.

1064
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:53,298
Hendrick makes the motion.

1065
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:55,456
Can I get a second before we discuss?

1066
01:23:56,437 --> 01:23:57,957
Ken Mellon seconds the motion.

1067
01:23:58,517 --> 01:23:59,297
Ken seconds it.

1068
01:23:59,797 --> 01:24:00,937
Okay, discussion.

1069
01:24:01,798 --> 01:24:02,938
Ryan, your hands up.

1070
01:24:05,258 --> 01:24:08,919
Yeah, just one small change.

1071
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:12,060
Hendrik, you're not limiting this in any way.

1072
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:17,461
People can write 10 essays if they wanted to, correct?

1073
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,241
Hang on one second.

1074
01:24:20,701 --> 01:24:22,982
I'm struggling with the different window.

1075
01:24:24,837 --> 01:24:29,058
I'm suggesting that each person picks one person to write on.

1076
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:35,660
I'm not suggesting that one person can submit many essays.

1077
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:42,202
I'm just suggesting change in the words so that people know that that's it.

1078
01:24:47,844 --> 01:24:52,725
Every resident is limited to one essay submission, maybe what we want to put in there because

1079
01:24:53,543 --> 01:25:04,070
So what number five says is the survey shall include the name of the resident, the address of the resident, and which of the 15 names they are writing to support.

1080
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:09,074
And an essay of no more than 250 words addressing why.

1081
01:25:11,455 --> 01:25:13,877
I'm just suggesting that each resident- Which one of the-

1082
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:17,118
That was my suggestion.

1083
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:26,302
Okay, so I just added the one to the document that is in our shared folder, resolution for public participation.

1084
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:32,064
Okay, and the other correction is- It should be 17 or 18 names.

1085
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:33,664
Well, whatever that is.

1086
01:25:33,764 --> 01:25:39,106
But the other suggestion is that the charge from the school committee is up to three names.

1087
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:43,508
I don't wanna leave it out there that we're definitely have to resolve on three names.

1088
01:25:44,088 --> 01:25:50,010
because that's not, you know, up to three name submission, just so we have it in writing.

1089
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:50,991
That's all.

1090
01:25:51,091 --> 01:25:52,852
Those are my two clerks.

1091
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:56,413
Up to three submissions to the school committee.

1092
01:25:56,433 --> 01:25:56,653
Yeah.

1093
01:26:00,675 --> 01:26:01,335
That's all I have.

1094
01:26:06,257 --> 01:26:06,577
Okay.

1095
01:26:07,117 --> 01:26:07,438
I'm sorry.

1096
01:26:07,498 --> 01:26:10,359
All right, can I just, Jim, can I just clarify?

1097
01:26:10,379 --> 01:26:10,939
I'm sorry.

1098
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,660
What?

1099
01:26:13,628 --> 01:26:17,751
Ron said, every resident is only allowed to submit one essay.

1100
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:24,195
Is that how you wrote it, Henrik, into your, or just- Yes, it is.

1101
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:35,723
So I just this second changed the wording, and I did it in the version that's in the public folder so that you'll have that written.

1102
01:26:38,153 --> 01:26:43,677
But it says which one of the 18 names they are writing to support.

1103
01:26:43,697 --> 01:26:52,183
I don't think, point of information, I don't think that that clarifies that you can only submit one.

1104
01:26:52,303 --> 01:26:58,308
Someone could say, I'm submitting this one, and I'm submitting this one, and I'm submitting this one, so.

1105
01:26:58,987 --> 01:27:05,873
I will just write residents may submit only more than one essay.

1106
01:27:09,075 --> 01:27:11,437
Mr. Lister, can I ask a point of clarity question?

1107
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:12,258
Yes.

1108
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:18,863
So when you're saying one essay, it also means they can only vote for one name from the survey that we put out there.

1109
01:27:18,903 --> 01:27:19,423
Is that correct?

1110
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:22,146
One name, one essay.

1111
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:26,449
I mean, it's not a vote.

1112
01:27:28,395 --> 01:27:34,778
But I mean, so are we asking the community to vote on one name from whatever it is we put out after tonight's meeting?

1113
01:27:36,959 --> 01:27:37,859
Point of information.

1114
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,500
Asking the public.

1115
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,441
I think I understand the question.

1116
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:47,684
We're talking about how many essays people can write on one person can only write for one name.

1117
01:27:48,324 --> 01:27:50,885
And then when they submit them to us, that's a whole different process.

1118
01:27:50,945 --> 01:27:54,126
But this is just the gathering of the public's information.

1119
01:27:54,206 --> 01:27:57,428
So I believe I want to speak for Hendrick, but it's

1120
01:27:58,368 --> 01:28:03,813
you can't vote for name one, give us information on number one and number four.

1121
01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:07,176
Hendrick is asking you to make a choice and send that information in.

1122
01:28:07,236 --> 01:28:09,158
So it's just fact finding, it's not voting.

1123
01:28:09,778 --> 01:28:10,018
Correct.

1124
01:28:10,179 --> 01:28:10,379
Okay.

1125
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:11,820
I don't wanna.

1126
01:28:13,101 --> 01:28:14,302
Thank you.

1127
01:28:14,482 --> 01:28:15,463
Point of information that just.

1128
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:16,885
Yes, Tom.

1129
01:28:17,485 --> 01:28:18,566
Matt, sorry.

1130
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:19,407
That's okay.

1131
01:28:20,248 --> 01:28:24,872
So we're talking about Hendrick's resolution, which is actually just clarifying

1132
01:28:25,483 --> 01:28:28,704
the rubrics number six public input comment, correct?

1133
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:35,846
So we're just getting down to the nitty gritty, how are we gonna get the public input from the rubric?

1134
01:28:36,146 --> 01:28:39,047
Yes, it's one of the ways public input.

1135
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:41,328
Okay, so it's- Doesn't say it's the only way.

1136
01:28:43,089 --> 01:28:48,590
So, you know, when you say that, Mr. Lister, I'm just wondering what the other ways are gonna be, are they listed somewhere?

1137
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:53,772
Well, so I'm sorry, the next resolution is for the kids at the school to vote.

1138
01:28:55,102 --> 01:29:06,486
Okay, so I just wanna make sure that what Hendrick is proposing is that really this is a definition of how we're gonna get public input to our rubric, correct?

1139
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:12,248
Yes, but not limited to, I would like to say that it's not limited to.

1140
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:13,068
Okay.

1141
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:21,371
I mean, because we had a proposed resolution before that was withdrawn that also had public input, so.

1142
01:29:22,383 --> 01:29:24,985
I don't want to get, I feel like I'm getting trapped into this rubrics.

1143
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:34,530
When I was under the impression, the rubrics was an exercise, not the complete procedure for this entire action.

1144
01:29:34,811 --> 01:29:35,671
You know what I mean?

1145
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:42,755
It's not the complete procedure, which seems to be what's happening.

1146
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:46,177
Correct.

1147
01:29:46,878 --> 01:29:52,081
To go through this rubrics, but it wasn't made that it was going to be the only thing we did.

1148
01:29:53,082 --> 01:29:55,464
because there's other ways the public was supposed to get involved.

1149
01:29:55,544 --> 01:29:56,024
That's all.

1150
01:29:57,606 --> 01:30:02,090
It is not the only way that we're evaluating names.

1151
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:02,950
Okay.

1152
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,071
There's discussion.

1153
01:30:04,091 --> 01:30:05,893
There's public input.

1154
01:30:06,793 --> 01:30:12,018
And I suspect that there's going to be people that did research that

1155
01:30:13,502 --> 01:30:22,816
Members of this committee have never heard of that they will talk about in this meeting and we would we may be swayed to think differently.

1156
01:30:22,836 --> 01:30:24,619
Okay, yeah.

1157
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:27,423
And I think that

1158
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:38,729
that the opportunity for the public to submit these essays, like, you know, this is a way for our people to say, you know, what Danny was just saying.

1159
01:30:39,029 --> 01:30:41,910
He's like, this family is really important to my family.

1160
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:46,612
It's important to other families that have been in Medford for years and years.

1161
01:30:47,513 --> 01:30:51,714
And I want to say what they've done for Medford.

1162
01:30:52,175 --> 01:30:56,797
This, you know, this is a personal connection for me, but, you know,

1163
01:30:57,637 --> 01:31:05,903
maybe the rules that Del Russo made in the 40s have changed how things happen for a lot of people.

1164
01:31:06,203 --> 01:31:08,945
And that's what we really need to hear.

1165
01:31:09,826 --> 01:31:12,568
And frankly, I'm not gonna know that.

1166
01:31:12,988 --> 01:31:24,457
So we have to have somebody like Danny saying, these are the things that are important to me and write it down and then we can learn about it because we don't have all of this knowledge.

1167
01:31:25,578 --> 01:31:27,139
I agree, thank you.

1168
01:31:28,085 --> 01:31:29,728
Don D'Amico, COB OSMP, is that correct?

1169
01:31:38,013 --> 01:31:41,395
talk about different elements that we need to consider.

1170
01:31:41,575 --> 01:32:01,444
And number eight on what we voted on last week and approved is the advisory committee deliberates to select three names by consensus, weighing the submissions average scores, average values on each rubric dimension, public input and research.

1171
01:32:02,485 --> 01:32:02,685
So

1172
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:12,826
it seems like folks are concerned, like we're not getting enough public input or we're not, we have that, we've already built that into the vote.

1173
01:32:12,846 --> 01:32:14,347
We built that into the process.

1174
01:32:14,967 --> 01:32:24,815
So we take into consideration the rubric as well as public input and research that we do as a group.

1175
01:32:26,536 --> 01:32:30,659
So that's number eight from our resolution that Dr. Rivera submitted.

1176
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,501
We do have hands up, Jim.

1177
01:32:34,892 --> 01:32:35,292
OK.

1178
01:32:37,514 --> 01:32:38,454
Lee, you want to go next?

1179
01:32:39,475 --> 01:32:39,675
Sure.

1180
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:41,637
My question, I think, is pretty quick.

1181
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:46,500
I was curious about the essay itself and whether it is a requirement or it's optional.

1182
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:51,924
Obviously, for the paper ones, it's optional in the sense that someone could return one without it.

1183
01:32:52,224 --> 01:32:58,088
But if we do an online version, is the idea that someone can vote without including an essay?

1184
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:01,210
Henrik?

1185
01:33:05,443 --> 01:33:06,023
You're muted.

1186
01:33:06,384 --> 01:33:07,184
Sorry, I'm muted.

1187
01:33:07,905 --> 01:33:09,346
Um, someone could do that.

1188
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:24,297
But the thing that would be supportive, like, that would help me sway me and might make me want to support somebody is them saying, I feel strongly about this, this is the things that I feel strongly about.

1189
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:28,220
This person helped my family.

1190
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,222
This person supported people that I cared about.

1191
01:33:31,322 --> 01:33:35,466
This person created something for these students.

1192
01:33:35,966 --> 01:33:37,828
That's the stuff that really matters to me.

1193
01:33:37,908 --> 01:33:44,073
I don't really care if a whole bunch of people say, I wanna vote for Galileo.

1194
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,975
It's why is Galileo important?

1195
01:33:47,415 --> 01:33:48,856
That's the thing that matters to me.

1196
01:33:49,597 --> 01:33:50,617
Yes, I understand.

1197
01:33:50,657 --> 01:33:55,819
I just wanted to make sure we weren't marginalizing people or not including people who wanted to vote without the essay.

1198
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,160
Yes.

1199
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,801
So the essay is priority.

1200
01:34:00,341 --> 01:34:01,241
Point of information.

1201
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:02,202
Is there a vote?

1202
01:34:02,222 --> 01:34:05,243
I don't see anything in the resolution about a vote of the public.

1203
01:34:08,723 --> 01:34:09,484
It's not a vote.

1204
01:34:09,544 --> 01:34:12,905
They're just expressing support for one person.

1205
01:34:13,385 --> 01:34:14,985
Okay.

1206
01:34:15,406 --> 01:34:21,087
Point of information, the guidelines that the school committee gave us, we need some way of getting public input.

1207
01:34:21,507 --> 01:34:23,328
And I think this is the best way of doing it.

1208
01:34:24,849 --> 01:34:25,309
I agree.

1209
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:29,550
Melissa, do you have your hand up?

1210
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:31,791
Yeah, just a point of information.

1211
01:34:31,831 --> 01:34:34,752
I think the word essay can deter a lot of people.

1212
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:38,630
I think we should maybe say a brief description.

1213
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:41,231
I just don't want to turn people away.

1214
01:34:41,311 --> 01:34:44,613
Sometimes when you hear the word essay, it might be a little bit overwhelming.

1215
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:48,035
English may not be their first language.

1216
01:34:48,095 --> 01:34:49,776
They might be concerned about conveying.

1217
01:34:50,657 --> 01:34:54,679
So I think maybe we should just say a brief description of why you support this person.

1218
01:34:54,699 --> 01:35:00,182
And I think you'd be more likely to get more people to submit that way.

1219
01:35:00,202 --> 01:35:01,083
Excellent.

1220
01:35:02,612 --> 01:35:05,154
I just- You accept that friendly amendment?

1221
01:35:05,794 --> 01:35:06,134
Yes.

1222
01:35:06,394 --> 01:35:06,875
Thank you.

1223
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:14,259
I know me being an engineer, being more into numbers, when I hear the word essay, it's very overwhelming to me, because I like to do better with numbers.

1224
01:35:14,299 --> 01:35:21,223
But if you tell somebody a brief description, I think that might be a little bit more, you know, a short paragraph, something.

1225
01:35:21,243 --> 01:35:23,905
Essay to me sounds very formal.

1226
01:35:24,445 --> 01:35:25,606
What about argument?

1227
01:35:27,507 --> 01:35:28,047
Is that word negative?

1228
01:35:28,067 --> 01:35:31,029
Submit one written argument in favor of the candidate.

1229
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:34,055
Sure, well, unwritten defense.

1230
01:35:34,115 --> 01:35:37,597
Yeah, I just wanna be careful of the word we use that we don't turn people away.

1231
01:35:37,617 --> 01:35:39,637
Maybe a statement.

1232
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:41,438
Yeah, yeah, I like statement.

1233
01:35:41,618 --> 01:35:42,819
Statement of support.

1234
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:46,860
Or the word we use with the kids at school is a persuasive letter.

1235
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,821
Oh, that's a good, yeah.

1236
01:35:49,141 --> 01:35:49,421
Yeah.

1237
01:35:50,461 --> 01:35:52,282
Okay, thank you.

1238
01:35:52,802 --> 01:36:00,505
And I also just wanna put some input that I don't think it's important how many people per household vote.

1239
01:36:01,753 --> 01:36:08,335
I know here in South Medford, we have very dense housing, and you may have four adults in one household.

1240
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:15,738
And I think that each person in that household, including my fourth grader at the Columbus, should be able to submit a name.

1241
01:36:16,538 --> 01:36:21,480
So I'm not sure if their name and address, and I know the city council is voting on that today.

1242
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:30,503
Tonight, I don't know if name and address is necessarily important, because I know on this committee alone, we have one household taking up two spots on this committee.

1243
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:35,636
So I think to then turn to the public and say that they can't do that would be hypocritical of us.

1244
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:41,419
So that's just my two things that I've been listening to everybody today.

1245
01:36:41,899 --> 01:36:43,980
Yes, I did miss last week because I was out of town.

1246
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,521
So I want to thank everybody for really rehashing what we did last week.

1247
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:53,364
And for the things that I heard today, that's just my information that I wanted to provide.

1248
01:36:53,404 --> 01:36:54,604
So thank you all for listening.

1249
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:55,965
Thank you.

1250
01:36:57,345 --> 01:36:58,586
Aaron, would you like to speak?

1251
01:37:02,095 --> 01:37:02,756
Yes, thank you.

1252
01:37:04,597 --> 01:37:09,401
I have two questions about the resolution and the request to the public.

1253
01:37:11,202 --> 01:37:17,627
One is, will they be given any information about the person or name proposal?

1254
01:37:19,609 --> 01:37:23,212
Will there be a description provided for them or will they just

1255
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:27,193
you know, have to know on their own what it is.

1256
01:37:27,914 --> 01:37:29,194
So that's one question.

1257
01:37:29,334 --> 01:37:34,876
And then the other question is, how will we evaluate those essays or those statements?

1258
01:37:35,717 --> 01:37:37,297
And what will the process be for that?

1259
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:52,023
So I think the first question, I think that they will have to do their own background to figure out the history behind the name.

1260
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:56,229
The second part, how would we evaluate?

1261
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:08,193
Kendrick, I suppose we would all read them and then if we're going back to a re-rubrics era, whatever, we would consider it.

1262
01:38:09,513 --> 01:38:20,996
So my thought was that everyone on the committee would read all of these statements and that we would be using that

1263
01:38:23,908 --> 01:38:26,829
You know, if it speaks to us, then it affects our decision.

1264
01:38:26,909 --> 01:38:29,630
If it doesn't speak to us, it doesn't affect our decision.

1265
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:39,312
I don't think that there's a formal way that we could evaluate what people write, other than whether or not it's persuasive to us.

1266
01:38:42,628 --> 01:38:50,155
The reasoning behind the address and name is to make sure that we're getting people that are in Medford.

1267
01:38:51,596 --> 01:38:59,083
Each individual would have the ability if they lived in Medford to participate.

1268
01:38:59,103 --> 01:39:04,488
So I'm definitely not limiting

1269
01:39:07,012 --> 01:39:13,876
participation from other members of the family, and I would love it if children would write in.

1270
01:39:13,896 --> 01:39:18,958
Okay, thank you.

1271
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:21,260
Kathy Kay, would you like to speak?

1272
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:22,780
Yeah, I have a question.

1273
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:33,946
At this point in the game, I think it would be important that if the teachers wanted to be involved as well, that they should be, and not all of the teachers live in Medford.

1274
01:39:35,488 --> 01:39:37,050
And so that would exclude that group.

1275
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:42,936
I don't know if that creates a problem for the committee here to allow that.

1276
01:39:42,996 --> 01:39:49,082
I mean, obviously the students live in Medford, but the teachers who work at the school, not all of them live in Medford, so that they don't get to have a say.

1277
01:39:50,984 --> 01:39:52,485
That would be another friendly amendment.

1278
01:39:52,505 --> 01:39:54,147
Hendrick, would we be in favor of that?

1279
01:39:57,311 --> 01:39:58,031
You're muted, Henrik.

1280
01:39:58,431 --> 01:39:58,691
Yes.

1281
01:39:59,012 --> 01:40:05,113
I'm going to learn to use these mute buttons at some point before this whole thing is over and we don't have to do this anymore.

1282
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:08,354
We all, we all, we all think that, but we all still do it.

1283
01:40:08,415 --> 01:40:09,295
So don't feel bad.

1284
01:40:11,415 --> 01:40:25,420
Um, so I will, I will add, uh, how about residents and

1285
01:40:27,812 --> 01:40:30,673
employees of the school.

1286
01:40:31,513 --> 01:40:33,113
Could the teacher just sign the letter?

1287
01:40:33,133 --> 01:40:36,754
The address would be the Columbus School.

1288
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:37,954
Do you know what I'm saying?

1289
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:45,715
So if I taught at the Columbus School, my name would be Lisa Evangelista, my address would be Columbus School, 37 Hicks Ave.

1290
01:40:46,456 --> 01:40:51,437
They would need to say that in the directions too though, because if it doesn't state it, teachers might not apply.

1291
01:40:52,337 --> 01:40:53,237
I believe that.

1292
01:40:54,302 --> 01:40:58,365
I think Hendrick had it right by saying employees of the Medford public school system work.

1293
01:40:58,405 --> 01:40:59,506
That's good.

1294
01:41:01,187 --> 01:41:11,715
There was also in the survey for name suggestions the term Medford community member and a question asking about connection to Medford.

1295
01:41:12,115 --> 01:41:14,577
Would that be something that you would be interested in adding or?

1296
01:41:18,455 --> 01:41:21,877
I'm sorry, I was typing and now I can't remember what you just said.

1297
01:41:22,237 --> 01:41:23,798
So can you say it one more time?

1298
01:41:24,899 --> 01:41:36,607
In the survey for suggesting names, there was the term Medford community member, which encompassed employees of the school, residents, students, et cetera.

1299
01:41:38,388 --> 01:41:43,191
And there was a question that asked, what is your connection to the Medford community?

1300
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:46,613
Would that be something that you'd be interested in adding?

1301
01:41:51,322 --> 01:42:05,793
Um, it sounds like we would have to think a lot about who, not to say that I am opposed to thinking, but, uh, we would have to figure out who, who would be allowed to the community.

1302
01:42:06,474 --> 01:42:06,754
Yeah.

1303
01:42:17,062 --> 01:42:18,863
Does anybody have any ideas on that?

1304
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:23,554
My only comment is it's not a vote, it's just gathering information.

1305
01:42:23,654 --> 01:42:32,337
So if somebody who travels into the city or works here knows of something, we just read their suggestion.

1306
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:35,218
It's not like they're voting, so we don't have to really restrict it, but.

1307
01:42:35,998 --> 01:42:37,679
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

1308
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:41,340
If it's valued information, I sure would like it.

1309
01:42:42,177 --> 01:42:50,738
unless we have a run from, you know, Somerville and, you know, people who want to write essays and submit them, I mean, statements and submit them, I think it's probably fine.

1310
01:42:51,699 --> 01:42:51,819
Okay.

1311
01:42:51,859 --> 01:42:53,939
All right.

1312
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:56,659
So was there any more hands that I didn't see?

1313
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,760
There are.

1314
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,120
Laura?

1315
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:02,861
Thank you.

1316
01:43:02,881 --> 01:43:11,262
I feel like a lot of what I wanted to say has already been said, but I just wanted to take one quick step back and say how I view this

1317
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:15,260
as being consistent with the resolution we passed last time.

1318
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:19,723
And I know that we've had sort of different opinions about what that means.

1319
01:43:19,903 --> 01:43:25,066
The way I see the resolution is not exclusive, but certainly it is a roadmap.

1320
01:43:25,146 --> 01:43:28,588
We did agree to do those 10 steps, right?

1321
01:43:28,648 --> 01:43:34,432
And I think now we're getting into the nitty gritty of how we do those steps, especially the step about how we get public input.

1322
01:43:34,772 --> 01:43:42,116
But I just want to be on the record to say that I do believe we are bound to do those 10 steps by what we voted on.

1323
01:43:44,617 --> 01:43:49,819
And there may be other steps that we may add in and it's not exclusive but we we did agree to do those 10 things.

1324
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:52,841
Okay, thank you.

1325
01:43:54,354 --> 01:43:55,535
Brian, do you wanna speak again?

1326
01:43:56,015 --> 01:43:56,916
Yeah, sorry.

1327
01:43:58,397 --> 01:44:03,481
I just wanna really pare it down so that, you know, we now have, I assume we now have a list of 18.

1328
01:44:03,581 --> 01:44:07,404
I just like the mechanics of it, how it's gonna be displayed.

1329
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:10,607
I think we talked about doing the survey.

1330
01:44:10,627 --> 01:44:19,353
I just, in the interest of being exact, what happens to somebody who writes a 350 word statement?

1331
01:44:19,834 --> 01:44:21,295
Are they, we're not gonna review it?

1332
01:44:25,869 --> 01:44:27,410
I would think that we would review it.

1333
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,511
I just think that we're trying to keep it under 250.

1334
01:44:29,911 --> 01:44:32,552
Yeah, I mean, I'm just saying.

1335
01:44:32,872 --> 01:44:38,214
I wouldn't say we would exclude anything, but the incentive is to keep it under 250.

1336
01:44:38,254 --> 01:44:40,095
Yeah, you can limit the form.

1337
01:44:40,115 --> 01:44:41,196
OK, good.

1338
01:44:41,276 --> 01:44:41,396
OK.

1339
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:50,953
And the other point that I wanna make is we now know what we need to know to do this.

1340
01:44:51,413 --> 01:44:59,179
I think we should develop a timeline of start date, end date, and how this is all gonna, just this part is all gonna happen.

1341
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,181
So I know you said a week.

1342
01:45:02,641 --> 01:45:05,743
Do we say it starts tomorrow and it ends next Wednesday?

1343
01:45:05,763 --> 01:45:07,985
I think also that should be in the resolution.

1344
01:45:11,872 --> 01:45:24,358
My intent was that we make the form and that however long that takes determines when we start, because we want to start as quickly as possible.

1345
01:45:26,879 --> 01:45:31,862
And I'm probably not the right person to make the Google form.

1346
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,820
I think I can get Susan to take care of that for us.

1347
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,201
Matt has his hand up.

1348
01:45:38,281 --> 01:45:38,541
Yes.

1349
01:45:40,021 --> 01:45:40,281
Thank you.

1350
01:45:40,301 --> 01:45:40,802
Go ahead, Matt.

1351
01:45:41,842 --> 01:45:45,063
I just wanted to ask how the names are actually put on the form.

1352
01:45:45,163 --> 01:45:48,784
I'm hoping alphabetically and not a ranking system, i.e.

1353
01:45:48,824 --> 01:45:49,024
not.

1354
01:45:49,745 --> 01:45:51,265
Not in order of how they fell.

1355
01:45:51,725 --> 01:45:52,526
Right.

1356
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:54,286
But alphabetically does.

1357
01:45:54,786 --> 01:45:55,126
OK.

1358
01:45:55,647 --> 01:45:58,968
Did you get that, Lisa?

1359
01:46:02,934 --> 01:46:03,294
Okay.

1360
01:46:05,616 --> 01:46:05,756
Yep.

1361
01:46:05,796 --> 01:46:09,859
Well, I was going to suggest that alphabetical is probably the easiest.

1362
01:46:10,519 --> 01:46:10,860
Okay.

1363
01:46:13,522 --> 01:46:13,822
All right.

1364
01:46:14,382 --> 01:46:16,043
Is there anything else on that motion?

1365
01:46:16,063 --> 01:46:20,487
Can we go through the list?

1366
01:46:22,508 --> 01:46:30,774
Mr. Chair, then I think Ron, you said you wanted to include a timeline on it, but what, what is the timeline you wanted to add to the resolution?

1367
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,131
Well, I think Hendrick answered the question.

1368
01:46:33,191 --> 01:46:35,653
It depends on how long it takes to do that survey.

1369
01:46:36,093 --> 01:46:43,078
But if we all understand that it's a seven-day window for citizens to submit, then that's fine with me.

1370
01:46:43,499 --> 01:46:49,903
The more information we have, it starts on May 18th, it ends on May 25th, that all has to be in there.

1371
01:46:49,983 --> 01:46:53,305
So as long as we agree it's a one-week survey, that's fine.

1372
01:46:54,847 --> 01:46:56,548
I don't think we can come up with a date just yet.

1373
01:46:57,228 --> 01:47:00,432
Well, is this something that we can have created tomorrow?

1374
01:47:00,452 --> 01:47:10,502
I mean, I don't know what the, yeah, I see Lisa's got her hands up.

1375
01:47:10,783 --> 01:47:17,890
Um, I mean, no, I don't mean to cause a problem, but I do know that, you know, it's a Columbus school renaming committee.

1376
01:47:17,951 --> 01:47:19,252
It's also budget time.

1377
01:47:19,965 --> 01:47:22,747
And so Susie and myself were very involved in that too.

1378
01:47:24,209 --> 01:47:28,813
So you just have to keep that in mind, like we have a budget hearing on Thursday that we have to prepare for.

1379
01:47:28,853 --> 01:47:42,924
So, you know, maybe if we could have it done by the end of the week so that we could go Monday to get it out across the school messenger and however else the survey was distributed, maybe, I mean, I have to double check with Susie, but.

1380
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:50,500
I mean, the timeline may be really tight, but I don't know if she can get it done tomorrow, or we could get it done tomorrow.

1381
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,820
I just can't commit to that without talking to her first.

1382
01:47:54,201 --> 01:47:56,381
I would just like to say.

1383
01:47:56,981 --> 01:47:58,522
Beth has had her hand up, I think.

1384
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:01,863
So I just have one quick, sorry, I'm sorry, Maria.

1385
01:48:02,263 --> 01:48:10,345
I just have one quick comment in that we, somewhere along the line, and it could be in the back and forth of the emails,

1386
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:30,803
Someone was suggesting that we also needed to be mindful of maybe the negative information that members of the community might want to submit to us.

1387
01:48:31,643 --> 01:48:39,905
How does that, if we're only limiting people to one statement of support or persuasive letter,

1388
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:44,549
How would we handle negative information?

1389
01:48:49,665 --> 01:48:51,386
That's a good point.

1390
01:48:51,546 --> 01:49:03,611
My feeling is that each member of the committee would evaluate whether or not they felt like that negative information was persuasive or if it was just part of the noise that we didn't want to hear.

1391
01:49:04,612 --> 01:49:08,253
And each person would vote based on their own feelings.

1392
01:49:08,954 --> 01:49:17,318
Someone makes a negative argument and it's persuasive, then it is.

1393
01:49:19,807 --> 01:49:29,754
I'm thinking Beth's question is if I want to vote for someone, but also give negative information about someone, I don't have an opportunity to do both.

1394
01:49:29,774 --> 01:49:34,077
It's a tough group.

1395
01:49:37,339 --> 01:49:37,739
Okay.

1396
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:40,961
Maria, did you have your hand up?

1397
01:49:41,802 --> 01:49:43,783
Yes, I was going to comment that

1398
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:47,862
making a Google survey does not take a very long time.

1399
01:49:47,882 --> 01:49:54,447
Um, and I would be happy to volunteer to make one if anyone else would like to help.

1400
01:49:55,227 --> 01:50:02,932
Um, I just don't think that there's any reason to be delaying because of budget season, et cetera, et cetera.

1401
01:50:03,373 --> 01:50:10,037
I think that you have to understand that it's still going to have to be, um, sent through the superintendent's office in order to get to everybody.

1402
01:50:10,595 --> 01:50:24,746
So you can certainly submit something to Susie if you wanna do that, or somebody wants to work on that, but it would still have to go through the process of getting it out to the same people that the survey initially went out to, and that stemmed from the superintendent's office.

1403
01:50:24,826 --> 01:50:30,610
So in order to get everybody to participate, we have to keep it as public as possible.

1404
01:50:31,171 --> 01:50:36,815
So whatever assistance you wanna provide, absolutely, but it should go to Susie for a final okay.

1405
01:50:38,843 --> 01:50:39,644
Okay, thank you.

1406
01:50:40,184 --> 01:50:44,406
And Mr. Lister, can I make a request as well for that information?

1407
01:50:44,887 --> 01:50:45,127
Yes.

1408
01:50:45,607 --> 01:50:52,551
That's shared with me as well as the principal of the Columbus so that I can share it with all my families too, just so that they get it in more than one way.

1409
01:50:52,571 --> 01:50:57,414
Okay, did you get that, Lisa, to add that on?

1410
01:51:01,236 --> 01:51:01,576
Okay.

1411
01:51:02,057 --> 01:51:02,457
Thank you.

1412
01:51:03,678 --> 01:51:05,879
Point of clarification, Mr. Chair.

1413
01:51:06,139 --> 01:51:07,100
I mean, on this,

1414
01:51:09,185 --> 01:51:14,528
What the superintendent is doing, that's the minimum where it needs to go out.

1415
01:51:14,948 --> 01:51:18,710
We can send it out through Facebook or send it out wherever else, right?

1416
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:24,952
There's no... I would agree, but they would have to go to the website to get actual access to submit.

1417
01:51:25,433 --> 01:51:25,613
Right.

1418
01:51:26,373 --> 01:51:27,874
Yeah.

1419
01:51:27,894 --> 01:51:37,983
They could go to the blog, the blog spits it out to Facebook and Twitter, just so we're, um, and obviously if you all have, you all would be CC'd on it.

1420
01:51:38,023 --> 01:51:45,970
So if you have members of the public that are asking you, obviously you could say, you know, you could send it out yourself as long as it's all returned to Susie.

1421
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:50,735
So we can, you know, provide the information to the, to the committee.

1422
01:51:51,575 --> 01:51:51,916
Correct.

1423
01:51:53,037 --> 01:51:53,377
Thank you.

1424
01:51:55,268 --> 01:51:56,549
Melissa, would you like to speak?

1425
01:51:57,829 --> 01:51:59,931
One quick thing, point of information.

1426
01:52:00,711 --> 01:52:00,931
Ms.

1427
01:52:00,951 --> 01:52:02,612
Beth Fuller brought up a great point.

1428
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:15,519
I'm sorry, my dog is going crazy, but how do we verify that if any negative or say derogatory information is provided, how do we prove that as fact?

1429
01:52:15,919 --> 01:52:22,603
Because I know there's been argument, it's hard to find certain information.

1430
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:32,630
Um, to prove that either positive or negative, how do we go about proving that that negative input is in fact truth?

1431
01:52:34,291 --> 01:52:41,695
And I think that's something that's going to be tied to every input is going to be tied to even individual that.

1432
01:52:43,616 --> 01:52:45,677
Uh, sent the information in.

1433
01:52:45,777 --> 01:52:52,801
So I would hope that if we had some, something that was damning that, uh, it would go back to that person.

1434
01:52:55,212 --> 01:52:55,472
Thank you.

1435
01:52:55,492 --> 01:53:08,303
That was, I just wanted to make sure that that's something that we also thought about because I'm kind of the longer we allow this statement as a paragraph to be, I feel like we're going to get more noise.

1436
01:53:09,584 --> 01:53:10,685
Um, then then good.

1437
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:12,987
Okay.

1438
01:53:14,088 --> 01:53:14,448
Thank you.

1439
01:53:15,309 --> 01:53:17,091
Breeze had her hand up for a very long time.

1440
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:19,032
I'm sorry for you.

1441
01:53:19,052 --> 01:53:19,453
Go ahead.

1442
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:20,554
That's okay.

1443
01:53:20,594 --> 01:53:23,276
I just, I don't have the raise hand as a,

1444
01:53:24,442 --> 01:53:24,862
Co-host.

1445
01:53:25,002 --> 01:53:25,503
I'm sorry.

1446
01:53:25,523 --> 01:53:26,643
I don't have you on my screen.

1447
01:53:26,663 --> 01:53:27,744
That's why I'm not saying it.

1448
01:53:27,764 --> 01:53:27,944
Sorry.

1449
01:53:28,224 --> 01:53:28,544
Okay.

1450
01:53:29,024 --> 01:53:36,088
Um, I was just also to what, uh, Maria said, I'm happy to help it.

1451
01:53:36,789 --> 01:53:45,113
It, um, I also, I mean, I hate that a lot of the heavy lifting is falling to Lisa or Susie or whomever.

1452
01:53:46,033 --> 01:53:48,875
Um, I know there was a little bit of hesitance.

1453
01:53:49,813 --> 01:54:01,082
Hesitation like with having committee members do some of the work for this week, but Assuming there's no randomization or anything like that to happen for a Google survey.

1454
01:54:01,142 --> 01:54:02,483
I'm also happy to

1455
01:54:03,764 --> 01:54:04,444
to help with that.

1456
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:15,187
And then I feel like if we as committee members can, can do a brunt of the work and then just get it to who it needs to go to, to go out to the proper channels, then that will save a lot of time.

1457
01:54:15,947 --> 01:54:16,448
That's fine.

1458
01:54:16,508 --> 01:54:29,651
If you and Maria want to work on something, I'm not saying you can't, I'm just saying that we would need to have it so that we get it out to the proper people, because we're going to get the calls if X, Y, and Z didn't, you know, couldn't participate or something.

1459
01:54:29,731 --> 01:54:32,272
So, and if there's something on the Google form that

1460
01:54:32,738 --> 01:54:33,858
you know, may or may not go.

1461
01:54:33,919 --> 01:54:35,919
I mean, the superintendent would have to look at it.

1462
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:39,781
So in case we got any calls, you know, we would be the ones speaking for it.

1463
01:54:40,361 --> 01:54:42,362
When I say, I mean like central office.

1464
01:54:43,503 --> 01:54:44,303
Does that make sense?

1465
01:54:44,863 --> 01:54:45,463
Yes, yes.

1466
01:54:46,844 --> 01:54:47,124
Okay.

1467
01:54:48,285 --> 01:54:55,287
Seth, do you have your hand up?

1468
01:54:55,968 --> 01:54:59,469
In the chat, which I know that not everybody has access to, I

1469
01:55:02,578 --> 01:55:17,625
wrote a proposal to solicit both positive and negative information on any of the other names that might be considered a number seven.

1470
01:55:18,145 --> 01:55:20,826
So Hendrick, this could be a potential friendly amendment.

1471
01:55:22,447 --> 01:55:28,410
And what I read or what I wrote was, if there is any additional information about any other name,

1472
01:55:29,458 --> 01:55:36,966
I'm sorry, if there is additional information about any other name, positive or negative, please feel free to write it.

1473
01:55:39,168 --> 01:55:43,352
And then I said, either here or send it to an email.

1474
01:55:44,093 --> 01:55:52,322
And I don't know whether or not it makes more sense to have it as part of a form or a document.

1475
01:55:53,568 --> 01:56:06,338
or have it sent theoretically to the superintendent's office or the chair directly and then distributed to the committee.

1476
01:56:06,778 --> 01:56:12,942
I think that we should have it go in the same form so that we don't have to chase the email.

1477
01:56:13,663 --> 01:56:14,984
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

1478
01:56:15,004 --> 01:56:19,027
OK, so that's a friendly amendment to the resolution.

1479
01:56:19,207 --> 01:56:21,008
I'm working on incorporating it.

1480
01:56:21,369 --> 01:56:21,469
OK.

1481
01:56:25,784 --> 01:56:28,987
Hendrik, can you see my chat?

1482
01:56:29,067 --> 01:56:34,771
Yes, I actually copied your thing, and I'm figuring out how to stick it in.

1483
01:56:35,372 --> 01:56:35,632
Great.

1484
01:56:37,294 --> 01:56:37,354
OK.

1485
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,541
Pat, go ahead.

1486
01:56:40,742 --> 01:56:43,564
On that issue, though, we say positive or negative.

1487
01:56:43,724 --> 01:56:50,068
I mean, now we're letting people go long form on multiple submissions, right?

1488
01:56:50,108 --> 01:56:51,569
And we wanted to limit it to one.

1489
01:56:52,310 --> 01:57:01,196
So do we just say, do you have any concerns about the people on the list, any negative information or something like that?

1490
01:57:01,216 --> 01:57:04,798
We're only allowing them to write on one person.

1491
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:05,739
Right.

1492
01:57:06,775 --> 01:57:14,017
But we're adding this piece here at the end that says, is there any negative information about any of the individuals listed above?

1493
01:57:15,197 --> 01:57:18,518
Seth had said, any addition to one?

1494
01:57:18,558 --> 01:57:20,818
I'm trying to make it into one.

1495
01:57:20,959 --> 01:57:25,019
Yeah, no.

1496
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:27,540
Jim, were you saying someone had like two negatives?

1497
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,961
I understand what you're saying, yeah.

1498
01:57:32,101 --> 01:57:34,662
We're convoluting what we're asking here.

1499
01:57:35,282 --> 01:57:35,422
Yeah.

1500
01:57:36,197 --> 01:57:42,150
positive report and then we're asking for negative if it's possible and they talk about multiple people.

1501
01:57:42,230 --> 01:57:46,219
I mean, we're making this kind of confusing.

1502
01:57:47,493 --> 01:57:52,415
Yeah, so it's one positive and then as many negatives as people have, I would think we want to know.

1503
01:57:52,455 --> 01:57:54,236
We don't want to name a school.

1504
01:57:54,256 --> 01:57:56,838
I see Laura's doesn't like that.

1505
01:57:56,878 --> 01:58:07,143
But, um, I guess I'm thinking like if someone has information that's negative about two or three of these candidates that we have, I, you know, I would like to hear that.

1506
01:58:07,183 --> 01:58:15,747
I would, I don't want to be back here next year, renaming a school after someone, you know, if we find additional negative information in the future.

1507
01:58:20,457 --> 01:58:31,743
So let me just read this, somebody, maybe just comment text box for negative character concerns, separate from the essay on person they support.

1508
01:58:31,763 --> 01:58:35,545
Sorry, Leroy.

1509
01:58:35,565 --> 01:58:41,428
I said there are hands, I see Lou, Kathy, Kay and Ron again.

1510
01:58:41,609 --> 01:58:42,289
Oh, and Dan.

1511
01:58:46,231 --> 01:58:46,831
You said Lou?

1512
01:58:48,892 --> 01:58:49,693
Lou, you got your hand up?

1513
01:58:49,978 --> 01:58:50,939
Yeah, I do, I'm sorry.

1514
01:58:52,399 --> 01:59:02,505
Going back to who can write these statements, I kind of have a problem with just, if you just work in Medford, that you can have a say in the school.

1515
01:59:05,206 --> 01:59:10,669
I mean, I understand the teachers of the Columbus, but I don't think every teacher of the Medford Public Schools should have a say in it.

1516
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:16,072
Or if you just work in a store, that you can just have a say in it.

1517
01:59:17,113 --> 01:59:18,454
I mean, I work in Lowell a lot,

1518
01:59:19,712 --> 01:59:21,613
I'm sure they don't want my input on a local school.

1519
01:59:23,114 --> 01:59:34,241
You know, that's, I think we've got to draw a line somewhere that would be in the form of an amendment to, uh, limited to met for residents only.

1520
01:59:34,261 --> 01:59:40,065
And, uh, Columbus school teachers, Columbus school teachers are Columbus school employees.

1521
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:44,187
Well, employees, I mean, that's their building.

1522
01:59:44,448 --> 01:59:45,028
They work in there.

1523
01:59:47,178 --> 01:59:52,703
Well, to be fair, some people might've started working at the Columbus, but now are at a different school.

1524
01:59:52,723 --> 01:59:56,827
And some left Medford and then someone could just leave Medford.

1525
01:59:57,407 --> 01:59:58,488
Well, that's fair too.

1526
01:59:58,728 --> 01:59:59,049
I mean.

1527
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:00,610
I don't think it's fair.

1528
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:01,431
Why?

1529
02:00:02,311 --> 02:00:04,153
Because if they're there right now and then they just leave.

1530
02:00:04,854 --> 02:00:09,938
Yeah, I don't mean they leave because they want to, they might've got an advanced degree and moved to a different school.

1531
02:00:10,359 --> 02:00:11,540
They could've moved to a different city.

1532
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:16,351
No, no, no, I meant like- All right, so please don't, it's through everything through the chair.

1533
02:00:16,371 --> 02:00:17,171
I'm sorry.

1534
02:00:17,191 --> 02:00:21,812
Don't go back and forth, just- I was just trying to get my point is- I understand.

1535
02:00:22,092 --> 02:00:28,974
You know, there could be a teacher there today and then they leave Medford and go to another school next week or next year.

1536
02:00:32,015 --> 02:00:41,537
That's, they could have a good or a bad or a, it's either or as far as a- I would second Lou's amendment.

1537
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:45,467
Okay, all right, we have a second on the amendment.

1538
02:00:47,428 --> 02:00:48,268
Any more discussion?

1539
02:00:48,589 --> 02:00:51,610
We're discussing the amendment now and then we'll vote on the amendment first.

1540
02:00:54,332 --> 02:00:54,912
Patrick.

1541
02:01:01,056 --> 02:01:02,157
I didn't lower my hand.

1542
02:01:02,597 --> 02:01:04,018
Sorry about that.

1543
02:01:04,198 --> 02:01:05,479
Ron, would you?

1544
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:10,462
I just want to comment on this amendment to say that

1545
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:13,119
We're not giving people a vote.

1546
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:16,140
We're giving them an opportunity to give us valuable information.

1547
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:17,400
That's all we're asking for.

1548
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:27,463
Whether, you know, let's say name number two 25 years ago would be doing something in Malden and the people in Malden knew about it.

1549
02:01:27,823 --> 02:01:33,885
I think back to Patrick's point, we just wanna ensure that the name we pick is not gonna be tarnished in 20 years.

1550
02:01:34,305 --> 02:01:39,806
So I'm for anybody who wants to give information, we can validate.

1551
02:01:40,374 --> 02:01:42,335
information, but it's only information gathering.

1552
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:48,198
It's not a unless, you know, the other the other point I have, I'll say the other point on this amendment.

1553
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:48,898
That's my point.

1554
02:01:50,799 --> 02:01:51,639
Okay, thank you.

1555
02:01:54,921 --> 02:01:55,341
Maria.

1556
02:01:57,442 --> 02:02:03,865
Yeah, essentially, I just want to reiterate what's already been said in terms of this is not about voting.

1557
02:02:03,885 --> 02:02:05,826
This is about information.

1558
02:02:05,846 --> 02:02:09,528
I also could see in some

1559
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:34,865
ways that we might want to limit it to Medford community members, in which case, even considering your amendment, I would say not just Columbus teachers or employees, but rather Medford public schools employees, because ultimately they're all part of the larger Medford community.

1560
02:02:36,942 --> 02:02:46,564
We are all in a way impacted by the names of our schools, particularly if that could be a damaging or positive theme.

1561
02:02:50,045 --> 02:02:50,445
Thank you.

1562
02:02:55,066 --> 02:02:55,346
Lee?

1563
02:02:56,826 --> 02:03:00,987
Yeah, I'm also going to agree with that sentiment because it is not a vote.

1564
02:03:01,407 --> 02:03:03,568
It really is information gathering.

1565
02:03:03,963 --> 02:03:23,006
And I think that, you know, if we were really concerned about, again, being overwhelmed with information, which is not typically a real issue in this case, when we could add a box that just, you just check it and say, if you're a Medford resident, but we're not weighing the results of these, we're reading them and learning from them.

1566
02:03:23,346 --> 02:03:26,847
So there's, it's not in the end, there's no ranking of what came in.

1567
02:03:29,307 --> 02:03:29,588
Okay.

1568
02:03:31,668 --> 02:03:32,028
Kathy K.

1569
02:03:34,638 --> 02:03:43,758
So the first point I was going to make is, you know, we could call this a fact finding survey, and not even actually really use the word survey though I think fact finding something.

1570
02:03:44,738 --> 02:03:47,840
And that would then let people know we're just looking for information, right?

1571
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:48,541
They're not voting.

1572
02:03:49,201 --> 02:04:04,692
And my second point was when we were kind of getting, I think, hung up in tell us negative things, would it be better to just create a second box that's also has a size limit that says, please add anything additional you wanna tell us here.

1573
02:04:06,153 --> 02:04:11,096
And so if they want to give us positive information, they can, if they wanna give us negative information, they can do that too.

1574
02:04:15,021 --> 02:04:15,422
Thank you.

1575
02:04:19,168 --> 02:04:22,434
There's a note in the chat saying Dan has had his hand up for 10 minutes.

1576
02:04:22,514 --> 02:04:23,816
Dan, I'm sorry.

1577
02:04:26,223 --> 02:04:27,404
It's okay, no worries.

1578
02:04:27,564 --> 02:04:28,884
I'm always the forgotten one.

1579
02:04:30,725 --> 02:04:32,386
I just wanted to make a quick comment.

1580
02:04:33,446 --> 02:04:41,330
I was scanning through the original survey that went out and it was great to see that we got somewhere around 300 back.

1581
02:04:42,411 --> 02:04:51,955
I just wanna make sure that we use all our resources as far as this one goes, because for a city with 57,000 plus residents,

1582
02:04:55,068 --> 02:04:56,228
you know, folks that live here.

1583
02:04:56,248 --> 02:05:01,130
I just want to make sure that we're not forgetting some of the folks that aren't computer savvy.

1584
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:16,033
So, you know, I know it's difficult and I know there's probably money involved, but I'd love to see some of the, you know, some of the folks that, you know, don't necessarily have computers to not be left out of this.

1585
02:05:16,333 --> 02:05:16,673
That's all.

1586
02:05:18,569 --> 02:05:18,969
Thank you.

1587
02:05:19,709 --> 02:05:24,011
We did say that there would be paper versions at the Medford High School.

1588
02:05:25,872 --> 02:05:36,997
So we won't be able to hold them to 250 words, but if someone's writing longhand, if we don't, I think we should just let them have the extra words if they're gonna write it out.

1589
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:40,078
Okay, I got one more.

1590
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:41,939
Let me see.

1591
02:05:41,959 --> 02:05:44,480
Well, let me, I got something in the chat here.

1592
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,180
Can I read this?

1593
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,601
And then Maria, I'll let you speak.

1594
02:05:48,326 --> 02:05:57,510
If we are seeking to gather both negative or positive, I'd like to know if we can make the names of the submitted confidential or does that violate public information laws?

1595
02:05:59,951 --> 02:06:02,232
I would think that it violates the public information law.

1596
02:06:04,653 --> 02:06:05,433
I may be wrong.

1597
02:06:09,055 --> 02:06:10,255
Maria, would you like to speak?

1598
02:06:11,816 --> 02:06:14,937
Yes, I would just like to say that in terms of

1599
02:06:15,488 --> 02:06:18,289
possibly adding an additional information box.

1600
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:30,016
I feel as though that could get dicey in terms of we did say that we would limit the statement in support or persuasive letter to one name.

1601
02:06:30,736 --> 02:06:41,722
And so I think that we don't really want to be adding that additional information box and then it just becomes a place where people start talking about other names that they support.

1602
02:06:42,362 --> 02:06:44,163
I do think that we should have something

1603
02:06:44,587 --> 02:06:49,889
that explicitly states that we want to hear possible negative information.

1604
02:06:49,909 --> 02:07:04,536
I feel like, you know, I feel like we should have a subcommittee on just the form that we appoint four people to just work on this form and get back to us.

1605
02:07:06,036 --> 02:07:09,218
I mean, it's, we can go round and round here.

1606
02:07:11,959 --> 02:07:12,699
Rhi has her hand up.

1607
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:14,240
Rhi, go ahead.

1608
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:27,705
I was just going to say to Kathleen's point, if we kind of just, I think if we reframe the whole way we're thinking about this survey, we could effectively do two birds with one stone.

1609
02:07:27,785 --> 02:07:41,030
If we just call this fact finding, as opposed to a show of support, it would essentially free up community members to provide facts, whether they are positive or negative,

1610
02:07:42,499 --> 02:07:46,101
facts, you know, like, to each their own.

1611
02:07:46,641 --> 02:08:07,150
But if we don't call it a show of support, and we just ask for information about these top 17, 18, whatever the number was, candidates, I feel like we could effectively get a plethora of information that could accomplish both of these.

1612
02:08:13,504 --> 02:08:19,347
I feel like that now we get off of how many people we're about, we're allowing the submission to talk about.

1613
02:08:19,367 --> 02:08:28,971
Well, no, it would still be for, you might be right.

1614
02:08:32,972 --> 02:08:33,372
All right.

1615
02:08:34,413 --> 02:08:38,074
I was also just going to say somewhat agreeing with you, Jim.

1616
02:08:38,094 --> 02:08:41,636
I mean, maybe it's just better to go forward with the resolution

1617
02:08:42,309 --> 02:08:50,234
as being modified to just, and just come up with a separate process for getting other feedback, you know.

1618
02:08:50,394 --> 02:08:53,036
But we have one process, which is your show of support.

1619
02:08:53,276 --> 02:08:58,640
And then if you just want, if we just stand up a separate process for providing additional information.

1620
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:07,926
Does any other information you feel that should be made public, you know, whether it be negative information

1621
02:09:10,924 --> 02:09:13,346
We need some avenue for that to come forward.

1622
02:09:13,386 --> 02:09:14,607
We can do other things.

1623
02:09:16,328 --> 02:09:20,652
I like the original idea behind this, but it is difficult.

1624
02:09:22,613 --> 02:09:39,667
So one of the things that I don't want to lose if we change the language to be fact-finding, I think that we may lose the emotional feelings that people have about the candidate.

1625
02:09:41,838 --> 02:09:57,545
And at least the way I feel when I'm supporting somebody or arguing against somebody, it's not just about the facts, it's about how I feel about it.

1626
02:09:59,546 --> 02:10:04,468
You know, it could be a fact that, you know,

1627
02:10:05,889 --> 02:10:14,277
very few people actually know the person that you're supporting, but that you feel very strongly about it.

1628
02:10:17,079 --> 02:10:18,280
I don't, I think that

1629
02:10:21,549 --> 02:10:38,138
that the argument and what satisfies the public is not just about providing facts, but also being able to have their emotional usage, their impassioned support or impassioned argument.

1630
02:10:38,518 --> 02:10:43,660
And I think that that's an important part of what these statements could be.

1631
02:10:50,855 --> 02:11:03,100
If it's only fact, I don't know, I'm starting to get like, I don't care what we vote on, I just wanna go home, except we're already home.

1632
02:11:06,141 --> 02:11:13,163
Can we pass the amendment and I'll appoint a committee to come up with a form for us that we'll have to approve.

1633
02:11:14,864 --> 02:11:17,385
With working on your resolution,

1634
02:11:18,465 --> 02:11:26,710
And everything we've heard here, we'd have to get something together the next day or two and get it up.

1635
02:11:27,551 --> 02:11:32,955
I don't think that we couldn't approve the form in a day.

1636
02:11:33,275 --> 02:11:39,639
We can write the form in a day and submit it to Lisa or Susie to get it put out.

1637
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:44,822
But if we're going to approve the form as a committee,

1638
02:11:45,947 --> 02:11:49,272
that would push our schedule out?

1639
02:11:50,935 --> 02:11:53,299
Yeah, I mean, I think that's an administrative task.

1640
02:11:53,339 --> 02:11:54,761
I don't think we have to approve it.

1641
02:11:54,841 --> 02:11:59,910
I think if we just agree to delegate it to the chair and

1642
02:12:01,832 --> 02:12:06,433
and all the staff, and I think that, not staff, the volunteers, sorry.

1643
02:12:08,394 --> 02:12:18,056
And I think we just need to avoid the miscommunication that we had last time where one group of folks thought that they had responsibility and Jim thought he had responsibility.

1644
02:12:18,116 --> 02:12:20,797
So we just need to clarify the roles there.

1645
02:12:22,497 --> 02:12:25,898
If we do delegate this out to a subcommittee to do,

1646
02:12:26,858 --> 02:12:38,905
which hopefully, my opinion is hopefully we do, because I don't want us to wait another week or two to approve a form that's administrative.

1647
02:12:41,967 --> 02:12:43,968
I think we just need to clarify the language here.

1648
02:12:44,428 --> 02:12:55,475
And Bree, I'm fine with them coming up with it and submitting it to Lisa, so that Lisa and Susan could get it out there.

1649
02:12:57,150 --> 02:13:00,611
I mean, we need to have an agreement on what the language is that we have.

1650
02:13:00,871 --> 02:13:04,672
I mean, we've gone round and round with this language now for a half an hour.

1651
02:13:04,772 --> 02:13:07,072
I mean, we agree on the resolution.

1652
02:13:07,152 --> 02:13:09,953
It's just as far as what we're putting in it for language.

1653
02:13:13,554 --> 02:13:15,755
We haven't passed the resolution yet, by the way, but.

1654
02:13:19,395 --> 02:13:22,816
There are multiple hands, including Lisa's at some point.

1655
02:13:23,716 --> 02:13:25,697
Lisa, you first, please.

1656
02:13:26,277 --> 02:13:35,065
I'm sorry, I just wanted to say that the superintendent's office, we do try to translate these documents into four other languages.

1657
02:13:35,165 --> 02:13:43,332
So our EL director always asks us to be as basic as possible in these forms or in these surveys because they have to be translated.

1658
02:13:43,392 --> 02:13:46,515
So whoever's gonna work on the forms, we could just keep that in mind.

1659
02:13:46,555 --> 02:13:47,596
That's all, thank you.

1660
02:13:48,757 --> 02:13:49,017
Thank you.

1661
02:13:49,037 --> 02:13:53,001
All right, I got two more hands.

1662
02:13:54,191 --> 02:13:57,254
Ryan just quickly, I think we should just move the resolution.

1663
02:13:57,294 --> 02:14:02,980
If we can add that a committee will be assigned by Jim to help Hendrick and then we just move on.

1664
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:08,285
Let's just, I trust that we Hendrick and those people understand.

1665
02:14:09,628 --> 02:14:10,568
The vote's been called.

1666
02:14:10,588 --> 02:14:13,169
Can I go through the line up here?

1667
02:14:13,189 --> 02:14:24,611
I'll just point of order, Mr. Chair, is that there's an amendment right now on the floor about who's qualified to fill out this information.

1668
02:14:24,971 --> 02:14:27,551
And we never made a decision on that.

1669
02:14:27,591 --> 02:14:31,352
It was brought forward by Lou and seconded.

1670
02:14:31,372 --> 02:14:32,792
Correct.

1671
02:14:33,392 --> 02:14:34,452
Thank you for reminding me.

1672
02:14:34,472 --> 02:14:36,172
We need to vote on that amendment.

1673
02:14:36,192 --> 02:14:37,653
We need to vote on that amendment.

1674
02:14:41,415 --> 02:14:43,496
One time, can I get the amendment?

1675
02:14:43,696 --> 02:14:47,597
Lou, could you just say what you wanted to restrict?

1676
02:14:47,817 --> 02:14:54,600
You wanted to people that- I want it to be to Medford residents and Columbus school employees.

1677
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:55,360
Okay.

1678
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:58,241
All right, we're gonna vote the amendment.

1679
02:14:58,341 --> 02:14:59,661
Just point of clarification.

1680
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:01,722
That's not a friendly amendment.

1681
02:15:01,822 --> 02:15:03,162
Is that correct, Hendrick?

1682
02:15:03,683 --> 02:15:07,664
You want it open to all faculty and staff of Medford school system?

1683
02:15:11,331 --> 02:15:15,499
I think he wanted it for Columbus school staff.

1684
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:17,323
And yes.

1685
02:15:18,044 --> 02:15:20,649
No, I was saying Hendrick, the original motion.

1686
02:15:21,918 --> 02:15:30,602
Yes, Hendrick was- In the original motion I wrote, actually I don't have it in front of me anymore because I've been chicken scratching it.

1687
02:15:32,042 --> 02:15:42,247
The last thing that I had written was employees of Medford Public Schools and Medford community members is what I have written right now.

1688
02:15:43,743 --> 02:15:45,747
based on people's suggestions.

1689
02:15:46,588 --> 02:15:46,848
Okay.

1690
02:15:47,449 --> 02:15:47,650
Yeah.

1691
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:48,832
So that would require a vote.

1692
02:15:48,852 --> 02:15:50,976
It's not, if it's not a- That's not a friendly amendment.

1693
02:15:51,657 --> 02:15:51,957
Okay.

1694
02:15:52,498 --> 02:15:54,081
It feels friendly to me though.

1695
02:15:54,321 --> 02:15:55,563
So I'm okay.

1696
02:15:56,878 --> 02:16:02,261
Well, if you're okay with it, I don't think we need to take a vote on the separate amendment.

1697
02:16:02,361 --> 02:16:04,822
I would like to get the input of other people.

1698
02:16:05,382 --> 02:16:08,644
I'm I've been just putting a, most of the suggestions just in.

1699
02:16:09,224 --> 02:16:09,665
Okay.

1700
02:16:10,185 --> 02:16:16,488
So he's restricting it to just residents and employees of the Columbus.

1701
02:16:16,988 --> 02:16:22,171
And I would like to do the vote so that I'm not the one that makes the decision.

1702
02:16:24,012 --> 02:16:24,232
Okay.

1703
02:16:25,445 --> 02:16:27,146
Okay, so we'll move on the amendment.

1704
02:16:29,927 --> 02:16:30,527
Reed brothers.

1705
02:16:30,547 --> 02:16:32,228
Excuse me for a second.

1706
02:16:32,248 --> 02:16:33,328
For a point of information.

1707
02:16:33,688 --> 02:16:34,449
Can you clarify?

1708
02:16:34,469 --> 02:16:35,989
I'm a little lost on the amendment.

1709
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:42,612
The language of the resolution currently says it's for residents and all school staff.

1710
02:16:43,372 --> 02:16:47,054
And the amendment is residents and Columbus school staff.

1711
02:16:47,074 --> 02:16:47,834
Is that correct?

1712
02:16:48,594 --> 02:16:54,737
I also have and other Medford community members may also submit.

1713
02:16:55,685 --> 02:17:02,428
So that's the language that I have right now, which I added as we were talking about this.

1714
02:17:02,448 --> 02:17:06,970
So that isn't what the amendment we're voting on now is.

1715
02:17:07,430 --> 02:17:14,833
The amendment is to limit it to Columbus- To residents and employees of the Columbus School.

1716
02:17:15,533 --> 02:17:16,034
Okay, thank you.

1717
02:17:16,054 --> 02:17:16,174
Yes.

1718
02:17:17,574 --> 02:17:19,235
Who seconded Lou's amendment?

1719
02:17:19,555 --> 02:17:20,655
I mean, Lou's resolution.

1720
02:17:21,836 --> 02:17:22,816
I believe Paul did.

1721
02:17:23,677 --> 02:17:24,317
Ken Mallon did.

1722
02:17:24,977 --> 02:17:26,578
Ken Mallon did, yes, sorry.

1723
02:17:26,958 --> 02:17:30,139
Thank you.

1724
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:30,439
Okay.

1725
02:17:32,179 --> 02:17:33,400
Brie Brothers?

1726
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:34,680
No.

1727
02:17:37,521 --> 02:17:38,382
Dan Puccio?

1728
02:17:40,122 --> 02:17:40,542
Yes.

1729
02:17:42,923 --> 02:17:43,883
Aaron Genia?

1730
02:17:48,105 --> 02:17:50,186
I'm sorry, this is just for the amendment, right?

1731
02:17:50,846 --> 02:17:51,046
Yes.

1732
02:18:03,421 --> 02:18:05,041
Is there a third option?

1733
02:18:05,662 --> 02:18:06,802
Can I stand aside?

1734
02:18:08,562 --> 02:18:09,223
You can abstain.

1735
02:18:09,303 --> 02:18:09,763
Abstain.

1736
02:18:10,023 --> 02:18:10,863
I'll abstain.

1737
02:18:12,964 --> 02:18:13,624
Beth Fuller?

1738
02:18:20,306 --> 02:18:20,646
Yes.

1739
02:18:24,907 --> 02:18:25,927
Grace Caldera?

1740
02:18:28,328 --> 02:18:28,828
She left.

1741
02:18:29,788 --> 02:18:30,209
She left.

1742
02:18:30,909 --> 02:18:31,029
OK.

1743
02:18:33,975 --> 02:18:34,195
No.

1744
02:18:36,537 --> 02:18:37,858
Myself, Jim, yes.

1745
02:18:39,199 --> 02:18:40,000
Kenneth Mallon?

1746
02:18:41,201 --> 02:18:41,461
Yes.

1747
02:18:42,762 --> 02:18:43,823
Kristen Scalise?

1748
02:18:45,264 --> 02:18:45,485
No.

1749
02:18:47,306 --> 02:18:48,287
Laura Rotolo?

1750
02:18:49,228 --> 02:18:49,428
No.

1751
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:53,291
Leroy LaFleur?

1752
02:18:54,712 --> 02:18:54,972
No.

1753
02:18:57,574 --> 02:18:58,395
Lewin Tapa?

1754
02:18:59,075 --> 02:18:59,396
Yes.

1755
02:19:01,017 --> 02:19:01,958
Maria Rocha?

1756
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:03,079
No.

1757
02:19:05,667 --> 02:19:06,608
Melissa Miguel.

1758
02:19:07,888 --> 02:19:08,189
Yes.

1759
02:19:09,810 --> 02:19:10,730
Patrick McCabe.

1760
02:19:17,174 --> 02:19:17,434
Pat.

1761
02:19:18,695 --> 02:19:19,696
You are muted, Pat.

1762
02:19:20,496 --> 02:19:20,856
Patrick.

1763
02:19:21,177 --> 02:19:21,517
Sorry.

1764
02:19:22,097 --> 02:19:22,297
No.

1765
02:19:23,718 --> 02:19:24,439
Walden Ido.

1766
02:19:24,459 --> 02:19:34,505
I don't see him on the screen.

1767
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:36,651
He's giving a thumbs up.

1768
02:19:36,671 --> 02:19:37,571
He's giving a thumbs up.

1769
02:19:38,672 --> 02:19:40,213
Yes, I think is what he's saying.

1770
02:19:44,236 --> 02:19:45,037
Ron Jovino.

1771
02:19:45,897 --> 02:19:46,157
No.

02:19:47,899 --> 02:19:48,559
Seth Hill.

1773
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:49,800
No.

1774
02:19:51,701 --> 02:19:52,502
Kathy Kay.

1775
02:19:53,583 --> 02:19:53,783
No.

1776
02:19:55,684 --> 02:19:56,185
Matthew.

1777
02:19:57,105 --> 02:19:57,305
No.

1778
02:19:58,746 --> 02:19:59,227
Caitlin.

1779
02:20:00,107 --> 02:20:00,328
No.

1780
02:20:01,869 --> 02:20:02,369
Janelle.

1781
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:03,610
No.

1782
02:20:05,182 --> 02:20:05,722
Josie?

1783
02:20:06,583 --> 02:20:06,803
No.

1784
02:20:08,304 --> 02:20:10,305
Okay, I think we had more nos than yes.

1785
02:20:17,068 --> 02:20:17,869
Somebody have a count?

1786
02:20:22,291 --> 02:20:24,132
No.

1787
02:20:24,152 --> 02:20:30,955
14 nos, seven yeses, Grace left and Aaron abstained.

1788
02:20:31,156 --> 02:20:31,916
Does that work out?

1789
02:20:36,525 --> 02:20:37,345
Yes.

1790
02:20:37,625 --> 02:20:38,025
Thank you.

1791
02:20:38,606 --> 02:20:38,986
Thank you.

1792
02:20:41,046 --> 02:20:41,346
Okay.

1793
02:20:41,366 --> 02:20:42,187
Now to the motion.

1794
02:20:42,207 --> 02:20:44,808
Move the motion.

1795
02:20:46,168 --> 02:20:47,588
Can we have a reading of the motion?

1796
02:20:47,608 --> 02:20:48,209
Yeah.

1797
02:20:48,269 --> 02:20:49,329
I was just going to ask the same thing.

1798
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:51,830
Yeah.

1799
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:53,870
Would you like to read your motion again?

1800
02:20:53,890 --> 02:20:58,892
Yeah.

1801
02:20:58,912 --> 02:21:01,113
I might have an extra sentence or something.

1802
02:21:01,133 --> 02:21:01,173
Uh,

1803
02:21:03,218 --> 02:21:04,138
but I'll read what I can.

1804
02:21:04,158 --> 02:21:08,160
What kind of information, Jim, is part of this motion to move it to a subgroup?

1805
02:21:09,761 --> 02:21:10,502
To accept it.

1806
02:21:12,643 --> 02:21:15,724
And move it to a subgroup for wordsmithing, or is it done?

1807
02:21:18,646 --> 02:21:31,052
So I believe we're going to accept it, and then we'll have to... Yeah, we could do a separate motion on how to implement the motion that Hendrick has passed.

1808
02:21:31,818 --> 02:21:33,299
We're voting on a resolution, right?

1809
02:21:33,319 --> 02:21:33,920
Not a motion?

1810
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:36,181
Resolution, yes.

1811
02:21:37,763 --> 02:21:39,684
It's been motioned and seconded now.

1812
02:21:40,445 --> 02:21:49,452
Point of information, I think we're just voting on this resolution with the caveat, like we did last week, that it would be rewritten by Hendrick and his committee.

1813
02:21:54,335 --> 02:21:56,077
We would need a second motion to do that.

1814
02:21:56,917 --> 02:21:58,859
I mean, we can't vote on something that

1815
02:22:01,041 --> 02:22:02,722
we don't know what it is, right?

1816
02:22:02,802 --> 02:22:08,564
So if we delegate the task to a separate group, that can be a second motion.

1817
02:22:09,384 --> 02:22:11,565
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1818
02:22:11,645 --> 02:22:19,668
I thought the subcommittee was just to possibly reword the Google form, not the motion or the resolution, sorry.

1819
02:22:19,708 --> 02:22:23,389
All right, thank you.

1820
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:28,991
Correct, I think that's what we, just to reword the Google form and submit it to Lisa,

1821
02:22:31,252 --> 02:22:32,273
so that they can get it out.

1822
02:22:34,094 --> 02:22:35,075
We all agree on that?

1823
02:22:35,095 --> 02:22:38,657
All right, so now to pass the motion.

1824
02:22:41,019 --> 02:22:41,339
Reed?

1825
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:43,401
Can we hear the motion again though?

1826
02:22:43,861 --> 02:22:45,182
Yeah, I need to read it.

1827
02:22:45,202 --> 02:23:00,253
I just have to write the last sentence about the subcommittee will be formed to author the Google form for participation.

1828
02:23:01,835 --> 02:23:04,698
Who seconded Henrik's resolution?

1829
02:23:04,918 --> 02:23:05,319
Sorry.

1830
02:23:05,339 --> 02:23:07,701
He hasn't made it yet.

1831
02:23:08,482 --> 02:23:08,762
Okay.

1832
02:23:09,603 --> 02:23:14,949
So I will read the resolution as it is currently written.

1833
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:18,813
Resolution for public participation.

1834
02:23:20,091 --> 02:23:38,723
Whereas pursuant to the advisory committee's charge, the committee will hold at least one public hearing or issue one public input survey to solicit feedback on the options they are considering per the charge of this resolution as at least one of their meetings.

1835
02:23:39,936 --> 02:23:52,484
be it resolved that, one, once the committee has chosen 18 candidates from public submissions, the committee will issue one public input survey to solicit feedback.

1836
02:23:53,464 --> 02:23:53,664
Two.

1837
02:23:53,684 --> 02:23:53,764
Yeah.

1838
02:23:54,025 --> 02:23:55,926
Hold on, just one second.

1839
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:06,145
The survey shall be available as a Google form and as a paper version available at Medford High School.

1840
02:24:06,965 --> 02:24:10,287
The 18 candidates will be listed in alphabetical order.

1841
02:24:11,467 --> 02:24:15,690
There will be one week for the public to respond to the survey.

1842
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:24,375
Publicity of the survey shall be made through the administration via the channels that are already approved for publicity.

1843
02:24:25,525 --> 02:24:49,869
five, the survey shall include the name of the community member, the address of the community member, which one of the 18 names they are writing to support or argue against, and an essay of no more than 250 words addressing why the committee should include their candidate in the group of up to three submissions to the school committee.

1844
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:52,950
I just realized that that sentence doesn't make sense.

1845
02:24:55,607 --> 02:25:03,429
I thought that we had pursuant to Melissa's friendly amendment change the word essay to I believe statement.

1846
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:07,410
Yes, I changed it in one other.

1847
02:25:08,651 --> 02:25:11,112
Place but not in this place, hang on.

1848
02:25:12,912 --> 02:25:13,732
A statement.

1849
02:25:15,813 --> 02:25:19,934
Of no more than 250 words addressing why the committee.

1850
02:25:21,214 --> 02:25:22,475
Should or should not.

1851
02:25:26,936 --> 02:25:31,498
include their candidate in the group of up to three submissions to the school committee.

1852
02:25:32,518 --> 02:25:38,241
Residents, employees of Medford Public Schools and other Medford community members may submit.

1853
02:25:39,321 --> 02:25:40,702
Medford community members

1854
02:25:41,928 --> 02:25:54,576
may submit only one written persuasive statement supporting or arguing against their candidate of choice.

1855
02:25:55,596 --> 02:26:01,840
Survey results shall not be considered votes, but they will be considered individually on their own merits.

1856
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:06,923
A subcommittee will be formed to author the Google form for participation.

1857
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:13,621
Can we add who's on the subcommittee?

1858
02:26:16,784 --> 02:26:17,204
Uh, sure.

1859
02:26:19,726 --> 02:26:25,511
Um, I, I heard Maria volunteer and Brie volunteer.

1860
02:26:25,531 --> 02:26:28,713
Is that right, Jim?

1861
02:26:28,753 --> 02:26:30,134
It was Maria and Brie only.

1862
02:26:30,715 --> 02:26:32,777
Anybody else want to volunteer for that subcommittee?

1863
02:26:33,537 --> 02:26:34,678
I would like to volunteer.

1864
02:26:35,999 --> 02:26:36,319
Okay.

1865
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:38,341
So Josie too.

1866
02:26:39,222 --> 02:26:39,582
Okay.

1867
02:26:43,685 --> 02:26:46,587
and they're gonna create that Google form and get it to Lisa.

1868
02:26:51,491 --> 02:26:51,851
Okay.

1869
02:26:52,512 --> 02:26:55,134
Jim, this is Melissa, point of information.

1870
02:26:55,214 --> 02:26:58,196
I'd like the committee to look at that form before they submit it, please.

1871
02:26:59,797 --> 02:27:00,057
Sure.

1872
02:27:00,457 --> 02:27:03,620
I'm not comfortable with just being submitted without the whole thing.

1873
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:13,147
So that's the committee, put it on the Google documents for us to just look at it before it goes to Lisa.

1874
02:27:16,364 --> 02:27:17,325
I don't have information.

1875
02:27:17,365 --> 02:27:21,468
I just think the only thing we can edit is clerical stuff.

1876
02:27:21,589 --> 02:27:22,930
We can't change the substance.

1877
02:27:23,310 --> 02:27:23,510
Right.

1878
02:27:25,291 --> 02:27:25,932
Just to see it.

1879
02:27:26,552 --> 02:27:27,613
So we're all in the loop.

1880
02:27:28,774 --> 02:27:33,858
I think that it would be all the work for that would be done in the shared drive anyway.

1881
02:27:34,299 --> 02:27:34,559
Yes.

1882
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:43,506
As soon as we're finished with a decent draft, we'll send out an email letting everybody know with the link.

1883
02:27:46,904 --> 02:27:55,027
and hopefully people will be able to go over it and get back quickly.

1884
02:27:55,567 --> 02:28:03,249
I think there's a way with Google, if people have access, they can make comments and it comes up on the side for everybody to see and then the authors accept it or not.

1885
02:28:04,430 --> 02:28:06,990
Okay.

1886
02:28:07,190 --> 02:28:09,011
Bri, you're shaking your head, is that right, do you agree?

1887
02:28:11,112 --> 02:28:11,372
Okay.

1888
02:28:11,932 --> 02:28:15,353
We will use commentary

1889
02:28:16,686 --> 02:28:18,447
from committee.

1890
02:28:19,027 --> 02:28:20,207
Point of order, Mr. Chair.

1891
02:28:20,768 --> 02:28:31,092
The concern is what Ron brought up is that if we're having extensive discussion about this form, we risk violating open meeting law.

1892
02:28:31,252 --> 02:28:38,695
More than 12 people or 12 people or more from this group comment, it could be considered that it's an open meeting.

1893
02:28:40,456 --> 02:28:43,917
I believe that's how we understand open meeting law.

1894
02:28:48,164 --> 02:28:57,668
So, I mean- I would think that the submissions would be to the committee, the subcommittee that's preparing the document for us.

1895
02:28:58,269 --> 02:29:10,274
It wouldn't be a group discussion, wouldn't be, and no one should be discussing the documents in the comments with anybody other than the committee that's making this document for us.

1896
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:37,278
From a point of information, speaking to that open meeting law, from what I understand, if you have a concern over whether or not the form itself is going to be appropriate, then get on the subcommittee and take a look at it, because the subcommittee is what we're voting on in order to do the work.

1897
02:29:38,999 --> 02:29:40,381
We're specifically delegating

1898
02:29:41,546 --> 02:29:46,911
our authority to them in order to get this administrative form.

1899
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:51,475
Melissa, do you want to join the committee?

1900
02:29:52,436 --> 02:29:55,738
Melissa, would you like to be part of the subcommittee?

1901
02:29:58,681 --> 02:29:58,941
Yes.

1902
02:30:00,463 --> 02:30:00,743
Okay.

1903
02:30:11,952 --> 02:30:25,486
Okay, so I have changed the last sentence to be a subcommittee will be formed to author the Google form that's for participation.

1904
02:30:25,506 --> 02:30:34,055
Hendrick Gideons, Maria Rocha, Josie Dufour, Brie Brothers, and Melissa Miguel will be the subcommittee members.

1905
02:30:41,915 --> 02:30:43,856
I'd like to move the amendment, vote on the amendment.

1906
02:30:44,836 --> 02:30:45,657
I'd like to second that.

1907
02:30:50,138 --> 02:30:55,400
Actually, that requires a two-thirds vote to move it.

1908
02:30:58,322 --> 02:31:00,803
Well, we have to vote on the amendment, correct?

1909
02:31:01,063 --> 02:31:02,944
Hopefully, we just vote instead of moving it.

1910
02:31:07,045 --> 02:31:08,266
I'm totally lost.

1911
02:31:09,546 --> 02:31:10,166
I'm muted.

1912
02:31:10,447 --> 02:31:11,347
Jim, you're muted.

1913
02:31:16,298 --> 02:31:23,423
I didn't understand what was just... No, Ron had said procedurally that he moves the question and that requires a two thirds vote.

1914
02:31:23,463 --> 02:31:25,945
So I don't think there's any further comment here.

1915
02:31:26,025 --> 02:31:28,407
So I don't think we need to do a roll call of two thirds.

1916
02:31:28,727 --> 02:31:29,227
I agree.

1917
02:31:31,549 --> 02:31:31,869
Okay.

1918
02:31:34,551 --> 02:31:35,652
Okay, so where are we?

1919
02:31:36,653 --> 02:31:37,673
Voting on the amendments.

1920
02:31:38,034 --> 02:31:38,854
Okay.

1921
02:31:38,974 --> 02:31:39,515
On the amendment.

1922
02:31:40,435 --> 02:31:41,476
What is the amendment?

1923
02:31:43,598 --> 02:31:44,879
Was Lou's amendment to

1924
02:31:45,925 --> 02:31:46,866
No, we voted.

1925
02:31:46,986 --> 02:31:50,168
No, the amendment is the committee.

1926
02:31:50,268 --> 02:31:54,231
This is the resolution that we're voting on right now, the original.

1927
02:31:54,271 --> 02:31:56,172
Somebody said amendment, then left me lost.

1928
02:31:56,232 --> 02:31:59,674
I just assumed that the committee piece was an amendment.

1929
02:31:59,774 --> 02:32:03,077
Friendly amendment is modified by the person proposing it.

1930
02:32:03,317 --> 02:32:03,537
Got it.

1931
02:32:03,577 --> 02:32:04,998
All right.

1932
02:32:05,258 --> 02:32:06,879
On the resolution, on the motion.

1933
02:32:08,921 --> 02:32:09,701
Three brothers.

1934
02:32:10,782 --> 02:32:11,022
Yes.

1935
02:32:12,983 --> 02:32:13,824
Ian Puccio.

1936
02:32:14,504 --> 02:32:14,805
Yes.

1937
02:32:18,025 --> 02:32:18,885
Erin Genia.

1938
02:32:19,946 --> 02:32:20,226
Yes.

1939
02:32:21,606 --> 02:32:22,327
Beth Fuller.

1940
02:32:22,727 --> 02:32:22,967
Yes.

1941
02:32:24,827 --> 02:32:25,748
Grace Caldera.

1942
02:32:29,369 --> 02:32:29,789
She's left.

1943
02:32:29,809 --> 02:32:30,249
She's gone.

1944
02:32:30,269 --> 02:32:31,070
She's gone.

1945
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:31,630
OK.

1946
02:32:32,910 --> 02:32:33,310
Henrik.

1947
02:32:33,951 --> 02:32:34,231
Yes.

1948
02:32:36,812 --> 02:32:37,432
Jim Lusta.

1949
02:32:37,452 --> 02:32:37,812
Yes.

1950
02:32:39,012 --> 02:32:39,813
Kenneth Mallon.

1951
02:32:40,373 --> 02:32:40,633
Yes.

1952
02:32:43,034 --> 02:32:43,534
Kristen.

1953
02:32:44,334 --> 02:32:44,574
Yes.

1954
02:32:46,095 --> 02:32:46,475
Laura.

1955
02:32:47,755 --> 02:32:48,476
Oh, yes.

1956
02:32:50,457 --> 02:32:50,997
Leroy?

1957
02:32:51,698 --> 02:32:51,998
Yes.

1958
02:32:53,659 --> 02:32:53,979
Lou?

1959
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:54,640
Yes.

1960
02:32:56,401 --> 02:32:56,901
Maria?

1961
02:32:57,662 --> 02:32:57,942
Yes.

1962
02:32:59,803 --> 02:33:00,364
Melissa?

1963
02:33:01,244 --> 02:33:01,505
Yes.

1964
02:33:03,046 --> 02:33:03,346
Pat?

1965
02:33:04,186 --> 02:33:04,307
Aye.

1966
02:33:07,509 --> 02:33:07,929
Paul?

1967
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:10,411
Paul's still here.

1968
02:33:12,592 --> 02:33:14,013
He's giving two thumbs up.

1969
02:33:14,574 --> 02:33:14,874
All right.

1970
02:33:14,894 --> 02:33:16,135
I don't have him on my screen.

1971
02:33:16,175 --> 02:33:16,455
Sorry.

1972
02:33:18,181 --> 02:33:18,541
Ron?

1973
02:33:19,121 --> 02:33:19,482
Yes.

1974
02:33:20,842 --> 02:33:21,182
Seth?

1975
02:33:22,223 --> 02:33:22,463
Yes.

1976
02:33:24,643 --> 02:33:25,424
Kathy Kay?

1977
02:33:26,324 --> 02:33:26,824
Yes, please.

1978
02:33:28,605 --> 02:33:29,125
Matthew?

1979
02:33:29,805 --> 02:33:30,065
Yes.

1980
02:33:31,586 --> 02:33:32,086
Kaitlin?

1981
02:33:32,967 --> 02:33:33,247
Yes.

1982
02:33:34,747 --> 02:33:35,207
Janelle?

1983
02:33:36,528 --> 02:33:36,748
Yes.

1984
02:33:38,409 --> 02:33:39,049
And Josie?

1985
02:33:39,989 --> 02:33:40,229
Yes.

1986
02:33:41,710 --> 02:33:41,990
Okay.

1987
02:33:43,731 --> 02:33:44,351
I think we have

1988
02:33:47,521 --> 02:33:48,262
22 yeses.

1989
02:33:51,524 --> 02:33:52,385
All right, thank you.

1990
02:33:53,966 --> 02:33:54,667
That passes.

1991
02:33:54,687 --> 02:34:00,051
So the next resolution, I don't have it written in front of me.

1992
02:34:06,277 --> 02:34:15,044
I believe it's, I don't know why I have it, I can't find it, but it was to have the principal, Kathy,

1993
02:34:16,255 --> 02:34:27,500
hold an election at the school with our top 18 now for the students to cast their votes.

1994
02:34:33,683 --> 02:34:36,584
I don't see that on the agenda at all.

1995
02:34:37,304 --> 02:34:38,485
Does anybody else?

1996
02:34:38,505 --> 02:34:45,148
I don't have it either.

1997
02:34:45,613 --> 02:34:49,236
It's not in writing, but it can be brought up as a motion under new business.

1998
02:34:49,416 --> 02:34:51,337
All right, I'll bring it up in the new business.

1999
02:34:51,437 --> 02:34:58,462
I spoke to Susie, and I thought that she was going to put it on for me.

2000
02:34:59,283 --> 02:35:03,025
All right, so on the new business, was there anything else here for us?

2001
02:35:07,329 --> 02:35:09,690
OK, can I bring that up on the new business?

2002
02:35:11,151 --> 02:35:14,073
Sorry, I had one question before new business.

2003
02:35:14,494 --> 02:35:14,774
Go ahead.

2004
02:35:16,896 --> 02:35:19,037
Have we defined a timeline for the subcommittee?

2005
02:35:19,477 --> 02:35:23,879
Is there a deadline for us to have something for the rest of the committee to look at?

2006
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:28,922
Well, didn't we say it would only take a day or two?

2007
02:35:29,582 --> 02:35:32,504
You thought you girls could take care of it quickly for us.

2008
02:35:33,244 --> 02:35:33,804
Oh, I can.

2009
02:35:34,224 --> 02:35:34,645
We can.

2010
02:35:34,665 --> 02:35:38,006
I just, I didn't know if we wanted to formalize it.

2011
02:35:39,327 --> 02:35:39,647
Okay.

2012
02:35:39,967 --> 02:35:41,308
So today's Tuesday.

2013
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:44,441
You'll have it by Thursday.

2014
02:35:44,461 --> 02:35:59,102
So, my understanding was that Melissa was had joined the group so that we, we would let people know what it was that we had done, but that being on the committee.

2015
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:05,252
would correct me if I'm wrong, Melissa.

2016
02:36:05,272 --> 02:36:07,472
I'm just kind of paraphrasing.

2017
02:36:07,812 --> 02:36:12,994
Yeah, there's no need for this committee to discuss the form.

2018
02:36:13,394 --> 02:36:14,355
We'll make it available.

2019
02:36:14,555 --> 02:36:16,896
As soon as the committee can have it ready.

2020
02:36:18,897 --> 02:36:19,177
OK.

2021
02:36:21,337 --> 02:36:21,758
Thank you.

2022
02:36:24,659 --> 02:36:25,019
OK.

2023
02:36:26,459 --> 02:36:26,999
Anything else?

2024
02:36:27,019 --> 02:36:28,180
Am I missing any hands?

2025
02:36:29,186 --> 02:36:44,434
Yeah, I just, I don't know if this is new business or resolution, but can you Mr. Lister explain to me where this new, this resolution of the Columbus students having a vote, where did that come from?

2026
02:36:45,275 --> 02:36:49,337
So it's not a binding, it's a,

2027
02:36:52,219 --> 02:37:02,285
I don't want to say mock, but it was to give the students some input as to, it was felt early on that the students should have play a role in this somehow.

2028
02:37:02,825 --> 02:37:04,346
Where did this originate from?

2029
02:37:04,947 --> 02:37:08,549
I understand what you're saying, but where did the idea originate from?

2030
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:12,391
So I don't, you know what, I don't know exactly.

2031
02:37:12,912 --> 02:37:17,735
I discussed it with a few people and I put the resolution forward.

2032
02:37:18,777 --> 02:37:20,398
Okay, so it's coming from you.

2033
02:37:20,719 --> 02:37:27,784
I think it might have also been stated by Paul Rousseau in the school committee paperwork, I think.

2034
02:37:29,225 --> 02:37:34,149
But I'm not, I don't know for certain, 100%, I don't have it in front of me to be, you know.

2035
02:37:34,669 --> 02:37:48,320
It was discussed, when I was told, when I was discussed taking the chair and I was, you know, it was one of the thoughts that we were talking about was, and I thought it came from the school committee.

2036
02:37:49,052 --> 02:37:51,474
So yes, that's where it came, as far as I'm concerned.

2037
02:37:53,135 --> 02:37:57,378
Mr. Chairman, I don't know if we have control over this resolution.

2038
02:37:57,398 --> 02:38:06,444
I would certainly think we have the control to ask the school to do it, but where it's non-binding and it's not part of this committee, I think it's great information.

2039
02:38:06,464 --> 02:38:12,848
I would love to have that done by Columbus School, but it's not something that we can enforce as a committee, I don't think.

2040
02:38:14,104 --> 02:38:16,165
And I was point of information as well.

2041
02:38:16,245 --> 02:38:23,590
I would also like to request that whatever information gathering we've we've got on these 18 names were shared with me so I can share them with the teachers.

2042
02:38:24,571 --> 02:38:40,064
because as already been stated this evening, I mean, I learned a lot about the people that I vetted that I never would have known, but I can't expect the teachers to take the time, it's MCAS time and we have a quick turnaround to be able to do all the research that we've already done.

2043
02:38:40,965 --> 02:38:53,315
So perhaps if we could put together some kind of document that I could then share with the staff that they could then instruct the students, give them a little feedback that we have, where they're not just blindly voting for a name, if that makes sense.

2044
02:38:55,705 --> 02:38:58,846
Okay.

2045
02:38:59,126 --> 02:39:04,468
I don't have a proposal or resolution for this, but I'm on 18 names seems like a lot.

2046
02:39:04,688 --> 02:39:18,052
And I'm just wondering if, I mean, given just the time tonight, I like the idea of them having a vote, but maybe further along in the process when we, when we could prepare that kind of document for a shorter list.

2047
02:39:18,712 --> 02:39:18,912
Yeah.

2048
02:39:19,192 --> 02:39:19,953
Point of information.

2049
02:39:20,033 --> 02:39:21,733
I agree with Mr. Leflore.

2050
02:39:21,773 --> 02:39:24,234
I mean, if we had a smaller set of numbers,

2051
02:39:25,482 --> 02:39:27,604
has more information down the road.

2052
02:39:27,724 --> 02:39:28,544
Okay.

2053
02:39:28,644 --> 02:39:33,948
I'll withdraw that motion till after we complete next week's work.

2054
02:39:37,751 --> 02:39:38,171
Okay.

2055
02:39:39,512 --> 02:39:40,413
I got a few hands up.

2056
02:39:40,473 --> 02:39:40,954
I'm sorry.

2057
02:39:41,674 --> 02:39:42,235
One hand up.

2058
02:39:42,255 --> 02:39:43,876
A couple of thumbs, one hand up.

2059
02:39:50,959 --> 02:40:03,925
Yeah, yes, I think my concern about us putting forward like a narrative to people, I'm really concerned that we'd be too influential.

2060
02:40:05,565 --> 02:40:10,788
We would have to agree among ourselves about what 18 statements we're providing to people.

2061
02:40:12,809 --> 02:40:17,771
Otherwise, I could put a glowing thing together for my top choice and

2062
02:40:19,071 --> 02:40:24,373
something terrible together for somebody else that I don't think should get it, right?

2063
02:40:24,473 --> 02:40:39,697
So it's just, I think if people are concerned enough that they need to take the time to do a little bit of research, I don't think anyone's busier than most of the folks on this call.

2064
02:40:41,077 --> 02:40:42,938
But I don't see the children being able to do that.

2065
02:40:43,238 --> 02:40:44,238
It's K through five.

2066
02:40:45,950 --> 02:40:47,031
They just don't have the ability.

2067
02:40:47,051 --> 02:40:49,492
And then it's gonna be their parent influence.

2068
02:40:49,812 --> 02:40:52,814
And now we're not really getting a vote from the children, possibly.

2069
02:40:53,414 --> 02:40:57,836
Yeah, I mean, those are great points, I guess.

2070
02:40:58,057 --> 02:41:03,219
I just don't know, absent us doing 18 narratives and agreeing to 18 narratives,

2071
02:41:07,728 --> 02:41:08,768
how we do that, so.

2072
02:41:08,868 --> 02:41:23,211
It could be a list of links for people to follow, and then they get to evaluate for themselves whether or not they think that the link, the content of the link is legit or not, maybe.

2073
02:41:24,012 --> 02:41:30,173
And I think the idea that was raised before about narrowing down the list a little bit before we give it to the kids is a really good one.

2074
02:41:31,343 --> 02:41:35,925
because then it's not as much work to have the kids learn.

2075
02:41:40,347 --> 02:41:58,056
I was just gonna kind of reiterate that I think it should be a shorter list for the students to see with information, even if it was just very factual, like this person lived in Medford, something very basic for the students to kind of understand before they vote.

2076
02:41:58,556 --> 02:42:00,817
But definitely a smaller than 18, I think would be key.

2077
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:02,711
Okay, I agree.

2078
02:42:04,511 --> 02:42:04,892
Thank you.

2079
02:42:07,293 --> 02:42:07,613
Ron?

2080
02:42:11,695 --> 02:42:14,756
Again, I don't think it's in our purview as a committee.

2081
02:42:14,876 --> 02:42:21,679
I think Principal Kaye can ask for any resources she wants and creates a survey and gets us that information on her rules.

2082
02:42:22,199 --> 02:42:25,901
I don't think we should be declaring how the school should run their own survey.

2083
02:42:25,981 --> 02:42:28,242
So I don't think that this is

2084
02:42:29,187 --> 02:42:31,648
a resolution for this group where it's gonna be non-binding.

2085
02:42:33,349 --> 02:42:42,253
Principal K could simply conduct the survey on her own with their own rules and submit a submission to the site and tell us what the results were.

2086
02:42:42,714 --> 02:42:52,838
So I don't wanna, I think back to Patrick's point, I don't wanna influence it in any way and make it, put our name on it as sanctioned because we said it.

2087
02:42:52,978 --> 02:42:54,279
So that's my opinion.

2088
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:55,980
Okay.

2089
02:42:56,450 --> 02:42:59,272
Dan's had his hand up quite a while.

2090
02:42:59,632 --> 02:43:00,493
I'm sorry, Dan.

2091
02:43:00,553 --> 02:43:01,353
Go ahead.

2092
02:43:01,974 --> 02:43:03,975
Thank you, Hendrick.

2093
02:43:04,575 --> 02:43:06,016
I just want to make a quick comment.

2094
02:43:07,397 --> 02:43:15,402
As far as the kids in the school go, a good point was made about them getting influence from their parents.

2095
02:43:16,823 --> 02:43:19,765
One of the things that I'm personally concerned with is

2096
02:43:21,712 --> 02:43:28,677
can we receive any backlash from some of the parents that don't want their children involved in this process?

2097
02:43:29,278 --> 02:43:33,581
I'm sure there's folks in that school that were against all of this.

2098
02:43:33,861 --> 02:43:35,122
I mean, how do we handle that?

2099
02:43:36,143 --> 02:43:37,744
Do we need to come up with a plan for that?

2100
02:43:37,805 --> 02:43:46,532
Or are we gonna just kind of shoot from the hip and assume everybody wants participation and changing this name?

2101
02:43:47,359 --> 02:43:53,661
Personally, I mean, I've talked to a handful of people that felt negatively from that school community about it.

2102
02:43:54,981 --> 02:43:57,342
Is this something that we should probably discuss?

2103
02:43:59,783 --> 02:44:00,783
Defer to the principal.

2104
02:44:03,684 --> 02:44:08,045
So I would like to say that normally when we do things like this in the school, it's voluntary.

2105
02:44:09,087 --> 02:44:12,068
If the students don't want to participate, they do not have to.

2106
02:44:12,088 --> 02:44:18,890
And we put it out to everyone and probably I would use a Google form as well with the names.

2107
02:44:19,951 --> 02:44:24,592
But I do just wanna state again, as everybody has said, it's a very busy time of year.

2108
02:44:24,612 --> 02:44:29,694
And I'm not asking for statements of opinion about the people.

2109
02:44:29,834 --> 02:44:33,235
When I vetted my names, I went to websites and I just copied and pasted

2110
02:44:33,917 --> 02:44:40,082
you know, lots of dialogue that I took from other people that helped me make my decisions on how I voted.

2111
02:44:40,202 --> 02:44:51,751
And so I'm just looking for a biographical type thing because I think it's, we're not gonna get what we want from the kids if we don't give that information to the teachers and they have to look it up on their own.

2112
02:44:51,791 --> 02:44:53,072
It's just gonna be much more cumbersome.

2113
02:44:56,374 --> 02:44:56,575
Okay.

2114
02:45:00,438 --> 02:45:03,480
So we've agreed to table that anyway until next meeting.

2115
02:45:07,468 --> 02:45:08,588
So is there anything else?

2116
02:45:09,949 --> 02:45:11,749
I have a quick question for the group.

2117
02:45:13,130 --> 02:45:16,851
An envelope was left in my mailbox about one of our nominees.

2118
02:45:17,211 --> 02:45:18,692
It's about 13 pages.

2119
02:45:18,712 --> 02:45:22,353
I have it, was given to me, I guess.

2120
02:45:22,813 --> 02:45:24,514
It's not one of my nominees.

2121
02:45:24,594 --> 02:45:25,794
It's not anybody I know.

2122
02:45:26,514 --> 02:45:29,875
Does the group want me to submit this to Susan so you can all see it?

2123
02:45:30,415 --> 02:45:31,936
Or do you want me to just hold on to it?

2124
02:45:33,351 --> 02:45:35,692
I've already scanned it in, so it'd be nothing to do.

2125
02:45:36,072 --> 02:45:38,453
It's an envelope, it says Ron on the envelope.

2126
02:45:39,213 --> 02:45:40,353
That's super creepy.

2127
02:45:40,773 --> 02:45:48,956
Yeah, so there's 13 or 14 pages here from what appears to be people who know this person very well.

2128
02:45:49,656 --> 02:45:51,817
Would you wanna see it or do you wanna go through the process?

2129
02:45:51,857 --> 02:45:52,857
I'll leave it up to you guys.

2130
02:45:54,198 --> 02:45:56,479
Is it a person that's on the top 18, Ron?

2131
02:45:57,019 --> 02:45:57,219
Yes.

2132
02:46:01,552 --> 02:46:06,576
I'm just not, I'm not gonna send it if somebody doesn't want it, but I can put it on, you can get it put on the Sierra Drive.

2133
02:46:07,056 --> 02:46:07,617
I'm curious.

2134
02:46:08,197 --> 02:46:09,318
Can I ask a question?

2135
02:46:10,599 --> 02:46:11,820
Yes.

2136
02:46:13,522 --> 02:46:18,165
In a situation like that, would that be considered like additional public comment?

2137
02:46:18,245 --> 02:46:24,330
And I know in all of the meetings I attend, when you make a public comment, you're supposed to say your name and your address.

2138
02:46:25,171 --> 02:46:26,072
The names are on here.

2139
02:46:26,637 --> 02:46:29,159
Oh, the person who gave it to his name is on there.

2140
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:32,242
No, that was my question.

2141
02:46:32,442 --> 02:46:40,950
Like, it's a very well, I'm literally asking, I don't know the answer is anonymous commenting aloud from there are names.

2142
02:46:42,910 --> 02:46:47,373
There are no addresses, but like I said, I don't want to- That's a little creepy.

2143
02:46:48,454 --> 02:46:58,060
Well, it's not as creepy as I'm making it sound, but somebody concerned sent it to me, and I don't know this person, and I have this information.

2144
02:46:58,121 --> 02:47:01,063
It's quality information, and it looks like it's all vetted.

2145
02:47:01,383 --> 02:47:06,566
It looks like it could help you all, in my opinion, but if you want me to hold on to it, I'll hold on to it.

2146
02:47:06,947 --> 02:47:09,849
And please, the public, no more to my house.

2147
02:47:13,852 --> 02:47:17,294
Anyways, maybe you should just summarize it for us, but not now.

2148
02:47:18,074 --> 02:47:25,238
Well, you gotta, I mean, so just, I don't even, do you want to see it or you don't want to see it?

2149
02:47:25,298 --> 02:47:29,540
No, I don't think through open meeting, I don't think we can from a point of order.

2150
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:41,066
I mean, if this is, we had specifically time periods where we solicited public input,

2151
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:42,881
This is not a new name.

2152
02:47:44,442 --> 02:47:47,605
This would be under the category of what we're doing now with the survey, so.

2153
02:47:48,145 --> 02:47:56,532
Right, but it's outside of the methods that we have agreed to as a group.

2154
02:47:56,713 --> 02:47:57,994
I think it's out of order, Ryan.

2155
02:47:58,574 --> 02:47:58,834
Fine.

2156
02:47:58,854 --> 02:47:59,715
All right.

2157
02:48:01,717 --> 02:48:02,958
Patrick, would you like to speak?

2158
02:48:03,980 --> 02:48:19,673
Just briefly, I know we said this will be a discussion for later, but I think that what we need to think about before we send out a vote is, is this committee ready to go against a vote of the students, right?

2159
02:48:19,693 --> 02:48:25,838
So if we send out a vote and one of the name, the majority name that's picked is not one of our three,

2160
02:48:27,388 --> 02:48:41,091
or, you know, if they pick- I think it's just, it's non-binding and it's just- Right, but I'm just saying the public, I mean, the public face of it, right, is the kids vote and, you know, our number one pick wasn't submitted, right?

2161
02:48:41,151 --> 02:48:44,952
So that's a potential, you know, a potential issue there.

2162
02:48:44,992 --> 02:48:48,933
I'm not- The potential of the survey that we're putting out to the city doing the same thing.

2163
02:48:50,453 --> 02:48:51,554
That's why we're picking three.

2164
02:48:52,254 --> 02:48:52,394
Okay.

2165
02:48:53,220 --> 02:49:12,207
I think in some of the discussions I had with some of the committee members, if I may, sorry, Mr. Lister, was that perhaps the name, the one name that got the most votes at the elementary school would come forward to the committee and that we would then put that forward with whatever we put forward to the school committee.

2166
02:49:13,628 --> 02:49:15,108
I don't know if that's binding or not.

2167
02:49:15,148 --> 02:49:17,209
And it was just some discussions I had back and forth.

2168
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:21,611
And that way the kids would feel heard

2169
02:49:22,503 --> 02:49:31,526
in a sense, but if the name wasn't chosen by the committee overall, the school committee, it would be one of the ones we put forward and then it rested in their hands.

2170
02:49:31,546 --> 02:49:33,086
So it would be like four names.

2171
02:49:34,387 --> 02:49:38,368
Well, I mean, we said up to three, right?

2172
02:49:39,028 --> 02:49:44,690
So if we pick three and we added theirs as the fourth and one of whatever they pick might be something that we would pick as well.

2173
02:49:44,710 --> 02:49:50,532
From a point of order that wasn't part of our founding documents.

2174
02:49:53,783 --> 02:49:59,285
I know, cause we, that's what I did discuss was if the kids are going to vote for a name, oftentimes they're going to think it's the winner.

2175
02:50:00,166 --> 02:50:01,326
You know, they're, they're little kids.

2176
02:50:01,346 --> 02:50:04,667
They think if they all vote and they choose the name, it's like, Oh, we picked the name of the school.

2177
02:50:04,768 --> 02:50:13,831
And so we wanted it to be a child friendly so that they understood when they were involved, it might not necessarily be the name that's chosen for the school.

2178
02:50:14,331 --> 02:50:15,292
And that would have to be clear.

2179
02:50:17,793 --> 02:50:23,095
I think when we get down to three names, that's when we should present to the kids, the three names.

2180
02:50:24,428 --> 02:50:31,833
And then present that information to the school committee saying here are three names that the committee came up with.

2181
02:50:32,453 --> 02:50:34,574
And by the way, here's what the kids voted on.

2182
02:50:34,794 --> 02:50:38,237
It's one of our three names or it's a fourth you might want to consider.

2183
02:50:38,537 --> 02:50:38,877
I don't know.

2184
02:50:41,779 --> 02:50:44,961
This point of information, we've tabled this till next week.

2185
02:50:45,021 --> 02:50:46,902
So maybe we can have that discussion next week.

2186
02:50:48,263 --> 02:50:48,503
Yeah.

2187
02:50:48,523 --> 02:50:48,723
Okay.

2188
02:50:53,833 --> 02:50:54,433
Or anything else?

2189
02:50:56,034 --> 02:50:56,715
I see hands.

2190
02:50:58,876 --> 02:51:01,897
Uh, Laura.

2191
02:51:06,119 --> 02:51:06,320
Right.

2192
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:07,340
That was an old hand.

2193
02:51:08,281 --> 02:51:08,661
Okay.

2194
02:51:10,482 --> 02:51:10,722
All right.

2195
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:13,423
Paul.

2196
02:51:15,844 --> 02:51:20,627
Would you like to say something?

2197
02:51:24,115 --> 02:51:26,016
He says he can't unmute, that's what he said earlier.

2198
02:51:28,197 --> 02:51:29,178
Is Paul a co-host?

2199
02:51:30,639 --> 02:51:31,919
I am now, I guess, yes.

2200
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:32,940
Thank you.

2201
02:51:34,281 --> 02:51:34,861
I'm all set.

2202
02:51:36,382 --> 02:51:36,722
OK.

2203
02:51:38,443 --> 02:51:41,365
Ryan, is your hand still up, or do you want to speak again?

2204
02:51:41,385 --> 02:51:47,228
No, I've done enough.

2205
02:51:47,949 --> 02:51:48,209
All right.

2206
02:51:49,589 --> 02:51:50,230
Anybody else?

2207
02:51:54,513 --> 02:51:55,673
Is there anything else tonight?

2208
02:51:58,255 --> 02:51:59,715
Are we meeting again next Tuesday?

2209
02:51:59,735 --> 02:52:00,956
Or is the date not yet decided?

2210
02:52:02,936 --> 02:52:04,337
I'm not available next Tuesday.

2211
02:52:04,357 --> 02:52:06,118
I was hoping for next Thursday myself.

2212
02:52:06,138 --> 02:52:12,540
And I'm hoping that allows enough time for us to get a return on the public survey.

2213
02:52:14,881 --> 02:52:17,622
I'm personally not available next Thursday.

2214
02:52:19,643 --> 02:52:21,544
But if everybody else is then

2215
02:52:23,273 --> 02:52:28,236
Yeah, I'm not available next Thursday either, personally.

2216
02:52:28,256 --> 02:52:36,360
I don't know.

2217
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:41,002
Maybe we have to do another doodle poll.

2218
02:52:43,624 --> 02:52:44,284
We can do that.

2219
02:52:46,425 --> 02:52:49,507
We have to allow seven days for the survey to take place, right?

2220
02:52:54,868 --> 02:53:04,214
Okay, Mr. Mr. I'm assuming that after this meeting we start to that top 18 correct and get our in our numbers to Miss Weiss.

2221
02:53:05,115 --> 02:53:05,675
Good point.

2222
02:53:06,015 --> 02:53:06,516
Good point.

2223
02:53:06,596 --> 02:53:13,360
I guess if we're going to do another Yes, we're going to do another rubrics.

2224
02:53:14,221 --> 02:53:20,145
Um, we're not allowed to if we already voted to vote again on the same person.

2225
02:53:20,825 --> 02:53:21,085
Right.

2226
02:53:21,746 --> 02:53:23,207
So it would be the rest of them.

2227
02:53:23,707 --> 02:53:23,887
Right.

2228
02:53:25,010 --> 02:53:29,973
Are we not going to wait for the community input before we do that again?

2229
02:53:29,993 --> 02:53:36,516
In theory, we should, or at least be prepared to look at it once it comes in.

2230
02:53:37,496 --> 02:53:41,558
I mean, I don't... Yeah, why would we vote again without all that information?

2231
02:53:41,578 --> 02:53:45,320
They're going to give us more information that might sway our mind another way.

2232
02:53:45,761 --> 02:53:48,642
And we already know the 18 anyways, nothing's going to change.

2233
02:53:48,702 --> 02:53:50,323
If you rank them, it doesn't really matter.

2234
02:53:51,785 --> 02:53:52,145
Correct.

2235
02:53:52,165 --> 02:53:54,046
We can certainly start researching them.

2236
02:53:54,586 --> 02:53:56,306
Yeah, absolutely.

2237
02:53:56,326 --> 02:53:56,306
100%.

2238
02:53:56,366 --> 02:53:57,447
That can be done all the time.

2239
02:53:57,647 --> 02:53:57,867
Yeah.

2240
02:53:58,367 --> 02:53:58,627
Yes.

2241
02:54:01,368 --> 02:54:01,548
Okay.

2242
02:54:01,568 --> 02:54:03,708
Is there anything else?

2243
02:54:06,849 --> 02:54:08,050
Am I missing any more hands?

2244
02:54:09,610 --> 02:54:10,230
I don't see any.

2245
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:12,551
All right.

2246
02:54:12,711 --> 02:54:17,072
Unless someone else has something else, a motion to adjourn in order?

2247
02:54:18,733 --> 02:54:19,073
Second.

2248
02:54:21,578 --> 02:54:21,858
All right.

2249
02:54:22,179 --> 02:54:22,940
Thank you, everybody.

2250
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:24,902
Good night.

2251
02:54:25,042 --> 02:54:25,583
Thank you.

2252
02:54:25,883 --> 02:54:26,103
Night.

2253
02:54:26,143 --> 02:54:26,644
Thank you.

2254
02:54:26,724 --> 02:54:27,005
Thank you.
