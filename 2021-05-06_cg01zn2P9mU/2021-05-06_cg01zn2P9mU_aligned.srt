Good evening.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,110
Just waiting for member Rousseau.

Give him one more minute and then we'll begin.

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,932
I saw his name.

6
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:21,892
Oh, you did?

7
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:22,732
OK, I didn't see it.

8
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:23,592
There he is.

9
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:24,452
He's here.

10
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:25,592

and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

39
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:40,865
I know we have a number of our administrators on.

40
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:44,847
I'll turn it over to Mr. Murphy and Dr. Edward Vincent.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,140
Good evening, everyone.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,423
I just want to say today we're going to embark on our second budget presentation.

43
00:03:54,643 --> 00:04:07,289
And we will be hearing primarily from what's happening under our director, departments related to Joan Bowen, the Director of Pupil Services, and what is happening with special education.

44
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:15,072
Dave and his team, Michelle Kingdon and all the others in there have been working incredibly hard

45
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:18,714
And so I look forward again to today's presentation.

46
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:20,235
Thank you, Dave.

47
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:21,937
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

48
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:34,786
As the superintendent noted, tonight's second public budget meeting and committee of the whole is focused on our Office of Pupil Services led by Joan Bowen.

49
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:42,732
Members of her team will be joining her tonight as we walk through the budgetary priorities for FY 22.

50
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:44,713
The school committee did receive

51
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:51,091
several pieces of documentation related to tonight's presentation and those budgetary priorities.

52
00:04:52,032 --> 00:05:14,401
And as we did for the first budget meeting on Monday evening, when we focused on elementary and secondary school communities in the Medford Public Schools, we have a deck that I'll be putting up on the screen momentarily that is the same content as the information that the school committee has received and all of the documents related to tonight's presentation will be

53
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,547
uh, published on the Medford Public Schools website.

54
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:34,272
I will say, uh, as I, as I put this up on the screen, um, you'll, you'll see that several of the slides that we'll be sharing as part of this presentation are the same slides, excuse me, uh, are the same slides that we used on Monday evening.

55
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:43,575
And that's, uh, for the benefit of members of the community who are, um, either, uh, this is either they, they didn't see Monday evening or, um, they're watching this on tape.

56
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:44,775
We want to make sure that, um,

57
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:55,250
folks have as much context as possible and make sure that they understand where in the sequence of the budget development this presentation and this information is being conveyed.

58
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:08,174
That being said, given that I know that a large portion of the audience did see this information on Monday, I will move through these first several slides at a slightly more brisk pace.

59
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:14,536
But of course, if there are any questions or if there's anything you would like us to speak in greater detail about,

60
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:16,184
We'll be happy to do that.

61
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:22,205
So we said that tonight's presentation is on the Office of Pupil Services.

62
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:30,727
And if you look in the organizational chart, that essentially means tonight we're talking about the boxes on the far right of our organization.

63
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:43,329
And so you see there that Director Bowen oversees a number of offices and departments that are related to special education and some of the support services that are made available to students across the district.

64
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,959
And if I were to, Ms.

65
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,060
Bowne will speak momentarily.

66
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,507
And so if this is presumptuous of me characterizing or summarizing this before she speaks, I'll apologize.

67
00:06:54,548 --> 00:07:06,920
But I would say that if from a lay person's perspective, if I were to describe the Office of Pupil Services in one sentence, it would be that these are the offices that are charged with making sure that the educational opportunities

68
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:15,788
available to Medford Public Schools students are available to all Medford Public Schools students, and that there's equitable access in all of our various school communities.

69
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:30,619
And that while every educator, every staff member has this responsibility, the individuals who lead the offices that you'll be hearing from tonight are charged with making sure that we are meeting students where they are in meeting their needs and their educational needs, whatever they might be.

70
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,484
And so some of the values and strategic priorities that we talked about on Monday,

71
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:49,108
that are informing our budgetary proposals for our school communities very much have a nexus between that information and those priorities with the work that Joan's office is charged with doing.

72
00:07:49,848 --> 00:08:04,592
And it is for that reason that we are taking this evening to focus solely on the Office of Pupil Services before moving on to some of our other academic and operational areas over the course of the next couple of budget meetings.

73
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:18,336
With that, we'll go, again, we've talked about our budget sequence and the development of our goals and priorities and how that moves across these different lanes to get to the place where the superintendent makes a recommendation to the school committee.

74
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:23,539
The school committee then will take a vote that will serve as a request to the municipal government.

75
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,422
You've heard me say this many times, but I don't think it can be repeated enough.

76
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:35,267
And again, this is the simplified version as to where exactly in this budgetary development sequence that we are right now.

77
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,914
We, as the administration, are preparing the budget within two separate spheres.

78
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:53,181
We are developing and looking at all of our needs, and we do that by many, many meetings with all the different people representing the different departments, identifying what our priorities are, what our needs are.

79
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:55,803
We'll talk a little bit about how we frame them momentarily.

80
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:06,877
And then that is to go into the information necessary for the superintendent to make an informed recommendation and for the committee to make an authentic request with regard to the district's budgetary needs.

81
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:19,667
At the same time, we understand that the municipal government will ultimately make an appropriation that will take into account all of the various needs and priorities that the city of Medford has to, has to, uh, is, is accountable for.

82
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:25,372
And so, um, for that reason, we are simultaneously preparing a variety of contingencies

83
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:30,356
to make sure that we are able to operate the district with the appropriation that is ultimately made.

84
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:43,506
And so it is not the case that if an appropriation is made that is less than the request that is made by the school committee or the recommendation of the superintendent, that does not mean that we're going to fold the tent and decide we can't have school next year.

85
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:47,889
We're going to operate, we're going to operate effectively, and we're going to serve the interests of students.

86
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,894
And while this is a conversation that has to take place, and we have to develop these priorities in an authentic way,

87
00:09:54,448 --> 00:10:01,510
I think it's important that we also point out that we will be prepared to operate regardless of the circumstances under which we are operating.

88
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,811
Again, on that note, these are the funding sources.

89
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:12,453
If anyone wants to hear more about these, I would encourage you to watch any of the several meetings at which we've discussed this and shown this slide.

90
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:20,015
These are the three buckets in which the priority, we've asked our department leaders to develop our budgetary priorities.

91
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,956
First, identifying what our personnel and staffing needs

92
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:31,622
what our material and infrastructure needs and priorities, and what is the training and professional development that we needed, as well as some miscellaneous categories.

93
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:48,471
The committee knows, as you've heard many times, that we've asked everyone to develop the budgetary priorities primarily within the frame of how do we repair and rebuild damage caused by the COVID-19 disruption to students' instruction.

94
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:54,853
We know that students have gone through two very disruptive and nontraditional years of education.

95
00:10:54,873 --> 00:11:08,876
And while we're always looking to innovate and build toward the future at the same time, we want to make sure that we are taking into account all of the needs and challenges that have developed as a result of this substantial disruption in students' educational journey.

96
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:16,918
This, as we reported first on April 26th, is our projected budgetary growth for the year.

97
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,442
approximately $2.1 million in fixed costs.

98
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:24,384
That is a number that is somewhat fluid.

99
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:36,373
And as we'll talk about tonight, and particularly tonight because of some of the variables that are at issue within our special education arena, that $2.1 million could move.

100
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:42,938
We know that there are approximately $1 million in contractual compensation increases that are owed.

101
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:47,782
Those are your steps and lanes and your movement along the wage scale across all of our different bargaining units.

102
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:59,955
And then in those other two buckets, again, there are variables that could result in some fluidity, both with regard to strategic priorities that we have to weigh over the course of these discussions.

103
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:06,337
And also, we know that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring.

104
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:12,740
It is the result of their expirations that's keeping that number of fixed costs down at $2.1 million.

105
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,002
But we know that that does not include any potential compensation increases

106
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,662
that are yet to be negotiated.

107
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:26,166
And that's part of why we're saying right now, it is a range of 3.4 to $5.8 million.

108
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:41,174
Again, understanding that this is reflective of the needs and priorities as we see them by examining closely within the school district, recognizing that we will be prepared to operate regardless of what the appropriation ultimately is.

109
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:55,851
The other variable that distinguishes the FY22 budget from essentially all other budgets in previous fiscal years are the ESSER funding that is coming available, earmarked specifically for school districts from the federal government.

110
00:12:56,731 --> 00:13:06,479
We have two large buckets, relatively large buckets of ESSER funding that is available to the Medford Public Schools, estimated at $2.3 and $5.3 million, respectively.

111
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:09,121
I did, at the committee's request, provide

112
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:13,460
the state guidance that we've received related to restrictions on the ESSER II funding.

113
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,662
As you can see, there are restrictions, but they're pretty broad.

114
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:28,908
And as such, it's been incumbent upon us as we've built the FY22 budget to be simultaneously developing our budgetary priorities specific to our ESSER funding.

115
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:34,751
And so that is the bottom column in the budget narratives in each department and school that you've received.

116
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,693
And those are the priorities that we see, one, as having

117
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:45,583
a strong nexus between the need and what's precipitating the need related to the pandemic.

118
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:53,128
And it's also taking into account, to the extent that we can, the nature of the funding.

119
00:13:53,288 --> 00:14:02,215
And what I mean by that is whenever we develop a budget for a new fiscal year, we want to be mindful of recurring revenue sources and one-time revenue sources.

120
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,557
And ESSER is very much a one-time revenue source.

121
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:11,843
That was the case in ESSER I and the funding that was received in FY20 and FY21.

122
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:16,505
And that funding went largely toward infrastructure-type priorities.

123
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:21,466
So that is why we were able to make the $2.7 million investment in instructional technology.

124
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:26,187
It's why we were able to devote so much funding to our HVAC repairs and improvements.

125
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:30,168
That is typically what we want to use one-time funding for.

126
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,070
However, as we discussed on Monday, we also have to be cognizant

127
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,017
of the urgent educational needs of students.

128
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:52,806
And so it may well be the case that there will be an investment in personnel that is responsive to the ways in which the disruption to instruction has exacerbated the challenges that some of our students are facing.

129
00:14:53,366 --> 00:15:06,295
And we know that that means that we are essentially starting a timeline to either identify the efficiencies necessary to make those investments sustainable, or we have to view them as essentially temporary because

130
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:10,360
the ESSER funding is, by its nature, temporary.

131
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:30,390
So there are different paths that we can go, but it is the case that some of the recommendations, as you saw on Monday, will be that some limited amount of one-time funding will be used to try to bridge gaps in our personnel that have a strong nexus with the urgent needs of students coming out of the pandemic.

132
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:35,973
So as we move toward our discussion tonight about pupil services,

133
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:49,395
One of the other variables that really distinguishes the budgets of the departments that we're talking about tonight is that there is an extensive amount of external funding that supports these budgetary priorities.

134
00:15:49,955 --> 00:16:02,627
And I think if those of us who work in this field and develop these budgets, if we were starting, if we were writing education laws and education funding laws from scratch,

135
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:13,639
I think we probably would like to see a different sequence in terms of when some of the specifics related to this funding come into view.

136
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,183
We're developing an FY22 budget without knowing the level of support that we will have.

137
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:25,186
But by looking back at history, we have a sense as to what we can expect with regard to that extra funding.

138
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:25,947
And so Ms.

139
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,508
Bowman and I were talking earlier.

140
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:35,562
The term that we both agreed can apply to budgeting in a special education context is that it's a bit of a roller coaster.

141
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:46,170
You'll see as we go through the slides tonight that there are some potential significant increases from a budgetary perspective that are necessary in order to meet our needs.

142
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:56,258
I mentioned that a lot of, a fairly significant portion of our fixed costs, which has to do with both our emerging needs and with our compliance obligations

143
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,431
from a contractual perspective, live within the special education budget.

144
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:07,854
And so when you see those numbers, you can see that this is going to be a pressure point, and this is going to be a challenge from a budgetary perspective in FY22.

145
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:19,398
But when we go to this slide, we see that there's over $2 million that we can expect to receive in that external funding that will help offset the costs that live within the special education budget.

146
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,920
So that momentarily can sort of put our mind at ease, and we know that

147
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,000
Generally speaking, we have funding that's going to come through Circuit Breaker.

148
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,662
It's going to come through the IDEA grant and some of the other smaller sources.

149
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:47,668
However, the sort of the third leg of that roller coaster is that there are other variables that are beyond our control that could increase costs significantly at any point during the school year in order for us to meet our obligations to all students.

150
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:52,730
And so that is something that's a level of flexibility that we have to maintain

151
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:58,846
and a capacity that we have to understand can become exacerbated on very short notice.

152
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:03,289
And so that's why I say these numbers to some degree are fluid.

153
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:08,572
So that's a lot of background and context, and I appreciate your patience as I walk through that.

154
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:14,515
Believe it or not, that was my attempt to go through the slides that you've seen before in an expedited fashion.

155
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,216
So I will, as Ms.

156
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:19,618
Bowen begins walking us through some of the specific priorities

157
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:28,982
and initiatives that have been deemed necessary, I will go back and I'll check my clock and I'll see whether or not I was successful or not.

158
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:30,723
So, Ms.

159
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:32,885
Bowen, you're not up on my screen, but I'm sure that you're there.

160
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:46,716
And I know that you have members of your team representing certain offices that are under the auspices of the Office of Pupil Services, who will be helping you this evening go through some of these specific priorities.

161
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:49,138
And then we'll walk the committee through that.

162
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:56,510
And to the degree that there are specific questions or areas that the committee would like us to expand upon, we'll of course be happy to do that.

163
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,471
So Ms.

164
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,573
Bowen, how is that for an extended introduction?

165
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,654
That was right on point.

166
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,335
Thank you.

167
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:05,236
Good evening, everyone.

168
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:11,240
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee and members of the Medford community.

169
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:18,105
Before we get started, I just want to take a moment to express my appreciation to all the special education staff

170
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:19,407
throughout the district.

171
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:28,282
This past year, they have demonstrated professionalism, strength and compassion, while prioritizing the needs of our most vulnerable population.

172
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:32,989
I could not be more proud or more grateful to work with such dedicated staff.

173
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:43,608
As we get started, I want to go through these key priorities that have been identified and just present you a brief overview of them.

174
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:55,977
After I go through this list, there will be opportunities for Stacey Shulman, Tony Ray, and Craig Droschke to provide you with more insight to each of these priorities.

175
00:19:57,158 --> 00:20:07,268
So some of the key priorities for serving our most vulnerable and highest needs students is additional staffing capacity to meet both students' needs and compliance obligations.

176
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:11,592
We would like to have the ETL at the Andrews Middle School.

177
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:17,998
We would also like to add an additional connections classroom at the Roberts Elementary School.

178
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,922
This is in regards to, we will now have

179
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:34,570
Grades K to five, and we do not have any students that are rising sixth graders, so we will have a full program, and it will require an additional staff person.

180
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,254
Contracted services to address low incident student needs.

181
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:45,841
We'd like to shift some roles and responsibilities to allocate more direct support to our students.

182
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:53,562
We'd like sufficient school nursing staff at the McGlynn Elementary School, Middle School, and the Curtis Tufts.

183
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,463
And I believe that Ms.

184
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,744
Ray will speak more directly about this.

185
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,347
We'd like to provide more training to our paraprofessionals.

186
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:15,095
We're looking into them becoming registered behavioral therapists, which will help with the social emotional concerns and challenges that we see when students come back to school next school year.

187
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:21,233
We would also like to increase our behavioral specialist positions and Ms.

188
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:24,197
Stacey Shulman will be addressing that later on as well.

189
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:32,187
One of our biggest needs that we see in the district and most concerning is the need for

190
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:37,995
more teachers to be trained in Orton-Gillingham, and we would like that for all K-1 teachers.

191
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:47,109
This is also part of the new dyslexia guidelines that have come out, and it would just be able to strengthen the teachers' toolkits in regards to reading.

192
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:53,980
We'd also like to add a COVID testing coordinator, a Medicaid billing team.

193
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,743
This is extremely important as there's new regulations that need to be followed.

194
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:04,126
And it takes a whole team of people to be able to do this Medicaid building.

195
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:06,368
And as we are billing, I'm sorry.

196
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:13,853
And as we go through it, we're identifying team members, what it would look like and what it would cost the district to be able to do that.

197
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:20,659
The next is building based professional development at the Curtis tough school, and Mr Drowski will speak more to that.

198
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,695
Recovery high school enrollment support.

199
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:35,505
Every year we have one or two students who are enrolled at recovery high school, either in Boston, or I believe it's in Beverly, that the district is required to pay their tuition.

200
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:41,289
We would like to have this built into the budget for the following school years to support that.

201
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:47,114
And then also a 0.6 full-time employee school counselor to support

202
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:50,637
focused on students who are English learners.

203
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:51,978
So I believe Ms.

204
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:53,719
Schulman will also talk about that.

205
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,981
So I'm going to ask Ms.

206
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:02,145
Schulman if you'd like to talk about your priorities for your department.

207
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:04,747
Good evening.

208
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:09,090
I'll begin with discussing the behavioral specialist positions.

209
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:19,688
We all know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of social emotional need, not only for our students, but for our society at large.

210
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,613
I am anticipating a significant amount of behavioral support needed specifically at the elementary level.

211
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:40,643
Currently in the district, we have four full-time BCBAs that are supporting students throughout the district and one behavioral specialist that supports specifically the Columbus Elementary TLP program.

212
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:55,212
I would like to increase this to four behavioral specialists who would be part of the paraprofessionals unit to support students with oversight from BCBAs at each of the elementary schools.

213
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:58,566
Additionally, as Ms.

214
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:07,069
Bowen mentioned, for the past several years, we have had at least one high school student enroll in a recovery high school program.

215
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:13,672
Previously, we have not had a line item specified for that, so we'd have to pull from other funding.

216
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:24,980
Additionally, I would like to add a .6, so three days a week, of a school counselor at the middle school or high school level to support students who are English learners.

217
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:38,643
We have seen more than ever our English learners struggling in the school system, more than ever with the closure and pandemic, and it would be of great need to have someone dedicated specifically to those students and their unique needs.

218
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:39,424
Thank you.

219
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,245
Mr. A, would you like to go next?

220
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:47,546
Mayor.

221
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:47,746
Yes.

222
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:48,347
Yes.

223
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:48,847
Good evening.

224
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,448
Oh, excuse me, Mr Russo.

225
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:52,090
Member Russo.

226
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,733
Are we going to go all the way through before asking questions or are we going to do?

227
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,374
That would be my recommendation.

228
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,896
We have two additional speakers, Ms.

229
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:04,379
Ray representing Health Services and Mr. Drovsky representing the Curtis Tufts High School.

230
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:10,163
And at that point, we'll go back to the umbrella group and I'm happy to take your questions, but that would be my recommendation.

231
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:11,644
Thank you.

232
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:12,065
Sounds good.

233
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:12,925
Thank you.

234
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:13,466
Ms.

235
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:13,606
Ray.

236
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:20,549
Good evening, Mayor, members of our school administration, members of school committee, and our Medford Public Schools community.

237
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:30,851
The priorities that were identified for health services for next year include a halftime school nurse at the Curtis Tufts High School.

238
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:37,672
In past years, we've had a patchwork of support at the Curtis Tufts.

239
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,413
The students there have need for a

240
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:52,942
consistent nurse to be there, attending to their needs and helping them make connections with the healthcare community for

241
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:58,366
as they transition into post-Medford Public Schools life.

242
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,048
I have been providing that support this year.

243
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:11,730
I think given my upcoming retirement, and it would be an unreasonable request for my successor to manage both aspects of that role.

244
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:20,133
In addition, this year, staffing was shifted so that

245
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:28,780
up 0.4 FTE was moved from the McGlynn middle school and elementary school to the Columbus elementary school.

246
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:32,944
This supported the COVID testing that was taking place.

247
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:45,847
We know that the student behavioral needs required having that second nurse at the Columbus Elementary School, and I was unable to shift that person back.

248
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:54,292
The McGlynn Middle School, with the student population, and will, it requires,

249
00:26:56,088 --> 00:27:08,137
three FTEs at that school to manage the student needs, including medication, different procedures, and nursing care for our access students.

250
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:18,752
The, my last priority recommendation is to establish a dedicated coven coven testing team and data support.

251
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:28,301
This year, the school nurses as their, their traditional role changed from a providing hands on care in the offices to

252
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:38,166
much more of a public health role, we were able to accommodate the testing with support from the Northeastern University School of Nursing.

253
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:52,612
Next year, as we transition back to a very traditional school nursing role, we will not have the ability or the capacity to maintain testing at a level that it may need to be provided.

254
00:27:54,074 --> 00:28:00,697
I think we could accomplish this with a team of four people who would rotate amongst all schools for testing.

255
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:02,678
Thank you.

256
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,242
And last but not least, Mr. Droschke, if you'd like to talk about your budget priorities.

257
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:20,287
Thank you very much.

258
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:21,528
You're breaking up a little bit.

259
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:36,618
We're going to add a new microphone to the Curtis Tufts High School as a last minute budgetary priority, I think.

260
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,780
Hold on one second.

261
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:41,542
We just heard you better.

262
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,244
That was better, Craig, if you want to.

263
00:28:44,284 --> 00:28:44,585
Sorry.

264
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,786
That works.

265
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,228
That's good.

266
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:58,456
So for the budgetary priorities at the Curtis Tufts, the expansion of the special

267
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:24,962
special slash electives teacher at the Curtis Tufts to a halftime position would facilitate some learning opportunities for the students that, in my opinion, are some of the most valued that the students get and are the best opportunity to meet some of their social emotional needs within the school setting.

268
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:26,943
Flexibility in scheduling,

269
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:35,981
is one way to support the needs of the students and expanding elective offerings will provide opportunities for credit recovery as well.

270
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:46,390
The current schedule focuses on academic opportunities with art offered one time a day and health offered one time a day.

271
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:49,653
And the expansion of a

272
00:29:51,923 --> 00:30:04,333
.5 FTE teacher would allow us to offer more electives that would promote positive student driven learning in various times of the day.

273
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:06,635
And as Ms.

274
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,897
Ray highlighted, it has been lovely to have Ms.

275
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:10,698
Ray there this year.

276
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:20,525
But as she also said, having consistent adults in the building, trusted consistent adults in the building is a key part of our programming.

277
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:21,526
Thank you.

278
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:23,734
I think Ms.

279
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:35,797
Ray said that it would be unreasonable for her successor to be expected to serve both as the director of health services and as the part-time school nurse at the Curtis Tufts High School.

280
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:40,418
And I think that it probably goes without saying, but it wasn't particularly reasonable for us to ask Ms.

281
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,579
Ray to do that over the course of this year.

282
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:48,420
And as has been the case with all of the responsibilities of leaving that department that has

283
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:59,995
served such an invaluable role throughout the course of this school year, especially, certainly every school year, but this school year especially, she's done it with a great deal of grace.

284
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:15,042
And I know served as an important member of the Curtis Tufts community, but it is something that, and I would also just incidentally note that that has been a budgeted position and it's something that it just, it wasn't filled.

285
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:27,350
It is conceivable that we'd have to look at whether or not the .5 nature of the position is something that we may have to increase that.

286
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:33,771
Again, the .5 is already budgeted, but it may be the case that we'd have to increase that to a 1.0.

287
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,352
Presumably, the responsibilities would still be shared.

288
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:44,133
I don't believe, at least at the moment, it can change depending on the population, depending on the number of students enrolled.

289
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:55,030
We wouldn't necessarily need the 1.0 at the Curtis Tufts, but it may be the case that we have to hire a 1.0 and then divide up the responsibilities.

290
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:58,514
And there are a few other situations like this.

291
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:08,404
I mean, we mentioned the fact that while this is an extensive list of priorities and you've seen the narratives of department by department and school by school, some of these are fixed costs.

292
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,840
Some of these, Ms.

293
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:19,323
Schulman mentioned the, I believe it's budgeted at somewhere between $8,000 and $16,000 with regard to the cost for the recovery high school program.

294
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:26,685
That is a, as it's been explained to me, a cost that the district incurs year after year.

295
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:36,888
And as is the case, it's not uncommon, but in school districts where you have these relatively low dollar amount costs that are not guaranteed

296
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:43,688
to be incurred on a year-in and year-out basis, it never essentially finds a landing place or a home within the budget.

297
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:48,130
And each year, either the person in my role or in Ms.

298
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,670
Bowen's role or Ms.

299
00:32:49,690 --> 00:33:00,895
Schulman's role, whatever the case may be, is going around and trying to identify a source of funding at the last minute to try to make sure that it's something that is covered.

300
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:04,537
And in one way or another, on a $63 million budget, there is $8,000 that you can pull

301
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:15,180
But it's an unnecessary step and not really reflective of our accurate costs to not actually have it living in a particular place.

302
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:32,173
So the last thing I'll say before we open it up to your questions is that, as you can see, given the nature of the work that these offices and departments are responsible for, in many cases, there is a very strong nexus between our COVID-related needs and these priorities.

303
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:38,449
That is why you're hearing a lot about the development of the ESSER budget.

304
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:44,853
And at the same time, because we don't know yet what our operating budget is ultimately going to be.

305
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:49,996
And we have advanced our conversations with the city in recent days.

306
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:52,217
And so we're getting a clearer picture of that.

307
00:33:52,697 --> 00:34:02,943
But there's still a number of variables that no one knows the answer to yet, particularly related to restrictions and as they might apply to ESSER III and to the ARPA funding.

308
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:13,754
And so without that information, it's important for us to develop these priorities, communicate to you as the school committee and to the community what we plan to address.

309
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:32,278
And as was the case on Monday night, whether some of these priorities land in the ESSER budget or in the operating budget, we'll have to take into account the nature of the expense and the nature of the funding, be it one time or recurring, the urgency of the expense and the availability of the funding, which will be very important

310
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:40,003
And we understand that there will be determinations that have to be made over the coming years with regard to sustainability.

311
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:45,644
And at the same time, there'll need to be additional determinations with regard to need.

312
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:51,565
And that'll be true for the priorities we're articulating here, which may be quite urgent in the 21-22 school year.

313
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,586
But two years removed from the pandemic, they may be less urgent.

314
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:59,907
At the same time, we have an obligation to be continuously looking at our expenses

315
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:17,201
and seeing what programs and what roles are relevant and what are producing or contributing to outcomes for students, and what are ones that roles or programs that may not have as urgent a need as they once did.

316
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,062
And so that's a conversation that's ongoing.

317
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:20,703
That's part of the budget process.

318
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:22,044
It's part of the governance process.

319
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:28,688
And we'll continue to do that through the development of the FY22 budget and beyond.

320
00:35:29,532 --> 00:35:41,379
I'm going to stop the screen share for now, but we can certainly go back to it if people have specific questions or would like to make reference to specific priorities and the team and I are happy to take your questions at this time.

321
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:46,883
Member McStone?

322
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,750
Thank you, Mayor.

323
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:53,891
Just two questions.

324
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:56,512
Thank you guys all for all the information.

325
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:56,572
Ms.

326
00:35:57,592 --> 00:36:02,574
Schulman, I think it's a great idea about the school counselor for the ELL students.

327
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:07,175
I didn't know if 0.6 is enough for both middle school and high school.

328
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:10,416
If it was possible, that position could be increased.

329
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:21,972
Cause I do think it's probably a good idea to have a both a middle school and high school and to have someone who's just 0.6 try to go between three buildings would be a challenge.

330
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:34,274
And then the next, and I'm not sure Mr. Murray, if it's the gym teacher, would that be under a different department?

331
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:40,155
We had talked about an adaptive gym teacher for the last, I wanna say at least two years.

332
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:47,601
Um, so I, if that's a different department, I can hold it to another meeting, but I just want to get some clarity.

333
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:53,434
I'll be happy to speak to the adaptive PE teacher momentarily, but I'll defer first to Ms.

334
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:58,756
Shulman with regard to the adjustment counselor focused on students.

335
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:00,657
And I apologize.

336
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:01,318
I did it again.

337
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:06,000
I said, Mr. Murray, because Colin's teacher is David Murray, who I see.

338
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,041
I just can change my name.

339
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:09,782
I could put a slash next to it.

340
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:11,343
I really will respond to anything.

341
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:11,983
Thank you.

342
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,503
Thank you.

343
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:18,517
In regards to the EL counselor, I agree.

344
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:23,942
But my focus will be looking at supporting high school level students.

345
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:30,329
We have a significant number of counselors, specifically guidance counselors at the middle school.

346
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:38,157
Their roles and responsibilities are more flexible than the high school counselors who have significant responsibilities with post-secondary transition.

347
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:49,030
Therefore, I'd be looking to house the counselor primarily there, though it would seem to be best fitting to have them be available for the middle school should something arise.

348
00:37:50,670 --> 00:38:03,456
And if I could just add one quick comment that I think it's okay for me to just, we've talked a lot about how we've had so many of these meetings leading up to these presentations, and I just, for transparency's sake,

349
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,212
Some of the conversations that have occurred as Ms.

350
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:20,863
Shulman and I have discussed the budgetary priorities coming out of the counseling area is that we know that there is clearly a strong nexus between the work that her department is doing in our work to repair and rebuild from the disruption caused by the pandemic.

351
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:28,589
And so it might well be the case that there are resources available to the counseling department in order to try to fund some of these priorities.

352
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:30,630
And hypothetically, one of them could be

353
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:35,864
of 1.0 counselor focused on EL students.

354
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:40,406
Right now, we think 6.6 would be sufficient with regard to where we are.

355
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:53,832
But the Counseling and Behavioral Health Department, like all departments, will have a responsibility during the life of the ESSER funding to talk through what are their best practices, what are their current structure, what are the current roles and responsibilities.

356
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,614
And in addition to giving us the opportunity to respond

357
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:02,754
to the most pressing needs of students coming out of the pandemic.

358
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:12,641
One of the things that the ESSER funding gives us the opportunity to do is to look at all of our practices and to look at how we're structured and to look at what we're doing well and what we're not.

359
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:21,766
And what it means is part of identifying what's going to be sustainable is identifying those practices and committing to them during the life of this ESSER funding.

360
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:25,809
And that, frankly, it's a forcing mechanism for us to determine

361
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:30,967
what are potential efficiencies, what are potential consolidations, what are necessary investments.

362
00:39:31,427 --> 00:39:49,915
And so I think that is, you know, clearly we need the ESSER funding because we need to make sure that students are not having their educational careers defined by these horrific years in terms of, you know, the experience you're having as a student trying to learn to read or trying to move through some of these transitional periods.

363
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:54,197
But it's also a real opportunity for the organization to identify

364
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:58,595
how should we be organizing our funding and our structure going forward.

365
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:01,616
With regard to the PE teacher that Ms.

366
00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:19,482
McStone references, that priority, which I'm certainly familiar with, and I know that it's something that's been discussed in this forum several times in recent years, and it will be discussed next week in the academic presentations along with the PE and health department budgetary priorities.

367
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:23,744
I will say, though, just as a way of sort of foreshadowing that conversation,

368
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:30,418
We will be looking to engage in a discussion about what is the most prudent investment.

369
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:47,332
We certainly, a 1.0 PE teacher is something that I know the committee has considered and it's something that, if that's the committee's direction, it's something that we'll certainly commit to retaining and to try to add that to the suite of services that we have in our PE and health department.

370
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:52,557
But I do think that given that this has been a budgetary priority, it is a,

371
00:40:53,193 --> 00:41:05,721
a conversation that we've had internally about what would it look like to have the most expansive availability of PE classes and adaptive PE classes and adaptive PE certifications.

372
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:17,969
So perhaps that's hiring a 1.0 or perhaps it is going to the teachers union and bargaining over the impact of requiring an adaptive PE license or at least one per building.

373
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,671
And they're not either or.

374
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:35,155
But the committee should be prepared for that conversation because I think that as we look at the limited capacity we do have, I think we have to make sure that we're attempting to move forward in the most thoughtful way possible.

375
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:49,501
So that is a conversation for next week, but I think just as evidence of the fact that we're actively discussing it, you should know that we're looking at both of those paths as a way to make sure that ultimately we're bringing that staffing capacity to bear.

376
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:51,232
in a way that will benefit students.

377
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:53,433
Thank you.

378
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:55,734
Thank you.

379
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:56,434
Member Van de Kloop?

380
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:00,196
Yes, thank you.

381
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:03,418
I just wanted to ask a quick question about the Curtis Tufts.

382
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:08,680
Could you tell me what the current population of the school is right now?

383
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:13,403
And also, were there some students, did all students start coming in?

384
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:19,546
Or do we have any fully remote students at the Curtis Tufts?

385
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,716
Currently there are 22 students on the rolls.

386
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:32,161
There are six that are presently all remote.

387
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:38,265
I'm sorry, there are seven that are all remote.

388
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:47,212
So do the Curtis Tufts teachers, are they interacting with those students specifically?

389
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:49,433
Yes.

390
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:54,580
I mean, our teachers have been in since the very beginning.

391
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:03,464
And they are running Zoom classes alongside of their in-person classes as well.

392
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:06,845
Next question.

393
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:10,767
You mentioned the program, Boston Recovery Program.

394
00:43:11,868 --> 00:43:17,110
In what ways would that differ from, say, a student going to the Curtis Tufts?

395
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:25,207
I'm Paul and I can answer that so the recovery high school is a general education high school it's a public high school.

396
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:29,250
So it does not provide students with special education services.

397
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:33,273
It works on addiction and recovery.

398
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:38,077
So it's separated that way it would be very different than the Curtis class.

399
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:53,310
Yeah, it falls within, I mean, I think it's great that we're building something in because certainly one of the biggest problems in this realm is that we don't usually get to build stuff into our budget, it seems.

400
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,132
And then all of a sudden somebody moves into the district.

401
00:43:56,292 --> 00:44:01,216
And so I think that that's a very positive move, but I just wanted to make the distinction.

402
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:02,097
Thank you.

403
00:44:02,997 --> 00:44:05,859
And I have one clarifying note to that about the recovery high school.

404
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,403
It's a very different process for enrollment than for special education.

405
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:15,968
So we do not receive notification of a student's intent to enroll in recovery high school.

406
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:27,217
We receive notification when they have enrolled and they've been accepted and Medford public schools is liable for that expense to cover the cost for that student.

407
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:29,559
Okay, thank you.

408
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:33,770
To follow up on that, do we have any students in that program?

409
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,092
And if so, how many and how much does it cost?

410
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:42,977
Right now, I believe we have one student and I think the tuition is approximately $8,000.

411
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:45,339
That's correct.

412
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:47,981
Thank you.

413
00:44:50,262 --> 00:44:50,903
Member Rousseau.

414
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:53,345
Thank you.

415
00:44:54,185 --> 00:44:56,387
Member Stone asked part of what I was trying to

416
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:58,353
the similar question around the 0.6.

417
00:44:58,473 --> 00:45:12,822
Can I, I need help to understand, do we advertise for a 0.6 FTE and are there really people looking for 0.6 FTE work, especially in this setting, in this environment and the skillset we need?

418
00:45:13,302 --> 00:45:22,488
Because I don't want to hear that we have students that need these people, we budgeted for them, but they don't exist or they only exist at 1.0 FTEs.

419
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:26,030
And if that's the case, then I think we need to really

420
00:45:26,578 --> 00:45:27,298
think about this?

421
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,200
Where did the point six come from?

422
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,501
Yeah, I mean, it's a it's a fair point.

423
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:39,384
And I think I mentioned that it well might be the case that strategically, we have to look to hire a 1.0.

424
00:45:40,544 --> 00:45:54,250
But just because there is a there are capacity issues with regard to our budget, it may be the case that our immediate needs are right now to devote a point six to the EL program, and then that would free up the

425
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:59,147
potentially 0.4 to other schools that also need to supplement their services.

426
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:16,154
So the other factor in this, as I mentioned, or as I maybe alluded to, it may be the case that there may be a confluence of the applicant pool leans toward desiring a 1.0 position.

427
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:22,537
And theoretically, we could be splitting the cost between ESSER funding and operating budget.

428
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:39,992
in a way that would allow for 1.0 worth of services with the understanding that part of that funding would need to be identified through a different funding source over time because of the one-time nature of the temporary nature of the ESSER funding.

429
00:46:40,032 --> 00:46:52,659
So those are the types of strategic decisions that we will need to be sifting through as we get a greater sense both of the restrictions on ESSER funding and ARPA funding and what our overall capacity limitations might be.

430
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:55,615
but it certainly might be the case.

431
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:57,136
Thank you.

432
00:46:57,176 --> 00:47:14,679
I just want to make sure we avoid, you know, at one point we had, we didn't have a full-time nurse at each school a couple of years ago, and that was resolved, but, you know, kids don't need nurses necessarily on a schedule, you know, when there's accidents.

433
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:20,901
And similarly, we didn't have enough adjustment counselors all the time and the elementary schools.

434
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:22,581
And when a kid has a meltdown

435
00:47:23,438 --> 00:47:28,939
needs an adjustment counselor, they do it when they do it, not when we have scheduled somebody to be in the building.

436
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:45,203
So I just wanna hear you say there will be, for our EL population, the entire time the kids are at school, every single day of the week, there will be an EL support person in this role, five days a week.

437
00:47:45,223 --> 00:47:50,864
I don't care where the funding comes from, but I don't wanna hear that two days of the week, hopefully they won't need one.

438
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,065
That's not responsible.

439
00:47:53,468 --> 00:47:54,309
I think, sure.

440
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,110
I mean, first of all, we always have to prepare.

441
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,472
All budgeting is contingency-based to some degree.

442
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:04,894
And so we want to make sure that these resources are available as needed by students.

443
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:06,675
That's the whole point of building the budget.

444
00:48:07,896 --> 00:48:10,317
But what I would say is just a couple of things.

445
00:48:10,538 --> 00:48:22,124
One, when we talk about devoting a 0.6 position to an adjustment counselor focused on serving the needs of our English language learner students,

446
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:29,744
That is not to say that adjustment counselor staffing is only available to EL students three days a week.

447
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:36,250
It means that that position is budgeted for and is in a role that is devoted to that time.

448
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:36,991
But there, Ms.

449
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:46,759
Schulman's department, as you can see in the staffing breakdown and the documents provided to you, this is sort of the second point I want to make.

450
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,002
Every one of us is responsible for all students.

451
00:48:50,482 --> 00:49:05,686
And of all presentations at that point really needs to be reiterated, I think it's probably in this one, because we talked a lot on Monday evening about the departmentalization of this budget and how that's reflective of the departmentalization and siloing of the organization.

452
00:49:06,846 --> 00:49:08,506
That's not a good practice anywhere.

453
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:16,428
And it causes problems when we think of the organization too rigidly in any sense, whether it be operations or academics.

454
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:19,357
But when it comes to the offices that Ms.

455
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:28,524
Bowen oversees, it is completely unacceptable for anyone to think that they are only responsible for a particular constituency of students.

456
00:49:29,044 --> 00:49:46,617
And so as we try to develop better practices from a budgeting perspective, and ultimately, hopefully, those practices can be, can bleed into how we operate as an organization, and we try to become more integrated and break down those silos.

457
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:56,039
Hopefully, one of the things you'll see is that we don't need to just have particular staff assigned to particular programs.

458
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:04,505
We'll always need people with expertise, and that's why there'll always be a Department of Pupil Services or Special Education, because it is a highly complex area.

459
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:09,789
And so it's not in any way to belittle the level of expertise that's necessary.

460
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,131
But I think your question speaks to the point of the need

461
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:24,633
essentially see a more integrated organization so that that's never an issue in terms of what capacity is available to which student based on the program that they're in.

462
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:27,214
That's part of what I think we need to break down.

463
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:28,875
Thank you.

464
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:33,277
Member McLaughlin.

465
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:36,347
Thank you, Mayor.

466
00:50:36,388 --> 00:50:47,735
I actually have a lot of questions, so you may, I want to defer to you to let me know when to stop and let another member go, and then I'll get back in the queue again, if that's okay.

467
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,837
Maybe two to three questions, then we'll give the rest.

468
00:50:52,278 --> 00:50:53,018
Okay, thank you.

469
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:55,500
Let me just see here.

470
00:50:58,953 --> 00:51:00,413
Thank you for the presentation.

471
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:11,139
This is always, I feel like a very complex aspect of the of the budget because it does the Director of Pupil Services obviously carry so many different departments.

472
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:31,151
I wanted to thank you also for providing the program descriptions that you provided to us, and I hope that obviously these will be shared with the community and the public and also the breakdown of the programs within each of the schools which I think is really important for us to discuss and also for the community to see and.

473
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:37,493
I think it's a little bit unfortunate that wasn't part of the introduction, but I know that in the interest of time, there's a lot to cover here.

474
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:41,454
So I can appreciate that that hadn't happened and why.

475
00:51:42,274 --> 00:51:47,356
But I am going to be asking some programmatic elements because they do relate to budget as well.

476
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:50,477
And so if you'll bear with me on some of those things, I appreciate it.

477
00:51:53,319 --> 00:52:07,252
I just want to mention that in the programmatic piece, the language-based definition of the program, the Medford Special Education Programs, in the language-based, it's mentioned that there's grade-level access for the students.

478
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:13,137
Language-based program uses grade-level content for ELA reading, math, social studies, and science, so on.

479
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:15,479
And I just wanted to clarify,

480
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,782
the access program says that they use Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

481
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:32,628
And my question is, aren't all of these programs and segregated classrooms and substantially separate classrooms, aren't they all grade level?

482
00:52:34,669 --> 00:52:38,751
They could be significantly modified for the students within that program.

483
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:39,552
Sure.

484
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:41,893
They're following the curriculum frameworks.

485
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:42,413
Yeah.

486
00:52:43,403 --> 00:52:49,445
but it may be significantly modified for say access as opposed to our language based programs.

487
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:49,965
Yes.

488
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:51,846
But in other words, I understand that.

489
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:52,186
Thank you.

490
00:52:52,426 --> 00:52:59,989
But in other words, a fifth grade student learning about the American revolution means the access classroom for fifth grade students are learning about the American revolution.

491
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:06,571
It's just an access point that is different than say, you know, the general education classroom.

492
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:09,392
But in other words, the content is grade level content.

493
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:27,520
Yes, yes, that's what I wanted to clarify thank you I wanted to make sure that that's the case because I'm not sure that that's all always understood in resource room opportunities at other schools and all programming levels, what does that look like I was curious, there was some narrative in here that there were resource room opportunities at all schools.

494
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,140
and all programming levels.

495
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:38,142
And I just, there was no clarification on the programming piece either on what the, or there was for the resource rooms, but there, oh no, was there for the resource rooms?

496
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:39,362
Yes, resource rooms.

497
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:42,223
But here it's listed only at the high school.

498
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:51,225
So for the special education program sheet, where you have all of the different program divisions, there's a resource room

499
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:55,135
learning center division and it says Medford High School and voc tech.

500
00:53:55,555 --> 00:54:05,163
But then if you go back to the presentation itself where we're breaking down the different settings schools that you did, which was very helpful.

501
00:54:05,203 --> 00:54:05,523
Thank you.

502
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:07,605
I found this to be extremely helpful document.

503
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:13,850
It says resource rooms on all of the different schools with an asterisk, but it says provided

504
00:54:14,964 --> 00:54:16,085
at all programming levels.

505
00:54:16,145 --> 00:54:17,966
And I'm wondering, what does that look like?

506
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:22,070
Can you explain to us what the resource rooms are and how they look at the different schools, if you don't mind?

507
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,612
Sure, so the resource rooms are across the district.

508
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:31,737
So it's a small group setting for special education students and it's in a specific area.

509
00:54:31,777 --> 00:54:43,927
So a student may need to go to a resource room if they have a math disability, but they do not require a substantially separate program or they do not require

510
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:47,157
you know, to be in special education services all day.

511
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:55,061
So we have students who go to a resource room for math, and they're in the general education setting for all their other major subjects.

512
00:54:56,302 --> 00:55:00,664
Resource room is to provide scaffolding.

513
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:10,509
They have a lot of support classes, which we call reading and writing, and that helps students with reading, writing,

514
00:55:11,189 --> 00:55:18,492
If they have a big project that they need to break down, helping them with test taking skills, organizational skills.

515
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:25,174
So it's usually about eight students in a small group setting with a special education teacher that focuses specifically on

516
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,385
what subject they're teaching in that resource room.

517
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:29,145
And it varies.

518
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,887
It's not one size fits all.

519
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:36,151
We have some students who are maybe one subject, some go to four different resource rooms.

520
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:40,594
So it just varies for each student individual needs.

521
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:41,495
Thank you.

522
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:44,957
And that's across all levels of disability?

523
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:46,198
Correct.

524
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:46,879
Okay.

525
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,579
Thank you.

526
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:48,400
I appreciate that.

527
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,202
And then do I get one more there?

528
00:55:52,573 --> 00:55:52,873
for now?

529
00:55:53,294 --> 00:55:53,934
Yes, please.

530
00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:54,335
One more.

531
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:55,335
Okay.

532
00:55:55,476 --> 00:56:09,528
And so, when I was doing the math on this document, again, this is the special education programming by schools, broken down by students on IEPs, programs, special ed teachers, paraprofessionals, and the co-teaching slash inclusion model.

533
00:56:09,928 --> 00:56:15,333
When I was adding up the paraprofessionals, it said that we, I got the number of 80 paraprofessionals.

534
00:56:15,393 --> 00:56:15,973
Is that right?

535
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,915
We have 80 paraprofessionals currently?

536
00:56:18,693 --> 00:56:20,053
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

537
00:56:20,073 --> 00:56:20,793
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

538
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:21,814
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

539
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:23,014
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

540
00:56:23,034 --> 00:56:23,654
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

541
00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:24,874
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

542
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:25,735
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

543
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:26,475
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

544
00:56:26,495 --> 00:56:27,295
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

545
00:56:27,335 --> 00:56:28,095
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

546
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:46,929
Thank you.

547
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,671
I had a health services question.

548
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:59,614
Under additional budget priorities worthy of consideration, there's this notion of developing a Medicaid billing team.

549
00:56:59,694 --> 00:57:14,400
And I was just curious what revenue is generated to Medford Public Schools today for Medicaid billing and what we would anticipate being generated to Medford Public Schools were we to invest in additional staff to facilitate that?

550
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:20,855
I don't have the exact number of how much we receive from Medicaid billing.

551
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:23,316
Revenues do go to the city.

552
00:57:23,336 --> 00:57:32,601
I know I did a pilot program of billing for nursing services for one student for part of last year, and we were able to recoup about

553
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:44,938
12 or $15,000 based on the nursing services that were provided to that student over a course of five months.

554
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:56,965
Last year, the federal government expanded the Medicaid reimbursement program so that we no longer have the restriction of only billing for students who are on IEPs.

555
00:57:57,585 --> 00:58:03,469
Now we can bill for services provided to any student who has mass health coverage.

556
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:16,938
And this includes many of our screenings, such as vision and hearing screening, substance use assessment screening, medications, treatments, procedures that are provided to students as part of their healthcare.

557
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:22,902
There's also an expansion with speech language services and related occupational

558
00:58:23,942 --> 00:58:24,903
therapy services.

559
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:30,105
So there is potential to recoup a fairly substantial amount of money.

560
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:38,729
There is a process and it's very heavily regulated by the government, as you'd expect.

561
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:48,133
So it requires people who are trained in that billing process so that we can accurately recoup what we deserve.

562
00:58:49,339 --> 00:59:03,684
Yeah, and I am wholly on board with maximizing our revenue, but I would only be in favor of this if the revenue actually comes to Medford Public Schools.

563
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:08,286
So if we have to decide how to spend our precious budget dollars,

564
00:59:10,055 --> 00:59:16,617
we can't be spending them to generate revenue that does not return back to the district directly.

565
00:59:17,797 --> 00:59:32,442
There's also statewide legislation pending that would require that, but in the meantime, I think it's an investment worth making as long as the return is there to offset the cost.

566
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:34,386
Agreed with you.

567
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:40,548
Being that the services are provided by the school, it seems appropriate that they come back to the school.

568
00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:46,831
And I know there's a lot of lobbying towards that and has been for many years.

569
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:56,076
Just the small amount of monitoring I had to do, I mean, I could not have done that on a wide scale basis for all the students who would be eligible.

570
00:59:56,636 --> 01:00:01,018
So it really becomes fulfilling that role.

571
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:05,166
Yeah, insurance billing is a beast unto itself.

572
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:06,866
Exactly, exactly.

573
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:08,287
Yeah, thank you.

574
01:00:08,747 --> 01:00:10,687
And then I did have a question for Ms.

575
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,187
Schulman.

576
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:26,051
I wondered if you could talk about the factors that go into what a particular building needs, because when I look at the distribution of adjustment counselors versus school psychologists versus BCBAs,

577
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:32,542
I can't correlate how staff are distributed among buildings.

578
01:00:32,582 --> 01:00:36,224
It doesn't match IEPs.

579
01:00:37,344 --> 01:00:41,386
It doesn't seem like there is an actual basis for those numbers.

580
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,748
So can you describe where we're headed?

581
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,470
In that regard, absolutely.

582
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:52,918
It is, it is confusing and it's in part because many of the roles have overlapping responsibilities.

583
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:00,888
So in some of the elementary school profiles it's noted that there is a point five school psychologist.

584
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:04,767
other elementary schools, there is a full-time school psychologist.

585
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:16,232
This is in part because the 0.5 school psychologist is a one FTE employee who only does psychological evaluations for IEPs.

586
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:23,136
They do not provide counseling services, while the other school psychologists 1.0 in the buildings

587
01:01:23,476 --> 01:01:24,997
do provide counseling services.

588
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:29,341
So then you would see a lower number of adjustment counselors in that building.

589
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:39,129
There's also additional staff in buildings with specialized programs, specifically with therapeutic learning programs, have more staffing than other buildings.

590
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:44,894
But we are certainly looking to streamline services more next year.

591
01:01:46,155 --> 01:01:52,600
In my more detailed budget, you will see more indication of that, if that answers your question.

592
01:01:55,457 --> 01:01:59,861
So I think you're saying there's a method to the madness and it's okay the way it is right now.

593
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:00,782
Is that what you're saying?

594
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:00,862
Yes.

595
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:06,768
And so can we try to find a way to describe why this is?

596
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:11,721
rational, like it just doesn't look super rational.

597
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:30,154
And it's really hard to, I think intuitively, I'm sure my colleagues agree with me that there's a widespread acknowledgement that we need additional support at the elementary school level.

598
01:02:30,494 --> 01:02:32,996
I don't think there's an argument about

599
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:44,468
The need in a like macro sense, but like to understand like where does where does the need plug in and is it enough, I feel like I don't know how to evaluate that at the moment because.

600
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:51,116
There doesn't like there's there's no rationale that makes these numbers sort of.

601
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:52,793
make sense.

602
01:02:53,274 --> 01:03:06,420
So it's hard to say like if everything's okay right now are we just like incrementally adding to everybody or are we trying to fix a structural deficit somewhere like what what is the goal of the additional staff and is it enough?

603
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:19,286
I would say if I could just very quickly I think I think that's important that we do spell that out and I think it's it's an important part of people understanding where this investment is going especially as it pertains to the ESSER funding that's coming in because

604
01:03:20,815 --> 01:03:26,559
$7.6 million is a really big number until you see that it's really attached to over the course of close to three fiscal years.

605
01:03:27,379 --> 01:03:39,066
And then all of a sudden, when you factor in the disproportionate need that is being realized because of this disruption that students have lived through, all of a sudden, those dollars appear to be much more scarce.

606
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:46,810
And that's part of why, as we discussed a little while ago, while there is a rationale now to how these services are being deployed,

607
01:03:47,200 --> 01:04:01,424
There is also a responsibility on the part of the district to identify while this funding is available, what is the best plan forward with regard to these investments when we don't have that sort of funding available, frankly.

608
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,424
And so when Ms.

609
01:04:02,444 --> 01:04:15,548
Schulman talks about potentially streamlining or identifying the responsibilities overlap, there's also going to be a responsibility on this department and every other department to identify what are the best practices across various grade levels

610
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:21,540
and what is the formula essentially that will best fit the needs of students across each schools.

611
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:40,148
And so that's a long way of saying that the rationale that we would describe, that we would provide now based on the system that we have in place, very well might differ from the rationale that we bring forward to you next year when we are one year closer to ESSER funding not being available.

612
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:45,110
And I think that's something that we have a responsibility to do and there's an urgency

613
01:04:46,078 --> 01:04:50,459
as a result of having this additional funding available in the short term.

614
01:04:50,479 --> 01:04:53,140
Okay, thank you.

615
01:04:53,700 --> 01:05:02,363
And my last question is on the sheet that was provided to us about special education program across the buildings.

616
01:05:03,523 --> 01:05:08,565
I noticed that there are zero students listed in gen ed inclusion.

617
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:13,046
And I wondered if that is typical for a district of our size.

618
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:20,362
The label general ed inclusion is just what the building offers.

619
01:05:21,203 --> 01:05:25,286
So it's not, I didn't put numbers of students underneath co-teaching or anything like that.

620
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:30,189
So it's just that they offer either co-teaching or inclusion opportunities.

621
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:36,173
I can get you the numbers and break it down for you if you need that information.

622
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:38,014
I think it would be helpful.

623
01:05:39,725 --> 01:05:41,606
at some point to clarify that.

624
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:46,648
I don't have a sense for how many students are in co-teaching models.

625
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:59,633
I don't have a sense for how many students are in inclusion models, nor what the holdbacks are if we're sort of out of alignment with what you would expect.

626
01:06:00,553 --> 01:06:06,256
I have no sense of how to evaluate that if we don't know what those numbers are.

627
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:25,024
So I think that would be very useful for the committee to understand because, again, if there's a structural, like a staffing deficit that is causing us to not be able to optimize those experiences for students who could benefit from them, I would want to be able to have that conversation.

628
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:26,785
Thank you.

629
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:34,900
Member Kretz, are you good for now?

630
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:43,485
I was just going to ask, and I know it's something that is additional budgetary priorities.

631
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:47,907
And I was getting ready for my upcoming subcommittee meeting with buildings and grounds.

632
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:55,391
So I just happened to notice under the Curtis Tufts, they have a capillary pier for the boiler.

633
01:06:55,511 --> 01:07:00,174
And it does say immediately, most immediately boiler repair.

634
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:09,459
So I was just wondering if that is something that is on the radar, you know, other plans for an emergency repair.

635
01:07:09,479 --> 01:07:11,660
I think we heard about it at one point.

636
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:18,124
And so I was just curious if maybe if Mr. Murphy has any information about that.

637
01:07:18,464 --> 01:07:23,907
Yeah, it is a repair that needs to take place in the next six months.

638
01:07:24,627 --> 01:07:26,929
We had a, I think you remember Ms.

639
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:28,910
Gretz that we discussed there was the potential for

640
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:33,287
a catastrophic failure earlier this year.

641
01:07:33,768 --> 01:07:43,233
We were able to essentially create a bridge solution that Mr. McLaughlin can articulate more eloquently than I can with regard to exactly how we fixed it.

642
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:48,337
But we fixed it and we were able to keep the building open, but it's not a long-term solution.

643
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,398
It's something that we will have to address over the course of the summer.

644
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:56,942
And frankly, the capital repairs that are necessary at the Curtis Tufts,

645
01:07:57,822 --> 01:08:05,065
Some of which ranging from sort of short term maintenance by fresh coats of paint and things like that, into some of the more significant things.

646
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:16,110
There is a need to look at all of our capital priorities and making sure that that building is reflective of our values and the investment we have in the students who are going to school there.

647
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:25,874
And so I give a great credit to Mr. Dravsky and his staff for working day in and day out in a very old building with some significant challenges.

648
01:08:26,805 --> 01:08:32,750
There will be a need for some work there over the course of the summer to make sure that it's where we need it to be.

649
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,431
The boiler is certainly the first priority.

650
01:08:36,973 --> 01:08:37,473
Thank you.

651
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:45,560
And I also happen to notice on the same line in the same box, and we talked about it with the elementary schools, was the refillable water stations.

652
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:55,087
So I'm hoping that with the ESSER funds that we'll be able to maybe get those to the districts if the grants don't go through with the on-board.

653
01:08:56,892 --> 01:09:11,317
Yeah, between grant funding, capital funding, and ESSER funding, these are all things that they won't, I suspect, land, and I don't think they should land on the operating budget, but from one of those other funding sources, these are things that we have to address over the course of the next year without question.

654
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:16,639
Thank you, and thank you to everybody for all your presentations.

655
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:17,220
They're excellent.

656
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:17,720
Thank you.

657
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,640
Thank you.

658
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,882
We have Member Van de Kloot, Member McStone, and then, I'm sure, Member McLaughlin.

659
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:27,122
Thank you.

660
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:31,905
First I wanted to mention that it happens to be National Nurses Day today.

661
01:09:32,825 --> 01:09:41,750
So Tony I wanted to bring that and say particularly to our all of our nursing staff who's done such a tremendous job this year but to you in particular as well.

662
01:09:42,831 --> 01:09:44,372
And, you know, we

663
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:49,696
We really haven't given you all the senior praises yet, but we will.

664
01:09:50,116 --> 01:09:55,341
It's very sad to know that you are retiring, but boy, what a way to go.

665
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:58,763
Tony, you certainly pulled out all the stops this year.

666
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:00,465
Thank you.

667
01:10:00,585 --> 01:10:05,069
And my team really appreciates everybody's thoughts of gratitude.

668
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:05,589
Thank you.

669
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,470
Sure.

670
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:12,475
I just want to ask you a little bit more about the four additional people you've

671
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:18,180
recommend it in terms of tracking the COVID and for next year.

672
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:25,407
What exactly, could you expand on the role, I mean that's a, you know, four more nurses,

673
01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:29,020
Could you speak to it a little bit more?

674
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,040
I could.

675
01:10:30,761 --> 01:10:36,183
Actually, a COVID testing team does not have to be nursing staff.

676
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:42,786
It could be coordinated by somebody with a bachelor's degree in public health.

677
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:50,290
And then the testers slash swabbers are trained personnel.

678
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:56,553
So maybe health assistants would be able to fill that role.

679
01:10:57,514 --> 01:11:00,837
We used nursing students very successfully.

680
01:11:01,218 --> 01:11:12,891
They were supervised by the school nurses, and it not only provided them with an extra learning experience in the public health arena, but it served our needs as well.

681
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,972
in a very safe manner.

682
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:21,356
I envisioned a small team that could go from school to school to do the testing.

683
01:11:21,476 --> 01:11:25,798
I think come the fall, we may not require twice a week testing.

684
01:11:25,838 --> 01:11:31,922
We may be able to do with once a week testing and then follow the metrics to see how long we need, you know,

685
01:11:32,315 --> 01:11:33,536
we would need to continue that.

686
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:44,684
Certainly the winter time, it may spike again, but I think a team that rotates between schools would be able to handle that project.

687
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:54,332
Right, so the difficult part with that is that, you know, please God, when this passes, you know, at which point we've now hired in,

688
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,860
you know, a team of four people.

689
01:11:57,681 --> 01:12:02,302
And then we're just sort of saying, you know, I'm trying to figure out how that works.

690
01:12:02,962 --> 01:12:07,524
It's probably similar to the contact tracing teams that the state has hired.

691
01:12:08,644 --> 01:12:16,847
They are grant driven short term programs and positions dependent on public health need.

692
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:25,320
And many, many hundreds or thousands of people were hired into the contact tracing system working for the state.

693
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,140
Okay.

694
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,500
Thank you, Tony.

695
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:40,504
If I could just add very briefly that that is a microcosm of a number of the questions that we're facing, because the reality is that not every position that we are advocating for will live in perpetuity.

696
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:46,405
Some of them are positions that are to address short-term urgent needs, ranging from operational to instructional.

697
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:54,442
Some of them are positions that we think would be helpful and useful, but the reality is that there may not be funding to sustain them indefinitely.

698
01:12:54,722 --> 01:12:57,143
And there are some that we think are probably really wise investments.

699
01:12:57,643 --> 01:13:09,547
And hiring now, frankly, will create, as I said earlier, a bit of a forcing mechanism for the district to determine how we make them sustainable going forward.

700
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:14,268
And I think all three of those scenarios are things that are represented by the developing this budget.

701
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:15,529
Thank you.

702
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:23,149
Member Stone, then Member McLaughlin.

703
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:25,851
Thank you, Mayor.

704
01:13:26,431 --> 01:13:35,618
Mr. Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to screen share page seven, which lists the superintendent's draft recommendations.

705
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,920
That'd be great if you can do it.

706
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:47,867
So, superintendent, I love your recommendations because I think those are things that we have learned through community and teachers and parents that are necessary.

707
01:13:48,968 --> 01:13:50,389
For the page seven,

708
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:53,876
Is this the pupil services budget?

709
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:56,217
Is this the... That is the one, thank you.

710
01:13:56,677 --> 01:14:03,738
So page seven, and now I'm gonna, sorry, Mr. Murphy, can you go to page eight?

711
01:14:03,818 --> 01:14:10,839
Just cause I was just highlighting what is in both the director's request and both the superintendent's direct.

712
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,020
That's not the one.

713
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:18,841
Which is it, pupil services, health services, Curtis Tufts or counseling?

714
01:14:21,068 --> 01:14:24,729
It's the one, it was in my package, page seven and then page eight.

715
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:28,930
So it's, I think it's the whole department.

716
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:34,972
Um, no.

717
01:14:35,052 --> 01:14:44,754
So at the top, so they pretty, I guess, I don't know if you can probably see mine, but it lines up except under the director's personnel priorities.

718
01:14:45,835 --> 01:14:47,195
Um, all right.

719
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:50,786
But keep talking and I'll- You got it, okay.

720
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:58,113
So under the director's personnel priorities, it lists two, four, six, eight, 10, 11, 12, 13 bullets.

721
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:08,704
All of the director's priorities are in the superintendent's recommendations except for the director's has three bullets.

722
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:12,908
One is behavior specialist at four specialists,

723
01:15:13,528 --> 01:15:19,211
One is a meet ETL position and one is an administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School.

724
01:15:19,831 --> 01:15:27,175
So they all sound like they are worthy priorities to be getting on the superintendent's recommendations.

725
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:32,257
I wish I was tech savvy enough to show you just the

726
01:15:33,081 --> 01:15:35,182
the two papers that I have.

727
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:37,523
So I love the superintendent's recommendations.

728
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:55,929
I'd love for us to make a motion to get them into the budget, but I do think it's important to add the three that didn't make it to the superintendent's recommendations that were on the director's personnel priorities, which is the behavior specialist, the meet ETL position, and the administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School.

729
01:15:56,449 --> 01:15:59,970
So I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.

730
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,951
It was page seven and eight.

731
01:16:01,828 --> 01:16:03,449
It's a Joan Bowen's report.

732
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:04,629
Yeah, I do.

733
01:16:04,649 --> 01:16:05,830
And I will, I will bring that up.

734
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:20,597
And as I do, I just, I want to, um, so just as a, as a point of process for folks that, um, didn't hear this piece of it on Monday, the, the information provided to the school committee provides, um, three distinct tables.

735
01:16:21,157 --> 01:16:28,040
The first table discusses the allocation of staff in the various areas, either in departments, roles, or buildings.

736
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,601
The second table.

737
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:33,153
is the superintendent's draft recommendations.

738
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:41,357
Those are the pieces that through the budget vetting process, our internal process, they have risen to the point of being the recommendation of the superintendent.

739
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:45,720
The third table are from the department heads themselves.

740
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:54,145
And that is in response to the school committee wanting to essentially see the raw data of the budgetary process.

741
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:54,505
And so

742
01:16:54,978 --> 01:17:04,106
The three budgetary, now there are different reasons that something might make it onto a director or a principal's priority list, but not into the superintendent's recommendation.

743
01:17:04,507 --> 01:17:11,433
Sometimes it's because the director has advocated for it, but we know that the need is being addressed elsewhere in the budget.

744
01:17:11,733 --> 01:17:15,937
And therefore we wouldn't recommend it being part of this particular department's budget.

745
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:20,481
So with regard to the behaviorist positions, and again, we've got,

746
01:17:21,552 --> 01:17:28,314
advocating, requested adjustment counselors, behavior specialists, and a variety of other different people doing these roles.

747
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:38,238
And so I can go back and look, but I'm pretty confident that that role, the reason it's not in the superintendent's recommendation is because we know it's living elsewhere in the budget.

748
01:17:38,718 --> 01:17:50,722
And it is really just a consequence of a very transparent process that we have here in Medford that you wouldn't necessarily see in other budget processes where you're really seeing exactly the sort of testimonials

749
01:17:51,249 --> 01:18:02,279
of the various department heads leading up to the superintendent who is responsible for synthesizing all that information and making sure there's a recommendation that is truly reflective of all the budgetary needs.

750
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:14,189
There are other instances in which the director is advocating for something that when it comes through the budgetary process, it's simply not in the superintendent's recommendation because on a basis of priorities.

751
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:17,732
And at least one of the two positions that you're referring to there

752
01:18:18,145 --> 01:18:21,327
I would say, and certainly the school committee can take that vote and we will include it.

753
01:18:21,688 --> 01:18:26,611
But when we remember, we talked about the budget being developed along the two tracks.

754
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:34,857
We are assessing the needs and giving as authentic a representation of the district's needs as we can to the school committee to make an informed request.

755
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:43,824
But the other thing that we're doing is making sure that we're prepared to operate the district, irrespective of the size of the appropriation that's already made.

756
01:18:44,164 --> 01:18:44,945
And so inevitably,

757
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:58,438
there will be things that we recommend and probably things that you request that if it's not appropriate for moving over to some of those external funds, it just won't make it into the operating budget on a basis of priorities, or at least it certainly won't be the recommendation of the administration.

758
01:18:58,558 --> 01:19:14,945
And at a minimum, the administrator assistant position at the Curtis-Tufts would not make the cut on that in part because, and that's not to say it couldn't be useful, and it's certainly no disrespect to Mr. Drowsky doing his job,

759
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:18,889
to advocate for his school and make sure that they have as much staffing as possible.

760
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:25,370
But we essentially had to make a choice around adding additional staff in other areas in that building.

761
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:40,974
And we felt that by doing so, we would better serve the interests of students, which is frankly, hopefully a common thread that you see through all of these budget proposals and requests, which is that we're trying to focus on as much direct support to students as possible.

762
01:19:41,014 --> 01:19:42,594
So if the committee would like to

763
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,711
have that included, we will certainly do that for the next presentation.

764
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:51,257
I would just say that understand there's a strong likelihood we'll be asking you to make a

765
01:19:52,015 --> 01:19:56,999
a decision on that point later in the budget process because of how all of these needs stack up against each other.

766
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:57,440
Right.

767
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,500
No, I appreciate it.

768
01:19:58,581 --> 01:20:11,611
I don't know how all the schools and all the departments, their backstory to all of them, but I would, um, I do would like to make a motion that the superintendent's recommendations, cause those are the ones that you vetted more than the directors or the principals.

769
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:18,377
Um, I would like to make a recommendation that we move forward to include the recommendations in the, in the budget, please.

770
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:19,998
And I'll second that.

771
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:29,133
can I ask a clarifying question?

772
01:20:29,153 --> 01:20:40,020
And while you're asking the clarifying question, member Graham, could we pull up the superintendent's recommendations to make it clear to all of us in the public what those are?

773
01:20:40,781 --> 01:20:43,322
Member Graham.

774
01:20:43,783 --> 01:20:44,303
Member Ms.

775
01:20:44,323 --> 01:20:52,008
Stone, through the chair, are you intending to include the COVID mitigation priorities in your motion?

776
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,841
I can, because I think, what is today, Thursday?

777
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:57,101
Did we meet on Tuesday?

778
01:20:57,921 --> 01:20:59,202
And you had followed up with it.

779
01:20:59,242 --> 01:21:06,084
So I am comfortable with making a motion that all four of the recommendation level priorities are included.

780
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:10,465
Thank you.

781
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:16,187
I have a point of information on that.

782
01:21:18,547 --> 01:21:20,808
Point of information, member McLaughlin, then Mr. Murphy.

783
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:27,120
Yeah, I still had additional questions that are on some of these recommendations.

784
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:31,601
So I don't know if we want to go through those or how you want to handle it.

785
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:35,582
But I had questions on the behavior specialist.

786
01:21:35,662 --> 01:21:40,483
I had questions on the training for paraprofessionals.

787
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:46,685
And I had questions on the additional special education teacher for the Brooks.

788
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:50,126
OK, why don't you ask those questions while we have it up?

789
01:21:52,697 --> 01:22:02,583
Okay, so for the Brooks program for the special education teacher at the Brooks, what classroom would that be for?

790
01:22:03,964 --> 01:22:07,506
That would be an additional staff person for resource room students.

791
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:09,287
Resource room students.

792
01:22:09,307 --> 01:22:11,709
So for the resource rooms, that's another thing I wanted to ask you.

793
01:22:11,749 --> 01:22:18,493
So those staff people are full-time dedicated to those resource rooms, including the powers, or are they moving in and out of those rooms?

794
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:19,853
It depends on the number of students.

795
01:22:23,495 --> 01:22:26,177
if there's less than eight, we do not require a para.

796
01:22:28,438 --> 01:22:31,619
Less than eight, you don't require a para, but are those, okay, thank you.

797
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:38,582
And those teacher positions are full-time specifically for those resource rooms, or do they move, are they counted twice in other places?

798
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:43,345
In other words, are they counted as resource room and teachers elsewhere, or are they just resource room?

799
01:22:43,745 --> 01:22:50,588
They're just identified as special education teachers who teach in resource rooms.

800
01:22:52,107 --> 01:22:52,867
And not elsewhere?

801
01:22:52,887 --> 01:22:53,628
Correct.

802
01:22:54,148 --> 01:22:54,868
Okay, thank you.

803
01:22:55,288 --> 01:23:00,870
And then for the, so that's for an additional resource room teacher is what that recommendation is under the superintendents, is that right?

804
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:01,870
Yes.

805
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:08,352
Okay, and that would be eight students, or I mean, under eight students since there's no para in those classrooms, is that right?

806
01:23:08,372 --> 01:23:09,033
Correct.

807
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:10,513
Okay, thank you.

808
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:13,474
And then the developmental classroom there?

809
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:16,515
The connections classroom?

810
01:23:16,857 --> 01:23:22,701
I don't know, it's called developmental on the Brooks spreadsheet and I don't know what that means, developmental.

811
01:23:23,441 --> 01:23:29,045
That's Katie Capuccio's class and that's students with significant disabilities.

812
01:23:30,986 --> 01:23:34,688
They have a significantly modified curriculum.

813
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:36,569
Yeah, okay, I know the classroom.

814
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:42,213
I just didn't recognize the developmental as the name of the program because it's not anywhere else.

815
01:23:42,233 --> 01:23:43,434
So I didn't realize what that was.

816
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:44,615
So that's Katie's classroom?

817
01:23:45,989 --> 01:23:48,371
Okay, so that's, okay.

818
01:23:48,531 --> 01:23:48,912
Thank you.

819
01:23:48,972 --> 01:23:58,401
And then for the training for the paraprofessionals, the licensing, can you tell me more about that?

820
01:23:58,421 --> 01:24:03,306
So it's for paras to become registered behavioral therapists.

821
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:10,633
They provide additional support to students with social emotional needs, with, you know,

822
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:15,384
you know, it, it uses, um, applied behavioral analysis.

823
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:17,745
They need to use that in the classrooms.

824
01:24:18,205 --> 01:24:27,250
Um, they can take data on, um, you know, different things, how students are performing in the classroom, how they're able to, um, complete their classwork.

825
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:33,253
And that would be able to support the teachers and also to support them, uh, social and emotionally.

826
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:33,753
Okay.

827
01:24:33,913 --> 01:24:36,094
And that, is that going to be offered to all Paris?

828
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:37,175
Yes.

829
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:38,247
Okay.

830
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:41,649
And that is going to be, is that going to be a contracted service or in-house training?

831
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,491
So it's a contracted service.

832
01:24:46,052 --> 01:24:49,513
It's they do a group, but it's all online.

833
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:56,257
So they do the training on their own and then they take a test at the end and then that's when they get their certification.

834
01:24:57,578 --> 01:24:59,039
Okay.

835
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:00,259
Thank you.

836
01:25:00,379 --> 01:25:00,660
And then,

837
01:25:03,344 --> 01:25:03,584
Okay.

838
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:07,846
And then the behavior specialists for just the four across the district.

839
01:25:07,886 --> 01:25:17,191
So I guess for folks watching as well, and I think I know the difference, but I want to make sure that the community understands the difference between adjustment counselor and behavior specialists.

840
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:20,732
Can someone share that with us?

841
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:23,262
Yeah, I'm happy to answer that.

842
01:25:23,642 --> 01:25:34,352
So a behavior specialist is a name that we give to members of our staff who fall typically under the paraprofessional unit.

843
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:44,002
They have a bachelor's degree and most often what we have for applicants are graduate students from behavior analyst programs.

844
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:56,808
A school adjustment counselor is a school social worker or licensed mental health clinician or someone who has undergone a specific school adjustment program at a master's level.

845
01:25:56,848 --> 01:25:58,870
They focus on the mental health component.

846
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:05,174
Behavior specialists would be supervised from a BCBA focusing on specific behavior plans.

847
01:26:06,195 --> 01:26:09,077
That falls under the social emotional realm, but it is quite different.

848
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:11,528
Yes, and it's quite different from a BCBA.

849
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:17,150
So how many BCBAs in the district versus the behavior specialists that we're asking for?

850
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:21,671
Currently, we have four BCBAs in the district and one behavior specialist.

851
01:26:22,091 --> 01:26:24,051
We're asking for four additional.

852
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:27,112
OK, that helps me understand that better.

853
01:26:27,192 --> 01:26:27,612
Thank you.

854
01:26:31,273 --> 01:26:35,294
Mayor, if I could just provide a couple of clarifying points I think might be helpful for the motion.

855
01:26:36,494 --> 01:26:37,735
Yes, member Murphy.

856
01:26:38,215 --> 01:26:38,435
Thank you.

857
01:26:38,455 --> 01:26:39,155
Mr. Murphy.

858
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:40,241
That's OK.

859
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:52,849
So the green checkmarks that you see in the critical budgetary priorities for the pupil services budget here are reflective of conversations that we had on Monday evening.

860
01:26:53,029 --> 01:27:00,813
And so similar to what we did on Monday, if the motion that Ms.

861
01:27:00,853 --> 01:27:09,058
Mustone has put on the floor were to pass, we will interpret that as the committee endorsing this set of priorities

862
01:27:09,522 --> 01:27:16,485
and a charge to the administration to incorporate this into the development of the recommended budget that will come before you on May 19th.

863
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:38,855
Now, you should know that there are some pieces of this that ultimately we will likely be asking you to not include in order for taking into account not just the overall budgetary capacity, but also the fact that we continue on a daily basis to be strategizing about how

864
01:27:39,826 --> 01:27:42,147
to maximize the use of resources.

865
01:27:42,207 --> 01:27:48,809
So I'm speaking specifically to the row related to long-term budgetary priorities.

866
01:27:49,009 --> 01:28:08,235
That row essentially represents a middle ground between the proposals that didn't make it from the director's testimony to the superintendent's recommendation, but also is something that as time goes on, if budgetary capacity is realized,

867
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:18,544
you should know that we recognize that this is a priority, and it could be something that would be important, but it wouldn't necessarily be at the front of the list, essentially.

868
01:28:18,564 --> 01:28:22,307
And that is based on our analysis of needs.

869
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:34,817
There are also instances, though, and the administrative assistant at the Curtis-Tufts is an example of this, where you'll see in the future budget presentations, just like you see the green checkmarks for the previous budget presentation,

870
01:28:35,183 --> 01:28:45,472
you'll see that we've devised other strategies that we think address those needs in a way that aren't specific necessarily to the presentation you're seeing tonight, but we think there might be a more cost efficient way of doing this.

871
01:28:45,512 --> 01:28:58,162
So for instance, I anticipate that we will be looking to fund a floating administrative assistant position who from time to time will provide staffing support to the Curtis Tufts, but also other offices.

872
01:28:58,883 --> 01:29:02,826
Essentially, we don't think it necessarily justifies, the need justifies,

873
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:04,988
either 1.0 or in this case, a 0.5.

874
01:29:05,749 --> 01:29:13,991
But it's not to say that this is an outlandish priority that the administrator has just sort of, you know, put in to fill out the form.

875
01:29:14,051 --> 01:29:16,251
I mean, it's, there is work to be done there.

876
01:29:16,571 --> 01:29:24,293
There is investment to be made, but not something that we think at this point would justify, you know, that particular ask.

877
01:29:24,413 --> 01:29:32,675
And so that's why when we get to the end on May 19th, we will, taking all the votes that you've taken and the endorsements that you've offered,

878
01:29:33,509 --> 01:29:35,009
incorporate that, strategize.

879
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:41,011
And if there are things that we have to essentially present to you as an either or, it's at that point that we will do that.

880
01:29:41,591 --> 01:29:47,972
And I think the other sort of obvious question as you endorse the priorities that are before you, what does this all add up to?

881
01:29:48,392 --> 01:29:53,893
And I would just go back to that previous slide that right now that there's a range of 3.4 to $5.8 million.

882
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:56,954
And so it will land somewhere in there.

883
01:29:57,494 --> 01:30:02,515
Also understanding that there are external funds, particularly in the area of special education that will offset some of these costs.

884
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:04,891
That's why there's a lot of fluidity.

885
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:13,977
That's why there's a lot of movement, but we certainly, we appreciate the support that is represented by the motion.

886
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:22,602
And this will help us as we take all of this information and factor it in to the proposals that will come before you over the course of the next several meetings.

887
01:30:27,912 --> 01:30:28,392
Thank you.

888
01:30:28,452 --> 01:30:29,453
Yes, this is a question.

889
01:30:29,473 --> 01:30:43,083
So I guess I am a little confused in the process because I felt like I thought this was the draft and discussion and then later would be we would be voting on sort of the decisions and maybe I'm just misunderstanding because I do feel like there's a number of additional questions that I have.

890
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:45,025
So what if I'm understanding the motion.

891
01:30:46,403 --> 01:30:57,145
Correctly, it is to accept the superintendent's recommendations with the understanding that we are continuing to negotiate and draft other recommendations.

892
01:30:57,305 --> 01:30:58,305
Is that what I'm hearing?

893
01:30:58,525 --> 01:31:12,448
And I think Mr. Murphy sort of clarified that, but I just want to make sure that I'm understanding, because I really just, I guess I thought that these were questions and answer time, and then, you know, the sort of voting on what was going in was going to be,

894
01:31:13,108 --> 01:31:13,928
further down the line.

895
01:31:14,829 --> 01:31:28,294
Last week, just on Monday, we made the motions to include them to see what they look like in the budget for a final review at the end of either the 19th or if we have another meeting.

896
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:30,775
So I just ask that that language be added.

897
01:31:30,795 --> 01:31:38,198
If I may, just one more minute, just because I know these positions are needed.

898
01:31:38,979 --> 01:31:42,380
My question would be for the 19th, how many

899
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:46,207
what's the overall add position wise?

900
01:31:46,447 --> 01:31:49,508
Is that, how much more is that from year over year?

901
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:52,470
And can we maintain that once this COVID money's gone?

902
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:59,233
I know some of these positions won't be needed, but many of them may still very well be needed or we don't wanna get rid of them.

903
01:31:59,593 --> 01:32:03,776
So I just wanna make sure we're not creating a structural deficit and have to do layoffs in 2025.

904
01:32:03,876 --> 01:32:08,118
Yeah, I think that's a very good question.

905
01:32:08,138 --> 01:32:12,380
I think it's something that we have to be cognizant about throughout the entirety of this budget bill.

906
01:32:12,997 --> 01:32:17,319
Um, so I, and I want to address that matter, if I could just quickly to miss the weapons point.

907
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:26,782
So the votes that you're taking now are helping to, uh, inform the administration as to what we ultimately bring before you on May 19th or very shortly thereafter.

908
01:32:27,262 --> 01:32:39,467
And so, um, if you hear something tonight that makes no sense to you, if there's, if the committee has a philosophical objection, um, this would be a great time for you to tell us because, um, this is what we're driving toward.

909
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,522
And ultimately, this is what you'll see in terms of that recommendation.

910
01:32:43,582 --> 01:32:50,704
So it's not the case that by virtue of a vote tonight, it is guaranteed that anything will be included in the budget.

911
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:59,808
But as we develop a $63 million, $63 plus million budget, we wanna make sure that we're doing that in line with the committee's expectations and priorities.

912
01:33:00,228 --> 01:33:03,250
And so that's what this sort of step-by-step process helps us to do.

913
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:09,272
With regard to the mayor's point, and I think this is certainly consistent with what we've discussed tonight,

914
01:33:09,695 --> 01:33:26,067
that it would be imprudent if we were to take the $7.6 million available to ESSER and fund a slew of teaching positions that we then said to the community, you know, come to Medford, every class is 10 students or fewer.

915
01:33:26,187 --> 01:33:31,571
That would be a ridiculous structural deficit that would absolutely be unsustainable.

916
01:33:32,412 --> 01:33:39,297
That being said, while this money is available, there are positions related to urgent needs

917
01:33:40,272 --> 01:33:48,117
that with a strong nexus to the pandemic, that despite their one-time nature, we will recommend investing in, and it's for two reasons.

918
01:33:48,777 --> 01:33:57,802
One, to address those urgent needs coming out of the pandemic, to try to bridge those gaps so students' educational careers are not defined by this experience.

919
01:33:58,342 --> 01:34:08,068
And two, because it is a forcing mechanism that will compel the district to identify ways to make them sustainable if in fact we feel the need

920
01:34:08,737 --> 01:34:11,458
outlast the immediate aftermath of the pandemic.

921
01:34:12,139 --> 01:34:18,522
Now, there's also a third option that revenues recover, we have an economic boom, and therefore they're both these positions and others are sustainable.

922
01:34:18,762 --> 01:34:19,302
That's obvious.

923
01:34:19,322 --> 01:34:20,863
I think that's everyone's preference.

924
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:24,104
But that's certainly not something that we can just assume is going to happen.

925
01:34:24,544 --> 01:34:31,468
So what we do have to assume is going to happen is either the need dissipates, and therefore the positions are not are not needed.

926
01:34:31,548 --> 01:34:34,389
And again, we're probably talking we're talking we're not we will absolutely articulate

927
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:40,633
at the end of this process, all of them, so that the community has a full understanding as to what the scope of this investment is.

928
01:34:41,854 --> 01:34:51,600
But the other option is we look at both the investments we're making now and the investments we've made over time, and we determine what the needs are going forward.

929
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:59,865
Because every organization of this size is going to have some investments that we're making simply because we always have.

930
01:35:00,525 --> 01:35:03,647
And it is our responsibility to look at that

931
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:13,227
on an ongoing basis and make those decisions so that we can make sure that what is having the most profound impact on students is what we make sustainable over time.

932
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:27,597
And so right now we're talking about FY22, but to the mayor's point, this is, we have to always look at this in the context of the succeeding years and what we can make sustainable and what we can systematize in a way that works best for kids.

933
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:32,781
Member McLaughlin, I think you had the floor, then Member Russo.

934
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,120
Thank you.

935
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:34,920
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

936
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,481
That was helpful explanation.

937
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:38,842
And I do have concerns that I think should be brought up.

938
01:35:39,302 --> 01:35:48,766
And I would ask my colleagues to perhaps let those be heard so that we could all think of them as we're thinking about all the budget in a big picture way.

939
01:35:48,806 --> 01:35:59,190
I did have one more question on the contracted services increase for low incident services not requiring additional full-time staff to the design of several unique student programs offsetting the need for out-of-district placement.

940
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:08,994
Can somebody explain what those contracted services would be for helping support less out of district placement and in these programmatic elements?

941
01:36:09,134 --> 01:36:09,934
What is that line item?

942
01:36:12,456 --> 01:36:16,417
So that would be speech and language and occupational therapy services.

943
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:19,519
Okay.

944
01:36:20,099 --> 01:36:26,162
We have contracted people in those positions right now, but we would like to increase their hours.

945
01:36:27,969 --> 01:36:30,218
Okay, as opposed to staff contractors.

946
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:30,539
Okay.

947
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:38,192
Mayor, do you want me to wait on these other questions?

948
01:36:38,212 --> 01:36:53,055
I do have, you know, just basically, I just wanted to say regarding member, through the chair, regarding member Graham's question, I thought was really pointed around the narrative to describe rationale and how our staff distributed among buildings.

949
01:36:53,115 --> 01:37:02,357
I think that that's a really important piece as we're looking at this, because it is really difficult in the complexity that is special education

950
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:04,383
around so many of these items.

951
01:37:04,523 --> 01:37:10,465
And specifically as we're looking at, you know, student supports and we're talking about equity in the district and how students are supported.

952
01:37:10,525 --> 01:37:16,247
So, you know, if we're looking at our paraprofessionals, I think it's great that we're providing additional training and professional development for them.

953
01:37:16,327 --> 01:37:18,648
I'd like to know, are we providing additional salary for them?

954
01:37:19,368 --> 01:37:24,169
Is there going to be salary increase to account for that additional training and additional responsibilities?

955
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:27,230
And if we have 80 paras right now on our staff,

956
01:37:28,357 --> 01:37:45,092
And there's currently 76 employed, because I know this has been a huge turnover piece as well so when we're talking about allocation of staff under one of your buckets Mr. Murphy, and I'd like the narrative to describe the rationale for the allocation of staff and also how we're addressing the high turnover rates for some of the staff members so we know that the

957
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:59,918
have been, you know, there's been a lot of turnover in those positions and I think, you know, exit interviews and other information I'm sure will give us data around why that is but I would ask, you know, with some classroom narratives how many parents are in the classrooms.

958
01:38:00,338 --> 01:38:05,220
How many are actually one to one and assigned to an individual student versus, you know, in the classroom.

959
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:27,807
You know, asking to be substituted for active substitute teachers in the school and then not allocated to the classroom and what kind of data collection is there around that, you know, how are we tracking para absenteeism and what are we doing about that when there aren't enough Paris like and what we're hearing what the community is hearing and families are sharing with me is that, you know, when this

960
01:38:28,217 --> 01:38:37,405
issue is brought up and staff when this issue is brought up with central administration, there's a there's a yeah there's not enough powers, you know point but there's not sort of okay then what.

961
01:38:38,466 --> 01:38:44,832
And so, again, for the allocation of staff, I think this is really important and if we're not looking at, you know, in the big picture.

962
01:38:45,325 --> 01:38:52,747
You know how we're allocating the support people to these classrooms to allow for so many of the things that we're talking about are important to us, such as equity.

963
01:38:53,307 --> 01:39:01,489
Across the district and as Member Graham also noted, you know the gen ed inclusion that's noted on the right of our program elements in our schools.

964
01:39:02,049 --> 01:39:06,050
And the CO teaching and you know, as you can see, I think the differentiation for that there was that.

965
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:08,631
there is no co-teaching at the elementary school level.

966
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:19,494
There's what you know is is labeled as gen ed inclusion but again it takes the coordinated program review or whatever that's called now the audit basically of the programs to understand what that actually looks like.

967
01:39:19,514 --> 01:39:23,416
So it's a very complex department all of this to say is a very complex department.

968
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:27,417
So I would be asking for these sort of big picture things that I think are really

969
01:39:28,039 --> 01:39:32,521
important based on my communication and contact with this community.

970
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:44,766
And the para distribution and allocation, I know that, for example, in the McGlynn school, in the middle school program, you know, we have two classrooms, there's a sixth classroom with one para, you know, and a 7-8 with no para.

971
01:39:45,326 --> 01:39:48,528
And so while it looks like there's paras assigned to those classrooms,

972
01:39:49,868 --> 01:39:50,969
there are two different classrooms.

973
01:39:51,009 --> 01:39:53,992
And so we don't understand that there's actually zero paras in one classroom.

974
01:39:54,412 --> 01:40:01,199
So we need to be able to disaggregate that a little bit to better understand, especially as we're talking about equity across the district.

975
01:40:01,239 --> 01:40:06,744
And then the other big things I'm hearing is that there's no unified music or art or adaptive PE.

976
01:40:06,804 --> 01:40:13,050
So the rare opportunities that are being provided, frankly, right now for inclusion, meaningful inclusion in the district,

977
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:23,038
for our students with low incidence disability and higher need are generally in these specials, which are, you know, art and music and PE, but they're not adapted.

978
01:40:23,098 --> 01:40:34,828
So, in fact, the students are actually not able to participate, especially imagine music class when you're learning the complexities of instrumental notes and you have a student who is, you know, in an access classroom or language-based classroom,

979
01:40:35,212 --> 01:40:36,833
that lesson's not appropriate for them.

980
01:40:37,514 --> 01:40:40,756
And so how are we differentiating curriculum or how are we looking at that?

981
01:40:40,796 --> 01:40:44,239
So I think that again, gets back to PD for our teachers and our staff.

982
01:40:44,259 --> 01:40:49,003
So there's some bigger sort of elemental pieces that I think we're not talking about here.

983
01:40:49,103 --> 01:40:56,108
And I don't know, I guess I'm deferring to my colleagues and to the staff on how do we address those issues?

984
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,711
Mayor, if I could, I think,

985
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,861
One of that is curriculum.

986
01:41:01,921 --> 01:41:03,862
So yeah, if you could address it, Mr. Murphy.

987
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:14,871
I mean, I think that the only thing I would say that I would, you know, I'm not sure disagree is the right term, but maybe part ways to some degree is that we're not talking about these things.

988
01:41:14,931 --> 01:41:20,955
Cause I think we are attempting to talk about them in a very extensive way.

989
01:41:21,336 --> 01:41:27,820
And if you recall on Monday evening, we talked about identifying the need for classroom paraprofessionals.

990
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:29,882
There are multiple reasons for that, but one of them is,

991
01:41:30,258 --> 01:41:39,725
we need to move to a place in which we are creating the conditions in which there are more students in inclusive environments.

992
01:41:39,785 --> 01:41:58,359
And one of the ways to do that is making sure that every single paraprofessional employed by the district, with the exception of kindergarten grades, kindergarten age rather, are not budgeted only on special education, because we need to make sure that we're not, to the point that was made earlier, we're not seeing special education as a side.

993
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:04,662
special education has to be a fully integrated part of our educational program.

994
01:42:05,142 --> 01:42:23,467
And with regard to PE and the specials, I think that what we're trying to do is identify the most effective and impactful strategies to achieve the types of environments that Member McLaughlin is speaking to.

995
01:42:23,827 --> 01:42:27,188
Whether that's hiring specific personnel or

996
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:38,538
engaging in the necessary conversations with our existing personnel to begin to ensure that everyone is properly credentialed to serve all students.

997
01:42:39,178 --> 01:42:47,502
These are the types of big picture conversations that have to occur in this fiscal year and most likely to some extent in the fiscal years after that.

998
01:42:48,202 --> 01:42:56,066
So this budget and the proposals that are coming before you are an attempt to continue that work where it's happening

999
01:42:56,722 --> 01:43:01,845
and to build the foundation for additional inclusive environments where it's not happening.

1000
01:43:02,025 --> 01:43:07,288
And as we talked about Monday, I don't think we're making the case that it's happening everywhere.

1001
01:43:07,328 --> 01:43:08,689
We're doing everything right.

1002
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:19,296
If we thought we were doing everything right, I think you'd have a much more boring set of budget proposals before you because we wouldn't need to be advocating for this or prioritizing.

1003
01:43:19,636 --> 01:43:21,737
So there is change that needs to occur.

1004
01:43:22,638 --> 01:43:23,198
And I think that

1005
01:43:23,806 --> 01:43:30,731
our hope is to start using this document along with others to start building the roadmap toward that.

1006
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:34,234
Thank you.

1007
01:43:35,035 --> 01:43:35,635
Member Russo?

1008
01:43:37,076 --> 01:43:37,517
Thank you.

1009
01:43:37,537 --> 01:43:43,001
I have a sort of a request where we talk about structural deficits.

1010
01:43:43,081 --> 01:43:50,787
Each time I hear it discussed, it's discussed in the context of, you know, we're going to hire a bunch of teachers and have to lay them off.

1011
01:43:52,282 --> 01:43:54,643
hear anybody suggesting we hire a bunch of teachers.

1012
01:43:55,963 --> 01:44:12,688
And for me being fiscally conservative, because we're afraid of what will happen in three years, when we know what is happening now to our children, and what will happen in the next year, that they have significant now and in the next year or two, at least significant emotional and mental health needs.

1013
01:44:13,769 --> 01:44:18,290
And it seems totally irresponsible to be so concerned that three years from now,

1014
01:44:19,081 --> 01:44:22,283
we may have a difficulty to deal with.

1015
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:27,505
The federal government has been wildly generous to help us meet the needs of our children.

1016
01:44:27,985 --> 01:44:30,686
And we should be wildly aggressive in meeting those needs.

1017
01:44:31,147 --> 01:44:35,528
And if that means three years from now, the city has to make a choice that is uncomfortable.

1018
01:44:36,009 --> 01:44:41,751
Well, the city is making uncomfortable choices for 39 years since Prop 2.5 went into effect.

1019
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:47,574
I don't remember the mayor in the last budget being very happy about the choices that were before her.

1020
01:44:48,299 --> 01:44:50,200
It was horrible, it was uncomfortable.

1021
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:53,903
And as far as I'm concerned, it has been for 39 years.

1022
01:44:54,763 --> 01:44:56,525
Different levels of discomfort, sure.

1023
01:44:57,025 --> 01:45:11,315
But I just think that worrying about three years from now, meaning we won't go whole hog in addressing the needs of our kids, to me just,

1024
01:45:12,268 --> 01:45:14,910
know, I don't want to hear about what's going to happen in three years.

1025
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:28,458
If in three years we have to lay a bunch of people off because there is no other option, if you tell me that has to happen, but between now and three years from now we have kept a bunch of kids from going over the cliff, I'm game.

1026
01:45:28,718 --> 01:45:34,042
Hire the people and we will suffer terribly in three years when we have to figure out who we have to let go.

1027
01:45:34,582 --> 01:45:35,743
But the kids are now.

1028
01:45:36,543 --> 01:45:37,584
We're not supposed to be

1029
01:45:38,102 --> 01:45:40,964
meeting the needs of the employees three years from now.

1030
01:45:41,184 --> 01:45:43,086
We're supposed to be meeting the needs of the kids now.

1031
01:45:43,266 --> 01:45:48,229
So if we could talk about the fiscal cliff a little differently, I would greatly appreciate it.

1032
01:45:48,249 --> 01:45:52,432
Mr. Sugg, the only thing I would say is we're looking at both.

1033
01:45:52,492 --> 01:46:05,522
I mean, we absolutely, and I think that the, I hope that the way we've constructed this and the prioritization that we've put toward students' immediate needs and framing the entire budget set of proposals around how do we reduce and eliminate

1034
01:46:05,962 --> 01:46:09,304
learning and opportunity gaps that have been caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

1035
01:46:09,704 --> 01:46:15,847
I hope that speaks to our commitment to making sure that we are addressing those immediate needs with a sense of urgency.

1036
01:46:16,267 --> 01:46:19,729
And at the same time, we're always looking long-term and making sure that we're making investments.

1037
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:25,011
But again, I wouldn't say that's necessarily about how many people we're going to have to lay off in the next three years.

1038
01:46:25,412 --> 01:46:27,392
I don't think that's necessarily constructive.

1039
01:46:27,433 --> 01:46:34,436
I think we look at it more as this is a great opportunity to make investments and to identify best practices so that we can

1040
01:46:35,179 --> 01:46:41,041
identify what needs to be sustained going forward, regardless of the capacity that we have.

1041
01:46:41,081 --> 01:46:46,883
And I think that is part of what I think is a real benefit to the funding that's come in.

1042
01:46:47,263 --> 01:46:49,483
It's giving us a great opportunity to do that.

1043
01:46:49,543 --> 01:46:51,564
So I'm not just trying to put a positive spin on it.

1044
01:46:51,584 --> 01:46:55,385
I honestly believe that this is a really positive opportunity for us.

1045
01:46:56,065 --> 01:46:59,486
Obviously, not the conditions in which we would ever like to.

1046
01:46:59,886 --> 01:47:01,887
There's other ways that we would have all preferred to have

1047
01:47:02,305 --> 01:47:06,186
great investment and a worldwide pandemic probably wouldn't be at the top of anyone's list.

1048
01:47:06,946 --> 01:47:11,767
But I think based on where we are right now, this is a great opportunity for us and we're going to try to make the most of it.

1049
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:13,487
Thank you.

1050
01:47:13,707 --> 01:47:17,228
I just wanted to, you know, I'm not questioning anybody's motives, by the way.

1051
01:47:18,028 --> 01:47:20,749
I'm just saying our messaging here is not good.

1052
01:47:21,809 --> 01:47:27,650
It is not good that we are so concerned about three years from now, what's going to happen to our employees.

1053
01:47:28,717 --> 01:47:34,002
when I don't hear anybody in the public clamoring for what's gonna happen to employees in three years from now.

1054
01:47:34,502 --> 01:47:39,166
All I hear them clamoring about is the kids now and in the fall.

1055
01:47:39,867 --> 01:47:49,995
And frankly, I think if we surveyed the Medford residents, we would be shocked at how few people were concerned about what was gonna happen to employees of the school system three years from now.

1056
01:47:50,556 --> 01:47:51,837
I know you have to care about it.

1057
01:47:52,297 --> 01:47:53,298
I do care about it.

1058
01:47:54,439 --> 01:47:55,300
I do care about it.

1059
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:59,663
But from a messaging perspective, it just is not coming across.

1060
01:47:59,683 --> 01:48:01,124
This is about the kids.

1061
01:48:01,244 --> 01:48:02,185
It's about the money.

1062
01:48:03,006 --> 01:48:07,489
And that just really is getting, it's just continuous, it seems.

1063
01:48:07,609 --> 01:48:08,410
So thank you.

1064
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:24,522
I don't know how you can say, you know, questioning the motives when you, you know, for a mayor to be concerned that we have this amazing opportunity of,

1065
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:30,035
a very large amount of money and to have three years to spend it.

1066
01:48:30,516 --> 01:48:42,324
And then to know you may not have the ability to maintain that come 2025, which would greatly affect our children with the changes we'd have to make.

1067
01:48:43,845 --> 01:48:47,847
I have to be fiscally responsible and at least ask the questions.

1068
01:48:48,027 --> 01:48:54,752
So I am worried about creating a structural deficit for whoever may be handling

1069
01:48:55,535 --> 01:48:59,398
all the needs of the city, including our children, which I care about very much.

1070
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:13,950
Well, I mean, if I may, Mayor, I mean, three years from now, you can decide to give all other departments a 0% raise in the entire city and give the school system all that other money.

1071
01:49:15,051 --> 01:49:17,413
And then there will be no layoffs, no matter what we do today.

1072
01:49:17,893 --> 01:49:25,119
So, I mean, these are choices that can be made and pretending that they're just, we don't have options is not helpful.

1073
01:49:26,788 --> 01:49:29,869
So I'm not worried about- I never said we don't have options.

1074
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:37,294
I'm just asking about, you know, if we hire 20 new positions, how does that differ from hiring 30 or 40 or 50?

1075
01:49:38,254 --> 01:49:39,815
Where will we be in a few years?

1076
01:49:40,135 --> 01:49:41,716
And how will we maintain that?

1077
01:49:42,037 --> 01:49:44,478
Because we want to be realistic as well.

1078
01:49:45,739 --> 01:49:48,881
I want to actually build a budget that meets the needs of the students.

1079
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:50,722
And then we talk about money.

1080
01:49:51,348 --> 01:49:54,351
And that's not how we're doing it.

1081
01:49:54,371 --> 01:50:08,047
You still have to live in reality, Member Russo, and we have a good deal of money, which is wonderful, but to create a budget that we cannot maintain and to spend it all in one year, like you probably would like,

1082
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:13,413
is not gonna be beneficial for the city next year or the year after.

1083
01:50:13,433 --> 01:50:16,996
So let's just try to build the best budget we can.

1084
01:50:17,016 --> 01:50:19,758
I can ask my questions the way I'd like.

1085
01:50:19,858 --> 01:50:21,599
You can ask your questions the way you'd like.

1086
01:50:23,741 --> 01:50:24,601
We'll leave it at that.

1087
01:50:26,963 --> 01:50:30,245
Member McLaughlin, do you have any other further questions or should we move the motion?

1088
01:50:32,807 --> 01:50:34,008
If I may.

1089
01:50:35,449 --> 01:50:36,450
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1090
01:50:36,766 --> 01:50:37,246
Thank you.

1091
01:50:37,807 --> 01:50:39,608
I have, okay.

1092
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:57,542
The note about the collaboration with MFN and Shelly Gross, I was just wondering what that was and if there was any sort of financial implication on that with either grant funding or what that actually is.

1093
01:50:57,562 --> 01:50:58,823
I think this is for Ms.

1094
01:50:58,843 --> 01:50:59,103
Bowen.

1095
01:51:00,087 --> 01:51:05,590
So I think that was so that let me say that, restate that.

1096
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:14,195
So we want to collaborate with Marie Cassidy and family network and use our in-district resources for presentations.

1097
01:51:14,955 --> 01:51:27,703
We worked with Marie recently with one of the autism support groups, but we'd like to be able to work better with her and offer more of our district resources for when

1098
01:51:28,463 --> 01:51:33,326
this PD or workshops that they're offering and to use our staff and to have input.

1099
01:51:33,827 --> 01:51:34,487
That'd be great.

1100
01:51:34,607 --> 01:51:34,927
Thank you.

1101
01:51:34,947 --> 01:51:35,848
I wanted to know what that was.

1102
01:51:35,928 --> 01:51:36,729
That's very helpful.

1103
01:51:36,909 --> 01:51:44,574
And it could even, well, depending on, yeah, okay, for grant money, that could be interesting as well, just to, you know, sort of put that into the grant writing.

1104
01:51:44,974 --> 01:51:45,414
That's great.

1105
01:51:45,534 --> 01:51:45,895
Thank you.

1106
01:51:45,975 --> 01:51:53,059
And then let me see the shifts, roles and responsibilities as one of your goals.

1107
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:56,202
What does that mean under the special under your request, Joan, Ms.

1108
01:51:56,782 --> 01:51:57,002
Bowen?

1109
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:13,207
So that's what we wanna look at is when we go into collective bargaining to talk about different roles, more roles that people can take on, distributing things, enhancing people's portfolios, that sort of thing.

1110
01:52:14,007 --> 01:52:26,817
Okay, and then for the enhancing the portfolios, getting back to the training that's happening for the paraprofessionals, again, is that gonna include a pay increase for additional roles and training that they've received?

1111
01:52:27,475 --> 01:52:29,616
That would be a matter of bargaining.

1112
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,216
So it's certainly possible.

1113
01:52:31,276 --> 01:52:38,018
And every time we look at expansion of roles and responsibilities, the compensation is a piece that we always have to be mindful of.

1114
01:52:38,538 --> 01:52:42,099
Sometimes it's changing roles and responsibilities as opposed to expanding.

1115
01:52:42,739 --> 01:52:44,800
And so that's something that we would certainly take a look at.

1116
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:47,140
To the point that you made earlier, Ms.

1117
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:53,642
Gautham, we know that we've had recruitment challenges with regard to recruitment and retention challenges with regard to some of our positions.

1118
01:52:53,702 --> 01:52:56,303
So that will certainly be a factor.

1119
01:52:57,042 --> 01:53:01,954
When we develop those strategies, but with nine expiring collective bargaining agreements.

1120
01:53:03,639 --> 01:53:04,902
Yeah, I think I want to go into.

1121
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:06,251
No, I know.

1122
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:07,652
I don't want the specific details.

1123
01:53:07,672 --> 01:53:08,553
I appreciate that.

1124
01:53:08,613 --> 01:53:11,155
Certainly something we're mindful of.

1125
01:53:11,376 --> 01:53:11,716
Thank you.

1126
01:53:12,997 --> 01:53:13,458
That's fine.

1127
01:53:13,658 --> 01:53:14,018
Thank you.

1128
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:19,103
And then I guess I would ask, you know, back to member Graham's point, Ms.

1129
01:53:19,123 --> 01:53:26,030
Bowen, if we could include the narrative for the schools with, you know, some of that disaggregated information, that would be really helpful.

1130
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,371
And I can, you know,

1131
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:30,753
clarify offline with you if that's useful.

1132
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:38,378
And then under the Curtis-Tufts, I'm wondering why 22 students and no paraprofessionals at the Curtis-Tufts?

1133
01:53:39,538 --> 01:53:42,920
That's why it's a priority for next year to address that.

1134
01:53:45,001 --> 01:53:45,261
Okay.

1135
01:53:45,842 --> 01:53:50,184
We did have a vacancy mid-year, and we have been trying to refill that position.

1136
01:53:50,204 --> 01:53:52,565
Okay.

1137
01:53:53,146 --> 01:53:53,586
I think

1138
01:53:55,293 --> 01:53:58,195
I think that might be it between everyone else's questions.

1139
01:53:58,236 --> 01:54:00,037
I'm sure if I have more, I can email you.

1140
01:54:00,117 --> 01:54:08,024
So, and the adaptive PE in unified music and arts, we'll just, I guess, continue that conversation is what I'm hearing.

1141
01:54:08,945 --> 01:54:12,087
It will be addressed next week in the academic presentations.

1142
01:54:14,009 --> 01:54:14,289
Okay.

1143
01:54:14,649 --> 01:54:17,191
I think I'll carry over some of these questions for that then.

1144
01:54:17,252 --> 01:54:17,652
Thank you.

1145
01:54:19,614 --> 01:54:21,255
Thank you, member McLaughlin and member Graham.

1146
01:54:24,366 --> 01:54:31,613
I just wanted to address what I think we've heard from the administration a couple of times now, which is that

1147
01:54:33,059 --> 01:54:37,961
The structure of our organization leaves a lot to be desired in terms of how it serves children.

1148
01:54:38,742 --> 01:54:46,145
And before this school year is over, we'll be reviewing and revisiting the strategic plan that was put on hold.

1149
01:54:46,765 --> 01:54:53,428
And while I don't expect the strategic plan to hold all the answers to what the specific

1150
01:54:54,468 --> 01:55:01,696
look of the organization should be, because that is not work that can be done in haste.

1151
01:55:02,257 --> 01:55:06,682
I will absolutely be expecting the strategic plan to address when we will see

1152
01:55:07,312 --> 01:55:21,204
the recommendations around how the structure of our organization needs to change to reflect the needs of our district right now versus the way we have always organized the district.

1153
01:55:22,025 --> 01:55:27,549
I am not interested in administrative positions because we have always had them.

1154
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:32,714
I am interested in administrative positions because we need them to serve kids.

1155
01:55:33,935 --> 01:55:47,047
And so I think that really does mean taking a very hard look at everything from how the departments are set up versus the schools are set up versus who has authority on what.

1156
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:56,215
It includes taking a very hard look at the fact that there are more IEPs at the Brooks School than there are at the McGlynn School, which is a staggering

1157
01:55:58,057 --> 01:56:05,443
surface observation tells me there's something very systemically wrong with how we identify children who need support and services.

1158
01:56:06,604 --> 01:56:08,986
And the list goes on.

1159
01:56:09,107 --> 01:56:18,835
So I think that being fiscally responsible for me means making sure that the organization serves its mission and its purpose.

1160
01:56:19,499 --> 01:56:29,409
And I think we are sort of in the middle of the road on that on that matter right now like we we could be doing better and we should do better.

1161
01:56:29,429 --> 01:56:34,394
And as we think about what those things are that we need to do better and be better at.

1162
01:56:35,255 --> 01:56:35,875
I do think.

1163
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:52,025
In the balance that will settle out some of the discomfort around what might happen in three years, because my expectation is that the district looks very, very different than it does to today, three years down the road so unfortunately.

1164
01:56:52,625 --> 01:57:08,277
were a strategic plan in place this conversation would be so much easier right now because we would be looking at what are the things we were going to do in three years and can we advance them into the district sooner, which avoids the the notion of some sort of a fiscal cliff.

1165
01:57:09,698 --> 01:57:29,306
we would be looking at what our needs are when we plan to have them and how does that how does that set of priorities and needs change based on the pandemic and because we don't have that plan well in place and known to the community we're sort of in this position where we're trying to like do a lot at the same time which includes rationalizing

1166
01:57:30,866 --> 01:57:52,174
how we spend money that the federal government has bestowed directly upon the district and presumably at some point money that has been bestowed to the city, as well as how do we help kids recover from what has been the most trying year that any adult on the call tonight can

1167
01:57:53,505 --> 01:57:54,646
remember in their history.

1168
01:57:54,866 --> 01:57:59,568
Imagine if you were eight, how impactful and meaningful this is in your life.

1169
01:58:00,588 --> 01:58:06,171
As well as, gee, we weren't where we wanted to be before the pandemic hit.

1170
01:58:06,411 --> 01:58:15,095
How do we mush all of that together and come out with something that doesn't require us to just accept how we have always done business?

1171
01:58:16,495 --> 01:58:26,383
I am not afraid to spend money in the right now if it forces us to really be motivated to have those discussions, because those discussions have to happen.

1172
01:58:27,164 --> 01:58:27,884
They're hard.

1173
01:58:27,904 --> 01:58:29,385
They're uncomfortable.

1174
01:58:30,746 --> 01:58:40,294
And if the only thing we do as a byproduct of serving kids right now is force those discussions, we will all be better off for it, and so will the district.

1175
01:58:44,557 --> 01:58:46,178
I would like to move member Ms.

1176
01:58:46,198 --> 01:58:51,422
Stone's question if there are no more questions, but I did just want member Ms.

1177
01:58:51,442 --> 01:58:53,704
Stone to repeat her motion.

1178
01:58:57,246 --> 01:58:57,627
Member Ms.

1179
01:58:57,647 --> 01:58:58,027
Stone.

1180
01:58:58,527 --> 01:58:58,887
All right.

1181
01:58:59,168 --> 01:59:00,369
Seconded by member Kratz.

1182
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:02,030
Very good, thank you.

1183
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:09,475
The motion was just that the superintendent's recommendations, the four levels are included in the budget.

1184
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:11,797
Thank you.

1185
01:59:15,773 --> 01:59:15,953
to review.

1186
01:59:15,973 --> 01:59:20,236
Um, see if the four levels will be included first to review in the budget.

1187
01:59:20,296 --> 01:59:24,459
First review for final discussion on the end at the end of the month.

1188
01:59:24,739 --> 01:59:26,080
That's the 19th or another date.

1189
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:27,621
Yes.

1190
01:59:27,781 --> 01:59:28,221
Thank you.

1191
01:59:29,322 --> 01:59:31,123
Miss that was seconded by member Kratz.

1192
01:59:31,644 --> 01:59:32,504
Is there Mayor?

1193
01:59:32,885 --> 01:59:33,725
I just have a question.

1194
01:59:34,085 --> 01:59:34,666
Member Russo.

1195
01:59:35,446 --> 01:59:35,786
Thank you.

1196
01:59:36,787 --> 01:59:37,648
This is for

1197
01:59:45,948 --> 01:59:49,189
many new students coming in with mental health needs.

1198
01:59:51,110 --> 01:59:54,212
Some of those students will end up with IEPs because of this, correct?

1199
01:59:56,052 --> 01:59:57,413
If they're found eligible, yes.

1200
01:59:57,513 --> 02:00:04,096
If they have a disability and they're not making effective progress, that's how we determine if a student requires specialized services.

1201
02:00:05,176 --> 02:00:13,440
And just from a logistical perspective, I know that I think everybody here who's aware of this stuff knows that

1202
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:22,262
If you had anything short of an emergency room need from a mental health crisis perspective, you can't get an appointment for a kid, even if you're rich.

1203
02:00:22,682 --> 02:00:27,063
I mean, paying out of pocket is probably your only option and still there's wait lists.

1204
02:00:27,704 --> 02:00:41,247
So have you been planning for a flood of new IEPs related to mental health services that will not, the only option for mental health services will be within the school system?

1205
02:00:42,996 --> 02:00:47,442
So we have not received a high number of referrals for social emotional.

1206
02:00:48,183 --> 02:00:58,596
There are a wide variety of needs but we are looking at that to see that's why we're looking at for our el population to have a counselor for them.

1207
02:01:00,358 --> 02:01:09,920
It's the engagement or re-engagement in school, but I do anticipate we are going to see a higher number of referrals when we come back in the fall.

1208
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:21,163
I don't know what disability category it will fall under, but I do anticipate that there is going to be probably more social emotional, but also a lot of learning disabilities as well.

1209
02:01:21,183 --> 02:01:23,503
Okay, thank you.

1210
02:01:23,523 --> 02:01:27,904
I mean, my concern is that kids who have low level needs

1211
02:01:28,552 --> 02:01:52,449
that might've typically been relatively easy to get resolved with a, you know, visiting a counselor or something in the community, that since that will not happen, that these needs will escalate and create a bigger demand on your services and on Ms.

1212
02:01:52,469 --> 02:01:53,930
Schulman's services as well.

1213
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,992
And I'm just worried about whether or not

1214
02:01:59,887 --> 02:02:02,349
Well, I mean, how quickly can we respond to that?

1215
02:02:02,729 --> 02:02:06,471
And from a budget perspective, are there other options?

1216
02:02:07,211 --> 02:02:12,674
I'm guessing ESSER would clearly qualify for spending that money.

1217
02:02:14,295 --> 02:02:18,017
And so maybe this isn't necessary in the budget, but it's just something.

1218
02:02:18,298 --> 02:02:27,883
And I, of course, understand that finding the professionals in the community to do services isn't possible, while hiring more staff to do that work also is probably as equally

1219
02:02:28,962 --> 02:02:30,303
impossible as well.

1220
02:02:30,424 --> 02:02:49,118
So then I'm just hoping that you're planning for things around, you know, what other training do the current, the current people that are here in the district, you know, the teachers and everybody like whether they like it or not, the kids are coming into their classes, and they're going to need their more than they've needed before.

1221
02:02:49,138 --> 02:02:52,441
And there's not going to be somebody to send them to.

1222
02:02:52,561 --> 02:02:56,204
So but I guess that's all extra stuff.

1223
02:02:56,224 --> 02:02:56,404
And I

1224
02:02:57,264 --> 02:02:59,105
we don't have to keep going.

1225
02:02:59,125 --> 02:03:16,970
That's why we're including the fourth row there so that you can see that as we talked about this before, but just like we can't consider ESSER just fully integrated into the operating budget, we also can't wall off ESSER as if ESSER is serving the needs of some other district down the street, right?

1226
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:20,151
But there is overlap eventually and the interests collide.

1227
02:03:20,511 --> 02:03:24,512
And so we're both identifying where the strongest nexus is to make

1228
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:27,497
the appropriate use of those ESSER funds.

1229
02:03:27,958 --> 02:03:35,662
And at the same time, we're building the budgets concurrently, essentially, so that we can move aggressively to do exactly what you're talking about.

1230
02:03:35,702 --> 02:03:44,247
And frankly, in many respects, we're more concerned about finding the personnel than we are having the funding.

1231
02:03:44,627 --> 02:03:49,190
The funding, in many cases, is going to be there due to the ESSER funds.

1232
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:54,593
But every district, and this is why we need to begin posting positions, recruiting, interviewing, and hiring,

1233
02:03:55,010 --> 02:04:06,493
is because every district is talking about this right now, is grappling with this, and they are going to be, from health services, to mental health counseling, to instructional positions.

1234
02:04:07,713 --> 02:04:14,655
Every district is going to be in a hiring mode, and we have to be competitive and bring the talent in as quickly as possible.

1235
02:04:20,477 --> 02:04:23,058
Okay, we have a motion on the floor with a second.

1236
02:04:23,558 --> 02:04:24,418
Is there a roll call?

1237
02:04:25,872 --> 02:04:26,493
Member Graham.

1238
02:04:26,973 --> 02:04:27,253
Yes.

1239
02:04:29,215 --> 02:04:29,795
Member Kretz.

1240
02:04:30,276 --> 02:04:30,496
Yes.

1241
02:04:31,156 --> 02:04:31,917
Member McLaughlin.

1242
02:04:31,937 --> 02:04:32,157
Yes.

1243
02:04:32,217 --> 02:04:32,998

1244
02:04:33,258 --> 02:04:33,518
Yes.

1245
02:04:34,459 --> 02:04:35,139
Member Rousseau.

1246
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:35,960
Yes.

1247
02:04:37,521 --> 02:04:38,282
Member Van de Kloot.

1248
02:04:44,527 --> 02:04:44,787
Yes.

1249
02:04:46,148 --> 02:04:46,849
Mayor Longo-Kern.

1250
02:04:47,950 --> 02:04:48,270
Yes.

1251
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:50,432
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1252
02:04:50,652 --> 02:04:51,873
The motion passes.

1253
02:04:53,547 --> 02:04:54,768
have a great night, everybody.

1254
02:04:54,788 --> 02:04:56,070
Motion to adjourn.

1255
02:04:56,591 --> 02:05:00,515
I'm member McLaughlin, seconded by member Graham.

1256
02:05:00,675 --> 02:05:01,116
Roll call.

1257
02:05:02,677 --> 02:05:03,278

1258
02:05:03,839 --> 02:05:04,119
Yes.

1259

Member Kretz?

1260
02:05:07,783 --> 02:05:08,004
Yes.

1261

Yes.

Yes.

02:05:19,156 --> 02:05:19,397
Yes.

1270
02:05:19,457 --> 02:05:20,838
