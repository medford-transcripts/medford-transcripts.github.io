1
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:29,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of your show, Method Happenings.

2
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:31,616
[SPEAKER_00]: I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:48,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's show features George Scarpelli, who will be addressing truth, facts, and information about the upcoming override questions in Method, which are questions six, seven, and eight.

4
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank George for appearing on a prior show.

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a video presentation from an all-Meffitt meeting that I attended.

6
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:05,732
[SPEAKER_00]: This was recorded and produced by Joe DiMeo at Joe DiMeo Creative.

7
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Joe, for helping us out with the videos.

8
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:15,434
[SPEAKER_00]: George Garpelli is a current Meffitt City Councilor and has been for 15 years.

9
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:20,496
[SPEAKER_00]: George represents all citizens of Medford.

10
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:29,143
[SPEAKER_00]: He has proposed viable solutions as opposed to increasing taxes to the citizens of Medford.

11
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:32,386
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a champion of citizens.

12
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:41,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth and facts drive his ideas, and he does not support the overrides and debt exclusion.

13
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:44,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to the video right now.

14
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:13,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.

15
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:25,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.

16
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:27,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And that reads,

17
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:58,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That exclusion on fire stations shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs

18
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,688
[SPEAKER_01]: incidental to related there too.

19
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.

20
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,132
[SPEAKER_01]: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.

21
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:21,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.

22
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:28,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.

23
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:30,367
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they've been treated.

24
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?

25
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:47,672
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.

26
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're willing to stand up and say what?

27
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:57,915
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt

28
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,912
[SPEAKER_01]: financially for an inferior product.

29
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:06,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do not vote for question six.

30
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Danielle.

31
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.

32
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:26,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate

33
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:33,245
[SPEAKER_01]: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.

34
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:53,734
[SPEAKER_01]: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance, and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited

35
00:04:54,877 --> 00:05:01,701
[SPEAKER_01]: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.

36
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:08,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this question seven.

37
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:12,366
[SPEAKER_01]: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.

38
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:24,533
[SPEAKER_01]: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.

39
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:27,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.

40
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.

41
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:31,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

42
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,731
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an initiative that I put forth years ago.

43
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:48,321
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.

44
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And we never saw sidewalks being done.

45
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,764
[SPEAKER_01]: We could never catch up.

46
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know my colleagues say, see?

47
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:54,566
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

48
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:55,246
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right.

49
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:55,887
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no money.

50
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:57,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Not right.

51
00:05:58,769 --> 00:05:59,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong.

52
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:05,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I love the dialogue.

53
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:13,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.

54
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:24,917
[SPEAKER_01]: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.

55
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we been resourceful?

56
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:35,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?

57
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,340
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

58
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:45,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.

59
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:54,005
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,

60
00:06:55,291 --> 00:07:03,977
[SPEAKER_01]: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.

61
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,359
[SPEAKER_01]: We showed them that avenue through free cash.

62
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did they do?

63
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,524
[SPEAKER_01]: They imposed a rule to shut me up.

64
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we move forward.

65
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:22,570
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.

66
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And that school kid member said,

67
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,615
[SPEAKER_01]: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?

68
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?

69
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame on that person.

70
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:48,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?

71
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the $5 million out of free cash.

72
00:07:52,669 --> 00:08:01,261
[SPEAKER_01]: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.

73
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.

74
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the drama behind this.

75
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:21,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Question 8 is intense.

76
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Question 8.

77
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:36,380
[SPEAKER_01]: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed,

78
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:45,874
[SPEAKER_01]: level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.

79
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:47,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that sound expensive?

80
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:48,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Vocational.

81
00:08:49,655 --> 00:09:01,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe what it is, Roy you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.

82
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,638
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're asking for, right?

83
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:10,525
[SPEAKER_01]: What, I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost?

84
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:17,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we're looking at is nothing close to $4 million.

85
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close.

86
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:20,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close.

87
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand the trend here.

88
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:25,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Six, we heard.

89
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:28,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven and eight, education.

90
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:33,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand every single community that has fought for an override

91
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,747
[SPEAKER_01]: and their communities has used what?

92
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,150
[SPEAKER_01]: The children in the schools.

93
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.

94
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:56,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I asked my colleagues, and the people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?

95
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were there, and you still have it.

96
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:06,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's understand this.

97
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.

98
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share with your friends.

99
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:24,884
[SPEAKER_01]: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.

100
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,105
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not want it, never.

101
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,286
[SPEAKER_01]: That was never said.

102
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:31,927
[SPEAKER_01]: What we said,

103
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,842
[SPEAKER_01]: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.

104
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bring everybody together to the table.

105
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have an open and transparent process.

106
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:50,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.

107
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't divide the community.

108
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,118
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what has happened now.

109
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:57,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're dividing.

110
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's yes or no.

111
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be honest with you.

112
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:10,044
[SPEAKER_01]: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.

113
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,545
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have $34 million in free cash.

114
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:25,027
[SPEAKER_01]: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.

115
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:27,207
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're talking about.

116
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:29,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who don't know,

117
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:36,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand, it's never quick with me.

118
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:40,450
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.

119
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:49,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caviello was there, Council President Beas was there.

120
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:56,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.

121
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:57,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too dangerous.

122
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were all for it.

123
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:15,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Carviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're going to vote for the budget.

124
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:17,766
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come to an agreement.

125
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:18,506
[SPEAKER_01]: What agreement?

126
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what agreement it was.

127
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:25,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Carviello, Councilor Mike didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.

128
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:29,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.

129
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,143
[SPEAKER_01]: A financial task force was created.

130
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:42,170
[SPEAKER_01]: A school kid member, two city counselors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.

131
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:49,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Five people with no background in financial battles.

132
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:50,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.

133
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:57,222
[SPEAKER_01]: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.

134
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So we move forward, this financial task force is meeting, we don't hear anything.

135
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:04,564
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no minutes, there's no information.

136
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,327
[SPEAKER_01]: We're told we're gonna get a meeting before we do anything.

137
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.

138
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:22,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our city council meeting, and I believe it was a week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart resident,

139
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,603
[SPEAKER_01]: very important, powerful question.

140
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:32,587
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?

141
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:38,511
[SPEAKER_01]: That means devastation for the school department and our children.

142
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:41,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine.

143
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:48,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?

144
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Use our free cash.

145
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.

146
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:59,654
[SPEAKER_01]: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.

147
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:04,115
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what happened?

148
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:05,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Rule 21.

149
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:09,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Counsel Scott Pelley shut down, can't speak.

150
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how we're getting messages.

151
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,439
[SPEAKER_01]: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.

152
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,319
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what they came out with.

153
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,941
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information, how do we get there, who was involved?

154
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:25,181
[SPEAKER_01]: No answer.

155
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:31,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.

156
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:32,258
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

157
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:34,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is all true.

158
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:37,141
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all on tape.

159
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:49,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.

160
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.

161
00:14:56,038 --> 00:15:07,125
[SPEAKER_01]: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.

162
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:20,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.

163
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Done, you can't talk about it.

164
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:34,421
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.

165
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:35,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.

166
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.

167
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:45,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.

168
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:47,966
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't wanna talk about it.

169
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,906
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what do we do?

170
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,347
[SPEAKER_01]: We move on to the next meeting, and they said okay.

171
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?

172
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:57,445
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do?

173
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:05,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, okay, legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.

174
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,907
[SPEAKER_01]: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.

175
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we get to the next meeting.

176
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.

177
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Suspends the rules.

178
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:19,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Says they cannot impose rule 21.

179
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:20,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I then invoke.

180
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:28,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Section 22, council leadership says, no, you can't do that.

181
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:32,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Against the rule, against the law.

182
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what was going to be said is this.

183
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:43,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.

184
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:49,850
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Hurtatone was at a crossroads with his community.

185
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Big cuts looming.

186
00:16:53,617 --> 00:17:05,601
[SPEAKER_01]: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.

187
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:10,282
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.

188
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,283
[SPEAKER_01]: You had his financial team present.

189
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.

190
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:23,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to Novartis.

191
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,435
[SPEAKER_01]: One, how do we get there?

192
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:33,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't know how we got here, at least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.

193
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, how do we fix it?

194
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, how does this never happen again?

195
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,325
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were taught.

196
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.

197
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:49,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.

198
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.

199
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,208
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to increase those fees.

200
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:59,853
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.

201
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:00,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.

202
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Need taken away.

203
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:02,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Next.

204
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:06,358
[SPEAKER_01]: We need streets and sidewalks.

205
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,278
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we figure that out?

206
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:13,863
[SPEAKER_01]: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.

207
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:15,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And boom.

208
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:16,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Developers paid for that.

209
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:24,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?

210
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,370
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we bring Somerville out of this?

211
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.

212
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:37,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.

213
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.

214
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,564
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I'm saying.

215
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,727
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is, that was an open process

216
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,458
[SPEAKER_01]: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.

217
00:18:53,279 --> 00:19:00,465
[SPEAKER_01]: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.

218
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows.

219
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:15,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what

220
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:20,720
[SPEAKER_01]: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?

221
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?

222
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:26,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody.

223
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:35,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.

224
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:41,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Councilor Caviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?

225
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,130
[SPEAKER_01]: $7.5 million for a new high school?

226
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,051
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

227
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the problem.

228
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,053
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the problem.

229
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:57,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scott Pelly shouldn't be doing this.

230
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:58,458
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a city councilor.

231
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit.

232
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:07,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna fight for what I think is right and so every citizen is heard.

233
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:15,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this or I wouldn't do this or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this because

234
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:39,937
[SPEAKER_01]: There were three former counselors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Alicia Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.

235
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:41,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so simple.

236
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,518
[SPEAKER_01]: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?

237
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:46,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hurting.

238
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Senior citizens are hurting.

239
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:59,552
[SPEAKER_01]: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.

240
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.

241
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,758
[SPEAKER_01]: We could swallow that, couldn't we?

242
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:08,816
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was with the process that gets started.

243
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.

244
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:13,440
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't know what's happening.

245
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:16,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's been posted.

246
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:22,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of the $34 million.

247
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's been done yet.

248
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:29,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So having this meeting tonight is so important.

249
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,374
[SPEAKER_01]: This fundraiser's so important.

250
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:33,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.

251
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,518
[SPEAKER_01]: The restaurants that donated.

252
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:42,684
[SPEAKER_01]: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's, always donate.

253
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:44,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

254
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:54,107
[SPEAKER_01]: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.

255
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:56,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess where that money's coming from?

256
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:58,728
[SPEAKER_01]: You.

257
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:05,024
[SPEAKER_01]: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.

258
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,225
[SPEAKER_01]: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.

259
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:13,146
[SPEAKER_01]: He has $8.

260
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:13,146
$8.

261
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, God, no, no, no.

262
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:27,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.

263
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.

264
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.

265
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:51,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money.

266
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the people I've talked to,

267
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:58,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.

268
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Mrs. Jones.

269
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,312
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, George, help me understand this.

270
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.

271
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:09,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So $48,000, I believe she said.

272
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I tell people $50,000.

273
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:15,118
[SPEAKER_01]: But now my house is worth a million dollars.

274
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,040
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband died 15 years ago.

275
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a seamstress.

276
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,942
[SPEAKER_01]: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.

277
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:24,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So should I move?

278
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:27,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want them to do that.

279
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:31,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.

280
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:37,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.

281
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:43,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.

282
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,399
[SPEAKER_01]: That simple.

283
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,881
[SPEAKER_01]: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.

284
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:53,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Devastating for residents.

285
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not candy coating anything.

286
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not hiding anything.

287
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you see has been public.

288
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:07,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.

289
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,453
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't see the information how we got here.

290
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,014
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.

291
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:15,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the other piece.

292
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's only this much money.

293
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:22,116
[SPEAKER_01]: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.

294
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.

295
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,705
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?

296
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:30,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Rent control.

297
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we talked about a transfer tax.

298
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we talked about a registry fee.

299
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we talked about overrides.

300
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:44,015
[SPEAKER_01]: But it stops there, right?

301
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:44,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

302
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:50,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.

303
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,341
[SPEAKER_01]: An additional $400 a month.

304
00:24:55,837 --> 00:25:00,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, he's a young man, works very hard, hopefully he can recover.

305
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:11,409
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.

306
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,071
[SPEAKER_01]: But Kelly, what did we say, what are we hearing?

307
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:23,257
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.

308
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:26,348
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going up again.

309
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:29,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So have we heard any of that in their homework?

310
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:31,331
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

311
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:33,853
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only $400.

312
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:37,095
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's go a step further.

313
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:42,618
[SPEAKER_01]: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.

314
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:44,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Who fits that bill?

315
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:46,161
[SPEAKER_01]: You.

316
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:49,243
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a new high school.

317
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,143
[SPEAKER_01]: A new one.

318
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:52,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it down to one new high school.

319
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:53,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at $400 million.

320
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:58,434
[SPEAKER_01]: You people don't understand what that number equates to.

321
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dangerous.

322
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,297
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scary and it's dangerous.

323
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:10,641
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.

324
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,483
[SPEAKER_01]: This group never wanted to say no to an override.

325
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:21,547
[SPEAKER_01]: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.

326
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:32,850
[SPEAKER_01]: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.

327
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,891
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.

328
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:43,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't build something just to check a box.

329
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:46,793
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the fire station.

330
00:26:47,553 --> 00:26:47,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.

331
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,174
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're saying it,

332
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've spelt it out for everybody.

333
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:57,170
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very simple process right now.

334
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:04,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Fix the budget with the $5 million in free cash.

335
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:07,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.

336
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:12,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.

337
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:13,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Something we haven't seen.

338
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:16,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I lying, Ricky?

339
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:18,718
[SPEAKER_01]: How many 40B jobs did we lose?

340
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:23,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?

341
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:25,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions of dollars.

342
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tax revenue.

343
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:28,853
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done the homework on it.

344
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:29,414
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?

345
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:29,914
[SPEAKER_01]: $16 million.

346
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:30,855
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one building.

347
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:31,775
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, these aren't lies.

348
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,396
[SPEAKER_01]: These are true numbers.

349
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you wish you had a platform

350
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:50,275
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been shut up way too easy.

351
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:52,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in this forum, I'm not.

352
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:53,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're my voice.

353
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,276
[SPEAKER_01]: You're helping us spread the message now.

354
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we need.

355
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:01,859
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.

356
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:02,219
[SPEAKER_01]: 600 volunteers.

357
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:08,041
[SPEAKER_01]: We have captains that are gonna be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?

358
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,162
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.

359
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:23,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.

360
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:35,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.

361
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:39,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.

362
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:45,769
[SPEAKER_01]: If a school kid member knocks on your door and says shame on you, be armed that you have the information right now.

363
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,474
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond that you know the truth.

364
00:28:52,095 --> 00:29:01,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?

365
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's gonna hurt people.

366
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:15,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.

367
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:20,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.

368
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:26,196
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect.

369
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.

370
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:34,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.

371
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:38,722
[SPEAKER_01]: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.

372
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:39,723
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay $2,400.

373
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cheap.

374
00:29:42,404 --> 00:29:42,984
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that.

375
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:44,745
[SPEAKER_01]: He will not raise that rate.

376
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:54,759
[SPEAKER_01]: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.

377
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,361
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be passed down to the tenants.

378
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:00,163
[SPEAKER_01]: And renters are going to go through the roof.

379
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:05,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.

380
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:07,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I miss anything, Rick?

381
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure?

382
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:09,831
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my captain.

383
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:10,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick's going to tell me.

384
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:15,045
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, I will tell you, we've got great people working on this.

385
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:16,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited for the energy.

386
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:21,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.

387
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's gone.

388
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:28,174
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.

389
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:35,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.

390
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,623
[SPEAKER_01]: And show your neighbors and just give us a call.

391
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:58,476
[SPEAKER_01]: override, when you vote for an override and we give the mayor six million dollars, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.

392
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:04,699
[SPEAKER_01]: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.

393
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so again,

394
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,051
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why we're here.

395
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:15,315
[SPEAKER_01]: $9 million in free cash.

396
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:30,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people that wanna know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.

397
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:34,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.

398
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:37,112
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple.

399
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:47,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people, bring them out, have them know what's going on.

400
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:53,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.

401
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:59,613
[SPEAKER_01]: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Cornell Stadium.

402
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,696
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.

403
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:05,838
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.

404
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:13,982
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors, and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.

405
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:26,469
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.

406
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:29,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you all for coming.

407
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a safe ride home, and we'll talk to you soon.

408
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:08,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Counselor George Scarpelli for that presentation.

409
