00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:29,595
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of your show, Method Happenings.

2
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:31,616
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:48,583
Today's show features George Scarpelli, who will be addressing truth, facts, and information about the upcoming override questions in Method, which are questions six, seven, and eight.

4
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,970
I also want to thank George for appearing on a prior show.

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,171
We have a video presentation from an all-Meffitt meeting that I attended.

6
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:05,732
This was recorded and produced by Joe DiMeo at Joe DiMeo Creative.

7
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,513
Thank you, Joe, for helping us out with the videos.

8
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:15,434
George Garpelli is a current Meffitt City Councilor and has been for 15 years.

9
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:20,496
George represents all citizens of Medford.

10
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:29,143
He has proposed viable solutions as opposed to increasing taxes to the citizens of Medford.

11
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:32,386
He is a champion of citizens.

12
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:41,173
Truth and facts drive his ideas, and he does not support the overrides and debt exclusion.

13
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:44,997
So let's go to the video right now.

14
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:13,270
Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.

15
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:25,261
Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.

16
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:27,563
And that reads,

17
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:58,142
That exclusion on fire stations shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs

18
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,688
incidental to related there too.

19
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,411
So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.

20
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,132
George, I thought you supported the firefighters.

21
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:21,737
Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.

22
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:28,880
Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.

23
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:30,367
and how they've been treated.

24
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,748
And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?

25
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:47,672
What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.

26
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,773
And they're willing to stand up and say what?

27
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:57,915
We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt

28
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,912
financially for an inferior product.

29
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:06,415
So please do not vote for question six.

30
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,576
Thank you, Danielle.

31
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,042
Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.

32
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:26,947
Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate

33
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:33,245
and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.

34
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:53,734
$3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance, and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited

35
00:04:54,877 --> 00:05:01,701
to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.

36
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:08,304
Okay, this question seven.

37
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:12,366
$500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.

38
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:24,533
ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.

39
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:27,265
Not at all.

40
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,348
So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.

41
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:31,728
Thanks.

42
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,731
This is an initiative that I put forth years ago.

43
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:48,321
We try to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.

44
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,723
And we never saw sidewalks being done.

45
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,764
We could never catch up.

46
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,925
And I know my colleagues say, see?

47
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:54,566
See?

48
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:55,246
We're right.

49
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:55,887
We have no money.

50
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:57,508
Not right.

51
00:05:58,769 --> 00:05:59,069
Wrong.

52
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:05,751
And again, I love the dialogue.

53
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:13,133
Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.

54
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:24,917
The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.

55
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,217
Have we been resourceful?

56
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:35,520
Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?

57
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,340
No.

58
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:45,763
I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.

59
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:54,005
But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,

60
00:06:55,291 --> 00:07:03,977
From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.

61
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,359
We showed them that avenue through free cash.

62
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,140
And what did they do?

63
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,524
They imposed a rule to shut me up.

64
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,546
So now we move forward.

65
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:22,570
One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.

66
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,191
And that school kid member said,

67
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,615
How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?

68
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,781
Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?

69
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,043
Shame on that person.

70
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:48,114
Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?

71
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,397
Take the $5 million out of free cash.

72
00:07:52,669 --> 00:08:01,261
put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.

73
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,872
So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.

74
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,746
I like the drama behind this.

75
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:21,828
Question 8 is intense.

76
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,770
Question 8.

77
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:36,380
This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed,

78
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:45,874
level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.

79
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:47,814
Doesn't that sound expensive?

80
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:48,814
Vocational.

81
00:08:49,655 --> 00:09:01,798
I believe what it is, Roy you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.

82
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,638
That's what we're asking for, right?

83
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:10,525
What, I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost?

84
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:17,586
Well, what we're looking at is nothing close to $4 million.

85
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,186
Not even close.

86
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:20,927
Not even close.

87
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,867
Understand the trend here.

88
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:25,808
Six, we heard.

89
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:28,168
Seven and eight, education.

90
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:33,849
Understand every single community that has fought for an override

91
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,747
and their communities has used what?

92
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,150
The children in the schools.

93
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,373
Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.

94
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:56,905
Well, I asked my colleagues, and the people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?

95
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,609
And you were there, and you still have it.

96
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:06,418
So let's understand this.

97
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,840
Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.

98
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,501
And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share with your friends.

99
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:24,884
All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.

100
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,105
We do not want it, never.

101
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,286
That was never said.

102
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:31,927
What we said,

103
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,842
was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.

104
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,704
Let's bring everybody together to the table.

105
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,947
Let's have an open and transparent process.

106
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:50,373
And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.

107
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,415
And don't divide the community.

108
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,118
But this is what has happened now.

109
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:57,619
Now we're dividing.

110
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,681
Now it's yes or no.

111
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,322
And I'll be honest with you.

112
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:10,044
As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.

113
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,545
But we have $34 million in free cash.

114
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:25,027
$34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.

115
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:27,207
This is what we're talking about.

116
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:29,648
And for those who don't know,

117
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:36,008
Just a quick step-by-step so you understand, it's never quick with me.

118
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:40,450
We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.

119
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:49,054
And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caviello was there, Council President Beas was there.

120
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:56,057
And we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.

121
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:57,518
It's too dangerous.

122
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,099
So we were all for it.

123
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:15,225
Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Carviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're going to vote for the budget.

124
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:17,766
They've come to an agreement.

125
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:18,506
What agreement?

126
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,308
I didn't know what agreement it was.

127
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:25,591
Councilor Carviello, Councilor Mike didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.

128
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:29,493
Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.

129
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,143
A financial task force was created.

130
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:42,170
A school kid member, two city counselors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.

131
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:49,816
Five people with no background in financial battles.

132
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:50,817
Nothing.

133
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:57,222
At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.

134
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,902
So we move forward, this financial task force is meeting, we don't hear anything.

135
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:04,564
There are no minutes, there's no information.

136
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,327
We're told we're gonna get a meeting before we do anything.

137
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,031
Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.

138
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:22,737
So we have our city council meeting, and I believe it was a week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart resident,

139
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,603
very important, powerful question.

140
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:32,587
They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?

141
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:38,511
That means devastation for the school department and our children.

142
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:41,453
Imagine.

143
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:48,398
So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?

144
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,580
Use our free cash.

145
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,922
Let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.

146
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:59,654
and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.

147
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:04,115
But guess what happened?

148
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:05,216
It's called Rule 21.

149
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:09,617
Counsel Scott Pelley shut down, can't speak.

150
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,698
And this is how we're getting messages.

151
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,439
The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.

152
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,319
That was what they came out with.

153
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,941
We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information, how do we get there, who was involved?

154
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:25,181
No answer.

155
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:31,458
Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.

156
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:32,258
That's fine.

157
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:34,820
But this is all true.

158
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:37,141
This is all on tape.

159
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:49,369
So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.

160
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,512
Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.

161
00:14:56,038 --> 00:15:07,125
As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.

162
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:20,834
Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.

163
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,258
Done, you can't talk about it.

164
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:34,421
But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.

165
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:35,381
Five.

166
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,182
And guess what that, that's free, nothing.

167
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:45,165
But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.

168
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:47,966
They don't wanna talk about it.

169
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:49,906
So, what do we do?

170
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,347
We move on to the next meeting, and they said okay.

171
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,905
I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?

172
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:57,445
What can I do?

173
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:05,486
And they said, okay, legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.

174
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,907
That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.

175
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,467
Well, we get to the next meeting.

176
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,428
Our leadership team does the same exact thing.

177
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,968
Suspends the rules.

178
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:19,629
Says they cannot impose rule 21.

179
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:20,129
I then invoke.

180
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:28,436
Section 22, council leadership says, no, you can't do that.

181
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:32,499
Against the rule, against the law.

182
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,201
Because what was going to be said is this.

183
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:43,006
And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.

184
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:49,850
In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Hurtatone was at a crossroads with his community.

185
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,072
Big cuts looming.

186
00:16:53,617 --> 00:17:05,601
He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.

187
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:10,282
You had the Sloans from Century Bank.

188
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,283
You had his financial team present.

189
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:17,744
You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.

190
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:23,246
And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to Novartis.

191
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,435
One, how do we get there?

192
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:33,760
We still don't know how we got here, at least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.

193
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,502
Two, how do we fix it?

194
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,744
Three, how does this never happen again?

195
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,325
That's what we were taught.

196
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,328
Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.

197
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:49,165
We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.

198
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,967
Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.

199
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,208
They're going to increase those fees.

200
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:59,853
They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.

201
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:00,193
Boom.

202
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,774
Need taken away.

203
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:02,695
Next.

204
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:06,358
We need streets and sidewalks.

205
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,278
How do we figure that out?

206
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:13,863
The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.

207
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:15,424
And boom.

208
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:16,725
Developers paid for that.

209
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:24,848
And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?

210
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,370
How do we bring Somerville out of this?

211
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,372
Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.

212
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:37,759
And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.

213
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,983
Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.

214
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,564
That's not what I'm saying.

215
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,727
What I'm saying is, that was an open process

216
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,458
with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.

217
00:18:53,279 --> 00:19:00,465
What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.

218
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,106
Nobody knows.

219
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:15,977
I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what

220
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:20,720
was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?

221
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,582
Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?

222
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:26,203
Nobody.

223
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:35,367
And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.

224
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:41,670
Like Councilor Caviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?

225
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,130
$7.5 million for a new high school?

226
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,051
That's great.

227
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,611
But this is the problem.

228
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,053
This is the problem.

229
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:57,478
So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scott Pelly shouldn't be doing this.

230
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:58,458
He's a city councilor.

231
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,659
I don't give a shit.

232
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:07,125
I'm gonna fight for what I think is right and so every citizen is heard.

233
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:15,751
Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this or I wouldn't do this or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this because

234
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:39,937
There were three former counselors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Alicia Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.

235
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:41,779
And it was so simple.

236
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,518
We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?

237
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:46,679
You're hurting.

238
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,041
Senior citizens are hurting.

239
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:59,552
The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.

240
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,135
And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.

241
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,758
We could swallow that, couldn't we?

242
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:08,816
But that was with the process that gets started.

243
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,619
Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.

244
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:13,440
We still don't know what's happening.

245
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:16,142
Nothing's been posted.

246
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:22,607
I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of the $34 million.

247
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,229
Nothing's been done yet.

248
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:29,113
So having this meeting tonight is so important.

249
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,374
This fundraiser's so important.

250
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:33,176
Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.

251
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,518
The restaurants that donated.

252
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:42,684
LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's, always donate.

253
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:44,885
Thank you so much.

254
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:54,107
The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.

255
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:56,627
And guess where that money's coming from?

256
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:58,728
You.

257
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:05,024
hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.

258
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,225
My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.

259
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:13,146
He has $8.

260
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:13,146
$8.

261
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,487
And I said, God, no, no, no.

262
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:27,349
Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.

263
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:40,283
We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.

264
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,044
Bullshit.

265
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:51,970
Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money.

266
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:54,752
But some of the people I've talked to,

267
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:58,730
I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.

268
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,651
I see Mrs. Jones.

269
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,312
She said, George, help me understand this.

270
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,794
I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.

271
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:09,315
So $48,000, I believe she said.

272
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,216
I think I tell people $50,000.

273
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:15,118
But now my house is worth a million dollars.

274
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,040
My husband died 15 years ago.

275
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,340
I was a seamstress.

276
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,942
My social security doesn't cover my taxes.

277
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:24,883
So should I move?

278
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:27,813
Some people want them to do that.

279
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:31,794
Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.

280
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:37,336
I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.

281
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:43,818
Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.

282
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,399
That simple.

283
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,881
The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.

284
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:53,482
Devastating for residents.

285
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,569
So we're not candy coating anything.

286
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,330
I'm not hiding anything.

287
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,651
Everything you see has been public.

288
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:07,312
I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.

289
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,453
We still don't see the information how we got here.

290
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,014
The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.

291
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:15,754
Here's the other piece.

292
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,135
Hey, it's only this much money.

293
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:22,116
If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.

294
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,837
Because understand this, and I'll end with this.

295
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,705
What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?

296
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:30,046
Rent control.

297
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,528
Then we talked about a transfer tax.

298
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,050
Then we talked about a registry fee.

299
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,752
And then we talked about overrides.

300
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:44,015
But it stops there, right?

301
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:44,876
Oh no.

302
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:50,279
Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.

303
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,341
An additional $400 a month.

304
00:24:55,837 --> 00:25:00,360
Now, he's a young man, works very hard, hopefully he can recover.

305
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:11,409
But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.

306
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,071
But Kelly, what did we say, what are we hearing?

307
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:23,257
In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.

308
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:26,348
It's going up again.

309
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:29,510
So have we heard any of that in their homework?

310
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:31,331
No.

311
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:33,853
But it's only $400.

312
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:37,095
But let's go a step further.

313
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:42,618
A minimum $200 million renovated high school.

314
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:44,740
Who fits that bill?

315
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:46,161
You.

316
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:49,243
We want a new high school.

317
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,143
A new one.

318
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:52,125
Take it down to one new high school.

319
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:53,485
Looking at $400 million.

320
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:58,434
You people don't understand what that number equates to.

321
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,275
It's dangerous.

322
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,297
It's scary and it's dangerous.

323
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:10,641
So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.

324
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,483
This group never wanted to say no to an override.

325
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:21,547
But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.

326
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:32,850
that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.

327
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,891
We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.

328
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:43,352
Don't build something just to check a box.

329
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:46,793
We don't want the fire station.

330
00:26:47,553 --> 00:26:47,813
Done.

331
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,174
So if they're saying it,

332
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,949
And I've spelt it out for everybody.

333
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:57,170
It's a very simple process right now.

334
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:04,052
Fix the budget with the $5 million in free cash.

335
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:07,714
Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.

336
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:12,015
Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.

337
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:13,996
Something we haven't seen.

338
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:16,597
Am I lying, Ricky?

339
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:18,718
How many 40B jobs did we lose?

340
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:23,530
Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?

341
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:25,351
Millions of dollars.

342
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,633
And then tax revenue.

343
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:28,853
You've done the homework on it.

344
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:29,414
How much?

345
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:29,914
$16 million.

346
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:30,855
So that's one building.

347
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:31,775
So again, these aren't lies.

348
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,396
These are true numbers.

349
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,698
And again, you wish you had a platform

350
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:50,275
But I've been shut up way too easy.

351
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:52,315
Well, in this forum, I'm not.

352
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:53,236
And you're my voice.

353
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,276
You're helping us spread the message now.

354
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,257
So this is what we need.

355
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:01,859
We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.

356
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:02,219
600 volunteers.

357
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:08,041
We have captains that are gonna be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?

358
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,162
60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.

359
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:23,232
I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.

360
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:35,741
Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.

361
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:39,244
Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.

362
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:45,769
If a school kid member knocks on your door and says shame on you, be armed that you have the information right now.

363
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,474
beyond that you know the truth.

364
00:28:52,095 --> 00:29:01,559
So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?

365
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,963
Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's gonna hurt people.

366
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:15,625
And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.

367
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:20,633
I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.

368
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:26,196
My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect.

369
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,897
And we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.

370
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:34,560
So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.

371
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:38,722
That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.

372
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:39,723
They pay $2,400.

373
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,944
Pretty cheap.

374
00:29:42,404 --> 00:29:42,984
We all know that.

375
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:44,745
He will not raise that rate.

376
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:54,759
What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.

377
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,361
It's going to be passed down to the tenants.

378
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:00,163
And renters are going to go through the roof.

379
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:05,888
So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.

380
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:07,089
Did I miss anything, Rick?

381
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,430
Are you sure?

382
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:09,831
He's my captain.

383
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:10,592
Rick's going to tell me.

384
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:15,045
You know, again, I will tell you, we've got great people working on this.

385
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:16,826
I'm so excited for the energy.

386
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:21,830
Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.

387
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,811
Steve's gone.

388
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:28,174
We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.

389
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:35,620
Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.

390
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,623
And show your neighbors and just give us a call.

391
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:58,476
override, when you vote for an override and we give the mayor six million dollars, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.

392
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:04,699
The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.

393
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,561
Okay, so again,

394
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,051
There's a reason why we're here.

395
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:15,315
$9 million in free cash.

396
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:30,026
Those people that wanna know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.

397
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:34,290
And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.

398
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:37,112
It's very simple.

399
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:47,403
So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people, bring them out, have them know what's going on.

400
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:53,188
Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.

401
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:59,613
But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Cornell Stadium.

402
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,696
We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.

403
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:05,838
We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.

404
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:13,982
We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors, and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.

405
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:26,469
The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.

406
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:29,171
So again, thank you all for coming.

407
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:31,792
Have a safe ride home, and we'll talk to you soon.

408
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:08,945
I want to thank Counselor George Scarpelli for that presentation.
