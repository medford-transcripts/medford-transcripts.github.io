    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=23.693s">[Petrella]</a>: 大家好，欢迎您演出的另一集《方法》。
 我是约翰·佩特雷拉（John Petrella）。
 今天的节目以乔治·斯卡佩利（George Scarpelli）为特色，他将解决有关方法中即将到来的替代问题的真相，事实和信息，这些问题是第六，七和八个问题。
 我还要感谢乔治出现在先前的演出中。
 我们参加了我参加的全梅福德会议的视频演示。
 这是由Joe Dimeo Creative的Joe Dimeo录制和制作的。
 乔，谢谢您帮助我们制作视频。
 乔治·加佩利（George Garpelli）是现任梅德福市议员，已经15年了。
 乔治代表梅德福的所有公民。
 他提出了可行的解决方案，而不是增加梅德福市民的税收。
 他是公民的拥护者。
 真理和事实推动了他的想法，他不支持债务和债务排除。
 因此，让我们现在就去看视频。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=125.303s">[Scarpelli]</a>:  Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.
 Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.
 And that reads,
 That exclusion on fire stations shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs
 incidental to related there too.
 So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.
 George, I thought you supported the firefighters.
 Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.
 Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.
 and how they've been treated.
 And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?
 What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.
 And they're willing to stand up and say what?
 We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt
 financially for an inferior product.
 So please do not vote for question six.
 Thank you, Danielle.
 Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.
 Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate
 and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.
 $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance, and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited
 to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.
 Okay, this question seven.
 $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.
 ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.
 Not at all.
 So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.
 Thanks.
 This is an initiative that I put forth years ago.
 We try to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.
 And we never saw sidewalks being done.
 We could never catch up.
 And I know my colleagues say, see?
 See?
 We're right.
 We have no money.
 Not right.
 Wrong.
 And again, I love the dialogue.
 Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.
 The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.
 Have we been resourceful?
 Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?
 No.
 I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.
 But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,
 From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.
 We showed them that avenue through free cash.
 And what did they do?
 They imposed a rule to shut me up.
 So now we move forward.
 One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.
 And that school kid member said,
 How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?
 Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?
 Shame on that person.
 Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?
 Take the $5 million out of free cash.
 put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.
 So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.
 I like the drama behind this.
 Question 8 is intense.
 Question 8.
 This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed,
 level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.
 Doesn't that sound expensive?
 Vocational.
 I believe what it is, Roy you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.
 That's what we're asking for, right?
 What, I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost?
 Well, what we're looking at is nothing close to $4 million.
 Not even close.
 Not even close.
 Understand the trend here.
 Six, we heard.
 Seven and eight, education.
 Understand every single community that has fought for an override
 and their communities has used what?
 The children in the schools.
 Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.
 Well, I asked my colleagues, and the people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?
 And you were there, and you still have it.
 So let's understand this.
 Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.
 And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share with your friends.
 All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.
 We do not want it, never.
 That was never said.
 What we said,
 was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.
 Let's bring everybody together to the table.
 Let's have an open and transparent process.
 And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.
 And don't divide the community.
 But this is what has happened now.
 Now we're dividing.
 Now it's yes or no.
 And I'll be honest with you.
 As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.
 But we have $34 million in free cash.
 $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.
 This is what we're talking about.
 And for those who don't know,
 Just a quick step-by-step so you understand, it's never quick with me.
 We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.
 And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caraviello was there, Council President Beas was there.
 And we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.
 It's too dangerous.
 So we were all for it.
 Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Caraviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're going to vote for the budget.
 They've come to an agreement.
 What agreement?
 I didn't know what agreement it was.
 Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Mike didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.
 Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.
 A financial task force was created.
 A school kid member, two city Councilors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.
 Five people with no background in financial battles.
 Nothing.
 At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.
 So we move forward, this financial task force is meeting, we don't hear anything.
 There are no minutes, there's no information.
 We're told we're gonna get a meeting before we do anything.
 Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.
 So we have our city council meeting, and I believe it was a week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart resident,
 very important, powerful question.
 They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?
 That means devastation for the school department and our children.
 Imagine.
 So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?
 Use our free cash.
 Let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.
 and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.
 But guess what happened?
 It's called Rule 21.
 Counsel Scarpelli shut down, can't speak.
 And this is how we're getting messages.
 The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.
 That was what they came out with.
 We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information, how do we get there, who was involved?
 No answer.
 Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.
 That's fine.
 But this is all true.
 This is all on tape.
 So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.
 Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.
 As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.
 Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.
 Done, you can't talk about it.
 But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.
 Five.
 And guess what that, that's free, nothing.
 But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.
 They don't wanna talk about it.
 So, what do we do?
 We move on to the next meeting, and they said okay.
 I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?
 What can I do?
 And they said, okay, legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.
 That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.
 Well, we get to the next meeting.
 Our leadership team does the same exact thing.
 Suspends the rules.
 Says they cannot impose rule 21.
 I then invoke.
 Section 22, council leadership says, no, you can't do that.
 Against the rule, against the law.
 Because what was going to be said is this.
 And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.
 In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Hurtatone was at a crossroads with his community.
 Big cuts looming.
 He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.
 You had the Sloans from Century Bank.
 You had his financial team present.
 You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.
 And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to Novartis.
 One, how do we get there?
 We still don't know how we got here, at least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.
 Two, how do we fix it?
 Three, how does this never happen again?
 That's what we were taught.
 Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.
 We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.
 Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.
 They're going to increase those fees.
 They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.
 Boom.
 Need taken away.
 Next.
 We need streets and sidewalks.
 How do we figure that out?
 The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.
 And boom.
 Developers paid for that.
 And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?
 How do we bring Somerville out of this?
 Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.
 And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.
 Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.
 That's not what I'm saying.
 What I'm saying is, that was an open process
 with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.
 What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.
 Nobody knows.
 I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what
 was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?
 Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?
 Nobody.
 And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.
 Like Councilor Caraviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?
 $7.5 million for a new high school?
 That's great.
 But this is the problem.
 This is the problem.
 So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scarpelli shouldn't be doing this.
 He's a city councilor.
 I don't give a shit.
 I'm gonna fight for what I think is right and so every citizen is heard.
 Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this or I wouldn't do this or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this because
 There were three former Councilors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Aleesha Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.
 And it was so simple.
 We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?
 You're hurting.
 Senior citizens are hurting.
 The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.
 And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.
 We could swallow that, couldn't we?
 But that was with the process that gets started.
 Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.
 We still don't know what's happening.
 Nothing's been posted.
 I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of the $34 million.
 Nothing's been done yet.
 So having this meeting tonight is so important.
 This fundraiser's so important.
 Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.
 The restaurants that donated.
 LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's, always donate.
 Thank you so much.
 The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.
 And guess where that money's coming from?
 You.
 hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.
 My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.
 He has $8.
 And I said, God, no, no, no.
 Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.
 We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.
 Bullshit.
 Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money.
 But some of the people I've talked to,
 I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.
 I see Mrs. Jones.
 She said, George, help me understand this.
 I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.
 So $48,000, I believe she said.
 I think I tell people $50,000.
 But now my house is worth a million dollars.
 My husband died 15 years ago.
 I was a seamstress.
 My social security doesn't cover my taxes.
 So should I move?
 Some people want them to do that.
 Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.
 I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.
 Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.
 That simple.
 The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.
 Devastating for residents.
 So we're not candy coating anything.
 I'm not hiding anything.
 Everything you see has been public.
 I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.
 We still don't see the information how we got here.
 The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.
 Here's the other piece.
 Hey, it's only this much money.
 If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.
 Because understand this, and I'll end with this.
 What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?
 Rent control.
 Then we talked about a transfer tax.
 Then we talked about a registry fee.
 And then we talked about overrides.
 But it stops there, right?
 Oh no.
 Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.
 An additional $400 a month.
 Now, he's a young man, works very hard, hopefully he can recover.
 But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.
 But Kelly, what did we say, what are we hearing?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1525.287s">[Scarpelli]</a>: 它再次上升。
 那么，我们在作业中听到了任何内容吗？
 不。
 但这只有400美元。
 但是，让我们进一步迈进。
 至少有2亿美元翻新的高中。
 谁适合该法案？
 你。
 我们想要一所新高中。
 一个新的。
 将其放到一所新高中。
 看4亿美元。
 你们不明白这个数字等于什么。
 这很危险。
 这很可怕，很危险。
 所以我不想带你出去吓你，但是我带你出去唤醒你。
 这个小组从不想对替代说不。
 但是我们从我身边的最聪明的教育思想中听到了它。
 我们还没有看到足够的创造力，我们还没有看到足够的信息，也没有透明度表明我们需要这一点。
 我们已经与消防部门进行了交谈，我们的消防员说，不要伤害我们的居民。
 不要仅仅构建一些东西来检查一个框。
 我们不想要消防局。
 完毕。
 所以如果他们说的，
 而且我为每个人都拼写了。
 这是一个非常简单的过程。
 用500万美元的免费现金来修复预算。
 让我们前进，思考具有创造力的不同方式。
 让我们震惊，看看新的增长和发展。
 我们没有看到的东西。
 我在撒谎吗？
 我们失去了多少40B工作？
 三，这三个项目的许可证有多少钱？
 数百万美元。
 然后税收。
 您已经完成了功课。
 多少？
 1600万美元。
 那是一栋建筑。
 因此，这些不是谎言。
 这些是真实数字。
 再一次，您希望您有一个平台
 但是我被封闭了太容易了。
 好吧，在这个论坛中，我不是。
 你是我的声音。
 您正在帮助我们现在传播消息。
 这就是我们需要的。
 我们目前有600多名志愿者的清单。
 600名志愿者。
 我们有队长将在60至80个人中表现出色？
 已经有60至80人报名参加了杰出表现。
 我问大家，10月15日，扎克，如果您想出来，我们将在Hormel体育场见面。
 每个人都会出来，我们将传达信息，我们要去附近，我们将敲门，我们将为人们提供城市中没有人提供的信息来帮助他们理解的信息。
 了解其他所有人，不要害怕。
 如果一个小学生的成员敲门，对您感到羞耻，请武装您现在有信息。
 除此之外，您知道真相。
 因此，明天，当您去咖啡店，或者明天去隔壁的时候，您和Dave聊天，喝一杯冷饮，和他坐下来，说，嘿，您知道覆盖物吗？
 因为火不想要它，所以教育的思想认为这是荒谬的，它会伤害人们。
 这是我似乎忘记的另一件作品，我永远都不想忘记这一点。
 我住在A中，在一个带租户的家中长大。
 我父亲确保我们以自豪和尊重对待我们的租户。
 我们确保我们保持租金合理。
 因此，我兄弟接受了这一点，我们在那里仍然有相同的家庭十年。
 那个家庭为梅德福的四间卧室付费。
 他们支付$ 2,400。
 很便宜。
 我们都知道。
 他不会提高这一比率。
 人们必须了解的是，如果这些税收产生，纳税人将无法自己处理。
 它将传给租户。
 房客将穿过屋顶。
 因此，我要感谢大家今晚的出现。
 我想念什么，里克吗？
 你确定吗？
 他是我的队长。
 里克要告诉我。
 你知道，我会告诉你，我们有很棒的人在为此。
 我为能量感到非常兴奋。
 目前，我们已经有260个标志在街上。
 史蒂夫走了。
 我们在街上有260个标志，今晚在这里还有200个标志。
 确保您有标志，但请确保您留下自己的姓名和地址，以便我们知道您已经服用了它。
 并向您的邻居展示，然后给我们打电话。
 超越，当您投票赞成替代时，我们给市长六百万美元，即使他们说这笔钱将用于职业学校或艺术课程，这不一定是事实。
 这笔钱进入了普通基金，以供市长的酌处权。
 好吧，再次
 我们在这里是有原因的。
 900万美元的自由现金。
 那些想知道真正简单的人是什么免费现金，免费现金是我们上一年在预算中批准的资金，而市长不使用，不花钱，然后获得认证和携带。
 然后，它进入了她可以做自己想做的任何事情的帐户。
 这很简单。
 因此，我希望今晚我们真正想做的就是教育一些人，带出他们，让他们知道发生了什么。
 了解我们将拥有的，如果您请注册杰出人物，我们将在敲门上敲门。
 但是大个子将是10月15日，星期六，康奈尔体育场的九点钟。
 我们将在那里见面，我们都会上街。
 我们要去附近。
 我们将敲门，与您的邻居交谈，并让他们知道如果经过投票，这不会伤害孩子。
 市长只需要把她与她一起玩的钱放回到应该的地方，并帮助我们的孩子，并帮助我们的学校，并帮助我们的老年人和居民，这样他们就不会被这些税收杀害。
 因此，再次感谢大家的到来。
 有安全的骑车回家，我们很快就会与您交谈。</p>
