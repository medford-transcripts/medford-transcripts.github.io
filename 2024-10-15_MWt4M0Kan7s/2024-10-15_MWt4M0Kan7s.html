    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=23.693s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to another episode of your show, Method Happenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=30.276s">I</a>  am John Petrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=32.757s">Today's</a>  show features George Scarpelli, who will be addressing truth, facts, and information about the upcoming override questions in Method, which are questions six, seven, and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=49.949s">I</a>  also want to thank George for appearing on a prior show. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=55.25s">We</a>  have a video presentation from an all-Medford meeting that I attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=61.071s">This</a>  was recorded and produced by Joe DiMeo at Joe DiMeo Creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=66.392s">Thank</a>  you, Joe, for helping us out with the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=70.813s">George</a>  Garpelli is a current Medford City Councilor and has been for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=77.193s">George</a>  represents all citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=81.337s">He</a>  has proposed viable solutions as opposed to increasing taxes to the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=90.204s">He</a>  is a champion of citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=93.527s">Truth</a>  and facts drive his ideas, and he does not support the overrides and debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=102.455s">So</a>  let's go to the video right now.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=125.303s">Right</a>  now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=134.211s">Question</a>  six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=146.882s">And</a>  that reads, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=149.395s">That</a>  exclusion on fire stations shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=179.087s">incidental</a>  to related there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=184.229s">So</a>  you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=188.431s">George,</a>  I thought you supported the firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=191.352s">Well,</a>  when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=202.797s">Instead,</a>  look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=209.527s">and</a>  how they've been treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=211.468s">And</a>  yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=215.869s">What</a>  you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=228.992s">And</a>  they're willing to stand up and say what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=233.074s">We'd</a>  rather not have our residents of Medford hurt <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=239.03s">financially</a>  for an inferior product. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=242.212s">So</a>  please do not vote for question six. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=247.815s">Thank</a>  you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=254.76s">Question</a>  seven is funding schools and street repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=261.424s">Shall</a>  the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=267.462s">and</a>  personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=273.265s">$3</a>  million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance, and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=294.877s">to</a>  additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=302.501s">Okay,</a>  this question seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=308.744s">$500,000,</a>  come on, for the roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=314.087s">ARPA,</a>  when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=326.544s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=328.706s">So</a>  now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=331.428s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=333.55s">This</a>  is an initiative that I put forth years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=337.032s">We</a>  try to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=348.361s">And</a>  we never saw sidewalks being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=350.783s">We</a>  could never catch up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=352.524s">And</a>  I know my colleagues say, see? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=354.326s">See?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=354.886s">We're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=355.266s">We</a>  have no money. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=357.028s">Not</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=358.769s">Wrong.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=360.529s">And</a>  again, I love the dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=367.091s">Public</a>  schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=376.414s">The</a>  superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=386.697s">Have</a>  we been resourceful? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=389.458s">Has</a>  the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=397.06s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=399.321s">I</a>  know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=407.383s">But</a>  I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=415.291s">From</a>  step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=424.557s">We</a>  showed them that avenue through free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=428.3s">And</a>  what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=431.502s">They</a>  imposed a rule to shut me up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=435.385s">So</a>  now we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=438.887s">One</a>  of our members got a phone call from a school kid member. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=442.59s">And</a>  that school kid member said, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=445.253s">How</a>  dare you put a no sign on your lawn? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=451.259s">Are</a>  you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=454.842s">Shame</a>  on that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=457.524s">Because</a>  that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=469.055s">Take</a>  the $5 million out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=472.669s">put</a>  the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=484.526s">So</a>  that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=497.444s">I</a>  like the drama behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=500.827s">Question</a>  8 is intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=504.39s">Question</a>  8. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=505.671s">This</a>  override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=518.932s">level</a>  and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=525.894s">Doesn't</a>  that sound expensive? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=528.094s">Vocational.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=529.655s">I</a>  believe what it is, Roy you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=541.818s">That's</a>  what we're asking for, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=545.724s">What,</a>  I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=552.365s">Well,</a>  what we're looking at is nothing close to $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=558.426s">Not</a>  even close. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=560.047s">Not</a>  even close. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=562.667s">Understand</a>  the trend here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=565.087s">Six,</a>  we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=566.548s">Seven</a>  and eight, education. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=569.488s">Understand</a>  every single community that has fought for an override <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=574.985s">and</a>  their communities has used what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=577.988s">The</a>  children in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=581.03s">Don't</a>  hurt our children, don't hurt our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=585.054s">Well,</a>  I asked my colleagues, and the people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=600.048s">And</a>  you were there, and you still have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=604.857s">So</a>  let's understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=607.458s">Now</a>  that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=613.04s">And</a>  let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share with your friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=618.922s">All</a>  Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=625.425s">We</a>  do not want it, never. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=627.125s">That</a>  was never said. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=631.167s">What</a>  we said, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=633.839s">was</a>  let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=637.702s">Let's</a>  bring everybody together to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=640.184s">Let's</a>  have an open and transparent process. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=643.707s">And</a>  let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=652.074s">And</a>  don't divide the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=654.857s">But</a>  this is what has happened now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=656.838s">Now</a>  we're dividing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=658.8s">Now</a>  it's yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=659.721s">And</a>  I'll be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=662.603s">As</a>  a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=671.505s">But</a>  we have $34 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=675.785s">$34</a>  million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=685.967s">This</a>  is what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=688.668s">And</a>  for those who don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=692.767s">Just</a>  a quick step-by-step so you understand, it's never quick with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=697.789s">We</a>  had our budget meeting last year, the year before last. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=702.271s">And</a>  my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caraviello was there, Council President Beas was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=710.035s">And</a>  we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=716.777s">It's</a>  too dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=718.838s">So</a>  we were all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=722.237s">Until</a>  the night of the meeting, Councilor Caraviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're going to vote for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=736.725s">They've</a>  come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=737.886s">What</a>  agreement? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=740.147s">I</a>  didn't know what agreement it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=741.388s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, Councilor Mike didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=746.631s">Well,</a>  as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=750.981s">A</a>  financial task force was created. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=755.545s">A</a>  school kid member, two city Councilors, the chief of staff, and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=763.531s">Five</a>  people with no background in financial battles. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=770.517s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=772.398s">At</a>  least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=778.92s">So</a>  we move forward, this financial task force is meeting, we don't hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=782.302s">There</a>  are no minutes, there's no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=786.065s">We're</a>  told we're gonna get a meeting before we do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=791.049s">Well,</a>  you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=795.091s">So</a>  we have our city council meeting, and I believe it was a week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart resident, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=805.302s">very</a>  important, powerful question. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=806.803s">They</a>  said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=814.288s">That</a>  means devastation for the school department and our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=820.993s">Imagine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=822.754s">So</a>  I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=829.538s">Use</a>  our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=832.26s">Let's</a>  come to the table and do the right thing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=835.873s">and</a>  let's not leverage our kids in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=841.314s">But</a>  guess what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=844.435s">It's</a>  called Rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=845.296s">Counsel</a>  Scarpelli shut down, can't speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=852.417s">And</a>  this is how we're getting messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=854.538s">The</a>  Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=858.199s">That</a>  was what they came out with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=860.12s">We</a>  asked for the minutes, we asked for more information, how do we get there, who was involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=864.721s">No</a>  answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=867.375s">Now</a>  maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=871.758s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=873.859s">But</a>  this is all true. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=876.021s">This</a>  is all on tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=880.984s">So,</a>  typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=891.871s">Tuesday</a>  we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=896.038s">As</a>  a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=909.006s">Something</a>  that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=925.158s">Done,</a>  you can't talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=926.999s">But</a>  I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=935.021s">Five.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=936.162s">And</a>  guess what that, that's free, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=940.103s">But,</a>  the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=947.105s">They</a>  don't wanna talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=948.566s">So,</a>  what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=950.586s">We</a>  move on to the next meeting, and they said okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=952.904s">I</a>  reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=956.925s">What</a>  can I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=957.485s">And</a>  they said, okay, legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=966.206s">That</a>  supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=970.007s">Well,</a>  we get to the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=972.527s">Our</a>  leadership team does the same exact thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=975.408s">Suspends</a>  the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=978.328s">Says</a>  they cannot impose rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=979.669s">I</a>  then invoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=983.853s">Section</a>  22, council leadership says, no, you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=990.538s">Against</a>  the rule, against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=994.68s">Because</a>  what was going to be said is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=999.243s">And</a>  listen closely, because this is how real communities do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1003.186s">In</a>  2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Hurtatone was at a crossroads with his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1011.271s">Big</a>  cuts looming. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1013.617s">He</a>  convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1026.421s">You</a>  had the Sloans from Century Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1031.442s">You</a>  had his financial team present. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1034.443s">You</a>  had community leaders and business leaders all in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1038.965s">And</a>  they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to Novartis. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1044.554s">One,</a>  how do we get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1048.777s">We</a>  still don't know how we got here, at least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1054.36s">Two,</a>  how do we fix it? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1057.522s">Three,</a>  how does this never happen again? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1061.305s">That's</a>  what we were taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1064.347s">Well,</a>  they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1067.344s">We're</a>  going to look at traffic and parking fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1069.205s">Not</a>  going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1071.987s">They're</a>  going to increase those fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1073.228s">They're</a>  going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1079.873s">Boom.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1080.313s">Need</a>  taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1082.415s">Next.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1084.596s">We</a>  need streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1086.378s">How</a>  do we figure that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1088.399s">The</a>  focus is fees and fines for trash and building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1094.964s">And</a>  boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1095.744s">Developers</a>  paid for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1098.583s">And</a>  then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1104.968s">How</a>  do we bring Somerville out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1107.19s">Well,</a>  they started this little project called Assembly Row. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1112.515s">And</a>  now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1119.04s">Now,</a>  maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1122.663s">That's</a>  not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1123.904s">What</a>  I'm saying is, that was an open process <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1127.875s">with</a>  financial minds that sat together to find a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1133.279s">What</a>  has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1141.426s">Nobody</a>  knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1144.508s">I</a>  know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1156.478s">was</a>  shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1162.141s">Who</a>  were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1165.822s">Nobody.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1167.863s">And</a>  here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1176.848s">Like</a>  Councilor Caraviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1181.89s">$7.5</a>  million for a new high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1183.391s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1187.39s">But</a>  this is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1190.072s">This</a>  is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1193.435s">So</a>  people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scarpelli shouldn't be doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1197.498s">He's</a>  a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1198.839s">I</a>  don't give a shit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1204.323s">I'm</a>  gonna fight for what I think is right and so every citizen is heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1208.506s">Because</a>  I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this or I wouldn't do this or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this because <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1216.837s">There</a>  were three former Councilors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Aleesha Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1240.838s">And</a>  it was so simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1242.895s">We</a>  would exclude senior citizens because you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1245.998s">You're</a>  hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1247.7s">Senior</a>  citizens are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1251.704s">The</a>  vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1260.873s">And</a>  I believe at the time it was $17 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1264.597s">We</a>  could swallow that, couldn't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1266.995s">But</a>  that was with the process that gets started. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1268.837s">Even</a>  with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1272.139s">We</a>  still don't know what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1274.421s">Nothing's</a>  been posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1276.963s">I</a>  know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of the $34 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1283.288s">Nothing's</a>  been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1287.031s">So</a>  having this meeting tonight is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1289.133s">This</a>  fundraiser's so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1290.954s">Because</a>  I tell you, I gotta thank so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1294.377s">The</a>  restaurants that donated. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1296.243s">LaCasha's,</a>  Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's, always donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1304.025s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1308.066s">The</a>  thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1315.187s">And</a>  guess where that money's coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1318.608s">You.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1320.363s">hard-working,</a>  method residents that want to do anything they can and fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1325.824s">My</a>  neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1331.986s">He</a>  has $8. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1337.927s">And</a>  I said, God, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1340.527s">Because</a>  I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1347.975s">We</a>  have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1361.403s">Bullshit.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1364.926s">Because</a>  I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1373.311s">But</a>  some of the people I've talked to, <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1376.149s">I</a>  keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1378.75s">I</a>  see Mrs. Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1380.851s">She</a>  said, George, help me understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1383.973s">I</a>  bought my house 50, 60 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1387.815s">So</a>  $48,000, I believe she said. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1389.676s">I</a>  think I tell people $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1392.937s">But</a>  now my house is worth a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1396.359s">My</a>  husband died 15 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1398.46s">I</a>  was a seamstress. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1400.201s">My</a>  social security doesn't cover my taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1404.203s">So</a>  should I move? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1406.392s">Some</a>  people want them to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1408.433s">Because</a>  I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1412.334s">I</a>  haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1417.636s">Cuz</a>  one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1424.759s">That</a>  simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1426.619s">The</a>  understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1432.322s">Devastating</a>  for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1436.049s">So</a>  we're not candy coating anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1438.17s">I'm</a>  not hiding anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1440.01s">Everything</a>  you see has been public. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1443.151s">I</a>  have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1449.113s">We</a>  still don't see the information how we got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1452.834s">The</a>  way they want to get out of it is by taxing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1455.074s">Here's</a>  the other piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1456.335s">Hey,</a>  it's only this much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1459.715s">If</a>  I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1462.996s">Because</a>  understand this, and I'll end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1466.303s">What</a>  did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1469.365s">Rent</a>  control. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1471.407s">Then</a>  we talked about a transfer tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1474.248s">Then</a>  we talked about a registry fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1477.05s">And</a>  then we talked about overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1482.874s">But</a>  it stops there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1484.535s">Oh</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1485.856s">Because</a>  my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1491.18s">An</a>  additional $400 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1495.837s">Now,</a>  he's a young man, works very hard, hopefully he can recover. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1501.241s">But</a>  then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side. <a href="https://youtu.be/MWt4M0Kan7s&t=1512.469s">But</a>  Kelly, what did we say, what are we hearing?</p>
