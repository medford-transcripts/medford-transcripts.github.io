00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:14,322

302
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:47,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, so people know that the process has to go through requirements, and one is that has to be posted for two weeks, correct, Council President?

[SPEAKER_01]: I am very much dismayed and shocked if Salem Street is going to relax their zoning to a point that, as I stated many times before, it's already congested and it's going to become like Somerville.

316
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have the summable hassles along with that.

317
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:06,993
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the only best place is Mystic Avenue for development.

318
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:08,254
[SPEAKER_01]: End of story.

319
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:11,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

320
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:16,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any other comment on this item, either in person or on Zoom?

321
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:22,758
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go to Robert Carney on Zoom.

322
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

323
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:31,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Robert Carney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6.

324
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to thank George for bringing this up.

325
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:43,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say I don't live in the Salem Street corridor, but that for the record, I just want to share that I support reverting the designation from MX2 to MX1.

326
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:52,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Recognize and respect that many residents of this corridor support MX2, but as someone affiliated with the CDB, I think

327
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:58,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel Evans had previously mentioned, our zoning is dynamic and can be modified over time.

328
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:05,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Many Salem Street corridor residents of the area are uncomfortable with this jump to MX2.

329
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:10,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So offering maybe a compromise here, why not try MX1, see how it goes.

330
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:17,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to do MX2 really badly later on, talk about it later if you still feel strongly about it.

331
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Just also want to share concerns about the lack of

332
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:26,278
[SPEAKER_08]: what I think should be citywide comprehensive traffic studies.

333
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:43,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that developers are responsible for doing traffic studies when appropriate and I have heard assurances at council meetings that the appropriate parties will take that into consideration so as not to overload our infrastructure but I respectfully offer just my

334
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:52,950
[SPEAKER_08]: skepticism about that based on a recent example of a new business that has brought a lot of new activity to South Medford, Great American Beer Hall.

335
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:57,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Abutting residents were assured in this case that they would not hear music from it.

336
00:39:58,511 --> 00:40:10,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Residents suffered from loud music, rowdy neighbors for over a year, as you all know, and vocalized their concerns at the September 9th city council meeting as this business was asking to extend its hours.

337
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:13,196
[SPEAKER_08]: situation was so bad.

338
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:20,841
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, we had a group of abutting residents petitioning not to allow the owners to extend hours.

339
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:32,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And so just asking the question here, especially when that establishment waited until a week and a half prior to petitioning the council before taking mitigation.

340
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:46,191
[SPEAKER_08]: If this happened with the Great American Beer Hall, how can we know that we won't see promises by developers that there will be sufficient parking only for residents in those adjacent properties to turn around and find that they have a hard time parking on the street?

341
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:52,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Will residents suddenly find themselves without sufficient street parking for traffic backlogs?

342
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:57,215
[SPEAKER_08]: for extended periods of time, you know, before the city addresses their concerns.

343
00:40:57,715 --> 00:41:03,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just saying, you know, with all this, let's slow down and take a deep breath and not so not move so fast zoning.

344
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:05,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So just my thoughts there.

345
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:05,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

346
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

347
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Andy, we'll come back to you.

348
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have also can grow on zoom.

349
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm gonna request that you unmute.

350
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:21,266
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you'll have three minutes, name and address for the record, please.

351
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:24,775
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thanks.

352
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:26,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

353
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I am 100 feet away from Salem Street.

354
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I live right behind Haines.

355
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:39,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to say that I'm excited to see the zoning continue forward.

356
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:49,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was about a year ago when the Salem Street rezoning was actually in the last city council meeting before the zoning.

357
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:50,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

358
00:41:52,383 --> 00:42:06,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing this after a year long process, as much as I'm in favor of the MX2, if it's going to help the mayor along to continue the rezoning process, I am excited to see this brought back in front of the council.

359
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:26,144
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have to compromise on an MX one for that, I think that's a perfectly fine thing to, you know, hopefully push the mayor to get even better communication than was going out previously, which I know on a shoestring budget was was tricky for people and Councilor Collins in particular.

360
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:30,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that's that's all it was great.

361
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to contributing more as a Salem Street resident.

362
00:42:34,509 --> 00:42:34,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

363
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:36,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

364
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:40,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anyone else who hasn't spoken yet who would like to speak on this issue?

365
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:47,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, we'll go back to the podium to Andrew Castanedi for one minute.

366
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:49,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

367
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:56,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I've neglected to say that Salem Street is very, very congested as is.

368
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:57,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I live

369
00:42:58,955 --> 00:42:59,856
[SPEAKER_01]: one block away.

370
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:07,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I avoid that and go through the square because it's easier to deal with Medford Square than it is with Salem Street at times.

371
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:26,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't forget, we on the east side of Route 93 have been suffering with the noise pollution 24 hours a day, which really hurts at three o'clock in the morning when you have a motorcycle revving up

372
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:31,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fun, and the pollution is not good either.

373
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:39,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the people that say, oh, the noise doesn't bother me, but I have to wash my boat at the Riverside Yacht Club on a daily basis.

374
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:43,584
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like insult to injury.

375
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:49,947
[SPEAKER_01]: For 65 years, they've been suffering since they built Route 93 in 1960.

376
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:50,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

377
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:02,330
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli receiving place on file, is that fine?

378
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:08,051
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive in place on file, seconded by Councilor Leming.

379
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

380
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:12,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan?

381
00:44:12,852 --> 00:44:14,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

382
00:44:14,072 --> 00:44:15,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Collins?

383
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:15,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

384
00:44:17,313 --> 00:44:18,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazzaro?

385
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:20,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Leming?

386
00:44:20,754 --> 00:44:21,214
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

387
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:22,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Try it now.

388
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:24,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Leming?

389
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:26,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

390
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

391
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:29,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

392
00:44:29,863 --> 00:44:29,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

393
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:31,724
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears.

394
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:32,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

395
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:33,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I have an affirmative, none negative.

396
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:35,066
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion is received and placed on file.

397
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:36,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Communications from the Mayor.

398
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:39,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Supplemental appropriation for the fiscal year 2026.

399
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:47,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following supplemental appropriation for fiscal year 2026.

400
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:59,970
[SPEAKER_11]: $1,300,000 for the acquisition and implementation of an updated accounting software, including but not limited to funding for up to one full time temporary staff member to assist the city's transition.

401
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:05,051
[SPEAKER_11]: associated employee benefit costs, and third-party consulting and implementation services.

402
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:12,374
[SPEAKER_11]: To meet this appropriation, the sum of $1,300,000.00 be raised and appropriated from the fiscal year 2026 tax levy.

403
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:18,236
[SPEAKER_11]: The proposed supplemental appropriation utilizes one-time funds to support the transition to a new accounting software system.

404
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:22,238
[SPEAKER_11]: This initiative is the result of months of productive discussions and successful negotiations

405
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:36,613
[SPEAKER_11]: With the mystic Valley Development Commission related to the rivers edge project as the council was aware the properties at 100 and 200 rivers edge will no longer be exempt under Massachusetts general law chapter 59 for fiscal 26 with both properties now taxable.

406
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,970
[SPEAKER_11]: The resulting increase in the city's new growth will be sufficient to sustain this appropriation.

407
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:51,638
[SPEAKER_11]: As part of the ultimate MVDC negotiation, Medford has tentatively agreed to commit annual payments for the next five years, fiscal 26 to fiscal 30, ranging from $31,683 in fiscal 26 to $47,848 in fiscal 30, which would be deducted from the amount owed to Medford by the MVDC and redirected to Malden.

408
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:09,726
[SPEAKER_11]: This arrangement will require future City Council approval as it involves a payment not mandated by the district's enabling legislation, but it would simplify the process by eliminating the need for Medford to issue a separate payment.

409
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:12,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

410
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:14,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Brianna Lugo Kern, Mayor.

411
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:17,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have the Assessor and the Finance Director with us.

412
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:27,891
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll give them a second to explain this to us a little bit more, and then we'll ask them any questions, and then we'll take it from there.

413
00:46:28,691 --> 00:46:28,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So

414
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:31,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here, Jared and Bob.

415
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:36,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the overview.

416
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:38,625
[SPEAKER_11]: We might need you to move it up a little bit, sorry.

417
00:46:39,926 --> 00:46:41,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too tall for the mic.

418
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:43,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's totally cordless.

419
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:51,476
[SPEAKER_04]: The overview on this, I mean, I think anybody who's been at the conference since I started here

420
00:46:52,873 --> 00:47:00,840
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing that I've been pushing to actually upgrade the accounting system that we have.

421
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:05,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's overdue to do.

422
00:47:06,364 --> 00:47:10,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very big project.

423
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:11,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be expensive.

424
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:14,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take years to do it properly.

425
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:21,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding the funding for it, of course, is one of the big issues in this.

426
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:38,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So this year, when we came before you for the 2026 budget, we were operating on the information we had back in the beginning of May, basically.

427
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:43,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do conservative estimates for what our revenues will be.

428
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:46,433
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, what happened was that

429
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:55,314
[SPEAKER_04]: due to Jared's work and the work of the mayor, we finally settled this 101-102 Rivers Edge.

430
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:59,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Those properties are now in the Medford tax rolls.

431
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:08,656
[SPEAKER_04]: That means my estimate for certified new growth, which was between $2 million and $2.2 million, is now over $3.5 million.

432
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:35,745
[SPEAKER_04]: This gives us room on the tax levy to actually appropriate these funds to, I won't say do this whole project because this is going to take years and probably more funding, but we can actually use this money, reserve it in a capital project fund to, probably this winter, we will be

433
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:51,078
[SPEAKER_04]: hiring consultant, look at the general ledger, decide what things we need to do before we do the upgrade, figure out what we're going to do with the chart of accounts, how to set the thing up correctly from the get-go.

434
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:56,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't want to minimize how much work this is going to take or how long it will take.

435
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:01,727
[SPEAKER_04]: If we try to not do the work and we try to do it fast, it's not going to work.

436
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:03,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't give us what we want.

437
00:49:04,268 --> 00:49:10,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point, I think we're ready to actually make a good plan to do this and get it done.

438
00:49:11,971 --> 00:49:15,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have this opportunity now because of this.

439
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't say it's a windfall.

440
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:19,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very good thing for the city because, of course,

441
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:27,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have this on the tax rolls, their taxes will be subject to proposition two and a half.

442
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:37,716
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll go into our levy limit for the rest of, for years and years and years.

443
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:42,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think at this time, it's an appropriate use of this money.

444
00:49:43,737 --> 00:49:47,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the overview.

445
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:49,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

446
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:51,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Jared, is there anything you want to add before we go to questions?

447
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to touch on his point, he pretty much covered it.

448
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:11,634
[SPEAKER_12]: But the difference between that estimate and what we actually gained with that 2.2 to 3.45, I believe it is, is the roll off of 100 and 200 Rivers Edge.

449
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,815
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's called what's exempt to taxable.

450
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:19,136
[SPEAKER_12]: And that brings in new growth that stays in the levy limit in perpetuity.

451
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:22,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Bob's point.

452
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:26,845
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is, was, we didn't know if that was going to happen.

453
00:50:26,885 --> 00:50:30,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we can say with certainty that it has happened and therefore we have the extra funds.

454
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:34,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

455
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:41,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to note that this was one of our budget priorities at the Council the last two years to move to fund a transition to a new system.

456
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:43,776
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm glad to see some progress on this.

457
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:44,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

458
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:49,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, and thank you for your hard work.

459
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:55,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this is something we've talked about for many, many years with getting the information that we need.

460
00:50:55,621 --> 00:51:07,965
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I want the community to understand is by finally having this type of system, people don't realize how much money we're gonna be saving just because what we're using right now is archaic.

461
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:14,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hours we're spending trying to gather data, and it must be very difficult.

462
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:15,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true or not?

463
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very difficult.

464
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,021
[SPEAKER_04]: There are synergies we could have by having one system.

465
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:24,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, we have technically four.

466
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: If you include Vision, Harper's for the payroll service, SoftRight for the treasurer and payroll, and admins for the general ledger.

467
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:37,832
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had problems.

468
00:51:38,272 --> 00:51:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, we've had problems in the last few months because uploads from SoftWrite for cash receipts aren't actually processing correctly.

469
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:50,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I have to spend time looking at why this is happening.

470
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one example of how having disparate systems causes problems.

471
00:51:57,884 --> 00:52:02,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can't stress enough about how, I mean, just to put it bluntly,

472
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:16,023
[SPEAKER_04]: The chart of accounts, which is how we record revenues, expenses, liabilities, all of that stuff has been set up piecemeal since we got admins back in 1998.

473
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't make sense.

474
00:52:22,065 --> 00:52:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a common problem.

475
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:29,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't say that other communities don't have this problem, but basically we've outgrown it.

476
00:52:30,686 --> 00:52:31,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing.

477
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:36,550
[SPEAKER_04]: The accounts that we can use in that are limited.

478
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a limited number of them.

479
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:42,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So at some point, something's got to be up.

480
00:52:43,195 --> 00:52:46,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's stuff that the current system does not.

481
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:50,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't be cloud-based, for instance.

482
00:52:50,461 --> 00:52:54,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's going to cloud-based solutions for accounting systems.

483
00:52:56,185 --> 00:52:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Admins doesn't do that.

484
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what we'd have to do to upgrade admins to be able to do that.

485
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:06,865
[SPEAKER_04]: They will definitely be included in the conversation about what software we're going to go to.

486
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:25,078
[SPEAKER_04]: But this, and I also want to stress when we're doing this, this is why I'm saying it's going to take money and take a lot of time, because I want to go through a proper procurement process, identify vendors using our consultants, identify vendors who are capable of having a system that will support a city of this size.

487
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we're picking the right software, we're closing down admins the way it should be, and moving that data into an upgraded software system where the account setup actually makes sense and works and is logical.

488
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:44,813
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to take a long time.

489
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,015
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like I said, it'd be nice to

490
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:57,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know we've been asking for quarterly monthly, you know, breakdowns and we get them some months we don't get them some months and I know that's a lot of work to be done.

491
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:02,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are things that are going to be streamlined for one person that worked in municipality who turned over.

492
00:54:03,763 --> 00:54:06,166
[SPEAKER_02]: their system to Munis.

493
00:54:06,406 --> 00:54:10,190
[SPEAKER_02]: We use Munis in Somerville and most communities use this software.

494
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's such an important piece because it ties every city entity together, whether it's a police department, DPW, different offices, and you'll see payroll being done, you'll see

495
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:34,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You know procurement process go through Munis so everything but you're right, it does take a lot of time and my question to you is what we did.

496
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:39,019
[SPEAKER_02]: What was important in the community I work in was the training.

497
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be part of the funds or just the software?

498
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:43,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

499
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:47,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd be doing this in stages so that we get one stage.

500
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:51,868
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing is to do the general ledger, get everybody trained on that.

501
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:57,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And that involves procurement, contract module, accounts payable.

502
00:54:58,052 --> 00:54:59,693
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what admins does right now.

503
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:05,015
[SPEAKER_04]: we would replace it with a new system and make sure that it's running concurrently.

504
00:55:07,296 --> 00:55:24,682
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd also have to, there's a fair amount of cleanup for old accounts in admins that we simply don't, I'm working on that, I've been working on that for two years now, to clean up old capital project accounts, because once we move to a new system, we won't have that data without going back to the old system.

505
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:33,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to have those all cleaned up as much as possible so we keep the data, we know where the money came from, what it's for.

506
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:42,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That type of stuff is going to take a lot of extra work on the part of the finance department.

507
00:55:43,127 --> 00:55:47,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is going to be a long process because, as you're saying, I want to do this right.

508
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:48,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I want people to be trained.

509
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the system to be set up correctly.

510
00:55:50,729 --> 00:55:55,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that we're doing it right so we don't cause more problems than we have right now.

511
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:01,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, we'll have a system that's built for Medford that will work correctly.

512
00:56:02,212 --> 00:56:03,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate it.

513
00:56:03,112 --> 00:56:06,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Rich put us into this century with some

514
00:56:08,155 --> 00:56:11,457
[SPEAKER_02]: data entry and making sure that we can streamline some processes.

515
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:16,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that we've talked to for many, many years and trying to find a way.

516
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes when you look at a funding mechanism, the end result will benefit far greater than what that cost will be.

517
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:28,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, like I said, I've seen it firsthand.

518
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:31,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with it firsthand.

519
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see the benefits to the community I work in.

520
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: because of just hours saved and money saved because things are, data is collected a lot easier and a lot more streamlined and shared very easily.

521
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:51,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would move approval if that's what's needed, Mr. President, so.

522
00:56:52,964 --> 00:56:55,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, we have a motion to approve from Councilor Serapelli.

523
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:57,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have, seconded by Councilor Townsend, do we have other questions?

524
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost thought you were out.

525
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:06,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I have questions and I always have questions on this stuff.

526
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:08,272
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been too long, Bob.

527
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:11,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't had you before us in a few months.

528
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:13,675
[SPEAKER_11]: My questions are actually really easy.

529
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:15,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had one.

530
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:19,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this going to make it easier for us to take online payments eventually if we move to this digital payments?

531
00:57:20,379 --> 00:57:20,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

532
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly.

533
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:21,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

534
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:34,547
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another interface problem that we'll have to be looking into, how online payments will be connecting to the treasurer and the general ledger.

535
00:57:36,175 --> 00:57:38,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably right now, that's a treasurer problem.

536
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:46,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would probably be something we'd be attacking in year two or year three when we move the treasurer's cash receipt process.

537
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,318
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can tell, I've thought about this way too much.

538
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:50,858
[SPEAKER_04]: We would move the treasurer's.

539
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:56,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we've got the general ledger working, we're going to go to the treasurer's cash receipt process and the billing.

540
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to make sure that we've transferred all billing balances to the new system correctly.

541
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:05,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But newer systems are used to all this stuff.

542
00:58:06,762 --> 00:58:09,865
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, back in 1998, it was taking online payments.

543
00:58:13,147 --> 00:58:21,573
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, having a more modern system would, whatever it turns out to be, would clearly make a difference with that.

544
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:34,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, yeah, that's a huge piece, I think, of the resident experience with City Hall, that we could make an improvement on online and digital payments would, I think, be a game changer for a lot of folks.

545
00:58:36,143 --> 00:58:40,766
[SPEAKER_11]: My other question is, you know, you mentioned chart of accounts, and I know it needs to be cleaned up.

546
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:57,076
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we had a bicycle commission donation at our last meeting last week, and they were like, you know, they've had some times in the past where they've had a donation and it's gone into a, you know, different thing in the chart of accounts.

547
00:58:57,176 --> 00:59:01,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And just wondering, is this going to like make it easier for us to see on a more regular basis?

548
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:15,094
[SPEAKER_11]: where things like a donation, making sure that it goes to the right account, giving commissions the ability to see what their balances are more easily and take that workload off of your plate and the people in your office.

549
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:27,979
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could, an example, the way we use this, there's a certain segment in the chart of accounts, in the accounts and admins, and it's called project code or program code.

550
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,180
[SPEAKER_04]: It has three digits.

551
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:34,000
[SPEAKER_04]: coming from Nantucket, we had five.

552
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:43,665
[SPEAKER_04]: So setting up a new piece of the accounting system, I had 10,000 things.

553
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:50,368
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running out of program codes just because that drives all the, that's how we keep track of all the grants.

554
00:59:50,428 --> 00:59:53,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we keep track of all the capital projects.

555
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we keep track of the CPC.

556
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:58,272
[SPEAKER_04]: The program codes drive that.

557
00:59:58,332 --> 00:59:59,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how that system is set up.

558
01:00:02,006 --> 01:00:03,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have 1,000 of them.

559
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:04,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

560
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:10,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with 10,000 of them, that means we can be much more precise in all of these things.

561
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:15,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to set up a new program, what we would call a program.

562
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:23,759
[SPEAKER_04]: In Munis, it would be called an organization code, an org code, for a specific thing.

563
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:25,340
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us $500.

564
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for making sure everybody has dog collars.

565
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:40,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and you have that set up, then you can make sure that all those donations go there and the money coming out is set up correctly so that the POs get put there and then you buy all the dog collars.

566
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:50,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the years, program codes have been used for many different purposes or many different appropriations.

567
01:00:51,934 --> 01:00:54,855
[SPEAKER_04]: So that becomes a big problem when you're trying to

568
01:00:55,854 --> 01:01:02,397
[SPEAKER_04]: go back into an actual program and see where the money came from and how it was supposed to be spent.

569
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Rich knows this.

570
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:15,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked for some dusty old papers that he had to go to the basement for because I got a query from somebody about the borrowings we had for the school pool.

571
01:01:17,184 --> 01:01:19,145
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have those papers.

572
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:20,126
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the basement.

573
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:21,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a copy of them.

574
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what they said.

575
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:27,492
[SPEAKER_04]: What else went into that account?

576
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the kind of stuff that I'm trying to clean up.

577
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:41,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be part of this whole project is to make sure that we cleaned up those old accounts and got them properly set up with the proper balances in the new system with their own specific codes.

578
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:42,951
[SPEAKER_04]: We know where the money came from.

579
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:53,240
[SPEAKER_04]: we know precisely what authorization had that money, appropriated that money, how it was funded, et cetera.

580
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes.

581
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:57,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, you're going to the basement to figure that out.

582
01:01:58,345 --> 01:01:59,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

583
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:02,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to happen for a while.

584
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:06,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've done... Actually, it's the work-off program.

585
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:08,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Last fall,

586
01:02:09,469 --> 01:02:21,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a wonderful work-off person who knew a lot about Old Benford and was bothering the clerk's office all the time to find old papers and say, OK, this is exactly what this funding was for.

587
01:02:21,957 --> 01:02:24,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could actually say, OK, we've got the paper.

588
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:25,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got it on a spreadsheet.

589
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:31,323
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all of the funding, where it came from, et cetera, what its account number in admins is.

590
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:34,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the kind of thing is when we set up a new system,

591
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:36,830
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have all that information.

592
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:41,511
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure that all of that information is recorded in an easily accessible way.

593
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:47,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So when somebody comes in and says, hey, I donated $500 to the dog fund, we'll know where the dog fund is.

594
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:49,293
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see the $500 coming in.

595
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:51,574
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see the PO for the dog collars, et cetera.

596
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,254
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it should work.

597
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:55,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

598
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:56,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Last two questions.

599
01:02:57,943 --> 01:03:14,072
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of an implementation period, I know something that, you know, I've really been focused on and I know a lot of residents would like to see is kind of a more interactive and available way to view the city budget and view the actual spending and things like that.

600
01:03:14,112 --> 01:03:15,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that going to be part of this?

601
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:22,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that we could have a link to on our website where residents could kind of have a budget browser of some kind.

602
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:26,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know other communities do have this.

603
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:36,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, with a more modern system, having that, we'd have to work on that because we don't currently do that very well.

604
01:03:37,653 --> 01:03:41,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the budget book in there, but day-to-day actuals.

605
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:45,499
[SPEAKER_11]: That's only day to day.

606
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:51,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not day to day, but yes, more accessible reports for the community.

607
01:03:51,184 --> 01:04:01,655
[SPEAKER_04]: That's certainly something that if you get a more modern system, you can have that system just do an upload in real time, say at the end of the month, something like that.

608
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:09,327
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell it how to get the data into the website without actually having somebody right now.

609
01:04:09,988 --> 01:04:20,917
[SPEAKER_04]: What we'd have to do is we'd have to do an Excel spreadsheet from admins and then group it correctly so it matches the actual budget votes.

610
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'd have to give it to ClearGov so that they can put it on the website.

611
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:26,823
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do that ourselves.

612
01:04:27,803 --> 01:04:28,744
[SPEAKER_04]: with the current system.

613
01:04:29,304 --> 01:04:31,746
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, this is something that we definitely discuss.

614
01:04:31,987 --> 01:04:34,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it was advisable, we should be able to do it.

615
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:35,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

616
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

617
01:04:37,451 --> 01:04:38,232
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.

618
01:04:38,552 --> 01:04:40,654
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be something a lot of folks are looking for.

619
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:43,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Last thing is just the timeline.

620
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:53,324
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I know, over the past couple years, we've talked, I can tell you've thought about it, because I've watched in stages, the implementation kind of idea, you put it together.

621
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:56,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And you mentioned year two, year three.

622
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:59,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So are we looking at about a three year implementation timeframe for this?

623
01:05:01,204 --> 01:05:04,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I would guess that the total conversion would take more like five.

624
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:05,905
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've heard from other communities.

625
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:06,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

626
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:14,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But we would look to be trying to, we would look to be getting things in place to replace the general ledger.

627
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:21,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be looking to do that probably this winter with the consultants, make sure that we have all our ducks in the row and everything we need.

628
01:05:23,108 --> 01:05:27,909
[SPEAKER_04]: If it worked the way I would like to, and obviously things happen.

629
01:05:28,269 --> 01:05:42,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would think that in the winter of 2027, we'd be looking to put in the general ledger module and run that concurrently with admins to make sure everything's working correctly, everybody's trained correctly.

630
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:44,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And that just works out.

631
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking of a project where

632
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:51,354
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to do another module every winter for probably five winters.

633
01:05:52,454 --> 01:06:01,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that way, for the finance department, the budget can be done without worrying about the system too much.

634
01:06:02,578 --> 01:06:05,719
[SPEAKER_04]: All the downloads for the budget have already been done.

635
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:13,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly wouldn't want to do it in September when we're trying to get the recap done, when we're trying to get the state reporting done, get the audit done.

636
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:15,262
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully,

637
01:06:16,114 --> 01:06:21,018
[SPEAKER_04]: In the wintertime, we would have more resources to concentrate on this.

638
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get around to June, you're trying to close the fiscal year.

639
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:27,383
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to make sure that everything's buttoned up for the end of the fiscal year.

640
01:06:27,403 --> 01:06:37,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the summertime, you're going through all of the year-end closing and making sure all the POs have been encumbered properly, that we've closed them out if they need to be.

641
01:06:37,691 --> 01:06:39,372
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an awful lot of detail work there.

642
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:44,988
[SPEAKER_04]: computer heavy with the accounting system.

643
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:47,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need the accounting system to do that.

644
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:59,593
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're doing the budget, that's more of a spreadsheet work and looking at tables to see whose payroll has to go up because of contractual obligations.

645
01:07:00,654 --> 01:07:01,714
[SPEAKER_04]: That's spreadsheet work.

646
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:09,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We can not focus so much on data that we need from the accounting system during that period of time.

647
01:07:10,523 --> 01:07:18,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that we won't be busy, we will, but it's not something that will put a lot of demands on the accounting system itself.

648
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:20,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how I see it working.

649
01:07:20,147 --> 01:07:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm saying a five-year timeline, because once we put something in, we're going to use it for the whole summer and make sure it's working correctly before we try to put another module in there.

650
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:36,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I've thought about this too much.

651
01:07:36,873 --> 01:07:37,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

652
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think, you know, it's important.

653
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:41,697
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an important project, and I'm glad we're moving on it.

654
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:43,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

655
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:44,359
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

656
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further questions from members of the council?

657
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:50,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing none, do we have any comment from members of the public on this paper?

658
01:07:50,584 --> 01:07:51,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I see one.

659
01:07:51,184 --> 01:07:56,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I will ask for your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

660
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

661
01:08:05,177 --> 01:08:10,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like some clarity on like the total windfall and how much spending is happening here.

662
01:08:12,142 --> 01:08:21,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that I'm in a position where I'm like potentially arguing against taking action against the increasing technical debt that our city continues to accrue.

663
01:08:23,111 --> 01:08:29,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But that sounds like a pretty large windfall and we're literally days away from

664
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:39,907
[SPEAKER_06]: a from a snap crisis from a health insurance crisis and knows what new crisis will turn out next week.

665
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:52,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's I just think it needs to be part of the calculus for using surprise money and windfall funds right now.

666
01:08:52,932 --> 01:09:02,461
[SPEAKER_06]: When we have these actual crises that, you know, as much as I would like to attack that, believe me, I want the technical debt of this city to be fixed.

667
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've worked with CPC code so I understand like the nightmare that you're dealing with.

668
01:09:11,037 --> 01:09:15,380
[SPEAKER_06]: But people, you know, residents eating is more important at the end of the day.

669
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:35,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it could just be some sort of explanation, like what the sort of spending outlay looks like and how that sort of like stepped or if it's basically taking all of this windfall cash and putting it into this project, potentially at the expense of using it for something that might be, unfortunately, more critical at the moment.

670
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you for your comment.

671
01:09:41,410 --> 01:10:04,163
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper before us is a one-time appropriation of $1.3 million, which is on the tax levy because of the River's Edge, but I don't know, Jared, if you could talk a little bit more about maybe where the money came from, and then maybe, Bob, if you could talk about what this looks like going forward in some way.

672
01:10:05,298 --> 01:10:09,939
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so the money came from what's called the MVDC, if you're familiar with it.

673
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:15,421
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the tri-city development over on the Malden River.

674
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:21,543
[SPEAKER_12]: And after 15 years, the properties roll off or come out of the pilot to their respective cities.

675
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,864
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't very well put.

676
01:10:24,924 --> 01:10:26,764
[SPEAKER_12]: It was vague in the original legislation.

677
01:10:26,804 --> 01:10:31,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So we went through what turned out to be a roughly two-year negotiation with Malden.

678
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:42,135
[SPEAKER_12]: to where they finally agreed to say, yes, once the 15 years are up, we all agree that it reads the city, the properties fall to their respective cities.

679
01:10:42,976 --> 01:10:49,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think 98% of the properties in the MBDC are on Medford land.

680
01:10:49,418 --> 01:10:56,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So as they fall off, we will get those properties to come on to our tax rolls, resulting in the same new growth.

681
01:10:57,401 --> 01:10:59,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not the same number, but it'd be the same process.

682
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:10,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the money that's in this year's levy, but we're not appropriating this money in future fiscal years to this project.

683
01:11:11,412 --> 01:11:16,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Only in so much, well, not appropriating the money.

684
01:11:17,796 --> 01:11:21,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's on the tax rolls, it goes into the tax levy.

685
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:21,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

686
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:24,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean more to say that this $1.3 million that is being

687
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:32,229
[SPEAKER_11]: appropriated in fiscal 26, it's not like the $1.3 million in the next budget is going to this as well?

688
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:32,689
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

689
01:11:33,109 --> 01:11:33,369
Okay.

690
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending on how the Council wants.

691
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:43,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll be another appropriation which will come before the Council when we need more funding.

692
01:11:43,713 --> 01:11:46,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't say if because I know we will, but

693
01:11:49,155 --> 01:12:04,448
[SPEAKER_04]: when the time is when we need the funding, we will come before the council with a funding source and say we need to do this because we need more funding because this is the next step of this project, just like any other capital appropriation.

694
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you might not have the exact figure in front of you, but

695
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:22,709
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the resident was talking about some emergency, potential emergency needs and obviously some of the really worrying and dangerous things that are happening in the federal government.

696
01:12:24,853 --> 01:12:30,878
[SPEAKER_11]: this wouldn't impact the stabilization fund or any funds that we would need that could be put towards.

697
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:40,205
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have $6 million, I believe it is, in the general stabilization fund that could be used for emergency spending.

698
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:45,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I get all the state reporting in, we'll have this year's free cash number.

699
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:50,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have an estimate on what that will be this year.

700
01:12:50,728 --> 01:12:50,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

701
01:12:51,849 --> 01:13:02,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And just, you know, I know that there's a lot of residents who are worried about the Trump administration not providing SNAP benefits starting November 1st, food stamps.

702
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:04,993
[SPEAKER_11]: and other items that are happening.

703
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:21,676
[SPEAKER_11]: The food security task force, I believe, is meeting tomorrow to bring together the city with some of the other agencies and folks who work on food security in the city to see, you know, figure out the mayor's team is putting that together.

704
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:32,298
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't really receive any communication about it directly as a city council, but we have been made aware that they're meeting to put together an emergency response in some way.

705
01:13:36,269 --> 01:13:38,857
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, do we have other comments on this?

706
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:42,890
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we'll take you to the podium, name and address the record, you'll have three minutes.

707
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:45,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

708
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,281
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jennifer Yanko.

709
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:52,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 16 Monument Street, and I just wanted to underline the importance of this.

710
01:13:52,383 --> 01:14:06,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there have been lots of complaints about lack of transparency, people wanting to know more about the budgeting process, more about where funds are going, and having updated and clear accounting systems are critical for this.

711
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:10,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to know how the money is being spent,

712
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:15,517
[SPEAKER_00]: and where it's going and how it's allocated.

713
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:18,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Having these systems in place is really important.

714
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that we should be in support of this.

715
01:14:22,444 --> 01:14:22,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

716
01:14:23,385 --> 01:14:23,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

717
01:14:23,866 --> 01:14:27,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any other public comments on this paper?

718
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:30,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

719
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:30,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, quickly.

720
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:35,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Castagnetti, Andrew, Cushman Street, East Method.

721
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:42,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have one question for these two individual department heads.

722
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:48,521
[SPEAKER_01]: What was our new growth value last year, and what is it projected to be this year?

723
01:14:50,162 --> 01:14:50,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

724
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:53,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if the assessor

725
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,611
[SPEAKER_12]: The approximate on the exact number.

726
01:14:59,631 --> 01:15:01,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Approximate was 2.5, I believe, last year.

727
01:15:01,953 --> 01:15:06,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year we're at 3.45, I believe.

728
01:15:06,155 --> 01:15:08,317
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

729
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:09,678
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

730
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:10,518
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

731
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:11,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's that.

732
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:15,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we say this year, last year, which are we talking calendar year?

733
01:15:16,002 --> 01:15:16,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Fiscal year.

734
01:15:16,602 --> 01:15:17,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Fiscal year.

735
01:15:17,403 --> 01:15:19,865
[SPEAKER_11]: So last year would be fiscal 25, and this year would be fiscal 26.

736
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:20,965
[SPEAKER_12]: That's correct.

737
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:21,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

738
01:15:26,703 --> 01:15:39,566
[SPEAKER_01]: With the extra million dollars new growth this year, can for a change, can we eliminate the prop two and a half increase and use this new growth to offset our increases?

739
01:15:41,366 --> 01:15:42,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the comment.

740
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further public comments on this paper?

741
01:15:48,548 --> 01:15:52,229
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

742
01:15:52,369 --> 01:15:53,269

[SPEAKER_03]: Council is our council.

[SPEAKER_11]: Public participation.

754
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:20,147
[SPEAKER_11]: We have general public participation on any topic that someone might want to discuss.

755
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:23,766
[SPEAKER_11]: You will have three minutes.

756
01:16:24,427 --> 01:16:28,908
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have folks in person and on Zoom, and we will alternate between in-person and on Zoom.

757
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:30,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Please raise your hands on Zoom.

758
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:32,190
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start at the podium.

759
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:34,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

760
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:35,591
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll have three minutes.

761
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:39,032
[SPEAKER_06]: 499 Main Street, Micah Kesselman.

762
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:45,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I sort of alluded to this earlier.

763
01:16:45,515 --> 01:16:49,297
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason I came to the City Council meeting tonight was that I

764
01:16:51,057 --> 01:16:57,360
[SPEAKER_06]: you're all aware, literally just talked about it, SNAP benefits are expiring or not being funded in November.

765
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:08,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Health insurance premiums are gonna devastate people starting in at the same time effectively.

766
01:17:08,926 --> 01:17:16,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are also basically people who are like, this is a cross section, like these are the same groups that are being impacted.

767
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:33,131
[SPEAKER_06]: By both of these things simultaneously and we're in a city that has, like the rest of the country ongoing and growing issues with on an underemployment, so I, what is I so I wanted to ask what are.

768
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, is there a plan?

769
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:46,247
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like there is an emergency meeting being convened tomorrow, though, if I understand correctly, the mayor didn't tell the city council about it, which is wild, but whatever.

770
01:17:46,268 --> 01:17:49,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll refrain from ranting about her incompetence today.

771
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:57,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And is there anything that is, are there any thoughts of plans or anything that

772
01:17:57,743 --> 01:18:08,347
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, any ideas that you have to deal with also the healthcare and health insurance stuff as well, because both of these things are gonna like really, really impact people in a really terrible, horrible way, and they need to be addressed ASAP.

773
01:18:09,588 --> 01:18:18,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, you know, do you have any advice or any guidance for residents who are interested or wanting to help with the situation?

774
01:18:20,713 --> 01:18:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you direct them anywhere?

775
01:18:21,893 --> 01:18:23,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think that like, you know,

776
01:18:24,174 --> 01:18:30,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate that's happening in the middle of your guys election election campaigns, you got a lot on your plate.

777
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:37,199
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is more important than moaning about Salem Street being mixed use to versus mixed use one.

778
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:40,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, thanks for any answer you give.

779
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:43,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the comment.

780
01:18:44,979 --> 01:18:46,781
[SPEAKER_11]: As I noted, super concerning.

781
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:55,329
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very worried about the impact that this retrenchment is going to have on residents.

782
01:18:55,349 --> 01:18:59,874
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not sure what the city response will be out of tomorrow's meeting.

783
01:19:00,054 --> 01:19:04,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I do know that the mystic community market is a resource on mystic Avenue.

784
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:08,082
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some mutual aid organizations in the city looking at direct

785
01:19:08,965 --> 01:19:13,207
[SPEAKER_11]: rapid response, especially the Mutual Aid Bedford-Somerville folks.

786
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:27,713
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of how is the city going to try to address certainly if this is a long-term issue with SNAP and then what seems to be a long-term issue on the health insurance premiums and the ACA markets, I do not know.

787
01:19:27,733 --> 01:19:29,434
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know,

788
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:39,416
[SPEAKER_11]: even before the last 11 months or 10 months or feels like 10 years.

789
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:47,649
[SPEAKER_11]: municipalities were being asked to do too much things that should be done by the state and federal government.

790
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:49,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're being asked to do even more.

791
01:19:49,271 --> 01:19:53,215
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything, but it just means that our capacity is limited.

792
01:19:54,316 --> 01:20:05,847
[SPEAKER_11]: For me as one Councilor, you know, we have advocated to state delegation, federal delegation for them to respond to what's happening at the federal level.

793
01:20:07,668 --> 01:20:16,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in some ways, it's a hard situation because the clearly like the Trump administration doesn't listen to Massachusetts as federal elected officials.

794
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:19,334
[SPEAKER_11]: But we definitely need to have a response.

795
01:20:19,374 --> 01:20:32,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Something I have been advocating for in an individual capacity is the corporate fair share law, which is at the state level, which would kind of backfill some of the funding cuts that we're seeing at the state level.

796
01:20:35,234 --> 01:20:56,219
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just some things that I have been looking at, and I hope that the city can kind of pretty soon after whatever meeting is happening tomorrow, point people, people who wanna help, people who wanna support in the direction of either city resources or private nonprofit resources in our community to make sure that people have food next week.

797
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,801
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, who I know is pretty in tune with a lot of the organizations who work on this.

798
01:21:03,983 --> 01:21:04,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

799
01:21:04,603 --> 01:21:09,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to mention that there I haven't been in touch with the city.

800
01:21:10,427 --> 01:21:23,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, food access resources community connector, but not since knowing that they're cutting snap benefits very soon, but Libby Lazar is our city.

801
01:21:25,197 --> 01:21:34,244
[SPEAKER_07]: connector in charge of that and actually emailed her just very recently to ask what the plan is, if there is a plan.

802
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:39,487
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mystic Market is one spot.

803
01:21:39,668 --> 01:21:45,172
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a food pantry at the UU Church on High Street every Thursday.

804
01:21:46,793 --> 01:21:49,154
[SPEAKER_07]: People can donate to these places as well.

805
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:52,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Bread of Life in Malden, Food Link in Arlington.

806
01:21:55,165 --> 01:22:00,368
[SPEAKER_07]: there are a lot of places that continue have been and continue to have food resources.

807
01:22:00,468 --> 01:22:16,017
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, um Uh, I'm interested in hearing what the city is planning to put together in anticipation of there being more people with fewer resources coming up.

808
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:16,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um

809
01:22:20,632 --> 01:22:38,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially the people that continue to have resources being interested in participating in that side of things is still I mean something we sometimes talk about in Medford, but maybe not frequently enough is that there is a lot of income disparity here, so there will continue to be people who are doing fine.

810
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:56,244
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's incumbent upon those of us who are doing okay to maybe step up and offer those resources to the people that may be especially suffering right now by donating and offering those resources to the people that don't have them.

811
01:22:56,485 --> 01:23:01,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we'll find ourselves with some more food drives in the future.

812
01:23:11,747 --> 01:23:12,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not sure.

813
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:15,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know when it's happening.

814
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:16,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who's attending.

815
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:21,055
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know that there's some sort of meeting because somebody emailed someone who told me that.

816
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:27,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

817
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:28,482
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

818
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:29,863
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll stay at the podium.

819
01:23:30,183 --> 01:23:31,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

820
01:23:31,104 --> 01:23:31,825
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have three minutes.

821
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:40,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to chime in on this.

822
01:23:40,884 --> 01:23:42,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Going hungry is no fun.

823
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:50,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like one in five Massachusetts residents are getting whatever they call it, snap, eight, food cards.

824
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:55,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not fun, especially if they're used to getting the food.

825
01:23:56,815 --> 01:24:07,562
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if I'm not mistaken, didn't the governor Haley come up with a billion dollars somehow to help with these hotels, with the immigration situation?

826
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:16,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think if she can come up with a billion dollars, maybe she could do something for all the 351 cities and towns.

827
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

828
01:24:24,171 --> 01:24:27,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further public comment on anything?

829
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:29,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

830
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:31,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you have two minutes left.

831
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:33,193
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

832
01:24:33,393 --> 01:24:34,793
[SPEAKER_11]: You have two minutes left on your timer.

833
01:24:35,373 --> 01:24:35,893
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is...

834
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:42,533
[SPEAKER_11]: This is in general, so we're already in the general public participation.

835
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:44,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

836
01:24:47,116 --> 01:24:48,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

837
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:54,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question that's very unusual.

838
01:24:57,962 --> 01:25:02,905
[SPEAKER_01]: First, your Prop 2.5 double override that we passed

839
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:07,137
[SPEAKER_01]: costs me about $1,000 extra on my real estate tax bill.

840
01:25:07,577 --> 01:25:12,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm pushing up to $10,000 on a year real estate tax bill.

841
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:17,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't take into account the $1,000 extra from the increase.

842
01:25:18,564 --> 01:25:22,787
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to be a 2.5% added thanks to Barbara Anderson.

843
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:25,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be any more unless we do another override.

844
01:25:27,049 --> 01:25:32,032
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's going to be in perpetuity along with the $9,000 I'm already paying.

845
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:39,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us are having trouble paying our real estate tax bills, especially our seniors on a fixed income.

846
01:25:41,278 --> 01:25:55,449
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, if you all city councilors are reelected next week, will you please repeal this unfair prop two and a half override and help all the method real estate taxpayers?

847
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:59,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, no or no comments.

848
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:04,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks Andy, it's.

849
01:26:05,329 --> 01:26:05,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

850
01:26:05,509 --> 01:26:05,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

851
01:26:07,231 --> 01:26:08,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, number two.

852
01:26:12,455 --> 01:26:16,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a question for Mr. Beers and another Councilor.

853
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:27,788
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck happened with my $100 check I gave to you in the city to install the memorial lights on the Mystic River footbridge?

854
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you gonna give it to the mayor?

855
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:31,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I did give it to the mayor, yes.

856
01:26:32,697 --> 01:26:34,757
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no lights, it's over a year now.

857
01:26:35,898 --> 01:26:40,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I have actually asked her about it, but the money's with them.

858
01:26:40,759 --> 01:26:42,619
