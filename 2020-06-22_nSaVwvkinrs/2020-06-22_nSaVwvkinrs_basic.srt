Greetings, seniors. This is Superintendent Edward Vincent, and I'm really happy to be here this evening to recognize you on this special scholarship awards night. As you can see, I'm holding in my hand the Mustang mask. I am Mustang proud, just like all of you. I am also Mustang strong.

2
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:59,224
Today, I'm speaking to you because schools are closed and we're not able to meet in person. But I want to congratulate all of you for your wonderful achievements. Why are we here tonight to celebrate you? We're here because you worked hard and you're being recognized. You're being recognized for your great achievements, but you're also being recognized financially.

3
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:16,681
Some of you are going to receive scholarships tonight because you excelled in certain academic areas or maybe in sports or maybe in the arts. Others of you are being recognized because you wrote an essay

4
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:46,288
for community service and you were selected because of your excellent persuasion skills and your ability to express through written word what it is that you do on behalf of the community of Medford. It doesn't matter the reason why you're being recognized. The fact is you're all being recognized with scholarships tonight. I want to congratulate you for your hard work

5
00:01:46,527 --> 00:02:00,179
As a Mustang, these 12 years, you're going on to college. You're going on to bigger, better, and a brighter future. And you have scholarship award money to support you with that.

6
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:23,507
I encourage you, when you are in college, to continue to write for scholarships, to not give up, to continue to be dedicated to the community and to doing service learning projects, continuing to make your community a better place. I am so proud of all of you. Congratulations on your wonderful accomplishments this evening.

7
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:47,039

11
00:03:44,991 --> 00:04:14,684

We'd like to have many applications, so next year the seniors should definitely reapply. Medford Quantics Club thanks you. Hello Medford community. My name is Katie Fumara and I am a school adjustment counselor at the McGlynn Elementary School here in Medford, as well as the president and founder of 4INC, a 501c3 nonprofit organization located here in Medford.

16
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:38,012
4INC is an organization that raises money for cancer research and patient care. We hope to help those in need and inspire those willing to help. When I was 18, I lost my father to lung cancer. My father was a lifelong Medford resident, a Medford High graduate, and an avid golfer. This organization started as an annual golf tournament, and it quickly transformed into a group raising money to support families going through a recent cancer diagnosis.

17
00:06:38,712 --> 00:07:05,469
as well as inspiring the community to know what they stand for. This is the second year that 4 Inc. is awarding a scholarship to a Medford High senior. Medford is so important to us, particularly to our story where my father was a lifelong Medford resident and now that I am working in Medford. My board of directors really looks for a graduating senior who is excited about their future endeavors

18
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:32,875
and how that connects to their passion about what they are advocating for in the community. We had numerous amazing senior candidates for this scholarship, and I want to sincerely thank each and every one of them for applying, as well as congratulating them on their recent graduation of high school. This year, 4INC would like to award the $1,000 scholarship to Jacqueline Madigan.

19
00:07:33,865 --> 00:08:02,125

The Petrangelo Fund has sponsored several key cultural events over the years, trips to Italy, in addition to giving out scholarships each year. Our library is actually named after Michelina Petrangelo. You can see the plaque right when you walk in.

And Charlie wants to make sure that students like you don't have the financial burdens that so many others have.

33
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:33,285

My brother Matt was a 2012 graduate of Medford High School. He passed away from cancer at the age of 19. Matt was a member of the high school cross country team for three years. He received the unsung hero award his senior year and was proud to serve as captain under coach Lou who Matt admired as a leader and a friend.

43
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:30,606
As a member of the team, Matt met some of his best friends and learned the meaning and value of dedication, teamwork, and the importance of simply enjoying the moment, whether it finished in a race in the first place or last. From reading their essays, it's easy to see how this year's recipients of the Matthew Soros Sorelli Scholarship exemplify so many of the characteristics that define who Matt was. A good person and friend with a kind heart and gentle spirit, who you could always trust and count on to be there when you needed him.
