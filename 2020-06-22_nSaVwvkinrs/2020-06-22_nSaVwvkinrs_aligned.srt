00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:05,768
Greetings, seniors.

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:17,598
This is Superintendent Edward Vincent, and I'm really happy to be here this evening to recognize you on this special scholarship awards night.

3
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:24,403
As you can see, I'm holding in my hand the Mustang mask.

4
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,347
I am Mustang proud, just like all of you.

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,669
I am also Mustang strong.

6
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:38,240
Today, I'm speaking to you because schools are closed and we're not able to meet in person.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,261
But I want to congratulate all of you for your wonderful achievements.

8
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:47,202
Why are we here tonight to celebrate you?

9
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:52,123
We're here because you worked hard and you're being recognized.

10
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:58,724
You're being recognized for your great achievements, but you're also being recognized financially.

11
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:10,196
Some of you are going to receive scholarships tonight because you excelled in certain academic areas or maybe in sports or maybe in the arts.

12
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:16,121
Others of you are being recognized because you wrote an essay

13
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:31,845
for community service and you were selected because of your excellent persuasion skills and your ability to express through written word what it is that you do on behalf of the community of Medford.

14
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:36,186
It doesn't matter the reason why you're being recognized.

15
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:41,567
The fact is you're all being recognized with scholarships tonight.

16
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:45,568
I want to congratulate you for your hard work

17
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:51,131
As a Mustang, these 12 years, you're going on to college.

18
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:55,435
You're going on to bigger, better, and a brighter future.

19
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,959
And you have scholarship award money to support you with that.

20
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:16,422
I encourage you, when you are in college, to continue to write for scholarships, to not give up, to continue to be dedicated to the community and to doing service learning projects, continuing to make your community a better place.

21
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:18,964
I am so proud of all of you.

22
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:23,147
Congratulations on your wonderful accomplishments this evening.

23
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:30,190
whether it's for academics, whether it's sports, whether it's the arts, whether it's community service.

24
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,812
Congratulations for your hard work.

25
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,173
You deserve these scholarships.

26
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:39,195
I wish you great success as you start school next year.

27
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:44,918
And don't forget, we are Mustang strong and we are Mustang proud.

28
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:46,319
Go Seniors!

29
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,722
I'd like to congratulate our seniors of the class of 2020 for being awarded these scholarships.

30
00:02:54,502 --> 00:03:01,005
This is just another mark that shows how hard this class has worked and how much they deserve.

31
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:10,789
For all the seniors that have been selected, I know that you've put a lot of effort into all your work and these scholarships are attainment for exactly what you have done.

32
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:22,213
I hope that you use this to move your education in a forward motion so that you are continuing your achievements and becoming lifelong learners.

33
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:27,255
Hello Medford Mustang graduates, class of 2020.

34
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:30,217
It's Miss Lavin, your director of guidance.

35
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:37,764
I wanted to kick off this year's scholarship award by first saying thank you and congratulations.

36
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:44,310
It truly has been my pleasure to step in as acting director of guidance this year.

37
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:48,072
and see how much you've grown up through the years.

38
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:55,476
I've had so many of you since elementary school, into the Andrews Middle School, and now at Medford High School.

39
00:03:56,196 --> 00:04:03,299
And this year, we're gonna start the award ceremony off with the Medford Police Patrolman's Association Award.

40
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:12,463
There are four $1,000 awards that they raised money during the No Shave November event that they held.

41
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,104
And the winners are,

42
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,463

45
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,568
We want to know how you're doing and what your future looks like.

46
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,070
Thank you so much and have a great day.

47
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,311
Hello from the Medford Kiwanis Club.

48
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,833
I am Mike Hayes, chair of the scholarship committee.

49
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:43,096

50

51
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,105
They're all $2,000 scholarship recipients.

52
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:12,929
As the chairperson, I create the facts about the applications without identifying people's names.

53
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,092
There's a committee of six voting members.

54
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:22,655
Recipients are picked on the following criteria.

55
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:32,343
Medford residents, financial needs, academics, community service, and character.

56
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:36,867
At least one recipient must be a Key Club member.

57
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:40,791
One recipient is from the Tufts-Curtis School.

58
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:47,969
We'd like to have many applications, so next year the seniors should definitely reapply.

59
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,571
Medford Quantics Club thanks you.

60
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,473
Hello Medford community.

61
00:05:53,073 --> 00:06:06,783
My name is Katie Fumara and I am a school adjustment counselor at the McGlynn Elementary School here in Medford, as well as the president and founder of 4INC, a 501c3 nonprofit organization located here in Medford.

62
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:12,707
4INC is an organization that raises money for cancer research and patient care.

63
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:17,288
We hope to help those in need and inspire those willing to help.

64
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:21,369
When I was 18, I lost my father to lung cancer.

65
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:27,090
My father was a lifelong Medford resident, a Medford High graduate, and an avid golfer.

66
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:37,852
This organization started as an annual golf tournament, and it quickly transformed into a group raising money to support families going through a recent cancer diagnosis.

67
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:42,214
as well as inspiring the community to know what they stand for.

68
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,097
This is the second year that 4 Inc.

69
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,499
is awarding a scholarship to a Medford High senior.

70
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,284
Medford is so important to us, particularly to our story where my father was a lifelong Medford resident and now that I am working in Medford.

71
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:05,349
My board of directors really looks for a graduating senior who is excited about their future endeavors

72
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:12,125
and how that connects to their passion about what they are advocating for in the community.

73
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:25,431
We had numerous amazing senior candidates for this scholarship, and I want to sincerely thank each and every one of them for applying, as well as congratulating them on their recent graduation of high school.

74
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:32,715
This year, 4INC would like to award the $1,000 scholarship to Jacqueline Madigan.

75
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:40,690
Jacqueline is attending Salve Regina in the fall to pursue a nursing degree and we wish her the best of luck.

76
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,752
Thank you so much to everyone who applied.

77
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,773

78
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:50,417

79
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,739
The first is the Munoz Lepore scholarship.

80
00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:02,125
It is awarded to a student who has achieved the highest level of Spanish competency at Medford High School while demonstrating a passion for learning and a constant pursuit of excellence.

81
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:12,250
The recipient of this scholarship will have demonstrated a desire to push the academic envelope, resulting in strong speaking and writing skill and ability to grasp difficult concepts.

82
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:23,814
In addition, the student will have brought to the classroom a strong appreciation for the cultural elements that strongly enhance the study of the language and will plan to continue the study of Spanish in the future.

83
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:28,376
We have two lucky recipients of this $1,000 scholarship this year.

84
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:31,697
They are Nicholas Hollings and Michael Wu.

85
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:33,182
Congratulations, gentlemen.

86

00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:54,788
Judgment was based on exemplary speaking, reading, and writing skills, while demonstrating a keen sensitivity to the cultural components that influence their respective languages.

89
00:08:56,148 --> 00:09:03,271
For French, in the amount of $400 each, we have two lucky winners, Katie Stefani and Shruti Sood.

90
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,492
And Spanish, one winner for the amount of $800, Catherine Brosnahan.

91
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:09,073

93
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:16,275
I'm a school counselor here at the high school, and I'll be presenting the Michelina Petrangelo Scholarship.

94
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:24,318
Michelina Petrangelo is a very dedicated and passionate teacher of the Italian language at the high school for many, many years.

95
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,343
Unfortunately, her life and career were cut short due to a long battle with a leukemia-related illness.

96
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:42,089
The Petrangelo Fund has sponsored several key cultural events over the years, trips to Italy, in addition to giving out scholarships each year.

97
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,592
Our library is actually named after Michelina Petrangelo.

98
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:48,413
You can see the plaque right when you walk in.

99
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,290
to the library.

100
00:09:51,051 --> 00:10:04,718

101
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,181

112
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:26,672

121
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:22,436

00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,220

129
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,286
And I studied music in college, too.

130

132
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:58,951
You know, Charlie Hoff happens to be a good friend of mine.

133
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:09,179
And I know there's nothing that Charlie likes more than trying to help our students achieve success, not just while they're here at UMass Lowell, but throughout your life.

134
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,705
And Charlie wants to make sure that students like you don't have the financial burdens that so many others have.

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,711
who you are, and I read your application.

138
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:43,096
And I know that you want to be somebody in this world, and you are definitely somebody in this world.

139
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:53,762
And coming to UMass Lowell is not only going to help you find out who that somebody is, but it will help you find out where your place is in the world today.

140
00:13:54,683 --> 00:14:01,947

156
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:50,018
This award goes to Dorothea Villot.

157

161

Hi, everyone.

162
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,266
My name's Alana Bruno.

163
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:22,007
I'm a guidance counselor at Medford High.

164
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,289
I'm announcing the scholarship for East Cambridge Savings Bank.

165
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:32,672
Supporting educational and enrichment opportunities for Medford High graduates is a core value of East Cambridge Savings Bank.

166
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:36,334
They believe that an educated community is a powerful one.

167
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:43,418

He passed away from cancer at the age of 19.

170
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:53,108
Matt was a member of the high school cross country team for three years.

171
00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:00,496
He received the unsung hero award his senior year and was proud to serve as captain under coach Lou who Matt admired as a leader and a friend.

172
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:13,421
As a member of the team, Matt met some of his best friends and learned the meaning and value of dedication, teamwork, and the importance of simply enjoying the moment, whether it finished in a race in the first place or last.

173
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:24,024
From reading their essays, it's easy to see how this year's recipients of the Matthew Soros Sorelli Scholarship exemplify so many of the characteristics that define who Matt was.

174
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:30,466
A good person and friend with a kind heart and gentle spirit, who you could always trust and count on to be there when you needed him.

175
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:38,083
took pride in anything he did, especially his work with kids with special needs and always remembering to pay it forward.

176
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:45,965
It is our honor to present this year's scholarships for $1,000 each to Jacqueline Madigan and John Falco.

178
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:54,147

179
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,667

181
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:03,836
watching you grow and realizing your dreams for the future.

182
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,625
