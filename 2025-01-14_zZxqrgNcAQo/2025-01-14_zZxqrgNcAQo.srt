[SPEAKER_20]: uh, true legend here in Medford.

105
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:30,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, when we know that Mr. Granada has been fighting a good fight for some time now.

106
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:43,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but when, uh, we sure when God came calling this past week, um, we knew he now has one of the best people Medford ever had to offer to sit by his side.

107
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:52,172
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, Mr. Granada was so entrenched in our community and had so much love and passion for the city that I remember the time when I first started

108
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:59,961
[SPEAKER_20]: the option of running for school committee, I had to go sit with Mr. Granara to get his blessing.

109
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:14,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Not for the fact that he was the God, but it was so important to get his blessing so he can talk to you and explain to you what it truly meant to be an elected official in Medford.

110
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:18,927
[SPEAKER_20]: He made me understand that the reason why we become elected officials

111
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:31,137
[SPEAKER_20]: is the work that you are doing for the community, for the residents of the city, not for yourself, not for yourself, anything to gain any self-worth or for you personally, but what's best for the community.

112
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:44,387
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that when you first hear some of the things, I know that people don't know this, but Mr. Granara was a major factor in the Middlesex Sheriff's Offices and Trevor Katushin

113
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,098
[SPEAKER_20]: wrote this past week.

114
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:53,542
[SPEAKER_20]: It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you all the former Special Sheriff John Granara Esquire has passed away.

115
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:57,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Our thoughts and prayers are with his entire Granara family during this difficult time.

116
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:06,810
[SPEAKER_20]: A graduate of Matanon High School, Boston College, Suffolk University Law School, John Granara served the MSO with distinction in the highest levels.

117
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,752
[SPEAKER_20]: He began as the MSO's Chief Legal Counsel in March 1997, serving until 2009 of August.

118
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:15,595
[SPEAKER_20]: when he was appointed as Special Sheriff.

119
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:26,878
[SPEAKER_20]: Following the passing of the Sheriff Jimmy DePaulo in November of 2010, Special Sheriff Granara ably ran this agency until the appointment of Sheriff Katushin.

120
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:36,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Providing leadership at the pivotal time for the Middlesex Sheriff's Office, he was an invaluable source of knowledge, leadership, and friendship to me and many others throughout his tenure.

121
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,963
[SPEAKER_20]: It was our great privilege to have him remain as a Special Sheriff until August of 2011.

122
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:55,918
[SPEAKER_20]: John's legacy is public service included his time in the method school committee from 74 to 77 and his election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 76 representing his beloved hometown of Medford.

123
00:18:56,578 --> 00:19:01,221
[SPEAKER_20]: In his memory, the half the flags in Middlesex jails were all lowered to half staff.

124
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:07,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I know I read council bears read a few things that Mr. Granada did, but he did every

125
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:09,664
[SPEAKER_20]: He did more than people even knew.

126
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:21,270
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a lot of things, whether it's a celebration parade in Medford, whether it's supporting different programs that no one knew about, it was Mr. Granauer that did the work behind the scenes.

127
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:34,398
[SPEAKER_20]: And he kept a tradition that I thought was so valuable and so needed for our veterans that I believe it was, I said Memorial Day, but I believe it's Memorial Day, not Veterans Day, I believe.

128
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:51,431
[SPEAKER_20]: that working together with the members of the American Legion and the Elks, they would have our presentation and he would set a day of remembrance that you had to be there, you couldn't miss.

129
00:19:52,232 --> 00:20:01,239
[SPEAKER_20]: So he was a special individual and someone that this city will miss, but if you've known John Granara, please share a story.

130
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't let his,

131
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:05,883
[SPEAKER_20]: his work fade away.

132
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:11,446
[SPEAKER_20]: Let that name stick with you, because this is what the city is lacking today.

133
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:18,030
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason why you see such divide is because people like John Granara aren't here to bring these groups together.

134
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:33,379
[SPEAKER_20]: So to the Granara family, we send our deepest condolences, and I'd love to, if we can, leave this meeting in his honor, Mr. President, and thank you for the time.

135
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:34,737

160

00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,382
[SPEAKER_20]: Another long time battle.

162
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:21,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Evangelista fought hard to be there for his loving wife and his two daughters, like he's always been.

163
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,185
[SPEAKER_20]: And unfortunately,

164
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:28,273
[SPEAKER_20]: He was taken from us and hopefully is resting in peace now.

165
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:34,855
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that the Evangelista family worked so hard, especially Julianne and Lisa.

166
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:37,936
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know Lisa, who's worked for the city for many, many years.

167
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:46,119
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to say she ran the city while Mike McGlynn was the mayor for those many, many years, and then moved over to the school department for many years.

168
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:54,031
[SPEAKER_20]: and I know that he will be missed and we just share our condolences with Evangelista family, so thank you.

00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:39,297
[SPEAKER_18]: On the request of Councilor Scarpelli, we're gonna take a moment of silence on the two condolences.

187
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone could please rise.

210
00:24:52,100 --> 00:25:08,490
[SPEAKER_17]: On Tuesday, January 7, we met as the governance committee to discuss the communications from the mayor and the receipt of the draft of the charter study committee's recommendations as sent to us and modified by the mayor's office.

211
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:14,554
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked at that meeting generally about how we wanted to structure the charter review process going forward.

212
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:19,877
[SPEAKER_17]: One slight, for folks watching at home, what the city charter is,

213
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:25,679
[SPEAKER_17]: our city constitution, it sets the foundation of how our city government works.

214
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:45,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that meeting, we laid out a roadmap for the next three meetings at which we'll have the call-in center there to help us understand the policy material, work with our ideas, with the ideas of the Charter Study Committee, and to create a draft that we can vote out of the committee

215
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:51,334
[SPEAKER_17]: by hopefully the end of February or early March.

216
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:55,778
[SPEAKER_17]: That way we can get it to the state house and get it before the voters this fall.

217
00:25:56,058 --> 00:26:01,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Being very quick, because I think this is a good opportunity to let the public know about how we're structuring these meetings.

218
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:11,691
[SPEAKER_17]: We've decided that on Wednesday, January 22nd, the governance committee will work on issues related to the legislative branch.

219
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:15,795
[SPEAKER_17]: If folks at home are following along with the process, the draft

220
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:17,180
[SPEAKER_17]: is there.

221
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:19,330
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be talking about the preamble, article one.

222
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:28,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Incorporation Short Title Definitions, Article 2, the legislative branch, and a section of Article 9, which also touches on the legislative branch.

223
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:49,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Speeding through, Tuesday, February 4 will be the second substantive meeting on the city charter, at which we'll discuss Articles 3 about the executive branch to the mayor's office, Articles 5, 6, and 7 about administrative organization, financial procedures, and elections.

224
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:57,584
[SPEAKER_17]: At our last scheduled substantive meeting on Wednesday, February 19th, we will be talking about the school committee.

225
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:02,987
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll also be reaching out to relevant stakeholders for their feedback as well.

226
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:09,792
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be talking about citizen participation mechanisms, general provisions, and transitional provisions as well.

227
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:11,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

228
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:13,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

229
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:16,257
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve the committee report, seconded by?

230
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:18,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

231
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:18,899
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

232
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:20,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

233
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

234
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Refer to committee for further discussion.

235
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:27,833
[SPEAKER_18]: 25-005 offered by Councilor Sagan, Councilor Leming.

236
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:34,857
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas most of Medford's financial electoral personnel assessment and other information is not readily available for bulk analysis.

237
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:43,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas analysis of such data would advance the City Council's goals of greater transparency and resident participation by allowing the city staff and residents to share and analyze data.

238
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:50,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that Medford create a system for residents to engage with data collected by the city of Medford and collaborate with city partners on policy development.

239
00:27:51,144 --> 00:28:04,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that this resolution be referred to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, whereas this is in the refer to committee for further discussion section, I will entertain a brief summary before this goes to committee for the discussion, Councilor Tseng.

240
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:06,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

241
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be brief about this.

242
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:11,310
[SPEAKER_17]: This is something that I know a few candidates ran on in the last election.

243
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:18,196
[SPEAKER_17]: When we think about democracy in the 21st century, we think about the challenges.

244
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:23,517
[SPEAKER_17]: We understand that to build trust, we must pursue a policy of transparency.

245
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:36,479
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe an open data policy will make data more accessible to our residents to understand what's shaping our policy debates in the city and how they can contribute to that debate as well.

246
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:43,201
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that pursuing an open data policy is in a proactive spirit.

247
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:53,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that we can come to answer questions with residents before they get to different levels as soon as possible.

248
00:28:54,206 --> 00:29:03,471
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe that this maximally leverages opportunities for us to collaborate, for policymakers in this building to collaborate with our residents.

249
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:06,073
[SPEAKER_17]: We know that there's so many bright minds here in Medford.

250
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:18,981
[SPEAKER_17]: We know that there's so many people eager to help us out on solving the big challenges that we're facing as a city, and that we can all work better together when this data is out there for people to use at home.

251
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:29,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Chief among our priorities with crafting an open data policy will also be privacy and security, which we know will be a challenge in the next four years coming up.

252
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:39,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank Councilor Tseng on the motion of Councilor Tseng to refer to the resident services and public engagement committee seconded by Councilor Leming Councilor Leming.

253
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:41,805
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

254
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:46,589
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm a data scientist by trade.

255
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:52,754
[SPEAKER_25]: And whenever I communicate with residents and add an email, I usually like to run some numbers.

256
00:29:52,774 --> 00:30:00,840
[SPEAKER_25]: I often look at historical housing prices and things like that that come from the state data bank.

257
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:06,544
[SPEAKER_25]: And whenever I try to bring any of that data

258
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Whenever I try to bring my eye over to the city, it's always a bit of a challenge.

259
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:19,028
[SPEAKER_25]: If you go on the elections website, for instance, they do release historic elections data, but it's all in kind of PDFs.

260
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:21,710
[SPEAKER_25]: It's occasionally a Google spreadsheet.

261
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,971
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all very inconsistent.

262
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:28,214
[SPEAKER_25]: If I try to look at historical data from the assessor's office, it is all available.

263
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:45,107
[SPEAKER_25]: In a website if you want to look up a particular address, but if you want to do bulk analysis of the trends find the average price find the average assessed price of a certain neighborhood, for instance, that state is very difficult to come by, even though it is available within the assessor's office.

264
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:54,574
[SPEAKER_25]: So this is a way to inform discussions among residents as well as department heads and city staff when they're making these sort of decisions.

265
00:30:54,654 --> 00:31:04,841
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a way to make all of our decisions a lot more numbers driven by making data from different apartments accessible in a format that is easiest to analyze.

266
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,703
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm personally very excited about this.

267
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:12,407
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm very excited to get into the weeds about this in committee and

268
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,970
[SPEAKER_25]: I look forward to the discussion in the coming months about it.

269
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

270
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,252
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion, all those in favor?

271
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:21,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

272
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:22,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

273
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,593
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

274
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,535
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins.

275
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:34,878
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears, I would motion to suspend the rules and take the following papers out of order, 25006, 24510, 24502, and 23055.

276
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:56,991
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to suspend the rules to take papers to 5006 to 4510 to 4502 and 23055 seconded by seconded by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

277
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed.

278
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:07,936
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes to 5006 resolution to support families of youth with disabilities offered by Councilor Leming and Councilor Callahan.

279
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:19,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas youth with disabilities need support during their developmental years, whereas parents of youth with disabilities are under supported and often have often have to go outside municipalities to find programs for their kids.

280
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:25,036
[SPEAKER_18]: And whereas after school programs are rare in Medford and those support that support youth with disabilities are non existent.

281
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:34,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the Bedford City Council strongly encourage the administration to prioritize these members of our community by finding a way to quickly set up programs that meet their specific needs.

282
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:40,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that the City Council listen to the comments of parents of youth with disabilities on their own experiences in finding support.

283
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:43,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Leming, and then I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

284
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:46,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, President Bears.

285
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:58,286
[SPEAKER_25]: Before I was in public office and about six months after, I was a mentor for a very wonderful charity called Partners for Youth with Disabilities.

286
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:05,949
[SPEAKER_25]: It's basically like a big brother, big sister kind of a program, except it's for youth who have a number of disabilities.

287
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:15,272
[SPEAKER_25]: I was working with a kid in Somerville who was on the spectrum, and it was also something that I studied a little bit more abstractly in grad school.

288
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:20,436
[SPEAKER_25]: Working with him, we met up usually once a week.

289
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:33,326
[SPEAKER_25]: I understood the challenges that not only these kids go through, but also their parents, as well as the amount of extra support that kids with disabilities need.

290
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:46,137
[SPEAKER_25]: And very recently, Councilor Callahan and I, as well as you, Council President Bears, were approached by a group of parents of

291
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:54,516
[SPEAKER_25]: kids and teenagers with disabilities who had been advocating for years for more city support for their kids.

292
00:33:55,517 --> 00:34:04,724
[SPEAKER_25]: Oftentimes they just wanted to have a group that would let them meet up after school to play board games, or really do any kind of

293
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:09,647
[SPEAKER_25]: socialization to get them out of the house, any kind of support.

294
00:34:10,187 --> 00:34:34,844
[SPEAKER_25]: And so the purpose of this resolution is to first give these parents, a number of whom are here tonight to speak about their experience, to give them a platform to talk and make public some of the challenges they've been through over the years, and also to prioritize some staff support

295
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:38,786
[SPEAKER_25]: for their kids during budget season.

296
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:43,228
[SPEAKER_25]: It could come through increased support to the Medford Recreation Department.

297
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:51,111
[SPEAKER_25]: It could come through other positions, but I'll stop talking because I'm looking forward to what they have to say.

298
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:51,652
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

299
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:53,472
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

300
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:54,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan.

301
00:34:55,523 --> 00:34:55,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much.

302
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:57,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do.

303
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:03,630
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I appreciate the time of these parents, you know, having heard a lot of their stories.

304
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:06,292
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you will all hear today.

305
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, it really is.

306
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:22,500
[SPEAKER_08]: They are in a situation of really needing to be supported and needing to be supported in their own city and not to have to drive like long distances to get to somewhere that they can get the support they need.

307
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to work with them as parents.

308
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:36,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope also that we can find someone in the community who is not one of these parents to like help us to really sort of move forward on this issue.

309
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:47,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to work with the administration, and to really be creative in thinking about the ways that we can support them as quickly as possible.

310
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:54,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we've been in these discussions so we've been in this administration already with these discussions so we're moving forward.

311
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm really excited to hear from them, and excited to.

312
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:13,590
[SPEAKER_08]: get them what they need quickly and in the long term, making sure that that's something that is going to be, you know, a long term thing in the city of Medford that they can count on.

313
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

314
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,292
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

315
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:21,774
[SPEAKER_18]: And before we hear directly I just want to say thank you to Trisha and all the parents.

316
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:24,199
[SPEAKER_18]: who've been working on this for years.

317
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:33,243
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank former school committee member McLaughlin who's here with us tonight and who has been a voice on the school committee as well.

318
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:36,244
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to acknowledge this is the second night in a row that a lot of parents have turned out.

319
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:45,608
[SPEAKER_18]: They were at school committee last night and we saw, I think, some significant progress last night with some investments in programming that parents have really been asking for.

320
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:50,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And that quite frankly would not have been possible if we didn't have the supplemental budget.

321
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:57,560
[SPEAKER_18]: from the override and I think prioritizing these investments was one of the reasons that we did that.

322
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,986
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really want to thank everyone who advocated and also the school committee for making those decisions last night.

323
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:13,694
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and just also thank Vice Chair Graham who, Vice Chair Graham and I had an initial meeting and a lot has blossomed since then that I'm grateful to see.

324
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:17,618
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, if there's any other Councilors who'd like to share anything,

325
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:22,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we open to the public, I'll go to Vice President Collins.

326
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

327
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:27,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to my fellow Councilors for putting this on the agenda.

328
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:31,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, mostly, to families who are here tonight.

329
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:39,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this is really just the tip of the iceberg of the advocacy that you're doing on behalf of not just your own families, but of the entire disability community.

330
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time you advocate for your own families and your own youth's outcomes, you're advocating for the entire community.

331
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:47,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very grateful to you for that and to the years of effort that have gone into this.

332
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:49,785
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to what the city can do.

333
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:53,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like anything else, we fund what's important to us.

334
00:37:53,226 --> 00:38:06,792
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a cut and dry equity issue, we need to do more to make sure that families that live in our community did not have to travel outside of our community to get the type of programming and supports and education that they or their children are entitled to.

335
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:14,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look forward to continuing to work with the administration to make sure that we are putting dollars where they need to be for that to be the case.

336
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:16,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

337
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,694
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli then Council is our Councilor Scarpelli.

338
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:21,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:23,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for this initiative I so excited to see this.

340
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:35,400
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can't wait for the involvement of our parents and, and, and really pick your brain and then as a program developer for parks and recreation department, and a neighboring community that

341
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:44,910
[SPEAKER_20]: is focusing on the enhancement and the growth of our adaptive programming for after school, before school, and during the summers.

342
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:53,416
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that during the vacation weeks, I'm so excited that, you know, that we have a group of parents that can kickstart something here in Medford.

343
00:38:53,816 --> 00:39:00,161
[SPEAKER_20]: I know I've worked very closely with Kevin and also the directors in Belmont and also in Malden because we find it

344
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:15,195
[SPEAKER_20]: very difficult to get programs that were bringing enough enough participants to make it sustainable in the sense not that it's, you know, we've offered to do special programming with, you know, with as free programs.

345
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:19,057
[SPEAKER_20]: We've looked into providing free transportation.

346
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:22,939
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're really excited and looking into trying to do things collaboratively.

347
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:37,767
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why I'm so excited tonight to see this, that our parents can share some information that I would love to work with Kevin directly with Somerville and saying, hey, this is a great collaboration where there'll be no boundaries, there'll be no limitations.

348
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:43,290
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember we worked closely with, at one time, the only thing that was offered for our

349
00:39:43,951 --> 00:40:02,132
[SPEAKER_20]: special needs and adaptive families back in the day when I first started as a developer was the top soccer program and it was such an important program and I remember talking to parents as we ran that program through and it was so important for the parents to feel that they want to be soccer moms and dads as well.

350
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:07,327
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just important for the whole family to have these programs and I'm so excited.

351
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:14,409
[SPEAKER_20]: I've worked with Adaptive Sports New England in trying to bring programs to Somerville.

352
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:23,592
[SPEAKER_20]: One program we're looking to start this coming year is looking to use Dillboy Stadium for our wheelchair accessible track program.

353
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:33,099
[SPEAKER_20]: One thing that I'm working closely with the Special Needs Department and Somerville in trying to find a true partnership that we can really sustain it.

354
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:40,685
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that when we've had a program during the summer, and it's an adaptive parks and recreation program.

355
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:45,929
[SPEAKER_20]: And we would offer that after our students would leave the summer program.

356
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:52,735
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was very accessible, and we made sure we supported in every which way with transportation.

357
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:57,020
[SPEAKER_20]: we found it at times that the numbers weren't there.

358
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:12,196
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that really having a group that can advocate that we can turn to both Kevin and I personally, because I think it'll be a huge success if we collaborate and work together with neighboring communities so we can really help it grow it together.

359
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:15,820
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm excited for the fact I've given, I've been given that

360
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:24,145
[SPEAKER_20]: that permission from our director in Somerville, that we can really enhance our, our adaptive programming.

361
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:31,949
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I, again, I could talk a buzz it off me wagon because I'm really excited about this, but I'd love to hear what our parents have to say.

362
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,211
[SPEAKER_20]: And, and if there's a way that we can meet after to try to set something up together, that'd be great.

363
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:36,971
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

364
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:40,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lazzaro.

365
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:43,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, I won't take much time.

366
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:53,673
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say I'm very excited about this opportunity and that services are often offered by a city because they spring from what residents demand for their families.

367
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:57,795
[SPEAKER_16]: And if other cities are offering this, we should be offering it too.

368
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:01,856
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm very eager to hear from our parents and community members.

369
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:03,557
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much for bringing it to the table.

370
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:05,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Tseng.

371
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:16,748
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Vice President Collins hit the nail on the on the head with it with this and I just wanted to add to what Councilor Lazzaro said about

372
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:21,320
[SPEAKER_17]: services coming out of what parents and residents are advocating.

373
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:33,674
[SPEAKER_17]: We know that oftentimes parents and students with disabilities have fallen way short of where that equitable advocacy is.

374
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:38,920
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a government, we need to step up and be aware of

375
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,381
[SPEAKER_17]: those shortfalls.

376
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:56,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm really grateful for our Medford parents for advocating for their children, for our community, really, because investing in programs like this not only helps the students using those programs, but helps our community as a whole.

377
00:42:57,713 --> 00:43:01,155
[SPEAKER_17]: We are all dependent on each other, and we are all in this together.

378
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:03,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Just really quickly,

379
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:20,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also working with our director Kevin Bailey on a youth commission, a youth council to really shape what our city does with recreation activities with policymaking in general.

380
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:34,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And I like that to be an opportunity and a channel in the future for parents to use too and to come work with me on that in our future committee meetings to make sure that that is set up as equitable as possible too.

381
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

382
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:43,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll open the floor to public participation.

383
00:43:43,942 --> 00:43:49,444
[SPEAKER_18]: If folks would like to speak, they can make a line behind the podium or raise their hand on Zoom.

384
00:43:49,924 --> 00:43:55,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also just want to note before we do that, that I know that a lot of people speaking here are everyday advocates.

385
00:43:57,126 --> 00:44:04,008
[SPEAKER_18]: And part of what I think we're hearing here is how can the community step up for these parents and these families

386
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:11,573
[SPEAKER_18]: so that we're all advocating together for inclusion and immersion and some of the things that I've been most proud to see in the city.

387
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:18,497
[SPEAKER_18]: When we have young people of all abilities, working together on different things in our schools and in our community.

388
00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:21,099
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, I will go to the podium.

389
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

390
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Patricia Cherry 20 Wellesley Street.

391
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:30,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for letting us come talk here for a few minutes.

392
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:31,986
[SPEAKER_03]: We have

393
00:44:33,697 --> 00:44:41,959
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past couple months, we've been having multiple meetings with yourself, Matt, Anna.

394
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:49,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought the issues to them that in the city of MedFed, us as parents, we're struggling.

395
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:57,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We're struggling to find places where our kids fit in, where our kids have the same opportunities that the other children

396
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:13,285
[SPEAKER_03]: are getting, you know, when you drive by the soccer field so when you drive by the baseball parks or when you drive by the hockey rink and that's what brought us to this, the lack of us having anywhere to bring our children.

397
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:20,218
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Matt over there we dragged him around the city for a little bit with us.

398
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:31,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We met with the library administration following suggestion by him to see whether or not they could host a weekly or even a monthly social group for teens with disabilities, but we were told they didn't have enough staffing or support.

399
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we also met with Francis Nwaji, the city's diversity, equity and inclusion director, and I'm sorry if I said her name wrong, who understood concerns and provided some resources, but also had no suggestions on how the city could create something meaningful.

400
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:59,188
[SPEAKER_03]: As parents of children with disability, we are the ones who organize programming for our children because we don't have meaningful access to city sports programs, after school music clubs or drama clubs.

401
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:00,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,

402
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We're told our kids can join these activities let's face it, true inclusion in these groups is often missing not necessarily because of lack of wanting, but because lack of support.

403
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:18,966
[SPEAKER_03]: This is especially true for the ages 13 to 18, the age when our children become aware of how isolated they are compared to their peers.

404
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:23,047
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't just drop them off at movie theaters, a dance or similar events.

405
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:27,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time we have to travel to other cities to find suitable programs.

406
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:34,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the children are also bust out of district for schooling because Medford does not have a program that fits their educational needs.

407
00:46:34,998 --> 00:46:45,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, some, a lot of children are bust out for schooling and out for activities, so they're doing zero in the city of Medford, because there's just nothing for them.

408
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:50,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ask tonight is that the city of Medford will make our children a priority.

409
00:46:51,471 --> 00:46:56,595
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard repeatedly over the past few months that there is no money, but we cannot accept that as an answer.

410
00:46:57,115 --> 00:47:05,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Time and time again, we had discussions about how the most vulnerable are affected, yet they're the ones consistently overlooked when it comes to budget decisions.

411
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:16,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Before adding more to an already funded item, we asked the city to prioritize areas that currently have no funding, namely community outreach and programming for children with disabilities.

412
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost done.

413
00:47:19,872 --> 00:47:24,976
[SPEAKER_03]: We are requesting the city to hire a part-time staff member who specializes in supporting children like us.

414
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:31,061
[SPEAKER_03]: The individual could work afternoons or weekends to develop and lead programs specifically designed for this group.

415
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:35,585
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, the position would support inclusion of children and teens with disabilities.

416
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:38,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are here to insist it.

417
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:40,301
[SPEAKER_03]: We're tired.

418
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:41,362
[SPEAKER_03]: We're tired.

419
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:44,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to tell you right now, we're exhausted.

420
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:47,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You took a trip with us and you were tired after one week.

421
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We do this day in and day out.

422
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:57,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And all we're asking is to have the same things that the other children have.

423
00:47:58,365 --> 00:47:59,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not asking for more.

424
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,909
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not asking for you to build a rocket ship.

425
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:07,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It is just, we want exactly what the other children are getting.

426
00:48:07,853 --> 00:48:09,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's time we get that.

427
00:48:10,395 --> 00:48:13,437
[SPEAKER_03]: People who've come before me, Melanie's here in the audience.

428
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:17,200
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Tanya Sullivan, Alex, they've been doing this for years.

429
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:26,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They're exhausted to the point where, you know, it's even disheartening for them to step in here because they know, they think they know what the answer is gonna be.

430
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,681
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what's always been.

431
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:29,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we got nothing.

432
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:33,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But this time, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be different.

433
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:48,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure this group of people is going to be able to get something together so that our kids can have exactly what the other kids have in their city, and that is programming.

434
00:48:48,956 --> 00:48:50,837
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we're asking for.

435
00:48:51,057 --> 00:48:51,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let somebody else speak.

436
00:48:52,038 --> 00:48:52,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much.

437
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:54,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

438
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:57,710
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no one on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium.

439
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,590
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record.

440
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,431
[SPEAKER_28]: Michael Pollack, 36, Jerome Street.

441
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:08,094
[SPEAKER_28]: I have an 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, and she is a lot of work.

442
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,074
[SPEAKER_28]: She's wonderful.

443
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:11,275
[SPEAKER_28]: Best thing that ever happened to me.

444
00:49:12,836 --> 00:49:16,417
[SPEAKER_28]: And we have loved our experience in Medford so far.

445
00:49:16,438 --> 00:49:18,098
[SPEAKER_28]: The schools have been great.

446
00:49:18,118 --> 00:49:18,698
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

447
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:29,564
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we would love to stay in Medford to do so many more things.

448
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:33,006
[SPEAKER_28]: We go to Weston for swimming.

449
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:35,627
[SPEAKER_28]: We've gone to Newton and Wakefield for ballet.

450
00:49:36,027 --> 00:49:38,368
[SPEAKER_28]: We've gone to Andover.

451
00:49:38,468 --> 00:49:42,189
[SPEAKER_28]: We go, basically, we would love to keep that stuff here.

452
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:48,911
[SPEAKER_28]: We have done many things with Medford Rec and Adaptive, the Adaptive programs, and they're fantastic.

453
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:52,153
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know a lot of this stuff is not city run, but private.

454
00:49:53,713 --> 00:49:56,394
[SPEAKER_28]: entities offering these programs as well.

455
00:49:56,734 --> 00:50:10,736
[SPEAKER_28]: But if there could be one centralized locator, I know a lot of these programs, city-sponsored and private, have not just, there hasn't been enough participation, and that's because of lack of promotion.

456
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:19,898
[SPEAKER_28]: If there's a centralized place where us parents know where to look for this information, where these programs exist, it would be so much easier to find.

457
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:33,482
[SPEAKER_28]: Within Medford, my daughter loved playing softball and talking about how, as the kids grow, when they're younger, they're much more involved and the differences aren't as obvious.

458
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:44,925
[SPEAKER_28]: But there's a certain point where she was getting left behind skill-wise and she actually stayed back at the age level where she was.

459
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:47,366
[SPEAKER_28]: but then it kept getting more and more competitive.

460
00:50:47,706 --> 00:50:54,630
[SPEAKER_28]: We would love to find, I've been looking for a place for her to play softball or baseball, and it's hard.

461
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,531
[SPEAKER_28]: There's possibility in Woburn, but we would love to have it right here.

462
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:02,153
[SPEAKER_28]: If we do have partnerships with those neighboring cities, that's fantastic too.

463
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:11,498
[SPEAKER_28]: But I do appreciate all of you hearing us and all of your kind words and acknowledging.

464
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,986
[SPEAKER_28]: That we are, we are struggling, and you know we are a big part of this.

465
00:51:17,026 --> 00:51:26,319
[SPEAKER_28]: We love this community and want to stay in this community and we also want to show that our kids also have a lot to offer it's not just we're missing, we can keep them busy and get them out of the house.

466
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:41,992
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, but when they are involved with typical developing kids to those typical developing kids benefit and as what we're really asking for is just to be more part of this community that we love.

467
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:43,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

468
00:51:44,353 --> 00:51:44,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

469
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:49,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

470
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:57,997
[SPEAKER_40]: Hello, my name is Melanie McLaughlin and Austin street and men for mass Thank you Councilors for hearing us tonight and.

471
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:03,218
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you to Trish and to the parents who are really organizing a lot of this.

472
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:05,219
[SPEAKER_40]: It's great to see the energy.

473
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:20,484
[SPEAKER_40]: And as we think about our children and young adults in this community, I have to say that you can tell immediately people who have experience with people with disabilities, because they know how to talk to them, they know how to

474
00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:25,109
[SPEAKER_40]: interact with them and they appreciate and see them as human beings.

475
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:32,094
[SPEAKER_40]: And Councilor Leming and school committee member Olapade did that recently at the library event.

476
00:52:32,134 --> 00:52:38,059
[SPEAKER_40]: It was really wonderful to see them playing Uno with a number of our children and getting involved.

477
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:49,848
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'll tell you, I have a seven, I can't believe she's 17, I have a 17 year old daughter with Down syndrome, excuse my hoarseness, I have a cold, with Down syndrome, who is also legally blind and,

478
00:52:51,738 --> 00:53:10,063
[SPEAKER_40]: You know, she's the best thing that ever happened to us she's taught us so much about compassion and kindness and so many things, and I think when other people get to meet people with disabilities, they learn that lesson themselves, and not that our kids are here to teach the rest of us about humanity but that's just who they are and it is what they do.

479
00:53:10,864 --> 00:53:15,085
[SPEAKER_40]: And, you know, a community that misses out on that misses out on quite a lot.

480
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:17,406
[SPEAKER_40]: and I wouldn't change anything.

481
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:25,370
[SPEAKER_40]: And I do have to say though, in terms of adaptive and other programming, I just wanna put a bug in everybody's ear too.

482
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,754
[SPEAKER_40]: As you're thinking about inclusion, adaptive is great and we want, that's the other thing is you have to have programs with support, right?

483
00:53:31,954 --> 00:53:37,277
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not just, oh yeah, you're all welcome here, which has often been the case, which is really nice, it's nice to be welcome.

484
00:53:37,677 --> 00:53:43,500
[SPEAKER_40]: But if you're welcome and there's no support and then it doesn't go well, then you're really not welcome and it's setting up our kids for failure.

485
00:53:44,160 --> 00:54:05,896
[SPEAKER_40]: So having the support to make sure that it's actually a welcoming community and an inclusive community, not just, you know, in, in theory only because it takes support it takes skill, and not from parents from people who have skill you know that been experience over the time where in the interaction with parents around skill I remember, I remember our daughter having a swim lessons in the,

486
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:25,804
[SPEAKER_40]: And the schools and young teenagers are working with our kids a lot and they're not really getting trained to be able to have that experience and seeing my daughter in the pool and just teaching something as simple as first then right first let's do the swimming the lab, then you'll get to go, you know, do whatever it's a really simple lesson, but if you don't know it you don't know it and so just being able to learn the basics is really important.

487
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:37,634
[SPEAKER_40]: And as we think about the training and being able to see not just recreation, being able to see our children, again, use the library, use the coffee shops, feel welcome, feel included, and feel part of.

488
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:41,317
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, I can't say enough about Amici's and West Medford.

489
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:45,660
[SPEAKER_40]: They are the most inclusive business I've experienced in Medford.

490
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:50,144
[SPEAKER_40]: Mario and his team make us feel right at home, make Gracie feel right at home.

491
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:52,326
[SPEAKER_40]: And Amici means friend.

492
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,051
[SPEAKER_40]: And he was teaching Gracie that the other day and I thought that was really beautiful.

493
00:54:56,531 --> 00:55:12,357
[SPEAKER_40]: So I hope that you guys get the chance to meet all these wonderful young adults and people in our community, beyond just the schools and the students and you know the schools are required by law just to provide all of the extracurricular activities that any other student is entitled to.

494
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:13,737
[SPEAKER_40]: to every student.

495
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:31,045
[SPEAKER_40]: And so again, you know, we did ask when I was on the school committee to include a statement that if you need accommodations for any of these experiences please contact and we had a specific contact around what accommodations needed to be available and how parents could, you know, reach out and let folks know that they need accommodations.

496
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:34,526
[SPEAKER_40]: Some parents don't even want to do that because it feels like a lot for them.

497
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:36,487
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's important to continue to reach out as well.

498
00:55:36,527 --> 00:55:43,270
[SPEAKER_40]: But that's something to consider, that how can we collaborate to make sure that the accommodations are helpful and real.

499
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:50,974
[SPEAKER_40]: And I have to say this, if you've never been to a dance with people with disabilities, you're really missing out because they really dance like nobody's watching.

500
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,514
[SPEAKER_40]: So thank you very much.

501
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:54,735
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

502
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:58,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

503
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:01,476
[SPEAKER_41]: Kara Higgins, 197 Spring Street.

504
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:04,077
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you so much for giving us a platform tonight.

505
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:07,038
[SPEAKER_41]: So I have a five-year-old son, newly diagnosed.

506
00:56:07,278 --> 00:56:11,540
[SPEAKER_41]: And since his diagnosis, I became totally immersed in the world of special needs.

507
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,241
[SPEAKER_41]: That's become just a focus point for myself.

508
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,562
[SPEAKER_41]: It brought me here tonight.

509
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:18,223
[SPEAKER_41]: So I would love to see more programming.

510
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:25,426
[SPEAKER_41]: The parents behind me that have been doing this for a long time have been trying to pave the way for the next generation, including my son.

511
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:30,188
[SPEAKER_41]: been involved in this.

512
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:34,070
[SPEAKER_41]: I have become a parent advisory board member through the Medford Family Network.

513
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:38,412
[SPEAKER_41]: I am running the support group we have for special needs parents through that monthly.

514
00:56:39,973 --> 00:56:45,556
[SPEAKER_41]: It's very important that our families feel supported and we have the programming in place for our children.

515
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:51,319
[SPEAKER_41]: I think it's a precedent that we need to set in this community that we are inclusive.

516
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:55,121
[SPEAKER_41]: We're not just using the word, but we're actually living by the action that it means.

517
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:55,721
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

518
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:58,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

519
00:56:58,162 --> 00:57:00,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

520
00:57:00,405 --> 00:57:07,172
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm just going to echo what the other panel said.

521
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:13,719
[SPEAKER_34]: I have a teenager who has intellectual disabilities, and we are going for baseball in Malden

522
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:16,908
[SPEAKER_34]: We are going for cooking classes in Burlington.

523
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:19,430
[SPEAKER_34]: We go for top soccer in Wakefield.

524
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:26,935
[SPEAKER_34]: Once a month, we go to Brookline so he can play pool and air hockey with a couple of other teenagers with disabilities.

525
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:35,981
[SPEAKER_34]: We would love to go to drama classes in Wakefield, but Wednesday at 5, it's basically impossible with traffic, so he's missing on that.

526
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:38,743
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, honestly, it's exhausting.

527
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:43,485
[SPEAKER_34]: And we participated in the event at the library, and it was just wonderful.

528
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:50,267
[SPEAKER_34]: It was it took us five minutes to get there, and he really enjoyed playing Uno and meeting new friends and new people.

529
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:52,708
[SPEAKER_34]: So we are, this is what we are asking for.

530
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:59,051
[SPEAKER_34]: We are asking for us to, you know, a little bit of a break, uh, and for our children to find a community here.

531
00:57:59,551 --> 00:57:59,851
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

532
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:02,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

533
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:05,954
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to go on to Zoom.

534
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:06,754
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Eileen

535
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:08,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Lerner on Zoom.

536
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Eileen, I'm gonna request to unmute.

537
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:16,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

538
00:58:17,506 --> 00:58:18,307
[SPEAKER_33]: Eileen Lerner.

539
00:58:18,947 --> 00:58:25,110
[SPEAKER_33]: I live at the, excuse me, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

540
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:35,136
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just want to say that I've lived in Medford for almost 11 years, and this is the first

541
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:46,861
[SPEAKER_33]: City Council meeting that I've been at where I feel just so full of love and unity.

542
00:58:47,061 --> 00:59:04,075
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, this issue unites our whole community because it's an issue of equality, giving everybody the same rights, the same privileges, and making them an equal part of our community.

543
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:30,069
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just wanna thank the school committee and the city council and say that what a pleasure to watch a meeting in which there's no controversy, there's no vitriol, there's no screaming, there's no yelling, there's no insulting, there's only love in this room.

544
00:59:30,689 --> 00:59:41,755
[SPEAKER_33]: And I want to thank all the parents, and it's been a long fight and congratulations on what you have achieved by your willingness to be active in the city.

545
00:59:42,196 --> 00:59:51,221
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's what it requires people being willing to step out and fight for the things that are needed, instead of just avoiding

546
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:55,390
[SPEAKER_33]: even knowing about what's going on in our town.

547
00:59:56,151 --> 01:00:00,774
[SPEAKER_33]: But anyway, I just wanna say, I feel like setting off fireworks.

548
01:00:01,655 --> 01:00:02,135
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

549
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:05,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

550
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:10,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to Marie on Zoom.

551
01:00:10,502 --> 01:00:12,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Marie, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

552
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:17,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hi.

553
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:18,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I want to.

554
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:22,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank Eileen for saying exactly what I wanted to say.

555
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:24,011
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm all set.

556
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:24,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

557
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:26,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you just give your name and address for the record?

558
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:31,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Marie Izzo, 29 Pilgrim Road, Medford, Mass.

559
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:31,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm all set.

560
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:32,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

561
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:34,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate this meeting.

562
01:00:37,563 --> 01:00:37,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

563
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:38,984
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll try to keep it going.

564
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:47,916
[SPEAKER_18]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Leming.

565
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

566
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:49,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

567
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:58,105
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm so passionate about this because what we're seeing, what I see in a day-to-day situation in my profession

568
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:14,046
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear it from our parents today and what we're hearing is the the difficult of having something in your own town and I know it's difficult I'd love to do more in the town that I work in the city working but it's sometimes you don't get the numbers that you need.

569
01:01:15,126 --> 01:01:38,187
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why the conversation with Director Levine in Malden and Director Bailey here in Medford, we've been talking about trying to find a collaboration between the triangle, the three of us, and trying to find a way to pool all the assets that we have together so we can have something that parents don't have to drive to Watertown or Burlington or Brookline

570
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:46,380
[SPEAKER_20]: but they stay right in this room and we can offer something and that that's that's something that our kids and families would love.

571
01:01:48,062 --> 01:01:55,730
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that we have someone here right now that i'll come to the carpet we we've been very fortunate to have the teamsters as part of our family.

572
01:01:56,408 --> 01:02:03,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll be honest with you, whenever I need anything, I would go to the Teamsters organization who works so hard for artistic community, right?

573
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:07,814
[SPEAKER_20]: And they run the artistic gala to help us support programs and they've always done that.

574
01:02:08,254 --> 01:02:09,915
[SPEAKER_20]: So Steve, I'll be calling.

575
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:22,361
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that looking as a collaboration, maybe having Mayor Lungo-Koehn and working with Mayor Christensen and working with Mayor Ballantyne and saying, hey, maybe there's somewhere we can go.

576
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:24,642
[SPEAKER_20]: It wouldn't be great, something like the Heckner Center.

577
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:30,065
[SPEAKER_20]: having a central site for our adaptive programming.

578
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:32,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Park right next door that's enclosed and safe.

579
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:37,228
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we can even across the street, we have St.

580
01:02:37,268 --> 01:02:38,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Francis has a gymnasium.

581
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,710
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have access.

582
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:45,713
[SPEAKER_20]: We have great people that have worked with our most vulnerable for many, many years.

583
01:02:45,773 --> 01:02:49,075
[SPEAKER_20]: Ron Giovino has done an amazing job with the Challenger program.

584
01:02:49,938 --> 01:02:51,900
[SPEAKER_20]: And imagine using that to enhance that.

585
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:59,847
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that we have an adaptive physical education teacher at Method High School, and Kala Andre, and she's doing amazing things with the Challenger program.

586
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:05,332
[SPEAKER_20]: And imagine bringing that to an after school program, bringing that in a Saturday program.

587
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,776
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think there's so much we can do as a city.

588
01:03:10,497 --> 01:03:15,558
[SPEAKER_20]: And the avenues that we already have and the partners that we already have, I don't think this is a reach.

589
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:19,560
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that what you hear, everybody loves to hear inclusionary.

590
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,680
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, we're inclusionary.

591
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:33,005
[SPEAKER_20]: When I was fortunate enough to start the summer program at the former Columbus, now the Mr. Tuck School, one of the issues is making sure that our

592
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,823
[SPEAKER_20]: special needs community had an avenue for a summer program.

593
01:03:37,704 --> 01:03:44,872
[SPEAKER_20]: And we really, at the time, Superintendent Belson made it a priority that it was open for everybody.

594
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:47,595
[SPEAKER_20]: But I also understand that

595
01:03:48,812 --> 01:03:55,678
[SPEAKER_20]: all inclusionary sometimes in some communities mean that all you're doing is saying we're covering you, but really not doing anything for you.

596
01:03:56,279 --> 01:04:15,456
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm excited just from what I hear and maybe if I could be added to any of the future meetings and maybe bring in Kevin Bailey, we can reach out to Joe Levine over in Malden and see if there's a true collaboration that we can use that, you know, maybe we're doing the basketball program here

597
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:26,963
[SPEAKER_20]: at the recreation center, but maybe we're doing our soccer program over at Dillboy Stadium, or maybe we're doing our track program over at McDonald Stadium.

598
01:04:27,303 --> 01:04:37,910
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's not that far of a drive, but it's sustainable enough that we can bring families together and have a true program that we can really be proud of.

599
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:43,714
[SPEAKER_20]: I find it so difficult to try to run the program in Somerville because it's our number one initiative.

600
01:04:44,395 --> 01:04:56,244
[SPEAKER_20]: And we just not getting the numbers because we have, we have, we have hundreds of parents have hundreds of kids but unfortunately, some can only do some after school here, some can don't have transportation there.

601
01:04:56,604 --> 01:05:02,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Some don't have this will maybe if there's a vibrant program that we have multiple offerings.

602
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:14,672
[SPEAKER_20]: that maybe we can do something great and I'm excited about moving forward and helping this community and I and I, you know, Medford high did something that's very different.

603
01:05:14,732 --> 01:05:18,576
[SPEAKER_20]: Most communities don't have an adaptive physical education teacher.

604
01:05:19,077 --> 01:05:23,562
[SPEAKER_20]: What they do is is a physical education teacher who studied the adaptive program

605
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:27,960
[SPEAKER_20]: you can cover some because of your experience.

606
01:05:28,561 --> 01:05:30,322
[SPEAKER_20]: But Medford has a teacher that does that.

607
01:05:30,502 --> 01:05:36,587
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll be honest with you, Carla ran our summer program for a few years and she was amazing for our recreation program.

608
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,210
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's opportunities there.

609
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:44,194
[SPEAKER_20]: So like, again, I'm excited about the process and I agree with you.

610
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:47,657
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think this is, no one's gonna walk away from this.

611
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:48,698
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is important.

612
01:05:48,738 --> 01:05:51,260
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you so much for bringing this forward.

613
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:53,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

614
01:05:54,630 --> 01:06:00,476
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad we're having this meeting because I think we're generating more threads and more things that we can work on.

615
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:05,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like Councilor Tseng and Councilor Scarpelli have both been talking to Director Bailey about some different programs.

616
01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:09,965
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also just want to make a pitch since I can't make motions, I'll make a pitch.

617
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:13,269
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a really concrete ask for a part time

618
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:30,724
[SPEAKER_18]: support uh person in the city and we can't appropriate money but we can request and maybe if someone wants to make a motion that that be our first budget request of the budget cycle start a couple months early that's something we could attach to this paper tonight so I can't do that myself I I would.

619
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:39,072
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli uh seconded by Councilor Leming and oh and Councilor Leming has more to say about that so go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor

620
01:06:43,663 --> 01:07:01,116
[SPEAKER_25]: So, so I do I do agree with the idea of having an additional motion but there's a. So I've been talking to a lot of different city staff about where the appropriate budget request would be initially it was a part time position under Francis office, I spoke to Kevin Bailey I think that.

621
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:27,342
[SPEAKER_25]: The most concrete ask would probably be a therapeutic recreation specialist, as well as an office manager under the recreation department, which would give them enough staff to be able to support these programs and likely integrate into that collaborations with other towns surrounding cities.

622
01:07:27,662 --> 01:07:30,143
[SPEAKER_25]: It could also come in the form of

623
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:38,117
[SPEAKER_25]: something this would cost the city less, but I think we should have more staff in the Recreation Department in addition to this.

624
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:43,560
[SPEAKER_25]: A community development block grant fund with a non-profit like Communitas.

625
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:50,883
[SPEAKER_25]: Patricia was partnering up with her church in order to find a space for that.

626
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:56,526
[SPEAKER_25]: Partnership with an organization such as that would also be another concrete ask.

627
01:07:56,646 --> 01:07:58,687
[SPEAKER_25]: I would make the motion to

628
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:17,355
[SPEAKER_25]: request for the budget season additional staffing under Medford Recreation or another department that could support this kind of programming for the upcoming budget season.

629
01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:26,999
[SPEAKER_25]: So preferably under Medford Recreation, but if there is flexibility there and it would be more appropriate to be in another department, that could fulfill that motion.

630
01:08:28,536 --> 01:08:45,720
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll call it a motion from Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Leming to amend the paper to make a budget request for the fiscal 26 budget cycle to the mayor for additional staff to coordinate and support

631
01:08:47,259 --> 01:08:53,461
[SPEAKER_18]: youth with disabilities in the recreation department with further discussions to come.

632
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:55,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that sounds good.

633
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:55,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

634
01:08:55,802 --> 01:09:01,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you also want to amend to make a suggestion around community development block grant?

635
01:09:06,344 --> 01:09:09,226
[SPEAKER_25]: That's that's not really in the I mean, that's a separate process.

636
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:10,987
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's that's kind of a separate process.

637
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, but we can keep that thread going.

638
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,509
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there's a lot more than just what's on the page here.

639
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:16,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

640
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:19,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Um so with that, I will go to Councilor Lazzaro.

641
01:09:20,391 --> 01:09:20,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

642
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:21,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to mention this.

643
01:09:22,232 --> 01:09:34,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh it it feels like a moment when Medford is no longer doing the bare minimum in our city services and I think it's it's uh a good time for us to consider what what we could

644
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:47,617
[SPEAKER_16]: where we could meet the needs of our residents, where we hear what they're asking for and where we can step up to the plate and provide them with the services that they request.

645
01:09:47,677 --> 01:09:50,299
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think this is a great moment to meet those needs.

646
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,841
[SPEAKER_16]: So I applaud that motion.

647
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:54,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I would support it.

648
01:09:55,722 --> 01:10:05,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Another thing I wanted to mention is that something that Melanie said about integrating children with disabilities with

649
01:10:05,424 --> 01:10:11,306
[SPEAKER_16]: children that are developing traditionally, there are studies that say it benefits everybody.

650
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:16,688
[SPEAKER_16]: It's good for all kids of all developmental levels.

651
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:22,950
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's part of the discussion too.

652
01:10:23,431 --> 01:10:26,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also, just a small correction, I think Gracie is in fifth grade.

653
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:28,172
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think she's 17.

654
01:10:28,212 --> 01:10:31,894
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't just... Thank you.

655
01:10:33,402 --> 01:10:35,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's been a long few years.

656
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:41,417
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, thank you everybody for this discussion.

657
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,659
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know there's a lot more work ahead.

658
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:52,386
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course we have to work with all the folks who make government churn, but we will continue to work on that.

659
01:10:53,407 --> 01:11:04,355
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Leming and Callahan, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Leming, as seconded by Council Vice President Collins, any further discussion?

660
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:06,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

661
01:11:09,551 --> 01:11:11,212
[SPEAKER_18]: That was thank you all, and we will be back.

662
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:13,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

663
01:11:13,933 --> 01:11:14,233
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

664
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:15,693
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

665
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:17,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Opposed?

666
01:11:17,594 --> 01:11:18,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

667
01:11:18,455 --> 01:11:18,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

668
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:36,822
[SPEAKER_18]: Paper 24510, the loan order for our school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds eligible for third reading.

669
01:11:37,509 --> 01:11:44,056
[SPEAKER_18]: January 14th, 2025, was advertised in the Medford Transcript and Several Journal December 26th, 2024.

670
01:11:44,736 --> 01:11:48,560
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is the meeting, we just had a meeting on this at 6 p.m.

671
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:57,470
[SPEAKER_18]: for further presentation regarding the school HVAC and infrastructure and roof bond projects at the McGlynn Complex and the Andrews Middle School.

672
01:11:58,811 --> 01:11:59,692
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins.

673
01:12:01,377 --> 01:12:02,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

674
01:12:03,298 --> 01:12:06,700
[SPEAKER_04]: As you just noted, we took our first vote on this loan order on December 17.

675
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:22,990
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a committee of the whole to talk about it more in depth with climate planner Brenda Pike as well as Assistant Superintendent Cushing immediately before the 7pm meeting tonight to really go over it in detail and hear more about their extensive plans for how this will facilitate the

676
01:12:24,051 --> 01:12:29,199
[SPEAKER_04]: repair of the McGlynn School roof and HVAC improvements at the Andrews and McGlynn.

677
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:38,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So this loan order would enable the funding for those roof repairs at the McGlynn and extensive HVAC at Andrews and McGlynn on a timeline that would enable the work to be completed.

678
01:12:39,273 --> 01:12:48,021
[SPEAKER_04]: over summer vacation so that when middle schoolers return in the fall, they're doing so to buildings with repaired roofs and functioning AC and then heat in the winter.

679
01:12:49,603 --> 01:12:57,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really basic stuff that unfortunately has not been guaranteed to our middle schoolers for a long time because the HVAC has been in such dire need of repair.

680
01:12:58,251 --> 01:13:04,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So very grateful to the hard work by those in MPS and the school department to

681
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:15,419
[SPEAKER_04]: to be aligned so that this funding could come together and that the work could be done on a timeline that would allow it to be completed over the summer with minimal disruptions to education.

682
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:17,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd motion to approve for third reading.

683
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

684
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:34,703
[SPEAKER_18]: And yes, as discussed, this is the first part of the project and we're going to be hearing more once some of the final pre-purchasing and other elements are completed

685
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:41,802
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, folks can take a look at the recording of the meeting that we had at six o'clock tonight if they want to see the full presentation.

686
01:13:42,302 --> 01:13:44,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Tseng.

687
01:13:45,343 --> 01:13:46,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

688
01:13:46,123 --> 01:13:49,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, as I said earlier, I thought the presentation was amazing.

689
01:13:50,325 --> 01:14:00,489
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand the need as a former teacher, my colleagues, relatives of teaching, family members that are in the schools, we understand that this is a definite need.

690
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:04,031
[SPEAKER_20]: I will be voting no for the simple fact that

691
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:26,113
[SPEAKER_20]: part of the first reading I asked for a breakdown of our capital plan this is going to be a 20 possibly 27 million dollar project and what I asked for the meeting from the mayor's office was a meeting to discuss our capital capital projects that are in in line also talked about what the future looks like and how this

692
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:34,278
[SPEAKER_20]: looking to see how it would affect the renovation or the new high school project moving forward when you're looking for 20 bonding $27 million.

693
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:40,522
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, the other pieces, the whole, we still need a main street fire station.

694
01:14:40,562 --> 01:14:42,724
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was so many pieces involved with this.

695
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:44,425
[SPEAKER_20]: I asked to have that.

696
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:45,245
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't get it.

697
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:46,486
[SPEAKER_20]: No council beers has tried.

698
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:51,790
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that he's still having, we will be hopefully having a meeting soon, but, um,

699
01:14:52,535 --> 01:15:05,817
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the hard work that everybody has done, but I'll be voting no because I have not gotten the information to make sure that our community understands the financial impact in totality once we vote this through.

700
01:15:05,857 --> 01:15:06,358
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

701
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:08,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

702
01:15:08,978 --> 01:15:11,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Kelly and Councilor Tseng.

703
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:12,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

704
01:15:12,699 --> 01:15:19,620
[SPEAKER_17]: I am very excited for this project because it's a need that our city has had for a very long time.

705
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:26,791
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the first time I ran, I heard from parents about the need to develop a better HVAC system.

706
01:15:27,031 --> 01:15:36,360
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember when I was a student in that building, we needed better air conditioning and better heating, and the needs have only grown in the decades since I've left that building.

707
01:15:38,722 --> 01:15:41,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said at our last meeting before this one,

708
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:45,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Investing in HVAC is investing in student success.

709
01:15:46,072 --> 01:15:52,134
[SPEAKER_17]: It's investing in giving teachers an adequate labor, adequate work environment.

710
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:56,876
[SPEAKER_17]: It's investing in making our school system as strong as it can be.

711
01:15:57,656 --> 01:16:00,958
[SPEAKER_17]: When I think about the fiscal parts of this project, I know

712
01:16:02,293 --> 01:16:09,516
[SPEAKER_17]: we've received an outline of how that the money on capital needs is going to be spent in the future.

713
01:16:09,536 --> 01:16:11,357
[SPEAKER_17]: There are lots of discussions to come.

714
01:16:12,237 --> 01:16:21,981
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Councilor or President Bears mentioned in our previous meeting, setting up a meeting with the city administration on that matter too.

715
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:30,303
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have received all in all a picture of the big items that we have coming up in the next few years.

716
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:33,904
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why that's one of the reasons why I feel comfortable voting for this.

717
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:41,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Another reason why I think it's fiscally prudent to do this right now is because when we defer costs, we don't save money.

718
01:16:41,846 --> 01:16:44,667
[SPEAKER_17]: When we defer costs, those costs become more expensive.

719
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,528
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know what inflation was like over the last few years.

720
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,009
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know that

721
01:16:51,443 --> 01:16:54,386
[SPEAKER_17]: material costs and labor costs only go up.

722
01:16:55,007 --> 01:17:00,372
[SPEAKER_17]: And we now know a bit about what the tariff picture looks like in the next few years.

723
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:11,344
[SPEAKER_17]: When we think about the materials that we'll need for a project like this, when we think about steel, when we think about construction, we get a lot of those materials from countries like Canada.

724
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:22,965
[SPEAKER_17]: And our president-elect has announced a 25% or plans for a 25% tariff on all those products that we will be paying as consumers of those products.

725
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,066
[SPEAKER_17]: That means increased construction costs.

726
01:17:25,486 --> 01:17:38,273
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think really epitomizes and highlights why it's more fiscally responsible, in my opinion, to spend on this project now, because I think we can save money in the long term compared to if we defer this into the future.

727
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

728
01:17:43,828 --> 01:17:44,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much.

729
01:17:44,269 --> 01:17:50,872
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone is curious about more information on this project, we just had a meeting at six o'clock that you can find online.

730
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:55,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and they provided a ton of information.

731
01:17:55,974 --> 01:17:58,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we all feel like quite informed.

732
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:03,557
[SPEAKER_08]: including all of the different state and federal grants that they've been looking into.

733
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:20,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate all the planning that has gone into this, the amount that they are balancing our goals, including things like climate goals and everything else with our limited budget and our desire to make sure that we are, you know, spending what we

734
01:18:21,181 --> 01:18:24,103
[SPEAKER_08]: need to spend in the most financially responsible way.

735
01:18:24,363 --> 01:18:32,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate what Councilor Tseng just said, which is that often if you wait and defer projects, it in fact costs the city far more money.

736
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:42,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that they are trying to look to the future and do these repairs now rather than waiting any longer and having it be more costly in the future.

737
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:44,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will be voting yes.

738
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:45,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

739
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:47,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

740
01:18:48,269 --> 01:18:53,412
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve the loan order for third reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

741
01:18:54,112 --> 01:18:55,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

742
01:18:59,795 --> 01:19:00,416
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan.

743
01:19:01,876 --> 01:19:02,697
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins.

744
01:19:03,497 --> 01:19:04,278
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazzaro.

745
01:19:05,098 --> 01:19:05,659
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Leming.

746
01:19:05,799 --> 01:19:05,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

747
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:07,199
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

748
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:07,560
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

749
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,100
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Tseng.

750
01:19:09,221 --> 01:19:09,441
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

751
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:10,481
[SPEAKER_26]: President Bears.

752
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:10,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

753
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:12,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

754
01:19:12,162 --> 01:19:13,083
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

755
01:19:14,224 --> 01:19:17,749
[SPEAKER_18]: 24-502, amendments to the Community Controller Public Surveillance Ordinance.

756
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:19,932
[SPEAKER_18]: First reading, December 17th, 2024.

757
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:23,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Advertised Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal, December 26th, 2024.

758
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:24,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Eligible for third reading, January 14th, 2025.

759
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Council Vice President Collins.

760
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:35,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

761
01:19:38,602 --> 01:19:41,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.

762
01:19:41,745 --> 01:19:45,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give a super brief recap because this is the third reading.

763
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:50,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna bore residents and Councilors who heard a very similar spiel on December 17th.

764
01:19:52,534 --> 01:20:07,009
[SPEAKER_04]: The Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance or CCOPS for short, was workshopped extensively by the 2022 to 2023 City Council, the Mayor's Office and Chief Buckley over about a year and a half period that was following I think three years of advocacy.

765
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:13,391
[SPEAKER_04]: by civil liberties and privacy community advocates in the city of Medford, asking for such an ordinance.

766
01:20:14,692 --> 01:20:24,116
[SPEAKER_04]: The point of this ordinance in a nutshell, is to protect privacy and civil liberties for Medford residents by creating a robust public process through which the community has a voice.

767
01:20:25,316 --> 01:20:32,978
[SPEAKER_04]: in decisions about when and for what reasons surveillance technology will be used by the city and for what purpose.

768
01:20:33,418 --> 01:20:35,779
[SPEAKER_04]: These are expensive and nascent technologies.

769
01:20:35,859 --> 01:20:39,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It is no small thing for any city agency to use them.

770
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:43,841
[SPEAKER_04]: There are reasons to use them, but this is really important stuff.

771
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really expensive.

772
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:46,081
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really new.

773
01:20:46,121 --> 01:20:48,923
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being aggressively marketed to communities such as ours.

774
01:20:49,563 --> 01:21:00,170
[SPEAKER_04]: For that reason, I think it's incredibly important for the public to have a very structured, very defined, very transparent role in those discussions about if and when they should be used.

775
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And the CCOPS ordinance sets up that process.

776
01:21:02,212 --> 01:21:07,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It sets up a reporting process so that the community and the city council can have an active role in those decisions.

777
01:21:09,216 --> 01:21:09,676
[SPEAKER_04]: To that end,

778
01:21:10,797 --> 01:21:18,280
[SPEAKER_04]: These tweaks are to fix some weaker areas or holes in the ordinance that were discovered in the first year or so of its implementation.

779
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It was passed in I think March of 2023.

780
01:21:20,902 --> 01:21:24,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that was two years ago now.

781
01:21:27,024 --> 01:21:32,926
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are to fix those weaker points, which is, I think, a fairly normal thing to do for a new ordinance.

782
01:21:33,006 --> 01:21:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: We put it into practice.

783
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We see what's working really well.

784
01:21:35,366 --> 01:21:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: We see what we can shore up to make even stronger so that we can fulfill this ordinance's goal of maintaining really strong protections and public process for privacy and private data in Medford.

785
01:21:46,329 --> 01:22:01,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And specifically, they resolve omissions dealing with how improperly collected data should be disposed of to maintain the same privacy protections and closes a loophole that would allow for surveillance data to be bought or sold from or to private or commercial entities.

786
01:22:02,715 --> 01:22:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I would motion to approve for three reading.

787
01:22:06,957 --> 01:22:10,599
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

788
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

789
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

790
01:22:15,314 --> 01:22:30,621
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, as I stated in the first meeting, I think it's very important when we started this project, as Councilor Collins mentioned years ago, the police chief and the police department were very involved in helping us craft this ordinance.

791
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:37,404
[SPEAKER_20]: For the fact that the police chief was not involved in this process, I will not be supporting this endeavor.

792
01:22:37,444 --> 01:22:37,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

793
01:22:38,424 --> 01:22:38,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

794
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:40,625
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further discussion?

795
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:48,226
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve for third reading.

796
01:22:48,806 --> 01:22:49,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

797
01:22:50,147 --> 01:22:50,767
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan?

798
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:51,987
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

799
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:52,727
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins?

800
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:52,807
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

801
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:54,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazzaro?

802
01:22:54,148 --> 01:22:54,268
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

803
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:55,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Leming?

804
01:22:55,568 --> 01:22:56,448
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

805
01:22:56,468 --> 01:22:57,048
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli?

806
01:22:57,068 --> 01:22:57,128
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

807
01:22:57,989 --> 01:22:58,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Tseng?

808
01:22:58,529 --> 01:22:58,809
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

809
01:22:59,289 --> 01:22:59,849
[SPEAKER_26]: President Bears?

810
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:00,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

811
01:23:00,349 --> 01:23:01,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

812
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:04,510
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

813
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,770
[SPEAKER_18]: 23055, welcoming city ordinance.

814
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:08,131
[SPEAKER_18]: First reading, December 17th, 2024.

815
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:12,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Advertised December 26th, 2024, Medford transcript and summer roll journal.

816
01:23:12,938 --> 01:23:14,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Eligible for third reading January 14th, 2025.

817
01:23:15,607 --> 01:23:18,075
[SPEAKER_18]: I will go to Councilor Tseng.

818
01:23:18,985 --> 01:23:20,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

819
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:28,228
[SPEAKER_17]: This Welcoming City Ordinance is a project that our council and the last council I've been working on for years.

820
01:23:28,968 --> 01:23:39,531
[SPEAKER_17]: It is essentially a codification of our city's existing policy on non-cooperation with federal authorities on non-criminal immigration matters.

821
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:47,433
[SPEAKER_17]: When we think about the impetus for this, when I think back to why I introduced this resolution in the first place,

822
01:23:48,444 --> 01:23:59,690
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really to protect residents who live in our city, our neighbors, our friends, our family, and to make sure that folks are feeling safe accessing city services.

823
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:08,114
[SPEAKER_17]: And in doing so, in having more people access our city services, improve those city services themselves.

824
01:24:09,254 --> 01:24:14,837
[SPEAKER_17]: It's frustrating to me to hear stories from constituents, from friends and their family,

825
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:27,616
[SPEAKER_17]: about being afraid to come into City Hall, being afraid to ask for something because they're afraid that we are working with federal authorities on immigration.

826
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:39,146
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really important to our residents to make sure that they feel safe at home here and in interacting with the Medford Police Department.

827
01:24:40,074 --> 01:24:44,117
[SPEAKER_17]: especially that, and I think that point is particularly important.

828
01:24:44,517 --> 01:24:50,461
[SPEAKER_17]: It's to build confidence in public safety here in Medford, and to let our police focus on their own jobs.

829
01:24:50,901 --> 01:24:52,903
[SPEAKER_17]: We have so much to do here in Medford.

830
01:24:53,283 --> 01:24:56,245
[SPEAKER_17]: We have so many laws to enforce already.

831
01:24:56,965 --> 01:24:58,846
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to focus on Medford laws.

832
01:24:58,987 --> 01:25:05,511
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to focus on local laws, because that is the separation of federal, state, and local powers.

833
01:25:07,772 --> 01:25:20,695
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's really important to note that it was crucial for us to reach out to the city administration and to the police chief personally to see if there were comments on this draft ordinance.

834
01:25:21,035 --> 01:25:22,495
[SPEAKER_17]: And we did receive a lot of comments.

835
01:25:23,255 --> 01:25:25,256
[SPEAKER_17]: We've accepted pretty much all of them.

836
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:30,777
[SPEAKER_17]: And this ordinance was drafted with the spirit of collaboration and cooperation.

837
01:25:31,357 --> 01:26:00,924
[SPEAKER_17]: I also have to thank Councilor Leming and our advocates, many of whom are in the audience today, for fighting so hard to make sure that we had a very solid draft, drafted by a lawyer, to make sure that we're acting before January 20th and before the big sea change that's gonna come in terms of immigration policy federally and the pressures that are gonna come from higher ups imposed on the city of Medford.

838
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:22,816
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of the day, I see the welcoming city ordinance, and I know many folks at home, and I've received many emails and phone calls about this, see this ordinance as a statement of our values, a statement of where we stand as a city when it comes to embracing our neighbors, protecting our neighbors, and making sure that they feel like a part of our city.

839
01:26:23,581 --> 01:26:40,486
[SPEAKER_17]: With all of that being said, I do have one proposed amendment to strike the last sentence of subsection 103B from the edits we had accepted last time from KP law.

840
01:26:41,826 --> 01:26:49,829
[SPEAKER_17]: The sentence starts with, this prohibition also does not preclude the Medford Police Department, blah, blah, blah.

841
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:57,644
[SPEAKER_17]: That was not in existing city policy that was added on later by KP law.

842
01:26:58,244 --> 01:27:08,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the spirit of keeping this in line with existing city policy, I've talked to, I've talked with Councilors, Councilor Leming about this.

843
01:27:08,573 --> 01:27:13,577
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know Councilor Leming has communicated with activists and advocates about this.

844
01:27:15,138 --> 01:27:17,600
[SPEAKER_17]: It would actually weaken the ordinance if we kept that in.

845
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,902
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would propose that we take that sentence out.

846
01:27:21,488 --> 01:27:36,336
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a motion to approve for third reading as amended to remove the last clause of our second sentence in section 50103B, seconded by Councilor Leming.

847
01:27:36,356 --> 01:27:39,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Skarpuk.

848
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:54,599
[SPEAKER_25]: I would just like to thank all of the advocates and all of the people who had lengthy discussions about this in the preceding months and years.

849
01:27:56,181 --> 01:28:00,645
[SPEAKER_25]: As is often the case, it's us sitting here on City Council that are

850
01:28:01,706 --> 01:28:19,779
[SPEAKER_25]: passing these ordinances, but it's really the residents of the city who make, lend us their expertise, make their voices heard, and convince us to support policies that make Medford as welcoming a city as possible.

851
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:23,061
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really them that deserve the credit for this.

852
01:28:23,121 --> 01:28:23,882
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this is a

853
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:33,533
[SPEAKER_25]: an appropriate measure to pass given that we're going to see a change in administration in about a week.

854
01:28:34,274 --> 01:28:37,917
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm very proud of all the work that went into this.

855
01:28:37,957 --> 01:28:45,303
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'd just like to thank the folks who are here today, particularly from Medford People Power and the ACLU who helped us out on this.

856
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:46,664
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you very much.

857
01:28:50,568 --> 01:28:51,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarborough.

858
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:53,271
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

859
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:57,113
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that I was the friends from Method People Power.

860
01:28:57,133 --> 01:29:01,715
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the conversation and the respect given in the conversation that we did have.

861
01:29:02,195 --> 01:29:14,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, in discussions with the chief of police and our police department, some of these initiatives can hamper our police department to do their jobs and contradicts some of the

862
01:29:18,564 --> 01:29:20,246
[SPEAKER_20]: the ordinances that are being put in place.

863
01:29:20,306 --> 01:29:32,398
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, without the police chief's involvement in this directly, I could not support this for the fact that it might hurt the community more than people think.

864
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:36,202
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's something that's already in place in Medford.

865
01:29:36,842 --> 01:29:38,264
[SPEAKER_20]: When I've talked to the chief, I believe

866
01:29:38,824 --> 01:29:42,246
[SPEAKER_20]: in the years that he's been here, he's always been proactive and involved.

867
01:29:42,846 --> 01:29:53,571
[SPEAKER_20]: I think he's had interaction with ICE once in the many years, but he thinks, he shared that he wasn't involved in this craft.

868
01:29:54,011 --> 01:29:58,313
[SPEAKER_20]: So it might leave us into some questionable findings later.

869
01:29:58,373 --> 01:30:00,954
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will not be supporting this initiative.

870
01:30:00,974 --> 01:30:01,495
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

871
01:30:03,395 --> 01:30:06,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Collins.

872
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

873
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:18,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to again thank Councilor Tseng and Councilor Leming for their work on this really important and positive ordinance.

874
01:30:18,827 --> 01:30:31,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to also thank all of the community advocates for pushing the City Council to do this, for insisting that we do this, for insisting that we be a City Council that stands up at the right time and says,

875
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:36,373
[SPEAKER_04]: our community really is for everybody, and we're going to make sure that our ordinances and our policies reflect that.

876
01:30:36,393 --> 01:30:41,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also proud that we're a city that can pass a welcoming city ordinance and have a change policy.

877
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:50,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all, because we know from the conversations that the lead sponsors have had with administration and the chief of police that this is merely codifying the MPD's existing

878
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:58,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really proud that to pass a welcoming city ordinance actually changes our MPD policies, not one bit.

879
01:30:58,063 --> 01:31:02,405
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me feel proud of the public safety program that we do have in Medford.

880
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:07,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I, personally, I feel really touched by that.

881
01:31:07,527 --> 01:31:18,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also feel really touched as a city council that the community has rallied around this to say at this moment, let's make sure that we're doing all that we can to make sure that Medford is a place that people can feel comfortable

882
01:31:19,592 --> 01:31:37,804
[SPEAKER_04]: identifying as an immigrant, identifying as not being born here and still seeking out every public service that they're entitled to, including knowing that they can go to first responders, knowing that they can go to public safety officials, knowing that they can go to the MPD and be safe because they're not going to be asked about their immigration status.

883
01:31:37,824 --> 01:31:39,265
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to be asked for their paperwork.

884
01:31:40,365 --> 01:31:45,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And to know because it's broadcast, because it's codified as an ordinance, that we care about public safety.

885
01:31:45,909 --> 01:31:48,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We care about putting our public dollars towards public safety.

886
01:31:49,271 --> 01:31:55,836
[SPEAKER_04]: not about complying with the agendas of other states or with federal actors.

887
01:31:55,856 --> 01:31:58,498
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to put our dollars towards public safety in our community.

888
01:31:58,518 --> 01:31:59,539
[SPEAKER_04]: We mean that for everybody.

889
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:04,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am really excited to ordain this tonight.

890
01:32:04,262 --> 01:32:10,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I want to thank my fellow Councilors for working closely with the administration, including working closely, I know, with the chief of police on this.

891
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:11,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

892
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:15,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

893
01:32:17,356 --> 01:32:18,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I'm going to Councilor Kellogg.

894
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:22,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

895
01:32:23,045 --> 01:32:24,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick point of clarification.

896
01:32:24,406 --> 01:32:28,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It is my understanding that the chief of police was invited to participate in the discussion around these changes.

897
01:32:29,814 --> 01:32:30,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

898
01:32:36,299 --> 01:32:48,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I sent an email to both the chief of police as well as the school committee requesting feedback on the draft of the welcoming city ordinance.

899
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:54,673
[SPEAKER_25]: I invited the chief of police to come to the relevant committee meetings where we were going over this.

900
01:32:55,714 --> 01:32:56,334
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't hear back.

901
01:32:56,374 --> 01:33:01,318
[SPEAKER_25]: I heard back from a couple of members of the school committee and incorporated their feedback into it.

902
01:33:01,898 --> 01:33:02,939
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah.

903
01:33:02,959 --> 01:33:03,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

904
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,120
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

905
01:33:08,566 --> 01:33:15,411
[SPEAKER_17]: When we started this effort up around two years ago, we also met with, or at least requested feedback for the police chief.

906
01:33:19,554 --> 01:33:20,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

907
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:26,679
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming to approve for third reading as amended.

908
01:33:28,721 --> 01:33:30,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

909
01:33:32,233 --> 01:33:34,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

910
01:33:34,255 --> 01:33:35,455
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a hand on Zoom.

911
01:33:35,756 --> 01:33:39,038
[SPEAKER_18]: If anyone would like to speak at the podium, they can go to the podium as well.

912
01:33:39,919 --> 01:33:42,621
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll start with Dennis on Zoom.

913
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:46,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Dennis, I'm going to request to unmute you and you'll have three minutes.

914
01:33:48,885 --> 01:33:50,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

915
01:33:52,568 --> 01:33:52,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

916
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:54,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

917
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:56,531
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dennis Detling-Kaltofer.

918
01:33:56,571 --> 01:33:58,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 120 North Street in Medford.

919
01:34:00,054 --> 01:34:00,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And

920
01:34:01,804 --> 01:34:08,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really glad that I'm able to stay this long and speak about this issue.

921
01:34:09,892 --> 01:34:11,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dear to my heart.

922
01:34:11,293 --> 01:34:15,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Immigrants contribute to our country, whether they're dentists or farm workers.

923
01:34:15,977 --> 01:34:17,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of my parents were immigrants.

924
01:34:17,919 --> 01:34:21,402
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother taught here as a high school teacher.

925
01:34:22,183 --> 01:34:24,745
[SPEAKER_01]: My father is a printer, worked as a printer.

926
01:34:25,466 --> 01:34:27,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both had to flee war in Europe.

927
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:41,941
[SPEAKER_01]: The condition of immigrants is very similar in other places, whether it's war, people come here undocumented, they're fleeing something.

928
01:34:43,662 --> 01:34:54,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's drought, you know, weather-induced stuff like climate change or whether it's administration that

929
01:34:56,511 --> 01:34:59,092
[SPEAKER_01]: suppressing certain groups.

930
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So people living in this country, everyone living in this country is either an immigrant or has ancestors who were immigrants.

931
01:35:08,576 --> 01:35:12,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the pilgrims, you know, people who came here

932
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:20,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone that came here are immigrants or have ancestors.

933
01:35:21,614 --> 01:35:34,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Undocumented immigrants, they aren't just vulnerable, but they usually risk their lives coming here and risk separation from their family members if they're caught.

934
01:35:36,445 --> 01:35:39,227
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they might be sent back.

935
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:49,695
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were to go through the process of asking for permission and proving that they need to immigrate, they probably will get sent back, and often to their deaths.

936
01:35:50,896 --> 01:35:56,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to protect everyone's privacy and security.

937
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:02,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who is here, and people are here to contribute.

938
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:03,346
[SPEAKER_01]: They come here.

939
01:36:05,086 --> 01:36:07,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Immigrants are the hardest working people.

940
01:36:07,808 --> 01:36:12,051
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to integrate into our society and they want to be of help.

941
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:15,013
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm supporting these measures.

942
01:36:15,953 --> 01:36:16,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

943
01:36:18,295 --> 01:36:18,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

944
01:36:20,577 --> 01:36:21,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to the podium.

945
01:36:23,418 --> 01:36:24,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

946
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:25,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have three minutes.

947
01:36:28,934 --> 01:36:30,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, one second, Gaston, sorry.

948
01:36:31,615 --> 01:36:31,935
[SPEAKER_11]: All good.

949
01:36:32,595 --> 01:36:32,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

950
01:36:33,235 --> 01:36:33,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

951
01:36:33,995 --> 01:36:36,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaston Ferrer, 61 Stingley Road.

952
01:36:36,316 --> 01:36:44,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make a comment in general about the audience, my experience, and then also about the general sort of reading of ordinances.

953
01:36:45,278 --> 01:36:48,299
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first one, as everyone can tell, I mean, I'm an immigrant.

954
01:36:48,339 --> 01:36:49,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I was born in South America.

955
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I came here in 2002 legally, obviously.

956
01:36:54,921 --> 01:36:59,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been mostly in Massachusetts, but I also lived in other states, other cities.

957
01:37:00,386 --> 01:37:19,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to say that despite of my accent, despite of being Hispanic Latino, I never experienced a situation where someone said something bad to me based on my race or something like that in places where there's no welcoming city ordinance.

958
01:37:20,023 --> 01:37:25,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to thank this country and the people of it that has actually given me a lot of opportunity.

959
01:37:26,325 --> 01:37:40,449
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I've said, I never felt sort of that I was in a situation where someone was mistreating me because of my origin without welcoming city urbans.

960
01:37:44,622 --> 01:37:47,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I think I'll just, we'll leave it at that.

961
01:37:48,723 --> 01:37:53,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, including this city council, of course, has always been welcoming.

962
01:37:54,085 --> 01:38:00,828
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, other states like New Hampshire, Kansas, other cities, I've never had a problem.

963
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:09,231
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, and obviously, you know, so I became a citizen, I think I listened to part of the,

964
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:12,652
[SPEAKER_11]: of the discussion of this last time.

965
01:38:12,952 --> 01:38:20,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you, Mr. President, mentioned that you knew some people that were concerned being naturalized citizens.

966
01:38:20,554 --> 01:38:24,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And to me, that's just, I was extremely surprised to hear that.

967
01:38:24,194 --> 01:38:27,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Because again, I became a citizen about two years ago.

968
01:38:29,396 --> 01:38:32,516
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I was a student first, and I had a green card.

969
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:38,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And I honestly never feared that anything could happen to me based on being a foreigner.

970
01:38:39,953 --> 01:38:45,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it never even crossed my mind, because again like my experiences has always been very positive.

971
01:38:45,798 --> 01:38:55,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this country again for the opportunity that he gives to people like me that come here to sort of, you know, make the best of themselves.

972
01:38:57,508 --> 01:38:58,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for that.

973
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:05,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I just wanted to make a quick comment about this setup that we have for reading audiences.

974
01:39:05,715 --> 01:39:09,278
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it says that, I'll make this quick.

975
01:39:10,499 --> 01:39:14,402
[SPEAKER_11]: So advertise December 26, 2024 Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal.

976
01:39:14,422 --> 01:39:19,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So I tried to find out what the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal was.

977
01:39:19,966 --> 01:39:21,347
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do a search,

978
01:39:22,068 --> 01:39:31,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We will search for that, then it says that the marathon tranquil and summer journal was like emerged out of the met for transcript and summer journal now became together when you go there.

979
01:39:32,218 --> 01:39:41,066
[SPEAKER_11]: there's absolutely no mentioning about the welcoming city audience or any other audience, for that matter, and then, if you search for welcoming city or if you Google welcoming city audience met for transcript summer journal.

980
01:39:42,247 --> 01:39:51,310
[SPEAKER_11]: The first result that you get is actually Councilor Leming's post on his personal website.

981
01:39:51,891 --> 01:40:05,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Then Tufts Daily article from 2016, something from the Summer of Medford News Weekly, the Tufts Daily talking about the Somerville City Council that passed a sanctuary city, reconfirms state of sanctuary city.

982
01:40:06,317 --> 01:40:13,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, there's absolutely no link that I can find to either this audience or any other audience that goes out for a reading.

983
01:40:13,779 --> 01:40:22,941
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just wondering, what is the point of these advertisements that go out, given that they seem that there's nowhere, or at least hard to be found?

984
01:40:23,381 --> 01:40:28,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And my speculation is that this is for people that do not actively search for something.

985
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:32,319
[SPEAKER_11]: to actually become aware of it, for example, in a local newspaper or something.

986
01:40:32,959 --> 01:40:42,364
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you Google this and then you don't get anything, then what are the chances that if you don't take to Google something, then you actually come across an ordinance?

987
01:40:43,165 --> 01:40:48,528
[SPEAKER_18]: All I can say is I agree with the spirit of your question of what is the point of this.

988
01:40:49,368 --> 01:40:54,251
[SPEAKER_18]: State law requires that we advertise in a print newspaper

989
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:57,232
[SPEAKER_18]: these ordinances.

990
01:40:57,272 --> 01:40:58,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a prison newspaper?

991
01:40:58,652 --> 01:41:01,053
[SPEAKER_18]: You can find about five copies at 7-Eleven.

992
01:41:02,834 --> 01:41:07,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to be a subscriber when it covered Medford up until about 2022.

993
01:41:07,535 --> 01:41:18,759
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Gannett Company essentially gutted all of the local newspapers that they owned, merged some together, reassigned reporters to different beats.

994
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:22,440
[SPEAKER_18]: And we no longer had a Medford beat reporter, which is the situation we've been in for

995
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:26,263
[SPEAKER_18]: two and a half years if folks can correct me on the timeline a little bit.

996
01:41:27,785 --> 01:41:31,729
[SPEAKER_18]: But this was advertised in the print version of the Medford transcript in Somerville Journal.

997
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:35,032
[SPEAKER_18]: The clerk can can provide the receipts.

998
01:41:36,213 --> 01:41:37,715
[SPEAKER_18]: And to be honest, I think this

999
01:41:40,253 --> 01:41:53,282
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a state law around advertising that harkens back to the time when most everybody got a local newspaper and actually read through the advertisements to see what was going on in the city.

1000
01:41:53,362 --> 01:41:58,745
[SPEAKER_18]: So we advertise public hearings in the paper, we advertise second readings of ordinances in the paper.

1001
01:41:59,806 --> 01:42:05,170
[SPEAKER_18]: We also, of course, put up the agendas and write everything on our website and the portal that we have.

1002
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:09,813
[SPEAKER_18]: But the state requires us to post in

1003
01:42:11,535 --> 01:42:12,617
[SPEAKER_18]: print paper of record.

1004
01:42:14,656 --> 01:42:18,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is available on the printed newspaper at 7-Eleven.

1005
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:18,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1006
01:42:18,798 --> 01:42:20,279
[SPEAKER_18]: And they might have a new.

1007
01:42:20,379 --> 01:42:24,041
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if they publish everything from the print newspaper online.

1008
01:42:24,081 --> 01:42:25,101
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think they do.

1009
01:42:26,022 --> 01:42:26,782
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, that's.

1010
01:42:27,262 --> 01:42:33,706
[SPEAKER_11]: So if possible, if we could add this to the open data access law that was mentioned earlier.

1011
01:42:33,906 --> 01:42:43,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think it's just, I mean, I don't know, again, whether we can do a local audience that sort of goes against the, I mean, if it goes against, probably no, but the state law.

1012
01:42:43,911 --> 01:42:49,657
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we could sort of like say, well, we still publish it that the Medford transcript journal or whatever it is.

1013
01:42:50,257 --> 01:42:56,003
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, there's another mechanism that makes it easier to push it into the local community, I think would be great.

1014
01:42:56,023 --> 01:43:00,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think, again, people follow what's going on here, like they're never going to find out about this or any other.

1015
01:43:00,988 --> 01:43:02,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I have seen

1016
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:16,630
[SPEAKER_18]: I was reading through the end of session bills to see if something that we had put forward had gone through at the legislature they just had their end of session, December 31, I think 2024 lasted maybe a little longer at the state house and everywhere else.

1017
01:43:21,235 --> 01:43:31,562
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kind of saying that I saw a title of a community that had filed a home rule petition to request that they could post these things on a bulletin board on their city website instead of in a paper.

1018
01:43:31,902 --> 01:43:35,945
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we would have to ask the state to allow us an exemption from the state law to do so.

1019
01:43:36,145 --> 01:43:37,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe that's part of it.

1020
01:43:37,506 --> 01:43:38,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I would support it.

1021
01:43:38,186 --> 01:43:39,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry for the digression.

1022
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:41,168
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I appreciate it.

1023
01:43:41,349 --> 01:43:44,170
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a procedural quirk that deserves some explanation.

1024
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:44,751
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1025
01:43:46,533 --> 01:43:48,074
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'm gonna go to Zoom.

1026
01:43:49,095 --> 01:43:52,878
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to Steve Schnapp on Zoom, and then we'll go back to the podium.

1027
01:43:53,659 --> 01:43:55,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Steve, I've requested you to unmute.

1028
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,781
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have three minutes.

1029
01:43:57,041 --> 01:43:58,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1030
01:43:58,923 --> 01:43:59,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1031
01:43:59,824 --> 01:44:01,005
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

1032
01:44:01,045 --> 01:44:02,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave.

1033
01:44:04,507 --> 01:44:11,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna say that this policy has been in effect in Medford for six years.

1034
01:44:12,145 --> 01:44:19,228
[SPEAKER_00]: For five of those years, I served as a volunteer with the city's Human Rights Commission.

1035
01:44:20,069 --> 01:44:23,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief Buckley is a member of the Human Rights Commission.

1036
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:30,033
[SPEAKER_00]: We had many meetings, monthly and in between, and many email exchanges.

1037
01:44:30,714 --> 01:44:37,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never heard one word that this policy was a problem for the police, not once.

1038
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:39,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have

1039
01:44:40,714 --> 01:44:53,977
[SPEAKER_00]: been watching all the communications from the police, and I have never seen any problem with the administration of this policy.

1040
01:44:55,177 --> 01:45:00,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully support the codification of this, and I thank the city council for moving on this.

1041
01:45:00,678 --> 01:45:01,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1042
01:45:02,999 --> 01:45:03,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1043
01:45:04,299 --> 01:45:05,499
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to the podium.

1044
01:45:05,519 --> 01:45:08,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1045
01:45:09,485 --> 01:45:10,626
[SPEAKER_18]: And you'll have three minutes.

1046
01:45:11,827 --> 01:45:13,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Victor Alejo, 40 Robinson Road.

1047
01:45:14,929 --> 01:45:18,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm here tonight to speak, again, against this ordinance.

1048
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:25,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I do see some changes were made, like getting rid of effectively all of the section on enforcement.

1049
01:45:26,537 --> 01:45:28,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I still don't believe this ordinance is legal.

1050
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:34,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think sooner or later, a court, probably the United States Supreme Court, to be honest with you,

1051
01:45:34,724 --> 01:45:38,189
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to strike it down, and it's like, as unconstitutional.

1052
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:51,766
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I believe this is, like I said the last time I was up here, is that it really does try to put local and state laws above federal law, which the Constitution prevents, as much as the city council might not like.

1053
01:45:52,625 --> 01:46:00,367
[SPEAKER_09]: That federal law says being in the United States unlawfully is against the law and could subject a person to removal, deportation proceedings.

1054
01:46:01,087 --> 01:46:01,807
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the law.

1055
01:46:02,447 --> 01:46:06,608
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't like it, petition your representatives in Congress to do something about it.

1056
01:46:07,008 --> 01:46:07,848
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the remedy.

1057
01:46:08,568 --> 01:46:16,410
[SPEAKER_09]: The remedy is not to do what the city council is doing or attempting to do, which is act far beyond its legal authority.

1058
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:22,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke the last time about some practical reasons why I think this ordinance is bad policy.

1059
01:46:22,824 --> 01:46:23,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll just reiterate them.

1060
01:46:24,525 --> 01:46:33,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I think even with the tempered language, the ordinance still does handicap to a significant degree, the police department's ability to do its job, which is to keep the community safe.

1061
01:46:34,231 --> 01:46:41,536
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just point as two examples here, look at 103D, talks about the police department not being able to initiate investigations.

1062
01:46:42,435 --> 01:46:46,997
[SPEAKER_09]: look at 103E, which limits the department's ability to make arrests.

1063
01:46:47,717 --> 01:46:50,538
[SPEAKER_09]: These are two fundamental functions of what police departments do.

1064
01:46:50,578 --> 01:46:55,180
[SPEAKER_09]: They investigate, and they make arrests of people who are not obeying the law.

1065
01:46:55,260 --> 01:47:01,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So us telling us, essentially, police departments don't do what you're designed to do, what you're supposed to be doing.

1066
01:47:02,683 --> 01:47:09,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I understand there's tremendous intent tonight to approve this ordinance, but I would seriously just ask you to at least wait until the U.S.

1067
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:21,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Supreme Court weighs in on this, because I'm telling you, there's going to be a case about this, and it's going to strike this down, and the city's going to be embarrassed, and it's going to show that Medford's leaders don't really understand the concept of limited government.

1068
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:23,451
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I have to say tonight.

1069
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:24,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for listening.

1070
01:47:24,451 --> 01:47:26,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1071
01:47:27,492 --> 01:47:29,313
[SPEAKER_18]: No one on Zoom, so we'll remain at the podium.

1072
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:31,821
[SPEAKER_18]: name and address for the record.

1073
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:32,801
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

1074
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:34,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

1075
01:47:34,442 --> 01:47:37,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Laura Rotolo, 14 Rita Drive.

1076
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:44,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also here on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and our thousands of members and supporters here in Medford.

1077
01:47:45,286 --> 01:47:49,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Very quickly to thank the city council for this third reading of this important ordinance.

1078
01:47:49,848 --> 01:47:52,949
[SPEAKER_12]: I too am an immigrant who's been living in Medford for about 30

1079
01:47:54,229 --> 01:47:59,372
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very proud to call this place my home and to support other immigrants here.

1080
01:47:59,752 --> 01:48:15,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to address some of the questions posed earlier about the legality of this, of course, Medford is one of dozens of cities and towns in Massachusetts to pass a similar ordinance, including the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, very recently.

1081
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:21,225
[SPEAKER_12]: It has been looked at by the council for the city for legality.

1082
01:48:21,926 --> 01:48:34,018
[SPEAKER_12]: These issues have been litigated across the country and there is nothing in here that limits the police's ability to carry forth a lawful arrest or its lawful duties as the police department.

1083
01:48:35,339 --> 01:48:38,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, many cities and towns have passed very similar language.

1084
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:41,703
[SPEAKER_12]: We look forward to Medford being the next city to do so.

1085
01:48:42,764 --> 01:48:47,968
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it just focuses on this voluntary collaboration with immigration authorities.

1086
01:48:48,508 --> 01:48:49,289
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank you again.

1087
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:51,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1088
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:53,592
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go back to Zoom.

1089
01:48:54,372 --> 01:48:57,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Muneer Jumanis, I'll ask you to unmute and you'll have three minutes.

1090
01:48:57,995 --> 01:49:00,497
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1091
01:49:00,997 --> 01:49:02,098
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm Muneer Jumanis.

1092
01:49:02,298 --> 01:49:02,998
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 370 Road.

1093
01:49:04,865 --> 01:49:20,077
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm, once again, congratulating the city council for taking this measure up and highly recommend a yes vote as was mentioned previously.

1094
01:49:21,999 --> 01:49:28,544
[SPEAKER_27]: We had discussions about these policies for several years.

1095
01:49:28,784 --> 01:49:30,465
[SPEAKER_27]: I was chair of the Human Rights Commission.

1096
01:49:31,026 --> 01:49:33,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Chief Buckley is part of the Human Rights Commission.

1097
01:49:34,529 --> 01:49:41,613
[SPEAKER_27]: And there was never any issues with the proposed policies.

1098
01:49:42,293 --> 01:49:51,438
[SPEAKER_27]: And similarly, I would say, since this ordinance simply codifies these policies, I don't expect that there will be any change.

1099
01:49:52,618 --> 01:49:55,260
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm an immigrant myself.

1100
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:01,903
[SPEAKER_27]: Some immigrants have faced severe bias.

1101
01:50:03,204 --> 01:50:03,924
[SPEAKER_27]: Others have not.

1102
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:13,957
[SPEAKER_27]: That does not mean that the experience of one immigrant who has not faced any such bias says it all.

1103
01:50:14,577 --> 01:50:18,940
[SPEAKER_27]: So once again, I urge the council to approve this policy.

1104
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,801
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for your attention.

1105
01:50:23,804 --> 01:50:24,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1106
01:50:24,344 --> 01:50:27,646
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll stay on Zoom.

1107
01:50:28,347 --> 01:50:29,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Eileen Lerner.

1108
01:50:29,608 --> 01:50:31,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1109
01:50:31,589 --> 01:50:32,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Eileen, you'll have three minutes.

1110
01:50:37,264 --> 01:50:42,025
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1111
01:50:42,785 --> 01:50:47,886
[SPEAKER_33]: And I wanna say that I'm very much for this adoption of this resolution.

1112
01:50:47,906 --> 01:50:49,986
[SPEAKER_33]: And I thank those who support it.

1113
01:50:51,286 --> 01:50:56,607
[SPEAKER_33]: Immigrants are people, people who are part of our community.

1114
01:50:58,148 --> 01:50:59,948
[SPEAKER_33]: They deserve to be protected.

1115
01:51:01,148 --> 01:51:04,589
[SPEAKER_33]: This ordinance is not happening in a vacuum.

1116
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,869
[SPEAKER_33]: We have,

1117
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:12,628
[SPEAKER_33]: a federal threat against people in our community.

1118
01:51:15,112 --> 01:51:20,902
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we all, or some of us, maybe not all of us, but some of us,

1119
01:51:22,034 --> 01:51:25,076
[SPEAKER_33]: are committed to protecting our neighbors.

1120
01:51:25,856 --> 01:51:33,922
[SPEAKER_33]: We're not gonna let them get swept up and put in concentration camps and deported from our community.

1121
01:51:34,602 --> 01:51:44,028
[SPEAKER_33]: We are not going to put up with the local police cooperating with the federal authorities to take people out of our community.

1122
01:51:44,408 --> 01:51:46,169
[SPEAKER_33]: And of what benefit is that?

1123
01:51:46,389 --> 01:51:48,931
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, you take people away, then,

1124
01:51:51,195 --> 01:51:54,578
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, the landlords have lost a rent.

1125
01:51:55,879 --> 01:51:58,862
[SPEAKER_33]: They take their work, their labor away from us.

1126
01:51:59,142 --> 01:52:00,583
[SPEAKER_33]: What does it gain you?

1127
01:52:01,244 --> 01:52:05,107
[SPEAKER_33]: But furthermore, what about how we treat each other?

1128
01:52:05,187 --> 01:52:07,009
[SPEAKER_33]: Isn't that important to anybody?

1129
01:52:07,129 --> 01:52:12,334
[SPEAKER_33]: Is money, George Scarpelli, the only reason to do anything?

1130
01:52:14,031 --> 01:52:17,657
[SPEAKER_33]: You don't do anything unless you have the money first.

1131
01:52:18,098 --> 01:52:21,804
[SPEAKER_33]: You think first about the money and second about the people.

1132
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:27,593
[SPEAKER_33]: That really, I'd like to use a curse word, but I won't.

1133
01:52:28,134 --> 01:52:32,157
[SPEAKER_33]: But I mean, that type of thinking is just archaic.

1134
01:52:33,138 --> 01:52:40,464
[SPEAKER_33]: And one time I said about some people in the city, including you, George, that you were a relic of another alien.

1135
01:52:40,624 --> 01:52:45,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Eileen, please direct your comments to the chair, and I'm gonna have to give Councilor Scarpelli a chance to respond.

1136
01:52:45,768 --> 01:52:47,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

1137
01:52:49,891 --> 01:52:50,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1138
01:52:52,116 --> 01:52:54,518
[SPEAKER_20]: I know this is so people realize Ms.

1139
01:52:54,558 --> 01:52:56,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Lerner has called me a racist for many, many years.

1140
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:00,101
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a first-generation American.

1141
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:02,022
[SPEAKER_20]: My parents are immigrants from Italy.

1142
01:53:02,622 --> 01:53:07,425
[SPEAKER_20]: They came across legally and did exactly what had to be done.

1143
01:53:08,206 --> 01:53:11,448
[SPEAKER_20]: They love this country, and they raised a proud American.

1144
01:53:13,089 --> 01:53:16,011
[SPEAKER_20]: I worked in a community that's very diverse, Mr. President.

1145
01:53:17,372 --> 01:53:17,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Unlike Ms.

1146
01:53:17,972 --> 01:53:21,234
[SPEAKER_20]: Lerner, I've sat in a living room with an ICE agent.

1147
01:53:22,012 --> 01:53:25,153
[SPEAKER_20]: and a family of illegal members.

1148
01:53:27,713 --> 01:53:29,233
[SPEAKER_20]: And I understand the situation.

1149
01:53:30,033 --> 01:53:33,194
[SPEAKER_20]: But we just had two human rights members just say what?

1150
01:53:34,754 --> 01:53:35,734
[SPEAKER_20]: They've worked with the chief.

1151
01:53:36,354 --> 01:53:38,815
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had the existing plan in place for five and a half years.

1152
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:40,475
[SPEAKER_20]: It's worked amazingly.

1153
01:53:41,735 --> 01:53:47,816
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what was mentioned last time where people are missing, when Mr. Lerner's talking about money.

1154
01:53:49,017 --> 01:53:50,877
[SPEAKER_20]: My fear at the time was understanding

1155
01:53:52,128 --> 01:54:02,855
[SPEAKER_20]: with the city of Medford and where we are financially, is what are the financial ramifications if there is negative feedback from the federal government?

1156
01:54:03,955 --> 01:54:06,096
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they take money away from Medford?

1157
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, in Cambridge, in Boston, in Somerville, they can survive.

1158
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:13,781
[SPEAKER_20]: In Medford, I question if we can.

1159
01:54:14,782 --> 01:54:18,064
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's our basic necessities, police, fire, school.

1160
01:54:20,485 --> 01:54:21,506
[SPEAKER_20]: That was my concern.

1161
01:54:22,572 --> 01:54:29,494
[SPEAKER_20]: So to sit there and publicly embarrass me, she's already called me racist many times.

1162
01:54:31,854 --> 01:54:32,874
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's uncalled for.

1163
01:54:36,315 --> 01:54:41,896
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will share with you the process as I met with many members of these organizations.

1164
01:54:43,937 --> 01:54:50,278
[SPEAKER_20]: I would never ever, in the spirit of any of these ordinances, they're very good.

1165
01:54:51,328 --> 01:54:55,151
[SPEAKER_20]: But as a city councilor, we have to weigh many different factors.

1166
01:54:57,052 --> 01:55:00,414
[SPEAKER_20]: And because I've done that, I'm labeled a racist.

1167
01:55:02,916 --> 01:55:03,876
[SPEAKER_20]: So shame on you, Ms.

1168
01:55:03,916 --> 01:55:04,257
[SPEAKER_20]: Lerner.

1169
01:55:04,777 --> 01:55:07,799
[SPEAKER_20]: I've given my life to this community and the people of this community.

1170
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:11,021
[SPEAKER_20]: No matter what color, what race, it doesn't matter.

1171
01:55:13,342 --> 01:55:16,565
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's about time people stand up to the ignorance we just heard.

1172
01:55:16,585 --> 01:55:18,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1173
01:55:22,356 --> 01:55:23,877
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you had a minute left.

1174
01:55:24,297 --> 01:55:29,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go back to you if you'd like to finish your comment, but please direct your comments to the chair.

1175
01:55:31,178 --> 01:55:31,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1176
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:40,400
[SPEAKER_33]: I didn't hear myself say a word about racism.

1177
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:42,441
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

1178
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:51,163
[SPEAKER_33]: So I was talking about giving equity to everybody in our community.

1179
01:55:52,537 --> 01:55:55,819
[SPEAKER_33]: that that is a priority and not money.

1180
01:55:57,380 --> 01:56:00,662
[SPEAKER_33]: Have the intention and then go find the money.

1181
01:56:01,823 --> 01:56:03,864
[SPEAKER_33]: Have the intention to do the work.

1182
01:56:04,564 --> 01:56:06,045
[SPEAKER_33]: That's all that's being asked.

1183
01:56:07,226 --> 01:56:15,871
[SPEAKER_33]: Pledge yourself to finding the money instead of always saying, oh, no, we can't do this and we can't do that and we can't do the other thing.

1184
01:56:17,452 --> 01:56:18,813
[SPEAKER_33]: Because maybe we can.

1185
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:20,554
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we can.

1186
01:56:21,897 --> 01:56:25,561
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm optimistic, I love this town as much as you do, George.

1187
01:56:26,581 --> 01:56:31,466
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think- Please direct your comments to the chair.

1188
01:56:31,746 --> 01:56:35,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

1189
01:56:38,373 --> 01:56:42,837
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, that's, I mean, I don't feel like I need to have to defend myself.

1190
01:56:44,819 --> 01:56:47,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your comments, I appreciate that.

1191
01:56:59,565 --> 01:57:01,646
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll go to the podium.

1192
01:57:02,286 --> 01:57:03,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1193
01:57:03,687 --> 01:57:04,707
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

1194
01:57:05,347 --> 01:57:06,728
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me turn on the microphone.

1195
01:57:07,028 --> 01:57:07,648
[SPEAKER_38]: Hello, friends.

1196
01:57:07,848 --> 01:57:08,569
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you very much.

1197
01:57:08,609 --> 01:57:09,849
[SPEAKER_38]: My name is Allison Earnhardt.

1198
01:57:09,929 --> 01:57:12,970
[SPEAKER_38]: I live at 37 Amaranth Avenue, that way over there.

1199
01:57:14,691 --> 01:57:16,292
[SPEAKER_38]: This is my first city council meeting.

1200
01:57:16,932 --> 01:57:18,613
[SPEAKER_38]: I haven't been living in Medford very long.

1201
01:57:19,513 --> 01:57:21,754
[SPEAKER_38]: Before this, I lived in Texas for a long time.

1202
01:57:21,834 --> 01:57:25,555
[SPEAKER_38]: I was in Texas during the Trump administration previously.

1203
01:57:27,676 --> 01:57:28,877
[SPEAKER_38]: I lived in North Austin.

1204
01:57:28,897 --> 01:57:32,800
[SPEAKER_38]: It was a very robust neighborhood, a wonderful community.

1205
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,881
[SPEAKER_38]: I was a high school physics teacher there.

1206
01:57:35,642 --> 01:57:40,485
[SPEAKER_38]: And during the crackdowns with ICE, it tore our community apart.

1207
01:57:40,705 --> 01:57:41,786
[SPEAKER_38]: It was horrifying.

1208
01:57:42,826 --> 01:57:49,411
[SPEAKER_38]: People would disappear on their way home from the grocery store, or people just wouldn't show up at work.

1209
01:57:50,071 --> 01:57:53,854
[SPEAKER_38]: I had students who were afraid that they weren't going to be at school the next day.

1210
01:57:55,177 --> 01:57:56,441
[SPEAKER_38]: It didn't feel safe.

1211
01:57:57,183 --> 01:58:00,291
[SPEAKER_38]: It didn't feel like I was living in a free country.

1212
01:58:00,832 --> 01:58:01,614
[SPEAKER_38]: It was scary.

1213
01:58:03,579 --> 01:58:10,483
[SPEAKER_38]: And honestly, living up here in New England now, I feel like I'm in a slightly more civilized place.

1214
01:58:11,423 --> 01:58:17,127
[SPEAKER_38]: And I was so, so excited to hear about this ordinance, to hear about the work that's already been done.

1215
01:58:17,987 --> 01:58:29,094
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm in huge, huge support of, you know, just codifying this and making it real, because I don't want to live in a neighborhood like that again, because it was awful.

1216
01:58:29,794 --> 01:58:32,118
[SPEAKER_38]: and I don't want that to happen to our community here.

1217
01:58:32,438 --> 01:58:34,161
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you very much for the work that you're doing.

1218
01:58:36,164 --> 01:58:36,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1219
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:43,034
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Leming.

1220
01:58:45,435 --> 01:58:50,338
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to thank everybody who spoke out about the ordinance.

1221
01:58:50,398 --> 01:58:52,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Just one small point to address.

1222
01:58:52,479 --> 01:59:05,466
[SPEAKER_25]: So even if something like this were to affect federal funding, I would be fully in support of it anyway, because that doesn't factor into my calculus.

1223
01:59:05,966 --> 01:59:13,490
[SPEAKER_25]: But you do need to consider that we've already been through one Trump administration.

1224
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:25,085
[SPEAKER_25]: PolitiFact, it does state that while he did issue executive order attempting to cut funding to sanctuary cities, to welcoming cities, those actually largely failed.

1225
01:59:25,145 --> 01:59:26,705
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, they were held back by courts.

1226
01:59:29,286 --> 01:59:31,947
[SPEAKER_25]: Most of those ended up being struck down in court.

1227
01:59:32,007 --> 01:59:38,449
[SPEAKER_25]: So maybe it will succeed the next time, but it actually didn't succeed the first time.

1228
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:39,690
[SPEAKER_25]: It was just well-publicized.

1229
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:42,431
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's the only point I want to make about that.

1230
01:59:45,742 --> 01:59:46,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1231
01:59:47,803 --> 01:59:57,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing no further discussion by members of the Council or members of the public on the motion of Councilors saying we have one more hand on Zoom.

1232
01:59:59,471 --> 02:00:06,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Just in the nick of time, we'll go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom and you'll have three minutes.

1233
02:00:06,415 --> 02:00:07,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me one second.

1234
02:00:14,508 --> 02:00:16,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Andy, if you could, I'm requesting you to unmute.

1235
02:00:18,749 --> 02:00:19,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

1236
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:20,850
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

1237
02:00:22,771 --> 02:00:23,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President.

1238
02:00:27,612 --> 02:00:29,673
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a nation of immigrants.

1239
02:00:32,614 --> 02:00:37,835
[SPEAKER_05]: And supposedly that made our country greatest of all times.

1240
02:00:39,636 --> 02:00:42,897
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother and father both

1241
02:00:44,065 --> 02:00:49,246
[SPEAKER_05]: were sponsored to come to the USA from northern Italy, mind you, which is rare.

1242
02:00:49,886 --> 02:00:55,827
[SPEAKER_05]: One out of ten Italians you find here come from the north because supposedly we're more affluent.

1243
02:00:57,368 --> 02:01:02,249
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they were sponsored.

1244
02:01:02,729 --> 02:01:04,089
[SPEAKER_05]: My father sponsored others.

1245
02:01:04,909 --> 02:01:07,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them sleep in our houses and with their families.

1246
02:01:08,709 --> 02:01:11,550
[SPEAKER_05]: They took the, they became citizens.

1247
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,550
[SPEAKER_05]: They studied the book.

1248
02:01:12,911 --> 02:01:14,071
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother had to learn English.

1249
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:19,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So I grew up speaking an Italian dialect in Somerville.

1250
02:01:19,933 --> 02:01:24,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the Hancock school in kindergarten, 1955.

1251
02:01:25,335 --> 02:01:28,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Richard could attest to that.

1252
02:01:28,636 --> 02:01:29,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't speak English.

1253
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:31,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a word.

1254
02:01:31,778 --> 02:01:35,959
[SPEAKER_05]: My father couldn't afford a black and white TV to watch the Three Stooges.

1255
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:37,920
[SPEAKER_05]: How am I going to learn English?

1256
02:01:39,022 --> 02:01:40,682
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is, I made it.

1257
02:01:41,283 --> 02:01:46,864
[SPEAKER_05]: The key is this, legal immigrants, legal immigration.

1258
02:01:47,084 --> 02:01:48,265
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one word, legal.

1259
02:01:48,905 --> 02:01:54,126
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only way to do it for the best chance for the United States of America.

1260
02:01:54,607 --> 02:01:55,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night.

1261
02:01:57,788 --> 02:01:58,728
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1262
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:18,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing no further discussion by members of the public or members of the council on the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve for third reading as amended by Councilor Tseng and seconded by Councilor Leming.

1263
02:02:20,128 --> 02:02:21,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk please call the role.

1264
02:02:31,448 --> 02:02:39,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

1265
02:02:39,974 --> 02:02:40,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1266
02:02:40,435 --> 02:02:41,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1267
02:02:41,616 --> 02:02:44,858
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes and the ordinance is ordained for adjournment.

1268
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:51,463
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1269
02:02:53,985 --> 02:02:56,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Could we take the hearings in the VIC?

1270
02:02:58,428 --> 02:02:58,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1271
02:03:00,814 --> 02:03:02,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1272
02:03:04,196 --> 02:03:05,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, the community, the CPC.

1273
02:03:06,958 --> 02:03:08,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even realize that was on here.

1274
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Under suspension, Councilor Scarpelli wants to take 25007.

1275
02:03:12,461 --> 02:03:13,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And 25013, the building department.

1276
02:03:13,161 --> 02:03:13,482
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1277
02:03:22,386 --> 02:03:25,429
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have the veteran services director too, so 24, 3, 5, 1.

1278
02:03:27,932 --> 02:03:30,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Veteran service director Shaw's here too for 24, 3, 5, 1.

1279
02:03:32,877 --> 02:03:37,021
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the resolution to allow the director to offer housing incentives to veteran renters.

1280
02:03:40,489 --> 02:03:43,510
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do all three of the fun ones where we have some city staff present.

1281
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:50,472
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll start with 25-007 submitted by the mayor, community preservation.

1282
02:03:50,492 --> 02:03:53,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I have to get my papers together here.

1283
02:03:59,614 --> 02:04:01,274
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a request from the CPC to

1284
02:04:05,253 --> 02:04:27,061
[SPEAKER_18]: dear community preservation appropriation request from the mayor, dear president bears members of the city council on behalf of your community preservation committee, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the CPC requesting the appropriation of 146,000 from the CPA general reserve to the office of planning development and sustainability for phase two of the car park renovation project.

1285
02:04:27,728 --> 02:04:29,990
[SPEAKER_18]: This project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

1286
02:04:30,450 --> 02:04:34,052
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the CPC recommendation letter attached and incorporated.

1287
02:04:34,072 --> 02:04:38,375
[SPEAKER_18]: CPA Manager DuPont and City Planner Centrella are in attendance.

1288
02:04:39,536 --> 02:04:46,480
[SPEAKER_18]: And we do have the signed letter from the chair of the CPC, who was here, but she had to go.

1289
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:46,861
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1290
02:04:47,754 --> 02:04:51,997
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Manager DuPont if you want to give a presentation on this.

1291
02:04:52,257 --> 02:04:52,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly.

1292
02:04:52,597 --> 02:05:00,582
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also joined by a planner, Amanda Centrella on Zoom, who is the project manager for this project.

1293
02:05:01,904 --> 02:05:13,114
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to give her the opportunity to share some merits of this request, but I will speak administratively that this was approved by the CPC unanimously for the amount of $146,000.

1294
02:05:13,154 --> 02:05:14,455
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll have to bear with me.

1295
02:05:14,475 --> 02:05:14,796
[SPEAKER_15]: There was $144,000 and $146,000.

1296
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:27,766
[SPEAKER_15]: It was again supported unanimously by the committee as it aligns with our goal of expanding our open space and recreation.

1297
02:05:28,427 --> 02:05:46,680
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason why you are hearing this in advance of all the other applications for this fiscal year is due to some funding deadlines, which I think I will at this point defer to Amanda to kind of elaborate on the deadlines that are necessitating an expedited request before this council.

1298
02:05:47,142 --> 02:05:47,422
[SPEAKER_18]: great.

1299
02:05:47,482 --> 02:05:49,103
[SPEAKER_18]: We have planner Centrala.

1300
02:05:49,123 --> 02:05:49,924
[SPEAKER_18]: You're recognized.

1301
02:05:51,585 --> 02:05:54,187
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank you, everyone for your time tonight.

1302
02:05:54,347 --> 02:05:58,310
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm happy to answer questions, but just to kind of give a little overview.

1303
02:05:58,330 --> 02:06:05,334
[SPEAKER_23]: Um so this funding is going towards the very exciting car park phase two renovation.

1304
02:06:06,055 --> 02:06:08,476
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, phase two includes some really incredible stuff.

1305
02:06:08,957 --> 02:06:09,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Um,

1306
02:06:16,021 --> 02:06:30,087
[SPEAKER_23]: basketball courts, one of which will be covered with a shade structure and some solar paneling that will power other features in the park, adult fitness area, a dog park, and there's more in there too.

1307
02:06:30,107 --> 02:06:32,028
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's a lot of really great stuff.

1308
02:06:32,768 --> 02:06:40,352
[SPEAKER_23]: The other funding that we've accrued for this project includes a land and water conservation grant in the amount of $1 million,

1309
02:06:42,032 --> 02:06:52,295
[SPEAKER_23]: A Department of Energy federal earmark that was acquired with the help of Congresswoman Clark's office for roughly one and a half million dollars.

1310
02:06:53,896 --> 02:07:00,818
[SPEAKER_23]: ARPA funding as well as this sort of application for like last mile funds through the CPA.

1311
02:07:02,975 --> 02:07:05,897
[SPEAKER_23]: So I mentioned a couple of different funding sources there.

1312
02:07:06,357 --> 02:07:18,286
[SPEAKER_23]: The Land and Water Conservation Fund has a deadline that the work needs to be completed by and that we're sort of running up against as far as getting things started.

1313
02:07:19,366 --> 02:07:25,951
[SPEAKER_23]: The federal earmark that we received, there were some regulations or requirements, I should say,

1314
02:07:27,432 --> 02:07:37,978
[SPEAKER_23]: for using these funds that there were sort of holdups around that were outside of the city's control in moving forward.

1315
02:07:38,378 --> 02:07:48,164
[SPEAKER_23]: It had to do with the Build America, Buy America Act and ensuring that there was a way to comply with that act while sourcing

1316
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:53,742
[SPEAKER_23]: materials such as solar panels domestically.

1317
02:07:53,882 --> 02:07:57,244
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm happy to go into the weeds there if people want it.

1318
02:07:57,544 --> 02:07:58,744
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure if you do.

1319
02:08:00,765 --> 02:08:02,426
[SPEAKER_23]: Feel free to let me know.

1320
02:08:03,667 --> 02:08:06,288
[SPEAKER_23]: But we're really excited about this project.

1321
02:08:06,928 --> 02:08:16,333
[SPEAKER_23]: We've heard from a number of different community members, and there's been a very robust process in shaping and forming the design for this.

1322
02:08:17,312 --> 02:08:31,700
[SPEAKER_23]: And having access to these funds would basically allow us to get started on bringing on our sub consultant team, as you can imagine with all of these different facets to the project there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of nuance.

1323
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:42,283
[SPEAKER_23]: to the engineering, and sort of the level of review that needs to happen to get this stuff in the ground secure and ready to go.

1324
02:08:43,144 --> 02:08:50,886
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of the materials that we're working with, particularly around the solar panels and the large shade structure, have very long lead times.

1325
02:08:51,026 --> 02:08:52,507
[SPEAKER_23]: So review

1326
02:08:53,587 --> 02:09:04,959
[SPEAKER_23]: for getting review of those materials by a team with expertise sooner rather than later would really help us keep on track with our timelines.

1327
02:09:04,979 --> 02:09:08,142
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'll pause there and just see if there are any questions.

1328
02:09:11,704 --> 02:09:13,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Just want to say thank you.

1329
02:09:13,385 --> 02:09:20,888
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that a lot of work has gone into trying to figure out how to make sure that all the deadlines worked out on this project.

1330
02:09:20,948 --> 02:09:24,369
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it was some intense management, so I just want to thank you for that.

1331
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:26,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any questions by members of the council?

1332
02:09:31,652 --> 02:09:33,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, is there anything you'd like to add?

1333
02:09:33,973 --> 02:09:35,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'll go to Vice President Collins.

1334
02:09:37,691 --> 02:09:40,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here, Teresa and Amanda on Zoom.

1335
02:09:42,972 --> 02:09:54,838
[SPEAKER_04]: just to echo what's already been said, shared sentiments, you know, obviously there's been so much work and effort and community input and staff effort poured into the car park renovation over many, many years at this point.

1336
02:09:55,898 --> 02:10:05,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really happy to see a unanimous recommendation come out of the CPC so that we can continue the good work of manifesting those goals and continuing the renovation project.

1337
02:10:05,183 --> 02:10:09,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be really happy to support this tonight and motion for approval after any other comments or questions from my fellow Councilors.

1338
02:10:12,409 --> 02:10:25,105
[SPEAKER_18]: thank you on the motion to approve by councillor collins seconded by councillor saying any further discussion by members of the council seeing none is there anything you'd like to add uh theresa oh sorry

1339
02:10:26,604 --> 02:10:37,391
[SPEAKER_15]: to share just really quickly that we appreciated the amount of fiscal, financial gymnastics that was done here with seeking other grants to help supplement the project.

1340
02:10:37,411 --> 02:10:45,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes at the CPC, we see projects where we're the only funding source, so we appreciated the collaboration that was spread out over this project.

1341
02:10:46,117 --> 02:10:51,040
[SPEAKER_15]: As you said, it's many years, it's many dollars, so we're excited to see it come to fruition.

1342
02:10:51,491 --> 02:10:54,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're federal, state, local on this one, if I'm correct.

1343
02:10:54,173 --> 02:10:54,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1344
02:10:54,813 --> 02:10:56,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Federal, state, and local on this one.

1345
02:10:56,414 --> 02:10:56,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1346
02:10:56,574 --> 02:10:56,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1347
02:10:56,795 --> 02:10:57,475
[SPEAKER_15]: All the agencies.

1348
02:10:57,615 --> 02:10:58,356
[SPEAKER_15]: All the acronyms.

1349
02:10:58,556 --> 02:10:59,817
[SPEAKER_15]: All the acronyms are represented.

1350
02:11:00,677 --> 02:11:00,977
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1351
02:11:00,997 --> 02:11:01,958
[SPEAKER_15]: But yes, thank you.

1352
02:11:02,258 --> 02:11:02,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1353
02:11:02,578 --> 02:11:03,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

1354
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:06,461
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion, any further discussion?

1355
02:11:09,623 --> 02:11:12,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1356
02:11:13,546 --> 02:11:14,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan.

1357
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:16,168
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins.

1358
02:11:16,928 --> 02:11:17,789
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1359
02:11:18,789 --> 02:11:19,310
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Leming.

1360
02:11:20,110 --> 02:11:20,791
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1361
02:11:22,588 --> 02:11:24,449
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

1362
02:11:25,309 --> 02:11:27,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative.

1363
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:28,251
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

1364
02:11:28,971 --> 02:11:29,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1365
02:11:29,451 --> 02:11:31,593
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1366
02:11:32,193 --> 02:11:44,319
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do 24.351, a resolution to allow the director of veteran services to offer housing incentives to veteran renters, whereas veterans in the city of Menford need a place to live and are often discriminated against when searching for housing.

1367
02:11:44,859 --> 02:11:51,788
[SPEAKER_18]: be it therefore resolved that the veteran services director shall have the authority to offer available funds to entities that choose to rent to qualified veterans.

1368
02:11:52,289 --> 02:11:56,714
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that this be discussed with the veteran service director and the city's legal representation and committee.

1369
02:11:57,555 --> 02:12:01,440
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like this has been done and we have a report out from the

1370
02:12:02,561 --> 02:12:19,278
[SPEAKER_18]: um resident services and public engagement committee uh here to amend uh the revised ordinances chapter two administration article four officers and employees division seven director of veteran services there are some minor amendments to um

1371
02:12:22,189 --> 02:12:30,293
[SPEAKER_18]: add pronouns, all the pronouns in this ordinance were just he and this adds she on her.

1372
02:12:30,913 --> 02:12:36,575
[SPEAKER_18]: And then also under section, creates a new section, section 2-765 called housing incentives.

1373
02:12:38,416 --> 02:12:52,845
[SPEAKER_18]: which says the directive of veteran services may in coordination and in the sole discretion with an in the sole discretion authorization of the mayor and subject to the available appropriation and compliance with applicable legal considerations including and not limited to general law chapter 30 b

1374
02:12:53,866 --> 02:13:04,178
[SPEAKER_18]: which is our procurement law partner with a non-profit organization which may offer cash incentives up to $750 annually to landlords who offer rental housing to qualified veterans.

1375
02:13:04,959 --> 02:13:09,304
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it amends the reserve section number to reflect the addition of the new section.

1376
02:13:10,065 --> 02:13:11,527
[SPEAKER_18]: I will go to Councilor Leming.

1377
02:13:14,192 --> 02:13:15,192
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Council President.

1378
02:13:15,693 --> 02:13:18,874
[SPEAKER_25]: So this is something that was originally introduced in May.

1379
02:13:19,594 --> 02:13:24,516
[SPEAKER_25]: And it was an idea of the veteran services director, Veronica Shaw.

1380
02:13:24,756 --> 02:13:43,363
[SPEAKER_25]: So I know that it's often beneficial for folks on city council to take credit for this, but really the credit for the idea and all the work for this goes to both Mrs. Shaw, as well as the very supportive staff at

1381
02:13:44,063 --> 02:13:48,606
[SPEAKER_25]: housing families who've agreed to initiate a pilot program around this.

1382
02:13:48,646 --> 02:13:55,530
[SPEAKER_25]: Essentially, the Veteran Services Office has a small amount of discretionary funds, which Ms.

1383
02:13:55,570 --> 02:14:10,780
[SPEAKER_25]: Shaw wanted to use as an incentive to landlords who choose to rent to veteran renters, which would help with some of the discrimination often faced by this country's veterans in attempting to find

1384
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:12,300
[SPEAKER_25]: housing.

1385
02:14:13,161 --> 02:14:19,184
[SPEAKER_25]: So this a lot of the legwork behind this was informing that partnership with housing families.

1386
02:14:20,024 --> 02:14:34,430
[SPEAKER_25]: The amendment that we see here in, uh, in the city's ordinances, section 2765 housing incentives did come after very lengthy discussion with legal.

1387
02:14:35,551 --> 02:14:38,592
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically, the wording of it is to keep in is

1388
02:14:41,155 --> 02:14:46,979
[SPEAKER_25]: to keep in line with the fact that one, the city can't just give money directly to individual citizens.

1389
02:14:46,999 --> 02:15:00,588
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to partner with a nonprofit and the under state law, the only individual in the city who has the right to create a contract with a nonprofit is the city's mayor.

1390
02:15:00,668 --> 02:15:06,352
[SPEAKER_25]: So the wording of this is a little bit wonky, but it basically says that the,

1391
02:15:07,493 --> 02:15:20,645
[SPEAKER_25]: mayor in collaboration with the veteran services director can form a partnership with one of these nonprofits and that the funding would come from the veteran services office for this for this particular program.

1392
02:15:20,725 --> 02:15:23,287
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm very excited about it.

1393
02:15:23,347 --> 02:15:25,009
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of work that is

1394
02:15:25,889 --> 02:15:29,352
[SPEAKER_25]: already gone into forming this program.

1395
02:15:29,933 --> 02:15:51,910
[SPEAKER_25]: And because I basically see this as a very minor amendment to the duties of the city's ordinances of the veteran services director, I would motion to waive all three readings and pass this directly.

1396
02:15:55,046 --> 02:15:56,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1397
02:15:56,607 --> 02:16:04,372
[SPEAKER_18]: So we do have motion by Councilor Leming to waive the readings and approve this ordinance to be ordained this evening.

1398
02:16:04,832 --> 02:16:06,193
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have Director Shaw here.

1399
02:16:08,755 --> 02:16:18,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we move to more presentations, if you'd like to share anything about this proposal and how you got there and what you'd like to be able to do in your office, I think that would be really great.

1400
02:16:18,881 --> 02:16:20,582
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you for working with us on this.

1401
02:16:22,661 --> 02:16:23,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having me again.

1402
02:16:23,882 --> 02:16:25,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting being here.

1403
02:16:28,185 --> 02:16:38,034
[SPEAKER_07]: So this ordinance has housing veterans is probably one of my top passions.

1404
02:16:38,955 --> 02:16:46,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was thinking about how I can help Medford veterans specifically thought of

1405
02:16:46,477 --> 02:16:48,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I need to get them into housing.

1406
02:16:48,839 --> 02:16:52,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And what better way than to pair them with landlords who need people to fill their homes?

1407
02:16:56,084 --> 02:16:58,606
[SPEAKER_07]: But veterans face discrimination a lot.

1408
02:16:59,947 --> 02:17:06,332
[SPEAKER_07]: They're stereotyped and all the things we've already heard about them.

1409
02:17:06,773 --> 02:17:14,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to find a way to get over that and give landlords an incentive to just take a chance on us.

1410
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:30,744
[SPEAKER_07]: When we were collaborating and creating the rules for this ordinance, one of the things that was very important to me was to keep Medford money in Medford.

1411
02:17:31,175 --> 02:17:39,058
[SPEAKER_07]: These are Medford landlords that live here with money from my office from Medford going to Medford veterans.

1412
02:17:39,578 --> 02:17:41,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not asking for anything.

1413
02:17:41,399 --> 02:17:44,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I already have the money in my budget.

1414
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:48,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just asking for permission to help veterans.

1415
02:17:50,822 --> 02:17:52,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much director.

1416
02:17:52,022 --> 02:17:56,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have any questions by members of the council?

1417
02:18:00,794 --> 02:18:05,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, there is a motion to waive the three readings and approve.

1418
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:07,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go to Vice President Collins.

1419
02:18:09,175 --> 02:18:09,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

1420
02:18:09,976 --> 02:18:18,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you so much for being here and for collaborating with Councilor Leming on this just really proactive, creative, common sense solution.

1421
02:18:18,762 --> 02:18:30,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being so willing to do your job, not just by the letter, but also creatively and do this kind of problem solving to utilize your existing resources to create just a really simple incentive.

1422
02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:35,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really glad that we have a voice in City Hall, not just for

1423
02:18:36,694 --> 02:18:47,903
[SPEAKER_04]: veterans in general and housing veterans, but also for calling out and not being willing to speak directly to the stigma that veterans face in their housing search along with other areas of life.

1424
02:18:47,983 --> 02:18:51,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So really grateful to be able to vote on this tonight.

1425
02:18:51,786 --> 02:18:53,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again so much for your work.

1426
02:18:53,848 --> 02:18:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And also thank you, Councilor Leming, for putting this forward.

1427
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:57,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would second the motion.

1428
02:19:00,273 --> 02:19:02,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1429
02:19:03,576 --> 02:19:05,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Per the state law, we can only

1430
02:19:06,533 --> 02:19:09,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll waive the three readings and ordain in one meeting if there is no objection.

1431
02:19:10,196 --> 02:19:15,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any objection from any Councilor to waive the three readings and ordain these changes tonight?

1432
02:19:19,364 --> 02:19:30,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none on the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Vice President Collins to approve this ordinance and ordain it and waive the three readings.

1433
02:19:31,735 --> 02:19:32,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1434
02:19:35,779 --> 02:19:43,931
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Lemme, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, President Bears.

1435
02:19:44,112 --> 02:19:46,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none of the negative.

1436
02:19:46,235 --> 02:19:47,056
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

1437
02:19:47,156 --> 02:19:50,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for working on this, and I look forward to you to be able to do this.

1438
02:19:50,461 --> 02:19:51,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, all of you.

1439
02:19:54,420 --> 02:20:23,838
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we will move to 25013, a resolution to discuss policy changes in the building department, be it resolved, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the city council call for an emergency meeting with the mayor and her administration dealing with the halt of overtime for the building department, whereas the building department and building inspectors have legally and historically been called to any call with the fire department or to incidents dealing with building structures and that they were recently informed they will no longer be involved in this process after business hours, be it further resolved that we request

1440
02:20:26,027 --> 02:20:45,229
[SPEAKER_18]: sorry, be it further resolved that we request that the mayor apply with guidance with what department will be overseeing this task, and whereas public safety is our first priority, be it further resolved that we request that the mayor bring in state past practice in dealing with these emergency response processes, and whereas we have learned that the former building commissioner has moved on to another community, be it further resolved that the city council receive a report on why he's still being paid

1441
02:20:45,789 --> 02:20:46,931
[SPEAKER_18]: by the City of Medford.

1442
02:20:47,451 --> 02:20:48,913
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1443
02:20:48,973 --> 02:20:57,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll also note that we did receive a communication from the Mayor and the Mayor is present on Zoom along with the Chief of Staff.

1444
02:20:57,602 --> 02:20:58,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1445
02:21:01,426 --> 02:21:02,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I got to turn you on.

1446
02:21:02,607 --> 02:21:02,868
[SPEAKER_18]: My bad.

1447
02:21:03,648 --> 02:21:03,929
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

1448
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:16,733
[SPEAKER_20]: responses over the last year as we continually struggle to effectively fund our priorities, especially our school priorities due to the cost of inflation.

1449
02:21:16,853 --> 02:21:22,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Our administration has continued the process of reviewing department overtime budgets and procedures.

1450
02:21:22,791 --> 02:21:40,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Since February 2024 especially, I've been focusing on OT even more and working with all department heads that have OT line items in their budget to make sure all public funds are being used the best way possible and to make sure there is not misuse or overuse of such funds.

1451
02:21:41,289 --> 02:21:50,552
[SPEAKER_20]: The city's obligation to fund overtime is necessary to ensure the general public's safety, fulfill contractual obligations, and for the efficient operations of our community.

1452
02:21:50,872 --> 02:22:00,754
[SPEAKER_20]: However, we must be strategic in how the staffing is deployed as the funding resources are extremely limited and there are critical needs throughout our school district and city.

1453
02:22:01,155 --> 02:22:02,635
[SPEAKER_20]: Overtime is a crucial component

1454
02:22:03,075 --> 02:22:05,956
[SPEAKER_20]: of every municipality's budget and operations.

1455
02:22:06,096 --> 02:22:14,599
[SPEAKER_20]: We need DPW crews out on the streets plowing snow, removing trees that block roadways, and other critical tasks to keep our roadways accessible and safe.

1456
02:22:15,039 --> 02:22:17,080
[SPEAKER_20]: Police and fire OT for several reasons.

1457
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:24,602
[SPEAKER_20]: In some circumstances, we need building inspectors to be able to visit homes and make determinations on living conditions.

1458
02:22:25,042 --> 02:22:29,484
[SPEAKER_20]: But we need to manage how overtime is allocated so we don't create a situation

1459
02:22:30,424 --> 02:22:33,786
[SPEAKER_20]: where we're spending taxpayers' money unnecessarily.

1460
02:22:34,226 --> 02:22:45,933
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why we're working with the department heads to develop a policy that enables them to manage their time to their team effectively and implement the overtime procedures that meets the needs of our constituency.

1461
02:22:46,413 --> 02:22:54,577
[SPEAKER_20]: The police department has done a much better job curbing overtime and has lowered the police overtime budget from about $2 million in 2018

1462
02:22:56,710 --> 02:23:01,914
[SPEAKER_20]: to an average number of 1.2 million for the past four years, a reduction of over 35%.

1463
02:23:02,375 --> 02:23:08,559
[SPEAKER_20]: The fire chief and mayor's office, the human resources director, are working diligently on accountability as it relates to OT.

1464
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:17,366
[SPEAKER_20]: As one example, 28 letters have been issued to staff putting them on notice that their sick time use, which causes the need for overtime, seems excessive.

1465
02:23:17,827 --> 02:23:22,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Within the DPW, we hired DPW commissioners to help manage the department, specifically the OT budget.

1466
02:23:24,002 --> 02:23:28,764
[SPEAKER_20]: The topic on the agenda is how overtime is managed in our building department.

1467
02:23:28,844 --> 02:23:35,286
[SPEAKER_20]: We cannot have a union member fielding calls and assigning overtime shifts to themselves and their fellow employees.

1468
02:23:35,786 --> 02:23:38,727
[SPEAKER_20]: That presents a conflict that we made this change over the years.

1469
02:23:39,327 --> 02:23:49,811
[SPEAKER_20]: This did find to be necessary change, especially when almost $50,000 was paid out to overtime during the period my chief of staff was out on maternity leave.

1470
02:23:50,715 --> 02:24:06,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Our current building commissioner fields the calls from dispatch as part of department responses hierarchy and works within the written protocol to determine the immediate life safety status situations in an effort to determine the need for an inspector on scene.

1471
02:24:06,978 --> 02:24:12,659
[SPEAKER_20]: If the situation does not present an urgent need to respond, the commissioner will decline to send an inspector.

1472
02:24:12,999 --> 02:24:17,780
[SPEAKER_20]: The address is tracked and scheduled for follow-up by an inspector the next day.

1473
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:24,364
[SPEAKER_20]: In instances where our commissioner is unavailable, our former commissioner is contacted and makes a determination.

1474
02:24:24,764 --> 02:24:30,227
[SPEAKER_20]: The former commission has received less than a handful of calls over the last year and has paid $60 per call.

1475
02:24:30,648 --> 02:24:39,433
[SPEAKER_20]: The building department continues to develop protocol and the training to fine tune the best possible responses of the concerns and staff welcome construction feedback.

1476
02:24:40,034 --> 02:24:40,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Kern.

1477
02:24:41,594 --> 02:24:41,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1478
02:24:42,435 --> 02:24:47,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, what I've been hearing is nothing what was just read.

1479
02:24:48,632 --> 02:25:09,873
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're seeing right now is practice that we've seen that I believe that our building department, by law, if you indulge me, Mr. President, by law, Mass Amendments Building Codes, Section 116.1 Unsafe Structures,

1480
02:25:12,583 --> 02:25:21,591
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hearing that we have concerns with protocol that's now been lifted because of said overtime, as the mayor has stated.

1481
02:25:22,392 --> 02:25:25,074
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're seeing right now, I don't believe is true.

1482
02:25:26,255 --> 02:25:38,366
[SPEAKER_20]: What I'm seeing right now is that our building inspectors who historically have gone out and not used the overtime that's been stated for overuse or misuse,

1483
02:25:39,204 --> 02:25:44,606
[SPEAKER_20]: but because it's standard and it's practice and it's making sure our constituents are safe.

1484
02:25:45,706 --> 02:26:06,572
[SPEAKER_20]: When a structure is put in crisis, whether it's be fire or water or some kind of accident that maybe a car hits a home and it's after hours, our inspectors are called and they're the governing body that comes in to deem that facility safe.

1485
02:26:08,004 --> 02:26:23,914
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're being told now is that we have a protocol in place where, because of financial reasons, we have, that's another question, we have the former director, the former commissioner of the building department still on staff being paid.

1486
02:26:24,394 --> 02:26:31,959
[SPEAKER_20]: It says that he's paid $60 when he's called, but I would like to know what he is paid by still being on the books.

1487
02:26:32,839 --> 02:26:36,882
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if we're hurting for money, there's a question there.

1488
02:26:37,771 --> 02:26:48,263
[SPEAKER_20]: What I've been told is that if the building department isn't called, then the fire department, the deputy on call, will make that decision.

1489
02:26:49,324 --> 02:26:50,966
[SPEAKER_20]: That is dangerous.

1490
02:26:51,427 --> 02:26:56,012
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not the governing body or the body that deems a structure safe.

1491
02:26:57,006 --> 02:27:06,188
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is a huge liability and huge safety issue and concern for our residents and our homeowners and our constituents.

1492
02:27:06,568 --> 02:27:10,348
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're seeing some very, very questionable practices.

1493
02:27:12,129 --> 02:27:18,470
[SPEAKER_20]: I find it very difficult that this mayor is putting this into place with other questionable reasons as we're moving forward, and I'll get to those later.

1494
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:24,731
[SPEAKER_20]: But we have our fire department that is thin as it is,

1495
02:27:25,925 --> 02:27:39,853
[SPEAKER_20]: that if no building department is called for an overtime, which is minimal, by the way, to come in and clear that, there is a trickle down effect financially that harms our community even more than any overtime.

1496
02:27:40,834 --> 02:27:42,915
[SPEAKER_20]: You're asking for our firefighters to come down.

1497
02:27:43,555 --> 02:27:49,239
[SPEAKER_20]: You're asking for possible detail from the fire department to sit there possibly for four, eight hours in overtime.

1498
02:27:50,099 --> 02:27:54,722
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you're possibly leaving our community in crisis

1499
02:27:55,583 --> 02:28:00,626
[SPEAKER_20]: by the ability not to have an engine back to where it should be, where it's needed.

1500
02:28:00,906 --> 02:28:03,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, it could be possibly at that site.

1501
02:28:04,629 --> 02:28:07,531
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that I don't understand why it's happening.

1502
02:28:08,611 --> 02:28:11,493
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that I find it very difficult to understand.

1503
02:28:12,254 --> 02:28:21,600
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't an organization, a group of people that have worked very hard for this community for many, many years and done so much for us and really just do their job.

1504
02:28:23,132 --> 02:28:30,975
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're seeing some tactics by this mayor that it's very glaring against the working men and women of our community.

1505
02:28:32,316 --> 02:28:36,517
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems like it's very petty, and it seems like it's very vindictive.

1506
02:28:39,438 --> 02:28:48,202
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been told that our building department now has had practice on Wednesday nights, the late evening, that they would have a working dinner as a group

1507
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:55,165
[SPEAKER_20]: with the commissioner for many years, this commissioner, the past commissioners, that they would come in and they would have dinner together.

1508
02:28:57,107 --> 02:28:58,808
[SPEAKER_20]: And that practice has stopped.

1509
02:28:58,908 --> 02:28:59,469
[SPEAKER_20]: What reason?

1510
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:01,370
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know.

1511
02:29:03,492 --> 02:29:17,063
[SPEAKER_20]: But for the ability to have your commissioners there, when a constituent comes in and has the ability to talk to any one of the building inspectors that they're working with on site, that's a relief.

1512
02:29:18,018 --> 02:29:22,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you're told that these people have to now maybe, they can leave, they can go out for the half hour.

1513
02:29:24,464 --> 02:29:27,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you have constituents that are accustomed to have someone there no matter what.

1514
02:29:28,468 --> 02:29:29,609
[SPEAKER_20]: Now that's gone.

1515
02:29:30,871 --> 02:29:31,291
[SPEAKER_20]: And why?

1516
02:29:32,152 --> 02:29:42,222
[SPEAKER_20]: Could it be that the evening before that this rule was put in place, that the union member was called into the commissioner's office to tell them

1517
02:29:43,140 --> 02:30:05,997
[SPEAKER_20]: that this practice will stop, that they can't have dinner in a common area together, that this practice stop the day after the mayor opened the door and informed these members that if they do not stop a lawsuit that we've been given and we've seen from the Teamsters, that she's gonna go public.

1518
02:30:07,245 --> 02:30:15,271
[SPEAKER_20]: This to me doesn't seem anything to do with overtime and our mayor taking care of this community financially, because that's a joke.

1519
02:30:16,452 --> 02:30:24,979
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're seeing over and over again is the working men and women in this community being treated unfairly and disrespected by this mayor.

1520
02:30:25,599 --> 02:30:35,707
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether it's the DPW being drug tested, whether it's our DPW members of firefighters being followed by private investigators,

1521
02:30:36,747 --> 02:30:37,767
[SPEAKER_20]: or what we hear today.

1522
02:30:39,548 --> 02:30:40,528
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a disgrace.

1523
02:30:40,708 --> 02:30:49,190
[SPEAKER_20]: This is why our community is a mess because our mayor is childish and our mayor is putting her feelings in front of what's right in our community.

1524
02:30:52,291 --> 02:30:55,191
[SPEAKER_20]: So, excuse me, but this is enough is enough.

1525
02:30:55,251 --> 02:30:56,752
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to stop this practice.

1526
02:30:57,012 --> 02:31:01,753
[SPEAKER_20]: It's causing the city to lose thousands and thousands of valuable dollars.

1527
02:31:03,897 --> 02:31:06,098
[SPEAKER_20]: I know we have building inspectors here this evening.

1528
02:31:06,378 --> 02:31:14,342
[SPEAKER_20]: We have other members that are directly affected in this community that have expressed concerns, because there are some serious concerns here.

1529
02:31:16,403 --> 02:31:26,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Because what I'm told, if no one else in the building department or the commissioners don't come out, and again, a commissioner that I don't understand why we're still paying, considering he's the assistant commissioner in Brockton.

1530
02:31:27,688 --> 02:31:30,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Why we have a sitting commissioner that's in his office today.

1531
02:31:31,385 --> 02:31:32,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are we paying that?

1532
02:31:32,406 --> 02:31:34,587
[SPEAKER_20]: We're so worried about financial issues.

1533
02:31:35,228 --> 02:31:36,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Why is it a problem?

1534
02:31:36,689 --> 02:31:38,790
[SPEAKER_20]: But regardless, let's move forward.

1535
02:31:39,551 --> 02:31:41,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's say nobody comes out.

1536
02:31:42,092 --> 02:31:43,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you know who makes that call?

1537
02:31:43,994 --> 02:31:44,854
[SPEAKER_20]: The deputy chief.

1538
02:31:46,215 --> 02:31:53,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I know we have one deputy chief here tonight that will tell you, I hope, that he shares that this is a huge liability.

1539
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:57,903
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something they're not legally authorized to do.

1540
02:31:59,024 --> 02:32:00,485
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're gonna see a practice of what?

1541
02:32:01,866 --> 02:32:04,528
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, structure inhabitable.

1542
02:32:05,449 --> 02:32:07,130
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut it down overtime.

1543
02:32:07,991 --> 02:32:22,281
[SPEAKER_20]: Not because what was said that we're giving people overtime because her rules, her ridiculous rules are forcing our members to waste our city's finances.

1544
02:32:24,323 --> 02:32:27,385
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, Mr. President, this has to stop.

1545
02:32:28,146 --> 02:32:32,767
[SPEAKER_20]: This petty, vindictive, ego-driven negativity has to stop.

1546
02:32:34,347 --> 02:32:35,448
[SPEAKER_20]: It has to stop.

1547
02:32:37,208 --> 02:32:41,949
[SPEAKER_20]: The morale in this community from our workers are a mess.

1548
02:32:43,509 --> 02:32:46,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Go up and down, go through the hallways, talk to the rank and file.

1549
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:50,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, all of you, all of us have been endorsed by unions.

1550
02:32:51,291 --> 02:32:55,052
[SPEAKER_20]: All of us have said that we support union labor workers.

1551
02:32:55,112 --> 02:32:55,712
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we said.

1552
02:32:57,199 --> 02:32:58,139
[SPEAKER_20]: When is enough enough?

1553
02:32:58,559 --> 02:33:01,080
[SPEAKER_20]: When do we all stand together and say this is enough?

1554
02:33:02,441 --> 02:33:06,502
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we've heard it over and over again from the Teamsters.

1555
02:33:07,542 --> 02:33:08,923
[SPEAKER_20]: We've seen it over and over again.

1556
02:33:08,963 --> 02:33:20,306
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been in meetings that we've been informed that we're paying out thousands and thousands of dollars because she is being sued and the city's being sued and they're losing case after case.

1557
02:33:21,753 --> 02:33:24,955
[SPEAKER_20]: When are we gonna wake up and realize, hey, maybe we didn't need an override.

1558
02:33:25,255 --> 02:33:28,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we just need a leader that manages our finances correctly.

1559
02:33:30,859 --> 02:33:31,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1560
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:32,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1561
02:33:34,522 --> 02:33:35,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1562
02:33:35,622 --> 02:33:43,888
[SPEAKER_18]: We did also, since you raised it, we did receive a communication regarding the drug testing at the DPW.

1563
02:33:44,488 --> 02:33:47,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have a Deputy Commissioner French on Zoom?

1564
02:33:49,011 --> 02:33:50,152
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like we might.

1565
02:33:52,726 --> 02:34:10,141
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to unmute you if you'd like to read the email that you sent to us into the record, and then given the discussion we do have the mayor here, and I'd recognize the mayor after that, but Deputy Commissioner, if you want to share that information with us.

1566
02:34:11,021 --> 02:34:12,383
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure, you hear me?

1567
02:34:13,483 --> 02:34:15,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you, and thank you for being here.

1568
02:34:15,525 --> 02:34:16,686
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, thank you for having me.

1569
02:34:17,327 --> 02:34:18,728
[SPEAKER_36]: Just give me one moment, please.

1570
02:34:21,425 --> 02:34:25,693
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we also have the chief of staff and the acting fire chief with us as well.

1571
02:34:54,088 --> 02:34:56,296
[SPEAKER_36]: I apologize, I'm trying to pull it up here.

1572
02:34:56,316 --> 02:34:59,447
[SPEAKER_18]: No worries, we can give you a second.

1573
02:34:59,788 --> 02:35:00,150
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1574
02:35:33,063 --> 02:35:34,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I believe Scott's looking for his.

1575
02:35:34,723 --> 02:35:35,504
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1576
02:35:35,564 --> 02:35:36,925
[SPEAKER_36]: I wasn't, I didn't know I'd be reading it.

1577
02:35:37,085 --> 02:35:41,867
[SPEAKER_36]: I have no problem doing so, but of course I can't find it right now in my, I have it.

1578
02:35:41,927 --> 02:35:42,307
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1579
02:35:42,327 --> 02:35:48,271
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he just found that he's going to read it.

1580
02:35:49,571 --> 02:35:50,392
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I appreciate it.

1581
02:35:50,412 --> 02:35:50,732
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1582
02:35:50,752 --> 02:35:52,073
[SPEAKER_36]: Someone just emailed it.

1583
02:35:52,093 --> 02:35:53,113
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's the top of my inbox.

1584
02:35:53,173 --> 02:35:53,473
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1585
02:35:55,094 --> 02:35:56,595
[SPEAKER_36]: Dear president bears and city council.

1586
02:35:57,495 --> 02:36:01,498
[SPEAKER_36]: I wanted to write to explain the drug testing that transpired in December 9, 2024.

1587
02:36:02,179 --> 02:36:05,281
[SPEAKER_36]: Testing protocol that took place at approximately 1230 p.m.

1588
02:36:05,341 --> 02:36:16,109
[SPEAKER_36]: on Monday, December 9, 2024 was a result of the discovery of a hypodermic syringe on top of and inside the DPW men's locker room trash barrel earlier that morning by a union employee.

1589
02:36:16,943 --> 02:36:29,367
[SPEAKER_36]: Not only was the discovery itself concerning, but the fact it was thrown into a regular trash barrel indicated that whoever had put it there was not educated in the proper disposal of sharps, and therefore it was unlikely to be a medically prescribed needle.

1590
02:36:30,408 --> 02:36:36,990
[SPEAKER_36]: This was the latest example of a series of possible drug-related incidents to occur in the DPW over the past several months.

1591
02:36:37,770 --> 02:36:46,113
[SPEAKER_36]: Just prior to the December 9 incident, it was reported that other drug paraphernalia had been discovered a week or two prior to in a DPW vehicle.

1592
02:36:47,170 --> 02:36:58,580
[SPEAKER_36]: Additionally, there have been anonymous reporting from DPW employees to City Hall with claims and concerns of DPW employee drug use during work hours and the subsequent operation of City vehicles and equipment.

1593
02:36:59,981 --> 02:37:09,248
[SPEAKER_36]: Due to the safety-sensitive nature of our work, operating heavy equipment and heavy-duty vehicles, there is an extreme risk to both employees and the public from workers being under the influence.

1594
02:37:10,071 --> 02:37:21,898
[SPEAKER_36]: In fact, over the past nine months, there have been dozens of equipment and vehicle damage incidents, underscoring the need to be proactive in our oversight and management of employees, as well as the need to develop a more comprehensive internal policy.

1595
02:37:22,598 --> 02:37:27,561
[SPEAKER_36]: We've also been contacted by our insurance broker due to their concern as it relates to accident volume.

1596
02:37:29,302 --> 02:37:38,148
[SPEAKER_36]: Only city employees that were present at the facility that morning were tested via standard DOT drug testing rapid test, including myself, the deputy commissioner.

1597
02:37:39,082 --> 02:37:42,044
[SPEAKER_36]: I went first to see the process that we were having employees go through.

1598
02:37:42,564 --> 02:37:49,769
[SPEAKER_36]: The contractor that performed the testing was licensed to perform such work, and the mobile facility that was used met industry standards for such testing.

1599
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:55,653
[SPEAKER_36]: The muster room was used as a waiting room as employees went one by one into the testing van for an observed test.

1600
02:37:56,333 --> 02:38:01,937
[SPEAKER_36]: The testing van consisted of a purpose-built stall in the back with a toilet and a privacy wall slash barrier.

1601
02:38:03,138 --> 02:38:07,281
[SPEAKER_36]: The tester had a workbench area with a sink, soap, hand sanitizer, gloves, et cetera.

1602
02:38:08,015 --> 02:38:15,117
[SPEAKER_36]: And the process is virtually identical to all workplace drug testing procedures I have been involved in throughout my career in public works and utilities.

1603
02:38:15,997 --> 02:38:32,261
[SPEAKER_36]: To add a bit more context to the decision to perform the testing that day, Lisa Crowley and our HR department notified me that morning, shortly after the discovery of the syringe, that Brian Hatcher of the Teamsters had told her that same morning that the DPW was a mess, that there had been needles found,

1604
02:38:32,873 --> 02:38:36,516
[SPEAKER_36]: at the DPW and that there was an alarming number of accidents occurring.

1605
02:38:37,156 --> 02:38:42,920
[SPEAKER_36]: This was especially concerning to me because he often hears of issues from different avenues than I do naturally.

1606
02:38:43,621 --> 02:38:47,224
[SPEAKER_36]: And it corroborated the anonymous reports to city hall from DPW employees.

1607
02:38:48,605 --> 02:38:52,568
[SPEAKER_36]: I want to emphasize there were no accusations or prejudgments being made of anyone here.

1608
02:38:53,328 --> 02:39:01,254
[SPEAKER_36]: I was not pleased that the discovery of such items had occurred in our facilities or that our own workforce and their union representation had voiced such allegations and concerns.

1609
02:39:02,031 --> 02:39:04,953
[SPEAKER_36]: Our administration takes these incidents and claims extremely seriously.

1610
02:39:05,513 --> 02:39:08,055
[SPEAKER_36]: The wellbeing and safety of our staff and the public are paramount.

1611
02:39:08,775 --> 02:39:15,179
[SPEAKER_36]: I felt that this process would help to identify if we did have an issue here and with who, and we could address it properly and safely.

1612
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:22,283
[SPEAKER_36]: I honestly believe that any of our workforce acting in good faith would agree that they do not want their coworkers working under the influence.

1613
02:39:22,784 --> 02:39:27,947
[SPEAKER_36]: And that due to the circumstances here, the city did what it could to ensure they were all safe as well as the public.

1614
02:39:28,767 --> 02:39:30,068
[SPEAKER_36]: There was nothing punitive about it,

1615
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:32,400
[SPEAKER_36]: On the contrary, it was for everyone's safety.

1616
02:39:33,821 --> 02:39:37,103
[SPEAKER_36]: This is the necessary, but not so fun part of this line of work.

1617
02:39:37,724 --> 02:39:41,406
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't want this to take away from the great work this department and the city does.

1618
02:39:42,026 --> 02:39:43,787
[SPEAKER_36]: It is just a reality of our industry.

1619
02:39:44,708 --> 02:39:45,428
[SPEAKER_36]: Thanks for your time.

1620
02:39:45,568 --> 02:39:47,970
[SPEAKER_36]: I hope this was helpful for your understanding of the situation.

1621
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:50,451
[SPEAKER_36]: Scott Brink, deputy commissioner.

1622
02:39:51,952 --> 02:39:53,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, deputy commissioner.

1623
02:39:53,453 --> 02:39:59,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, I'm gonna recognize the mayor or the DPW commissioner, whichever one would like to speak next.

1624
02:40:03,362 --> 02:40:06,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I see the mayor, and I'll recognize the mayor.

1625
02:40:06,724 --> 02:40:07,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for being here.

1626
02:40:11,188 --> 02:40:12,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears.

1627
02:40:12,449 --> 02:40:13,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

1628
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:14,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1629
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears and the City Council for allowing us to be here tonight.

1630
02:40:20,915 --> 02:40:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: With me is Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, Human Resource Director Lisa Crowley, DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern, and you just heard from Scott Brink, who is our

1631
02:40:33,252 --> 02:40:34,072
[SPEAKER_02]: deputy commissioner.

1632
02:40:34,272 --> 02:40:38,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have, um, Chief Evans is on the call.

1633
02:40:38,613 --> 02:40:40,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I know OT is on the agenda.

1634
02:40:41,714 --> 02:40:46,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Scott van der Waal, our building commissioner, is away on vacation today.

1635
02:40:46,095 --> 02:40:51,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he comes back tomorrow, but I can talk to the issue.

1636
02:40:53,477 --> 02:40:57,198
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I just want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for reading

1637
02:40:57,697 --> 02:41:05,962
[SPEAKER_02]: the email that we sent today with regards to overtime and what we've been doing, especially over the last year in all departments that have overtime budgets.

1638
02:41:06,882 --> 02:41:14,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna thank you for allowing us to read the email that Scott Brink sent about the drug testing.

1639
02:41:14,287 --> 02:41:18,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to be able to tell our story and tell the facts as we see it.

1640
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:25,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with what Councilor Scarpelli said

1641
02:41:26,021 --> 02:41:33,945
[SPEAKER_02]: with regards to dinner breaks, because I just need to get the facts out there, and I think it's important, because there is another side to that story.

1642
02:41:34,965 --> 02:41:39,647
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a lawsuit that the building inspectors have filed against the city.

1643
02:41:40,868 --> 02:41:43,169
[SPEAKER_02]: They are demanding over a million dollars.

1644
02:41:44,890 --> 02:41:52,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those pieces of that lawsuit is that they're stating they didn't take a lunch for three years, and they're looking for triple damages.

1645
02:41:54,525 --> 02:41:57,146
[SPEAKER_02]: almost $400,000 demand.

1646
02:41:58,406 --> 02:42:09,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So since that lawsuit was filed, we in the city have been actively, over the last six to nine months, actively working to implement timesheets.

1647
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:12,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Timesheets are now implemented.

1648
02:42:12,270 --> 02:42:19,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way to track when an employee comes to work, when they leave for lunch, when they come back from lunch, and then when they check out for the day.

1649
02:42:21,201 --> 02:42:29,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens in private sector and a lot of cities and towns do do it, and it's a way to ensure that our employees are taking lunch and when they're taking that lunch.

1650
02:42:31,066 --> 02:42:33,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Councilor Scarpelli is incorrect.

1651
02:42:33,548 --> 02:42:37,289
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no threats made to any building inspector.

1652
02:42:37,309 --> 02:42:38,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not do that.

1653
02:42:38,670 --> 02:42:43,012
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did do is I did have a meeting with the commissioner that night.

1654
02:42:43,032 --> 02:42:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I went down.

1655
02:42:44,868 --> 02:42:57,991
[SPEAKER_02]: and witnessed everybody having dinner, so we did just say, I did say to the commissioner, please make sure that all breaks, lunch, dinner, are recorded on those timesheets.

1656
02:42:59,691 --> 02:43:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That didn't happen, so our staff, HR director, chief of staff, we just notified Commissioner van der Waal that either the hour needs to be split if they're gonna take a dinner break,

1657
02:43:15,024 --> 02:43:17,206
[SPEAKER_02]: or they need to stop.

1658
02:43:17,366 --> 02:43:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't say stop dinner.

1659
02:43:18,527 --> 02:43:21,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, if you want to take a dinner break, that's absolutely fine.

1660
02:43:21,349 --> 02:43:32,177
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to have to put in your time for dinner as 5 to 6 or 5.30, 6.30, whichever it may be, and obviously work through lunch like the rest of the staff does.

1661
02:43:32,698 --> 02:43:34,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't a don't take a dinner.

1662
02:43:34,259 --> 02:43:43,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you have one hour a day, like everybody else, and that hour just needs to be recorded on the timesheets that we now fill out

1663
02:43:44,485 --> 02:43:45,966
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much because of the lawsuit.

1664
02:43:48,046 --> 02:43:49,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did let them know.

1665
02:43:49,427 --> 02:43:52,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I feel like we have a really good staff down there.

1666
02:43:52,688 --> 02:43:54,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect our inspectors.

1667
02:43:55,049 --> 02:44:06,033
[SPEAKER_02]: They are suing the city, and I believe they were pushed to sue the city, not even realizing what the outcomes would be.

1668
02:44:06,053 --> 02:44:13,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the gentleman's in the audience that tries to get people within City Hall to file different suits against the city because

1669
02:44:14,206 --> 02:44:23,789
[SPEAKER_02]: people love to come to the, or this gentleman loves to come up to the podium and either say, there's too many lawsuits, there's too much spent on attorney's fees, or there's too many settlements.

1670
02:44:26,370 --> 02:44:40,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Making the situation pretty difficult for the administration because if you have somebody actively asking employees or telling employees or pushing employees to file suits against the city, of course the city needs to defend those suits and pay attorneys.

1671
02:44:41,429 --> 02:44:45,414
[SPEAKER_02]: What Mr. Scarpelli is inaccurate about is that we're losing lawsuits.

1672
02:44:46,215 --> 02:44:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not losing lawsuits.

1673
02:44:48,477 --> 02:44:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: We're defending grievances and charges.

1674
02:44:51,641 --> 02:44:55,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is probably one of the biggest lawsuits we unfortunately have.

1675
02:44:55,905 --> 02:45:04,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's stressful for the administration who has to also balance a budget on the resources that we have.

1676
02:45:04,329 --> 02:45:07,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think George Scarpelli said it best.

1677
02:45:09,311 --> 02:45:13,653
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were talking about the welcoming ordinance, it's a question of if we can survive.

1678
02:45:14,034 --> 02:45:15,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we're at in Medford.

1679
02:45:15,774 --> 02:45:16,955
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we did overrides.

1680
02:45:17,635 --> 02:45:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to know that you have a unit being pushed to file suit against the city and we're spending money to defend

1681
02:45:25,817 --> 02:45:33,203
[SPEAKER_02]: one way or another, that's taking money away from other city services, or it's taking money away from our school department.

1682
02:45:33,884 --> 02:45:35,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a tough pill to swallow.

1683
02:45:36,046 --> 02:45:47,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did let them know that they're good people, and I was gonna have to sometime, such as tonight, gonna have to tell the city's story, our story, and what we're going through.

1684
02:45:47,675 --> 02:45:49,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to lay that out.

1685
02:45:50,417 --> 02:45:54,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can take a dinner break, anybody can go home for dinner or lunch, it's just that

1686
02:45:55,262 --> 02:46:01,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single employee that is filling out timesheets that's not a department head has an hour.

1687
02:46:01,623 --> 02:46:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an hour.

1688
02:46:02,443 --> 02:46:06,144
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it whatever way you want, but make sure it's recorded on your timesheets.

1689
02:46:07,424 --> 02:46:21,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as it relates to overtime, there are calls that are placed by the dispatch to our building commissioner, and he and he alone decides whether or not to send an inspector out.

1690
02:46:22,227 --> 02:46:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: There are times when inspectors go out building,

1691
02:46:25,307 --> 02:46:32,509
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical, and there are times where he may say, it's not needed, it can wait till tomorrow morning at 8.30.

1692
02:46:33,269 --> 02:46:35,090
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not up to me, I don't get the calls.

1693
02:46:35,470 --> 02:46:36,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't wanna get the calls.

1694
02:46:37,331 --> 02:46:38,771
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have a backup.

1695
02:46:39,451 --> 02:46:49,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And our prior commissioner, Bill 40, has graciously been willing to stay on in a very, very limited capacity.

1696
02:46:49,974 --> 02:46:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taken four phone calls in the last year.

1697
02:46:52,992 --> 02:46:57,734
[SPEAKER_02]: at $60 a call when building commissioner van der Waals not available.

1698
02:46:58,754 --> 02:47:00,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not on staff.

1699
02:47:00,494 --> 02:47:01,515
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not part time.

1700
02:47:01,695 --> 02:47:09,877
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the backup for when dispatch calls to give the explanation of why a building inspector may be needed.

1701
02:47:10,558 --> 02:47:12,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm completely left out of that process.

1702
02:47:13,318 --> 02:47:18,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our building commissioner, and then it's our prior building commissioner, and one of them will take that call.

1703
02:47:19,471 --> 02:47:32,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is stemming from a call from last week or the week before where our building commissioner did say to dispatch, I don't think we need an inspector at this call.

1704
02:47:33,021 --> 02:47:34,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one time.

1705
02:47:36,583 --> 02:47:41,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for him because he is on vacation, but that was one time.

1706
02:47:41,366 --> 02:47:43,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is stemming from one phone call.

1707
02:47:44,128 --> 02:47:49,192
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no protocol in place that says they will no longer respond.

1708
02:47:49,571 --> 02:47:54,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that one phone call, and I don't fully remember the circumstances.

1709
02:47:54,974 --> 02:48:06,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But the building commissioner is the expert in this field, and he knows when we need to send an inspector and when it can wait till the next morning at 8.30.

1710
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:09,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to set that record straight.

1711
02:48:09,882 --> 02:48:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: My email to you all has been read into the record.

1712
02:48:13,184 --> 02:48:15,725
[SPEAKER_02]: OT is something I do take seriously.

1713
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:30,090
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've been really working with all of our department heads to figure out ways to make sure that we are providing OT to our staff, but making sure it's not misused, making sure it's not overused.

1714
02:48:30,810 --> 02:48:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's something that the public would want us to do.

1715
02:48:35,014 --> 02:48:36,455
[SPEAKER_02]: They want us to be able to budget.

1716
02:48:36,535 --> 02:48:38,096
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanna make sure there's no waste.

1717
02:48:39,076 --> 02:48:44,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So to spin up a story that we are denying our employees overtime is completely false.

1718
02:48:46,011 --> 02:48:47,893
[SPEAKER_02]: millions and millions on overtime.

1719
02:48:48,974 --> 02:48:59,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to get a handle with Chief Evans and Chief Buckley and Building Commissioner Van De Wall and Commissioner McGivern and Deputy Commissioner Brink.

1720
02:49:00,404 --> 02:49:02,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We're asking the questions that need to be asked.

1721
02:49:03,406 --> 02:49:12,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that was on my agenda from the beginning, and I really dug into it the last year, especially after February, to make sure we got a handle on.

1722
02:49:12,614 --> 02:49:13,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something my

1723
02:49:14,421 --> 02:49:16,702
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole administration is really working towards.

1724
02:49:17,363 --> 02:49:19,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our story.

1725
02:49:19,664 --> 02:49:21,265
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the city's side.

1726
02:49:21,445 --> 02:49:22,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the facts.

1727
02:49:22,986 --> 02:49:24,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really thank you for your time.

1728
02:49:25,107 --> 02:49:33,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we can't all always be on the call on Tuesday nights, but I needed to set the record straight on a few of these things.

1729
02:49:34,032 --> 02:49:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Our staff needed to set the record straight because there is always another side to the story.

1730
02:49:38,355 --> 02:49:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry,

1731
02:49:39,946 --> 02:49:42,007
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get in the weeds and tell it every Tuesday night.

1732
02:49:42,067 --> 02:49:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing extremely, a lot of work and it's just very appreciated for the time.

1733
02:49:50,572 --> 02:49:50,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1734
02:49:53,154 --> 02:49:53,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1735
02:49:53,794 --> 02:49:57,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anyone else from the administration who would like to say anything, Madam Mayor?

1736
02:49:59,738 --> 02:50:01,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all here to answer questions.

1737
02:50:01,839 --> 02:50:07,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it up to city staff to raise hands if they have anything to add.

1738
02:50:07,363 --> 02:50:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: but we are here to answer some questions before we head off, and obviously a little bit.

1739
02:50:12,644 --> 02:50:13,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, thank you.

1740
02:50:13,804 --> 02:50:16,825
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will move to questions and comments from members of the council.

1741
02:50:17,265 --> 02:50:19,105
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll start with Councilor Scarpelli.

1742
02:50:19,225 --> 02:50:23,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, everyone else, use the request feature on your microphones.

1743
02:50:24,206 --> 02:50:25,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1744
02:50:25,186 --> 02:50:27,126
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that I have a bunch of questions.

1745
02:50:27,627 --> 02:50:36,168
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that starting with, I believe, Mr. Brinch, is he still on, Mr. President?

1746
02:50:37,381 --> 02:50:48,627
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we have the commissioner, the deputy commissioner of DPW, the chief of staff, I think, and the mayor still, and the HR director, and I think we might have the acting fire chief as well.

1747
02:50:48,887 --> 02:51:06,117
[SPEAKER_20]: So I have talked to the rank and file, and I've talked to many, many members of our union, and I've talked to these members, and the understanding that the fear that they have to speak because of retaliation is evident.

1748
02:51:06,693 --> 02:51:15,662
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor has spoken over and over again how she has come to the City Hall to clean up City Hall as if this is the Wild West.

1749
02:51:16,563 --> 02:51:18,425
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's said we've seen good people hurt.

1750
02:51:20,147 --> 02:51:29,277
[SPEAKER_20]: And we can go all the way back because we were part of those meetings where we see how much money that have been settled on many, many occasions.

1751
02:51:30,074 --> 02:51:31,995
[SPEAKER_20]: So we understand that we are losing money.

1752
02:51:32,055 --> 02:51:41,661
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a reason why these union members that have the right to file grievances because they feel that they're being treated unfairly.

1753
02:51:42,482 --> 02:51:57,911
[SPEAKER_20]: And when it goes through the process, the reason why we're losing so much money is because this administration has over and over again gone after our union workers without true facts,

1754
02:51:58,829 --> 02:51:59,830
[SPEAKER_20]: and true understanding.

1755
02:52:00,550 --> 02:52:11,139
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is why we're losing thousands of dollars, both in legal fees for lawyers to represent the mayor and for settlements.

1756
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:28,133
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we talk about this letter that was read by the assistant commissioner, the deputy commissioner, my question to him real quick, he started saying things that this was done, this action was taken,

1757
02:52:28,894 --> 02:52:38,082
[SPEAKER_20]: with lining up our employees and going into a drug truck, testing truck, like a herd of animals.

1758
02:52:39,163 --> 02:52:45,788
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they got calls from their wives, not them, how disgusted they were that they were treated that way.

1759
02:52:46,028 --> 02:52:47,169
[SPEAKER_20]: There's protocols in place.

1760
02:52:47,409 --> 02:52:51,913
[SPEAKER_20]: There are laws in place when you talk about drug use in the community.

1761
02:52:52,193 --> 02:52:57,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you hit the great buzzwords and how you're there to protect and make sure that our city's safe.

1762
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Or are we?

1763
02:52:59,861 --> 02:53:09,723
[SPEAKER_20]: It says in your own letter that it was put forth to the HR department and yourself months ahead of time that there was some concerns about drug use and drug issues.

1764
02:53:10,484 --> 02:53:11,104
[SPEAKER_20]: What was done?

1765
02:53:12,804 --> 02:53:21,247
[SPEAKER_20]: And then when it came to this syringe, when it came to this one syringe, you're talking about a public bathroom that's used by everyone.

1766
02:53:22,327 --> 02:53:26,188
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe the protocol that's in place by law and by statute

1767
02:53:27,029 --> 02:53:36,216
[SPEAKER_20]: and by union rules, is that the two administrators in that department have to identify employees that might be under the influence.

1768
02:53:36,536 --> 02:53:40,058
[SPEAKER_20]: And then that gives them the course to go to get drug tested.

1769
02:53:40,379 --> 02:53:41,279
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not what we saw.

1770
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:56,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, we saw, we heard and witnessed that our employees vindictively were taken out of the streets that were working,

1771
02:53:57,114 --> 02:54:00,095
[SPEAKER_20]: lined up and given drug tests and alcohol tests.

1772
02:54:01,735 --> 02:54:02,936
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are interesting questions.

1773
02:54:02,976 --> 02:54:14,979
[SPEAKER_20]: But more importantly, we have members that that are here tonight that aren't afraid to come here and shed the truth of why this resolution came up and why I had to share this.

1774
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:17,360
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the mayor talks about public safety.

1775
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:20,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Public safety is in the changes you've just made.

1776
02:54:23,214 --> 02:54:27,558
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll have other questions too, why Mr. Foti is even still working for the city of Medford.

1777
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:40,028
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I can, I'd rather yield to the podium, Mr. President, because we have union members that can answer a lot of these questions, because what the mayor said isn't true.

1778
02:54:42,470 --> 02:54:43,131
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not true.

1779
02:54:43,151 --> 02:54:50,637
[SPEAKER_20]: These members have told me over and over again, different members, some afraid to come to this podium, some are here right now that can answer those questions.

1780
02:54:50,937 --> 02:54:51,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1781
02:54:51,800 --> 02:54:52,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1782
02:54:52,301 --> 02:54:54,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So we had questions for the administration.

1783
02:54:57,991 --> 02:55:00,976
[SPEAKER_18]: If I mischaracterize, I'm just going to repeat them just so that we get them across.

1784
02:55:01,016 --> 02:55:01,778
[SPEAKER_18]: We had one for DPW.

1785
02:55:04,463 --> 02:55:10,986
[SPEAKER_18]: director and deputy commissioner and deputy commissioner, which was what was done about drug issues in the DPW before the drug testing occurred.

1786
02:55:11,246 --> 02:55:14,008
[SPEAKER_20]: They said that months before they were identified.

1787
02:55:14,068 --> 02:55:15,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Was the policy followed?

1788
02:55:16,148 --> 02:55:17,789
[SPEAKER_18]: And I see the mayor's hand on that.

1789
02:55:17,809 --> 02:55:24,492
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I had another question that we'll go to that after, but I'll go to the mayor and then if the commissioner or deputy commissioner wanna follow up.

1790
02:55:26,233 --> 02:55:26,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Mayor.

1791
02:55:27,073 --> 02:55:28,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears.

1792
02:55:29,674 --> 02:55:30,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime somebody

1793
02:55:31,513 --> 02:55:36,278
[SPEAKER_02]: from within DPW has come to me with concerns about drug use.

1794
02:55:36,818 --> 02:55:40,762
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been about the past.

1795
02:55:40,802 --> 02:55:45,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Like two weeks ago, there was an this happened or that happened.

1796
02:55:46,174 --> 02:56:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: As of recent, I was told that there was needle caps found in the vehicles and that people were driving under the influence, alleged people driving under the influence, and they were very concerned.

1797
02:56:05,066 --> 02:56:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was about things that have happened within the past month.

1798
02:56:08,388 --> 02:56:12,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't something that I was told the day of.

1799
02:56:12,531 --> 02:56:22,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We were told the day of, I let the building commissioner, DPW commissioner and the DPW deputy commissioner know, hey, I got this allegation.

1800
02:56:22,857 --> 02:56:24,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you please bring so-and-so in?

1801
02:56:25,378 --> 02:56:26,419
[SPEAKER_02]: This is being alleged.

1802
02:56:26,859 --> 02:56:27,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not the case.

1803
02:56:28,040 --> 02:56:32,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until we found, and I'll let Scott take over, it wasn't until we found

1804
02:56:33,712 --> 02:56:36,513
[SPEAKER_02]: a hypodermic needle in a trash barrel.

1805
02:56:37,373 --> 02:56:44,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't there the day before that we knew that something took place or could have taken place that day.

1806
02:56:44,796 --> 02:56:46,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took action that day.

1807
02:56:47,596 --> 02:56:56,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it over to the building commissioner, but that I just want to explain why past allegations didn't lead to immediate drug testing.

1808
02:56:56,219 --> 02:57:01,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because things were being reported of having been happened within the last week or two or three.

1809
02:57:03,567 --> 02:57:06,429
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll recognize Commissioner McGivern, DPW Commissioner McGivern.

1810
02:57:06,449 --> 02:57:13,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you.

1811
02:57:13,453 --> 02:57:16,214
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably meant to unmute Scott possibly on this one.

1812
02:57:16,234 --> 02:57:21,057
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I will say is I heard the comment about a public bathroom.

1813
02:57:21,518 --> 02:57:24,299
[SPEAKER_10]: That bathroom is not available to the public.

1814
02:57:24,679 --> 02:57:26,320
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have contractors that use the building.

1815
02:57:27,932 --> 02:57:30,993
[SPEAKER_10]: but this was a very limited timeframe as the mayor described.

1816
02:57:31,813 --> 02:57:39,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and it was, believe it or not, it was a limited amount of people because the DPW has obviously different locations.

1817
02:57:39,596 --> 02:57:48,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So nobody at the cemetery was tested, nobody in engineering was tested, just the people that were dispatched from the main James Street facility at 7 a.m.

1818
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:50,040
[SPEAKER_10]: that morning, including deputy commissioner.

1819
02:57:51,161 --> 02:57:51,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1820
02:57:56,582 --> 02:58:01,173
[SPEAKER_18]: deputy commissioner, if you could add to that and also the follow up question of did anybody test positive?

1821
02:58:01,814 --> 02:58:02,055
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure.

1822
02:58:02,496 --> 02:58:04,160
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, well, that

1823
02:58:05,168 --> 02:58:06,748
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a good question.

1824
02:58:06,788 --> 02:58:13,650
[SPEAKER_36]: And obviously, I'm not going to get into, you know, personnel issues, but they they're owed some privacy.

1825
02:58:14,470 --> 02:58:26,153
[SPEAKER_36]: But to answer the question, and it relates to your question as to what we had done prior to this with, you know, some discovery of paraphernalia and some allegations and even some

1826
02:58:26,593 --> 02:58:28,414
[SPEAKER_36]: you know, near miss incidents.

1827
02:58:28,834 --> 02:58:34,497
[SPEAKER_36]: We did do some testing that was brought about by reasonable suspicion.

1828
02:58:34,637 --> 02:58:39,259
[SPEAKER_36]: And we did have one employee test positive and he entered a treatment program.

1829
02:58:39,939 --> 02:58:46,582
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, so that was what happened prior to this more, uh, large scale testing based on the hypodermic syringe.

1830
02:58:47,482 --> 02:58:50,464
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, I think that answers your question, but I'm happy to answer more.

1831
02:58:53,905 --> 02:58:54,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1832
02:58:54,365 --> 02:58:54,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor.

1833
02:58:54,726 --> 02:58:55,386
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably one second.

1834
02:58:57,148 --> 02:58:57,708
[SPEAKER_18]: You're recognized.

1835
02:58:58,349 --> 02:58:58,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1836
02:58:59,049 --> 02:59:09,937
[SPEAKER_20]: So that one person that was identified then with past, was it similar and was that employee the same person?

1837
02:59:09,977 --> 02:59:23,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it would be interesting to see that that one person that was, it could have been carried over because what we hear is, what I've been told by the union members themselves, something they weren't afraid to tell me, that not one person

1838
02:59:24,362 --> 02:59:27,004
[SPEAKER_20]: that were drug tested that day tested positive.

1839
02:59:27,224 --> 02:59:28,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody was negative.

1840
02:59:29,165 --> 02:59:35,108
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's something they told me that I can openly disclose.

1841
02:59:35,368 --> 02:59:36,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Not one person tested positive.

1842
02:59:37,458 --> 02:59:37,598
[SPEAKER_36]: Yep.

1843
02:59:38,038 --> 02:59:43,641
[SPEAKER_36]: So the one person that was positive was probably, it was about, it was about a week prior.

1844
02:59:43,721 --> 02:59:48,083
[SPEAKER_36]: So I don't, I don't think it was related to, to that person.

1845
02:59:48,803 --> 02:59:53,765
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, the good news is that, yeah, everyone, um, everyone ended up negative.

1846
02:59:53,785 --> 03:00:04,490
[SPEAKER_36]: We had a couple that had to go for laboratory testing, um, based off of a false positive or an inconclusive rapid, but ultimately everyone was negative, which I was very, very happy and proud to say.

1847
03:00:05,697 --> 03:00:07,618
[SPEAKER_18]: But the- Thank you, Mr. Deputy Commissioner.

1848
03:00:07,658 --> 03:00:13,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And just I'd like to remind everyone to please let me recognize them so that we don't get into a back and forth.

1849
03:00:15,021 --> 03:00:16,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1850
03:00:17,122 --> 03:00:22,624
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, I think it's important that we understand this policies and protocol, correct?

1851
03:00:22,984 --> 03:00:32,988
[SPEAKER_20]: That the DPW director and his deputy, if it's found that there's drug or alcohol use, they are trained to first observe those people

1852
03:00:34,193 --> 03:00:35,814
[SPEAKER_20]: and then move forward.

1853
03:00:36,794 --> 03:00:48,060
[SPEAKER_20]: So that day when we had 35 members in a line to get drug tested, in your professional opinion, did you identify them to be under the influence?

1854
03:00:50,381 --> 03:00:53,963
[SPEAKER_36]: No, that wasn't what the reasonable suspicion was based on in this event.

1855
03:00:54,784 --> 03:00:56,805
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm recognizing you, Deputy Commissioner, if you could answer now.

1856
03:00:57,285 --> 03:00:57,945
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, okay, sorry.

1857
03:00:58,426 --> 03:01:03,088
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, so no, that wasn't what the reasonable suspicion was based on during that event.

1858
03:01:07,859 --> 03:01:19,305
[SPEAKER_20]: on this issue, and I don't wanna be the dead horse, but again, we have a bathroom that's used not just with employees, but as said by the commissioner, that is also open for contractors.

1859
03:01:20,365 --> 03:01:29,870
[SPEAKER_20]: We also realize that there are other avenues why people use syringes, whether it be diabetics, whether it be any other medical issues that were legitimate.

1860
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:36,433
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the reason why protocols are put in place that the leadership of that department,

1861
03:01:37,302 --> 03:02:05,256
[SPEAKER_20]: are trained to identify any drug use or alcohol use and then have right and course to move forward and what I've heard and what I've seen it's not didn't happen didn't happen that way and instead we put ourselves out there for another lawsuit and the attorneys that I've talked to because I can't talk to attorneys because we don't have a city solicitor the attorneys that I've talked to and when when the the the the um

1862
03:02:06,750 --> 03:02:14,196
[SPEAKER_20]: the legal document that I showed them to see where we're going to be later in life with this issue, we're in trouble.

1863
03:02:15,717 --> 03:02:20,461
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, that's just one issue, again, of the way we're treating our union members.

1864
03:02:20,561 --> 03:02:35,412
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate that, Mr. President, but I do know that the issue in hand that was brought forth in this resolution was really about the overtime and the fear of public safety with the building inspectors not being able to

1865
03:02:37,159 --> 03:02:43,141
[SPEAKER_20]: do their job as the governing body that's by law that should be doing this.

1866
03:02:43,321 --> 03:02:49,662
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I can, Mr. President, if my colleagues don't have any questions, I know that deputy chief has been waiting patiently.

1867
03:02:50,703 --> 03:02:50,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1868
03:02:51,003 --> 03:02:52,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we had one other question.

1869
03:02:52,223 --> 03:02:58,185
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe Councilor Scarpelli, you wanted to ask why former Commissioner Forty is still working for the city.

1870
03:02:58,225 --> 03:02:59,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct, yep.

1871
03:02:59,425 --> 03:03:03,126
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if the mayor wants to answer that question.

1872
03:03:05,207 --> 03:03:06,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can answer that.

1873
03:03:09,694 --> 03:03:12,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I answered it when I spoke the first time.

1874
03:03:12,735 --> 03:03:17,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Deputy, Commissioner Forty was the prior building commissioner.

1875
03:03:17,836 --> 03:03:29,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he took another opportunity in another city or town and we did not have a commissioner, he did take the phone calls from dispatch.

1876
03:03:30,898 --> 03:03:37,940
[SPEAKER_02]: When we hired Commissioner Van Der Waal, he then became the primary to take phone calls

1877
03:03:38,618 --> 03:03:48,029
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to send out inspectors to calls, and we wanted a backup in case Commissioner van der Waal is away on vacation or doesn't answer the phone.

1878
03:03:48,370 --> 03:03:54,818
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, he does not answer the phone when he's driving, and sometimes he goes away and cannot get to the phone calls.

1879
03:03:55,338 --> 03:03:56,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said before, there have been

1880
03:03:56,974 --> 03:04:03,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I think four times when Commissioner van de Walt has not been available to pick up a call from dispatch.

1881
03:04:03,658 --> 03:04:19,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need a backup listed in dispatch and prior Commissioner Forty is our backup to pick up those calls so that we have somebody other than a building inspector dispatching themselves like we had over a year ago.

1882
03:04:19,767 --> 03:04:22,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a change we made over a year ago.

1883
03:04:22,779 --> 03:04:32,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We now have a commissioner and then the prior commissioner as a backup to dispatch calls if they think that an inspector is needed at a scene.

1884
03:04:33,867 --> 03:04:49,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can, just while I have you before I hop off, I wanna just point out, I know, I believe it was in the email from Deputy Commissioner Brink, but one other issue we've had

1885
03:04:50,097 --> 03:04:57,583
[SPEAKER_02]: being reported was accidents within our Department of Public Works, damage to vehicles and motor vehicle accidents.

1886
03:04:58,264 --> 03:05:05,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one several weeks ago that took place was actually reported by a resident.

1887
03:05:05,730 --> 03:05:16,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only are there needle calves being found in vehicles, reported driving under the influence of employees, and there's been multiple

1888
03:05:16,997 --> 03:05:28,465
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also the hypodermic needle found and several accidents and being reported, including the representative who was in with HR stating there's accidents that we're not aware of.

1889
03:05:28,926 --> 03:05:34,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that circumstances led us to what do we do?

1890
03:05:34,570 --> 03:05:45,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't wanna have to do this, but God forbid, and this is what I think of, God forbid we had an accident with a DPW vehicle, our employee,

1891
03:05:47,247 --> 03:05:49,428
[SPEAKER_02]: hit somebody walking on the sidewalk.

1892
03:05:50,129 --> 03:05:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That type of lawsuit is what we need to prevent.

1893
03:05:54,051 --> 03:06:13,922
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to find a way to make sure we protected our employees, got them help if they need it, and to make sure we got to the bottom of what was in that trash barrel to make sure anybody operating heavy machinery, that day especially,

1894
03:06:15,777 --> 03:06:19,260
[SPEAKER_02]: that we took the proper steps, and that's what we had to do.

1895
03:06:20,901 --> 03:06:21,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1896
03:06:24,263 --> 03:06:25,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1897
03:06:25,945 --> 03:06:30,008
[SPEAKER_18]: And then also, I just want to know if any other councilors have questions, please let me know.

1898
03:06:30,348 --> 03:06:30,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1899
03:06:33,430 --> 03:06:44,959
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be interesting to see if there is a common trend with the person that has identified as having been

1900
03:06:48,179 --> 03:06:52,159
[SPEAKER_20]: caught with being tested positive and the prior incidents.

1901
03:06:52,179 --> 03:07:00,141
[SPEAKER_20]: That'll be interesting to know because if our HR department didn't do that due diligence when it was identified months ahead of time, I think that's a bigger problem.

1902
03:07:00,781 --> 03:07:02,422
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's for that.

1903
03:07:02,482 --> 03:07:07,083
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, the issue at hand is about the overtime.

1904
03:07:08,103 --> 03:07:12,744
[SPEAKER_20]: And the question that you bring forth over and over again is the overtime funding.

1905
03:07:13,772 --> 03:07:15,653
[SPEAKER_20]: and not spending the money wisely.

1906
03:07:16,893 --> 03:07:20,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, you haven't answered the question, why the former commissioner?

1907
03:07:21,174 --> 03:07:23,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I'm sure he's not doing it for $60.

1908
03:07:24,435 --> 03:07:30,536
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure he's still being paid just to be still on call for the city of Medford.

1909
03:07:31,897 --> 03:07:39,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Because no one in all my years, that'll be interesting to know the truth, because it's just not $60 when he's called.

1910
03:07:42,619 --> 03:07:48,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It is it's $60 when he's called so $60 times times four over the year.

1911
03:07:48,842 --> 03:08:05,889
[SPEAKER_02]: He is not paid Any we do not pay the prior building commissioner a weekly paycheck We pay him her backup call, which I believe it could be five, but I'm almost positive It's for or since he took the backup role.

1912
03:08:05,909 --> 03:08:05,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I

1913
03:08:06,749 --> 03:08:08,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so he's not getting a stipend.

1914
03:08:09,330 --> 03:08:16,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Not getting a stipend for being on call or being part of the city workforce still?

1915
03:08:17,492 --> 03:08:17,932
[SPEAKER_20]: No, he's not.

1916
03:08:18,772 --> 03:08:20,353
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, careful.

1917
03:08:20,733 --> 03:08:23,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And I clear up just one more thing.

1918
03:08:23,693 --> 03:08:33,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately when I was told of needle caps being found in trucks and employees worried about other employees, I immediately, I immediately

1919
03:08:34,226 --> 03:08:41,589
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have the emails to prove it, reached out to our human resource director and our building commissioner to let them know this is what's being reported.

1920
03:08:41,889 --> 03:08:57,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't today, it wasn't yesterday, but within the last month, staff are finding hypodermic needle caps in vehicles, and they're worried about their fellow employees, and they obviously want us to do something, but we can't do anything today.

1921
03:08:57,856 --> 03:08:59,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is in writing.

1922
03:09:00,217 --> 03:09:03,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are emails sent to city staff.

1923
03:09:04,304 --> 03:09:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: that.

1924
03:09:04,444 --> 03:09:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that Councilor Newton took that very seriously.

1925
03:09:06,666 --> 03:09:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I just want to make that that clear.

1926
03:09:11,069 --> 03:09:11,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1927
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:15,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Um yes, Councilor

1928
03:09:29,989 --> 03:09:37,314
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's not something that's locked, I know for sure, because I went the other day, it's an open bathroom.

1929
03:09:38,434 --> 03:09:45,659
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a lot of questions here, but more importantly, back to the original issue.

1930
03:09:46,479 --> 03:09:58,267
[SPEAKER_20]: We're paying the assistant director commissioner of buildings from another community to come in and pay him even a dollar

1931
03:09:59,036 --> 03:10:08,520
[SPEAKER_20]: while we have union employees that have done this over and over again for years, but haven't gotten a contract for over three years.

1932
03:10:10,621 --> 03:10:20,925
[SPEAKER_20]: So I find this very, very difficult to take when it's something so simple as you're projecting that this is just me trying to save the city money.

1933
03:10:21,365 --> 03:10:22,806
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I'd like to ask you the question,

1934
03:10:23,573 --> 03:10:30,637
[SPEAKER_20]: The evening when you walked in and you saw your employees sitting around a working table where they were working while they were eating.

1935
03:10:33,038 --> 03:10:36,960
[SPEAKER_20]: And they were told to please stop the lawsuit or else you'll go public.

1936
03:10:37,561 --> 03:10:38,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Was that made up too, Madam Mayor?

1937
03:10:38,821 --> 03:10:41,403
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to know this.

1938
03:10:41,483 --> 03:10:42,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not said.

1939
03:10:43,004 --> 03:10:46,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would ask somebody to drop a lawsuit.

1940
03:10:47,266 --> 03:10:50,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, they said, sit down and have some dinner.

1941
03:10:50,388 --> 03:10:52,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I don't take breaks.

1942
03:10:53,300 --> 03:11:21,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, while I have you, because I was supposed to meet with Scott, while I have you, I just want to let you know that I'm dealing with your lawsuit and I'm struggling with it, especially since the council, meaning you and the gentleman in the audience, are going to be before the podium claiming there's too much legal fees, there's too many lawsuits.

1943
03:11:22,850 --> 03:11:27,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in my, I do know, I said to the inspectors, I said, I do know who pushed you to file suit.

1944
03:11:28,694 --> 03:11:30,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, but while I'm struggling to fund a school budget.

1945
03:11:31,909 --> 03:11:40,736
[SPEAKER_02]: This is difficult, and I'm gonna have to go public with the facts, and I'm just, out of courtesy, letting you know, our building commission was present.

1946
03:11:41,177 --> 03:11:45,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I never once asked them to drop a lawsuit, quite the contrary.

1947
03:11:45,300 --> 03:11:53,047
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, well, we don't, we're not, you know, and I said, listen, I know who asked you to file that lawsuit.

1948
03:11:53,667 --> 03:11:58,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they probably told you it was gonna be a quick payout, but I have to defend it here.

1949
03:12:00,310 --> 03:12:03,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over a million dollars.

1950
03:12:03,312 --> 03:12:18,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an $850,000 demand that I got in writing and then additional claims were added on after for things like you didn't take a lunch or you'll want to be paid double time for Wednesdays while they're having dinner.

1951
03:12:19,585 --> 03:12:25,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having people tell me it's not a working dinner, whether it is or isn't, we'll figure that out in court.

1952
03:12:26,749 --> 03:12:44,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just feel bad, I feel bad that we even have to bring their names up when, in my opinion, they're used by the gentleman in the audience so that the gentleman in the audience can say that the city has too many lawsuits against them, the mayor's paying too much for legal fees, or there's too many settlements.

1953
03:12:45,076 --> 03:12:49,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say settlements, and I can only think of one settlement we negotiated.

1954
03:12:49,398 --> 03:12:54,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really, you're inflating the number of lawsuits that we're settling out.

1955
03:12:55,914 --> 03:12:59,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wanna talk about contracts, we've settled them all.

1956
03:12:59,655 --> 03:13:05,517
[SPEAKER_02]: The two union representatives from the Teamsters have been amazing to work with, with contracts.

1957
03:13:05,877 --> 03:13:10,758
[SPEAKER_02]: We've settled almost every single one except the building.

1958
03:13:11,278 --> 03:13:12,979
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a difficult one to swallow.

1959
03:13:13,699 --> 03:13:19,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it was ratified during my time, it was negotiated in 2019, right before an election.

1960
03:13:20,040 --> 03:13:22,061
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the most generous contract.

1961
03:13:22,955 --> 03:13:25,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Our building inspectors are paid more than most of our department heads.

1962
03:13:26,498 --> 03:13:31,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's lucky for them, paid more than our department heads.

1963
03:13:31,722 --> 03:13:36,006
[SPEAKER_02]: But it comes to a point where there needs to be equity within the organization.

1964
03:13:36,866 --> 03:13:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And so building inspectors making upwards of $26,000 a year in stipends, there's a point where I have to say, I can't give you as much as I gave public safety.

1965
03:13:50,057 --> 03:13:50,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't.

1966
03:13:51,783 --> 03:13:53,843
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making more than our public safety officers.

1967
03:13:53,883 --> 03:13:55,664
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making far more than our teachers.

1968
03:13:56,444 --> 03:14:02,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing my best to negotiate contracts and to bring some equity to the organization on so many levels.

1969
03:14:03,886 --> 03:14:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people to be making more than our department heads, I'm trying to level it off a bit.

1970
03:14:10,467 --> 03:14:14,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, we are still in negotiations, and we will try to work through that.

1971
03:14:16,529 --> 03:14:21,490
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm managing as best I can, and we're doing the best we can.

1972
03:14:25,598 --> 03:14:26,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1973
03:14:26,478 --> 03:14:27,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1974
03:14:27,679 --> 03:14:29,079
[SPEAKER_20]: In response, Madam Mayor.

1975
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:32,321
[SPEAKER_20]: You make it sound so simple.

1976
03:14:34,341 --> 03:14:37,002
[SPEAKER_20]: But if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.

1977
03:14:38,163 --> 03:14:41,304
[SPEAKER_20]: We have seen the way the firefighters have been treated.

1978
03:14:42,424 --> 03:14:45,005
[SPEAKER_20]: We have seen the way the DPW members have been treated.

1979
03:14:45,606 --> 03:14:47,686
[SPEAKER_20]: And now the building inspectors that have been treated.

1980
03:14:48,527 --> 03:14:51,848
[SPEAKER_20]: All of them with legitimate issues, because your administration

1981
03:14:52,515 --> 03:15:02,800
[SPEAKER_20]: has done a poor job in following the rules and the guidelines of the union contracts that was set forth as the law of this community and our employees.

1982
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:06,101
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can say you didn't know anything.

1983
03:15:06,461 --> 03:15:13,905
[SPEAKER_20]: You could say that it's one person being vindictive, but there's a common denominator with all of these unions.

1984
03:15:13,925 --> 03:15:16,506
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a common denominator with all of these concerns.

1985
03:15:16,526 --> 03:15:21,048
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a common denominator with all of this money being spent for attorneys and fees and settlements.

1986
03:15:21,741 --> 03:15:22,721
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's you, Madam Mayor.

1987
03:15:23,802 --> 03:15:26,963
[SPEAKER_20]: And the quicker the city realizes it, the better the city will be.

1988
03:15:28,063 --> 03:15:35,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you are dividing this community and you're pointing at the hottest working people that make this city run, not you, Madam Mayor.

1989
03:15:37,867 --> 03:15:38,667
[SPEAKER_20]: So shame on you.

1990
03:15:41,748 --> 03:15:43,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

1991
03:15:43,649 --> 03:15:44,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1992
03:15:47,945 --> 03:15:51,648
[SPEAKER_18]: to go back to the- We'll go to the podium in a second.

1993
03:15:53,149 --> 03:15:55,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any comments by members of the council?

1994
03:15:56,611 --> 03:16:06,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none and seeing nothing from the city staff, I will go to the podium for public participation.

1995
03:16:06,458 --> 03:16:07,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. South, there was someone behind you.

1996
03:16:07,599 --> 03:16:08,720
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to take people in order.

1997
03:16:10,221 --> 03:16:11,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, if that's all right with you.

1998
03:16:13,543 --> 03:16:15,405
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had a hand on Zoom, so I'll alternate.

1999
03:16:16,192 --> 03:16:21,000
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go name and address the record and you have three minutes, Mr. South

1999
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,298
[SPEAKER_29]: Steven South, 106 Damon Road.

2000
03:16:23,558 --> 03:16:30,264
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to make a couple of comments regarding the untrue statements that were just made by the mayor.

2001
03:16:30,964 --> 03:16:34,667
[SPEAKER_29]: So the mayor just said that she's only aware of one lawsuit that's been settled.

2002
03:16:36,268 --> 03:16:38,050
[SPEAKER_29]: Mayor has been in office for five years.

2003
03:16:39,875 --> 03:16:48,162
[SPEAKER_29]: In her time that she's been mayor, the city settled a lawsuit with the 30 Medford school custodians for $495,000.

2004
03:16:49,944 --> 03:16:55,229
[SPEAKER_29]: So she's saying that people are forcing them to file frivolous lawsuits.

2005
03:16:55,769 --> 03:16:58,571
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a lot of money that's just shy of half a million dollars.

2006
03:16:59,232 --> 03:17:04,934
[SPEAKER_29]: The Medford school security guards and monitors, the city settled a lawsuit with them.

2007
03:17:05,014 --> 03:17:07,295
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe it was right around $20,000.

2008
03:17:07,355 --> 03:17:10,916
[SPEAKER_29]: That was under the mayor who's also the head of the school committee.

2009
03:17:12,016 --> 03:17:22,140
[SPEAKER_29]: Just a few months back in 2024, the mayor, this administration settled a lawsuit with the Medford DPW workers.

2010
03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:24,540
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe it was somewhere between 30 and $40,000.

2011
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:39,057
[SPEAKER_29]: The mayor also last year, she was there at the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations as was I with her legal team and other staff members, myself.

2012
03:17:40,278 --> 03:17:42,319
[SPEAKER_29]: She settled the lawsuit with Sandra.

2013
03:17:42,639 --> 03:17:48,823
[SPEAKER_29]: It wasn't actually a lawsuit, it was a labor charge with Sandra Bourbon-Gayle for $47,500.

2014
03:17:48,863 --> 03:17:51,265
[SPEAKER_29]: She was there in the hallway when it was settled.

2015
03:17:51,345 --> 03:17:52,265
[SPEAKER_29]: I was there as well.

2016
03:17:52,546 --> 03:17:54,007
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm sure she's aware of that.

2017
03:17:55,288 --> 03:18:12,243
[SPEAKER_29]: Last year as well under Madam Mayor, Brianna lungo current last year she settled a lawsuit, and a workman's comp claim they combined them with Michael Nestor from the DPW for $265,000 the mayor was involved in that.

2018
03:18:13,484 --> 03:18:17,928
[SPEAKER_29]: Sandra Burbank Gail also has a lawsuit right now for a couple hundred thousand dollars.

2019
03:18:18,869 --> 03:18:21,730
[SPEAKER_29]: talked about the inspectors with a million-dollar lawsuit.

2020
03:18:23,170 --> 03:18:25,331
[SPEAKER_29]: Allison Convoy also has a lawsuit.

2021
03:18:26,311 --> 03:18:29,372
[SPEAKER_29]: The ex, I believe, finance director, Aleesha Nunley.

2022
03:18:30,152 --> 03:18:33,733
[SPEAKER_29]: There's numerous, numerous lawsuits pending.

2023
03:18:34,033 --> 03:18:46,896
[SPEAKER_29]: I know the mayor just said that they're all frivolous, pushed by one person, but it's funny that the city, on top of spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements, is also spending hundreds of thousands of dollars

2024
03:18:47,356 --> 03:18:50,800
[SPEAKER_29]: in legal fees to fight these frivolous lawsuits.

2025
03:18:50,860 --> 03:19:03,494
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just want to make sure that the facts are out there and point out to everybody on this council that everything I just spoke of, I've handed out copies in writing legal documents to support those facts.

2026
03:19:04,135 --> 03:19:05,397
[SPEAKER_29]: So I thank you all for your time.

2027
03:19:05,877 --> 03:19:06,338
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2028
03:19:13,357 --> 03:19:15,458
[SPEAKER_18]: The hand on Zoom has gone down, so we'll stay at the podium.

2029
03:19:15,498 --> 03:19:16,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

2030
03:19:16,798 --> 03:19:17,678
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

2031
03:19:19,819 --> 03:19:21,719
[SPEAKER_24]: Bill Young, Lincoln Road, Medford.

2032
03:19:24,040 --> 03:19:26,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, councilors and fellow community members.

2033
03:19:27,421 --> 03:19:30,422
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm a member of the Medford Fire Department, serving as deputy chief.

2034
03:19:31,442 --> 03:19:39,544
[SPEAKER_24]: I come here tonight to speak on the critical importance of having the building inspectors on call and the immense value to our community.

2035
03:19:40,779 --> 03:19:43,861
[SPEAKER_24]: The fire department's mission is to protect lives and property.

2036
03:19:45,542 --> 03:19:54,167
[SPEAKER_24]: A key partner in this mission are the building inspectors whose roles ensure that structures are built code compliant and safe, reducing fire risks and other hazards.

2037
03:19:55,447 --> 03:20:06,654
[SPEAKER_24]: By identifying issues such as damaged or improper electrical wiring, structural weaknesses, and other hazards, they help prevent emergencies before they occur.

2038
03:20:07,677 --> 03:20:13,320
[SPEAKER_24]: Their work saves lives and reduces the need for future emergency responses.

2039
03:20:14,841 --> 03:20:18,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Emergencies don't follow a nine to five schedule.

2040
03:20:19,224 --> 03:20:29,290
[SPEAKER_24]: A fire related or structural concern can require an immediate evaluation by a building inspector to determine if a structure is safe to occupy or further action is needed.

2041
03:20:30,991 --> 03:20:35,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Their expertise ensures both public as well as firefighter safety.

2042
03:20:36,272 --> 03:20:44,036
[SPEAKER_24]: I have been involved in numerous instances, day and night, where their proficiency has mitigated risks.

2043
03:20:45,036 --> 03:20:49,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Their work gives residents peace of mind, knowing that their homes and workplaces are safe.

2044
03:20:52,319 --> 03:21:00,463
[SPEAKER_24]: This administration is focused on how taxpayers' money is spent and has made it her mission to curb overtime, but at what cost?

2045
03:21:02,584 --> 03:21:04,325
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we put a price on a life?

2046
03:21:07,045 --> 03:21:10,927
[SPEAKER_24]: I urge the council to prioritize the availability of building inspectors on call.

2047
03:21:11,427 --> 03:21:17,349
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not just a convenience, it's a critical part of maintaining safety and resilience in our community.

2048
03:21:18,670 --> 03:21:22,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your time and considering this important, important issue.

2049
03:21:24,232 --> 03:21:27,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Together, we can continue to build and protect a safer, stronger community.

2050
03:21:28,474 --> 03:21:31,355
[SPEAKER_24]: I felt as though I had to come here tonight because I've been, I've seen this.

2051
03:21:31,375 --> 03:21:35,877
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been a deputy for eight years now and I saw how it used to be and how it was.

2052
03:21:36,667 --> 03:21:42,491
[SPEAKER_24]: And I wrote an email to the mayor in November of 23 praising the crew.

2053
03:21:43,072 --> 03:21:43,832
[SPEAKER_24]: They're unbelievable.

2054
03:21:44,633 --> 03:21:48,716
[SPEAKER_24]: I call them nights, weekends, holidays, Father's Day.

2055
03:21:49,417 --> 03:21:52,879
[SPEAKER_24]: And these guys, the inspectors, they do their job.

2056
03:21:53,259 --> 03:21:57,062
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe, I'm not going to read you the email, but it was along the lines of,

2057
03:22:01,031 --> 03:22:02,792
[SPEAKER_24]: like code, but with compromise.

2058
03:22:03,712 --> 03:22:06,233
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, I should say with compassion.

2059
03:22:06,833 --> 03:22:11,115
[SPEAKER_24]: I've seen the way they talk to people and I'm not qualified to make these decisions.

2060
03:22:11,195 --> 03:22:13,195
[SPEAKER_24]: I am not, I'm as qualified as any one of you guys.

2061
03:22:13,696 --> 03:22:19,578
[SPEAKER_24]: So a while back, we were told call the building commissioner twice.

2062
03:22:20,478 --> 03:22:23,239
[SPEAKER_24]: And when you don't get it, reach out to the mayor's office.

2063
03:22:23,619 --> 03:22:29,341
[SPEAKER_24]: So going forward, if this is actually gonna take place, I will call the building commissioner twice.

2064
03:22:30,967 --> 03:22:41,595
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I'm gonna call the mayor's office and anybody on this panel who votes in favor of it, I wanna make sure you guys are aware too, because you guys are as qualified as I am to talk about building construction.

2065
03:22:41,815 --> 03:22:43,276
[SPEAKER_24]: I mitigate hazards, I put fires out.

2066
03:22:44,417 --> 03:22:47,559
[SPEAKER_24]: And I need to know buildings are secure.

2067
03:22:48,319 --> 03:22:55,204
[SPEAKER_24]: We have fire damage, we put thousands of gallons of water in these houses and all sorts of buildings.

2068
03:22:55,985 --> 03:22:58,947
[SPEAKER_24]: And I need to know that they're secure and this crew does it.

2069
03:22:59,853 --> 03:23:01,474
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't even believe it's on the table.

2070
03:23:02,294 --> 03:23:06,236
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the things to her fear was something with the DPW and an accident.

2071
03:23:06,276 --> 03:23:06,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Forget that.

2072
03:23:08,337 --> 03:23:10,058
[SPEAKER_24]: This is where the problem is going to come from.

2073
03:23:10,798 --> 03:23:12,459
[SPEAKER_24]: And I stand nothing to gain from this.

2074
03:23:13,399 --> 03:23:13,939
[SPEAKER_24]: I never did.

2075
03:23:14,500 --> 03:23:16,621
[SPEAKER_24]: When I was told I was calling to, there was,

2076
03:23:18,332 --> 03:23:21,133
[SPEAKER_24]: accusations of trying to get people over time.

2077
03:23:21,313 --> 03:23:26,075
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't make a difference to me if somebody over there is a billionaire and somebody lives in a cardboard box.

2078
03:23:26,175 --> 03:23:28,896
[SPEAKER_24]: I need a qualified person to give me answers.

2079
03:23:29,316 --> 03:23:31,897
[SPEAKER_24]: So money has no bearing.

2080
03:23:32,958 --> 03:23:37,819
[SPEAKER_24]: And now hearing more about the lawsuits and stuff, it's starting to actually, I don't know much about that.

2081
03:23:37,859 --> 03:23:38,920
[SPEAKER_24]: I try and just do my job.

2082
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:43,241
[SPEAKER_24]: But hearing more about it, it's starting to all make sense.

2083
03:23:44,202 --> 03:23:44,782
[SPEAKER_24]: And there was,

2084
03:23:45,694 --> 03:23:49,538
[SPEAKER_24]: There was stuff that she said that is not true.

2085
03:23:50,199 --> 03:23:52,782
[SPEAKER_24]: I have called, I called, I'll give you an example.

2086
03:23:52,922 --> 03:23:57,127
[SPEAKER_24]: I called on a building that is at the edge of the square, that is about a 30 unit building.

2087
03:23:58,536 --> 03:24:02,860
[SPEAKER_24]: And they were doing some roofing, and they didn't attach the floor drain.

2088
03:24:03,481 --> 03:24:05,983
[SPEAKER_24]: I was called because the fire alarm system got wet.

2089
03:24:06,284 --> 03:24:07,004
[SPEAKER_24]: We got an alarm.

2090
03:24:07,225 --> 03:24:07,785
[SPEAKER_24]: We came there.

2091
03:24:08,065 --> 03:24:08,806
[SPEAKER_24]: It was a Saturday.

2092
03:24:09,186 --> 03:24:10,688
[SPEAKER_24]: It was flooded.

2093
03:24:11,449 --> 03:24:17,615
[SPEAKER_24]: I called for a building inspector, and I got refused without even giving any details, flat-out refusal.

2094
03:24:18,095 --> 03:24:21,298
[SPEAKER_24]: And our radios are all recorded, so we can find this.

2095
03:24:22,597 --> 03:24:24,758
[SPEAKER_24]: And I got just flat out refused.

2096
03:24:25,178 --> 03:24:26,038
[SPEAKER_24]: So I had to call back.

2097
03:24:27,159 --> 03:24:31,561
[SPEAKER_24]: It felt like in Austin Powers, you had to ask Will Ferrell the question three times in order to get an answer.

2098
03:24:32,281 --> 03:24:33,482
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't make any sense to me.

2099
03:24:34,462 --> 03:24:36,403
[SPEAKER_24]: So somebody is going to get hurt.

2100
03:24:37,717 --> 03:24:40,660
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's a mistake.

2101
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:43,122
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know more about the lawsuit.

2102
03:24:43,162 --> 03:24:44,283
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, that's none of my business.

2103
03:24:44,643 --> 03:24:45,444
[SPEAKER_24]: But what's going on here?

2104
03:24:45,644 --> 03:24:50,588
[SPEAKER_24]: These people need to be available 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.

2105
03:24:51,169 --> 03:24:52,890
[SPEAKER_24]: I had a car into a building in West Medford.

2106
03:24:53,031 --> 03:24:55,293
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as I was concerned, I needed that lady out of the house.

2107
03:24:55,313 --> 03:24:57,695
[SPEAKER_24]: I was going to have to uproot this poor woman.

2108
03:24:58,235 --> 03:25:00,837
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the inspectors came and realized it was a detached garage.

2109
03:25:01,058 --> 03:25:01,818
[SPEAKER_24]: There was no structure.

2110
03:25:03,416 --> 03:25:09,042
[SPEAKER_24]: I was so relieved that I didn't have to pull this lady out on a cold day because one of these inspectors did their job.

2111
03:25:09,683 --> 03:25:10,484
[SPEAKER_24]: And they do it well.

2112
03:25:11,285 --> 03:25:13,307
[SPEAKER_24]: And you guys really have to think about this.

2113
03:25:13,768 --> 03:25:14,729
[SPEAKER_24]: It's an important issue.

2114
03:25:15,590 --> 03:25:17,692
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're an asset to this community.

2115
03:25:17,892 --> 03:25:18,793
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll always stand by them.

2116
03:25:18,813 --> 03:25:19,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Young.

2117
03:25:19,754 --> 03:25:23,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Deputy Chief, we went about double time there.

2118
03:25:23,158 --> 03:25:23,939
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate it.

2119
03:25:24,841 --> 03:25:30,624
[SPEAKER_18]: gave you a little extra time, but we're just going to move to move on.

2120
03:25:30,644 --> 03:25:31,784
[SPEAKER_18]: But thank you for the comment.

2121
03:25:32,084 --> 03:25:36,286
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, if you guys have any, anything, reach out questions, I'm always available.

2122
03:25:36,626 --> 03:25:37,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2123
03:25:38,087 --> 03:25:42,009
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go to the chief of staff and then I'll go to you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2124
03:25:43,089 --> 03:25:43,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2125
03:25:43,769 --> 03:25:45,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Chief of staff Nazarian, name and address record.

2126
03:25:46,291 --> 03:25:51,693
[SPEAKER_18]: And actually, Madam Chief of staff, before you go, Mr. Young, we're not deciding on this policy as a council tonight.

2127
03:25:51,733 --> 03:25:53,554
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to, you know,

2128
03:25:54,008 --> 03:26:00,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever we vote tonight doesn't actually change what the mayor or the administration chooses to do or the policies that they set.

2129
03:26:00,858 --> 03:26:05,365
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have the ability to set the policy, but we can ask questions, which is what we're doing.

2130
03:26:06,326 --> 03:26:06,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2131
03:26:08,690 --> 03:26:09,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam Chief of Staff.

2132
03:26:10,339 --> 03:26:12,081
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, president bears members of the council.

2133
03:26:12,421 --> 03:26:18,187
[SPEAKER_39]: I just want to be clear about one thing that deputy young said just to make sure that it's stated into the record.

2134
03:26:18,988 --> 03:26:19,909
[SPEAKER_39]: Nobody is content.

2135
03:26:19,929 --> 03:26:26,015
[SPEAKER_39]: The procedure has been stated multiple times that nobody is to be contacting the mayor's office.

2136
03:26:26,175 --> 03:26:27,977
[SPEAKER_39]: The mayor even reiterated that this evening.

2137
03:26:28,577 --> 03:26:32,502
[SPEAKER_39]: The procedure is to contact the building commissioner, and this is through dispatch, by the way.

2138
03:26:32,762 --> 03:26:33,884
[SPEAKER_39]: Individuals do not call.

2139
03:26:33,924 --> 03:26:34,925
[SPEAKER_39]: It goes through dispatch.

2140
03:26:35,385 --> 03:26:41,212
[SPEAKER_39]: This procedure has been stated multiple times and restated, and I'll state it again to ensure that everyone's clear.

2141
03:26:42,153 --> 03:26:45,677
[SPEAKER_39]: There have been written communications that have gone on about this.

2142
03:26:46,567 --> 03:26:53,332
[SPEAKER_39]: that state that the communication shall go through dispatch, and that dispatch will ultimately call the building commissioner.

2143
03:26:53,812 --> 03:27:10,844
[SPEAKER_39]: And as stated by the mayor this evening, if the current building commissioner, Scott Vandewall, who's triaging these things as an expert in the field, is unavailable, the next call from dispatch is to the former building commissioner who's working for the city on a temporary capacity.

2144
03:27:11,344 --> 03:27:15,467
[SPEAKER_39]: Again, the number of calls that have been placed to the former building commissioner

2145
03:27:16,584 --> 03:27:18,646
[SPEAKER_39]: William 40 have been very limited.

2146
03:27:19,346 --> 03:27:19,646
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2147
03:27:22,369 --> 03:27:23,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

2148
03:27:23,309 --> 03:27:24,610
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

2149
03:27:25,671 --> 03:27:29,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Stay young if you can, because that- I don't want to get into a back and forth.

2150
03:27:29,254 --> 03:27:31,516
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not the purpose of public participation.

2151
03:27:31,556 --> 03:27:34,458
[SPEAKER_20]: This is about truth and understanding public safety, Mr. President, so I appreciate it.

2152
03:27:34,478 --> 03:27:40,123
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, then I'll go to Vice President Collins, and then we can come back around to the rules.

2153
03:27:40,423 --> 03:27:44,707
[SPEAKER_18]: We can give another minute after everyone else who wishes to speak in public participation has spoken.

2154
03:27:44,767 --> 03:27:45,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2155
03:27:45,587 --> 03:27:59,577
[SPEAKER_20]: So, so again, this is concerning because, again, if the protocol is the commissioner, and then the former commissioner, and then somebody doesn't, they don't both don't answer, then our deputy chiefs are told that's their purview.

2156
03:28:00,057 --> 03:28:07,302
[SPEAKER_20]: So moving forward to that if it is their purview, and we are concerned about finances, the understanding if we have a fire

2157
03:28:08,112 --> 03:28:19,603
[SPEAKER_20]: firefighter, a deputy chief that doesn't have the bandwidth to call a structure habitable and has to leave it inhabitable, then they have to then do what?

2158
03:28:20,043 --> 03:28:26,890
[SPEAKER_20]: They have to bring in someone, a firefighter for overtime, and then possibly leave an engine at that site.

2159
03:28:27,825 --> 03:28:40,211
[SPEAKER_20]: So from what I gather, I'd like to know the information, how many times so far that our building inspector didn't pick up the phone, and then our former building inspector, who by the way, doesn't live in Medford.

2160
03:28:41,152 --> 03:28:48,515
[SPEAKER_20]: So it'll be interesting to see what that path leads when Mr. Young comes back up, because that's going to be interesting.

2161
03:28:48,815 --> 03:28:54,038
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I like to know the financial impact, and I like to know how many times both people were called

2162
03:28:54,739 --> 03:29:01,521
[SPEAKER_20]: and nobody responded back to our deputies when they've reached out, because I think that's more concerning, Mr. President.

2163
03:29:01,602 --> 03:29:01,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2164
03:29:04,403 --> 03:29:04,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2165
03:29:05,143 --> 03:29:08,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this issue from the public who has not spoken yet?

2166
03:29:13,006 --> 03:29:17,547
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, unless Councilor Collins, do you want to go or do you want to go finish public participation?

2167
03:29:18,748 --> 03:29:19,248
[SPEAKER_18]: We can go back.

2168
03:29:19,288 --> 03:29:21,989
[SPEAKER_18]: We have one minute, Deputy Chief.

2169
03:29:23,388 --> 03:29:25,048
[SPEAKER_24]: said unnecessary spending.

2170
03:29:26,149 --> 03:29:38,111
[SPEAKER_24]: I have never seen anybody from this administration at three o'clock in the morning at any of these calls to make that distinction that this is unnecessary spending that we're calling them and it's not required.

2171
03:29:38,651 --> 03:29:45,492
[SPEAKER_24]: And as far as contacting the mayor's office, I'm not qualified to make these decisions.

2172
03:29:45,892 --> 03:29:49,353
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm gonna err on the side of caution and I'm gonna go the safest possible way.

2173
03:29:50,089 --> 03:29:51,249
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm getting people out of buildings.

2174
03:29:51,449 --> 03:29:54,810
[SPEAKER_24]: If I feel it's unsafe and I can't get an answer, I'm taking people out of buildings.

2175
03:29:54,850 --> 03:30:04,032
[SPEAKER_21]: So the question is, haven't we had issues with the corporate commission, the private commission, the task commission, that we've had issues that no one did not make?

2176
03:30:04,472 --> 03:30:05,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Then who's left to make that decision?

2177
03:30:06,812 --> 03:30:07,312
[SPEAKER_24]: It's us.

2178
03:30:07,492 --> 03:30:08,133
[SPEAKER_24]: It falls on us.

2179
03:30:08,533 --> 03:30:09,473
[SPEAKER_21]: And are you qualified?

2180
03:30:09,593 --> 03:30:10,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Not at all.

2181
03:30:10,673 --> 03:30:11,713
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, I mitigate hazards.

2182
03:30:12,033 --> 03:30:15,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that alone, for one time, is enough to stop this movement?

2183
03:30:16,591 --> 03:30:25,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I will Madam Chief of Staff, I don't know if you want to talk about what the policy is when neither commissioners available.

2184
03:30:27,675 --> 03:30:29,936
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'm not aware of Thank you, President Bears.

2185
03:30:29,996 --> 03:30:33,218
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm not aware of any circumstances where neither commissioner has been available.

2186
03:30:33,298 --> 03:30:36,239
[SPEAKER_39]: Although I will also say that I have not been

2187
03:30:37,239 --> 03:30:39,180
[SPEAKER_39]: working on this very issue directly.

2188
03:30:39,860 --> 03:30:47,562
[SPEAKER_39]: I think if there are circumstances where neither commissioner has been available, there's likely protocol in place.

2189
03:30:47,642 --> 03:30:50,743
[SPEAKER_39]: If there is not, I will certainly communicate that back.

2190
03:30:50,863 --> 03:30:52,383
[SPEAKER_39]: I would be surprised that there was not.

2191
03:30:53,624 --> 03:31:00,266
[SPEAKER_39]: Furthermore, it's imperative that we're not sitting in these meetings

2192
03:31:02,347 --> 03:31:12,838
[SPEAKER_39]: Identifying scenarios that do not exist or may exist where we're working collectively to identify procedures.

2193
03:31:13,339 --> 03:31:22,088
[SPEAKER_39]: I know the mayor has been in multiple meetings over at least a couple of years on this issue, working through with both chiefs and with.

2194
03:31:23,931 --> 03:31:30,773
[SPEAKER_39]: Obviously, the building commissioner to review the protocols for dispatch, including the dispatch supervisor.

2195
03:31:31,093 --> 03:31:38,635
[SPEAKER_39]: This is not a matter that is new, nor is it a matter that has any lack of procedures in place.

2196
03:31:39,095 --> 03:31:44,656
[SPEAKER_39]: If anything, we have to remind staff on a regular basis as to the procedures that are in place.

2197
03:31:49,557 --> 03:31:50,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

2198
03:31:58,604 --> 03:32:00,905
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go, we'll finish the public participation.

2199
03:32:00,925 --> 03:32:03,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to the podium, name and address the record.

2200
03:32:03,966 --> 03:32:05,607
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

2201
03:32:08,368 --> 03:32:12,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Who developed these protocols for this building commission to call back?

2202
03:32:15,290 --> 03:32:16,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody from the fire department?

2203
03:32:17,571 --> 03:32:18,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Or was it the administration?

2204
03:32:19,431 --> 03:32:21,132
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me get this straight.

2205
03:32:22,012 --> 03:32:23,813
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to call a dispatcher.

2206
03:32:24,704 --> 03:32:36,168
[SPEAKER_14]: who could be possibly on the job for a week to contact somebody in their bedroom at 2 in the morning, nobody's on scene to make a determination of whether a building commissioner is going to come on or not.

2207
03:32:36,768 --> 03:32:37,908
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the guy who's on scene?

2208
03:32:38,769 --> 03:32:45,091
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the deputy chief who's actually on location and sees all the hazards and makes that determination?

2209
03:32:45,451 --> 03:32:46,151
[SPEAKER_14]: How about that guy?

2210
03:32:46,651 --> 03:32:48,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he should be able to call the building commissioner.

2211
03:32:49,841 --> 03:32:58,125
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ludicrous to me to have a dispatcher relay the information to a commissioner who's at home in his bedroom.

2212
03:32:59,286 --> 03:33:00,766
[SPEAKER_14]: How many people work for the city of Medford?

2213
03:33:00,786 --> 03:33:02,467
[SPEAKER_14]: A thousand people?

2214
03:33:02,667 --> 03:33:04,108
[SPEAKER_14]: How many people work in the building department?

2215
03:33:04,828 --> 03:33:08,570
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to call somebody who's not even on staff here as a backup?

2216
03:33:09,831 --> 03:33:10,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything worked fine.

2217
03:33:11,472 --> 03:33:16,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Protocols should be developed and maintained and administered.

2218
03:33:17,017 --> 03:33:18,097
[SPEAKER_14]: by the fire department.

2219
03:33:18,358 --> 03:33:20,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd love to hear the chief weigh in on this.

2220
03:33:21,539 --> 03:33:23,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he has some other ideas.

2221
03:33:24,000 --> 03:33:31,423
[SPEAKER_14]: It should not be an administrator, should not be the mayor, should not be anybody in City Hall that has an office job.

2222
03:33:31,963 --> 03:33:37,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be somebody who is in the field, on scene, on location to make this determination.

2223
03:33:38,325 --> 03:33:38,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2224
03:33:41,246 --> 03:33:41,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2225
03:33:41,887 --> 03:33:44,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any further comment?

2226
03:33:44,448 --> 03:33:45,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to the chief of staff.

2227
03:33:49,121 --> 03:33:49,881
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, President Bears.

2228
03:33:49,901 --> 03:34:01,566
[SPEAKER_39]: The only further thing I'll state is that I have had direct conversations with the building commissioner about the very issue that Lieutenant Jones just brought up with regard to scenarios.

2229
03:34:01,786 --> 03:34:09,710
[SPEAKER_39]: If there's additional information that the building commissioner needs, there is a method in which the building commissioner can contact the individual on scene.

2230
03:34:09,930 --> 03:34:10,250
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2231
03:34:13,091 --> 03:34:14,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

2232
03:34:15,686 --> 03:34:20,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion by members of the Council on this item or any further public participation?

2233
03:34:20,070 --> 03:34:25,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2234
03:34:25,815 --> 03:34:29,718
[SPEAKER_42]: Paulette Vartabedian, 27th Central Ave.

2235
03:34:29,838 --> 03:34:33,722
[SPEAKER_42]: This is all new to me, but I'm just going to comment on what I'm hearing.

2236
03:34:35,183 --> 03:34:38,486
[SPEAKER_42]: It doesn't matter as a public

2237
03:34:41,367 --> 03:34:43,628
[SPEAKER_42]: I live here, any person that lives here.

2238
03:34:43,648 --> 03:34:46,490
[SPEAKER_42]: It doesn't matter if it's happened in the past.

2239
03:34:47,630 --> 03:34:56,596
[SPEAKER_42]: The thing is, if it could happen in the future, if it could happen that we don't have someone available, that's an issue.

2240
03:34:57,656 --> 03:35:07,502
[SPEAKER_42]: And the woman that just spoke, she was saying she's not aware of any time in the past that we haven't been able to reach a building inspector.

2241
03:35:08,049 --> 03:35:08,610
[SPEAKER_42]: That's great.

2242
03:35:08,730 --> 03:35:10,072
[SPEAKER_42]: I hope it never happens.

2243
03:35:10,372 --> 03:35:17,343
[SPEAKER_42]: But if it could happen, there has to be some type of policy in place and

2244
03:35:17,873 --> 03:35:25,695
[SPEAKER_42]: If the backup inspector is the backup, is he available 24-7, 365 days a week?

2245
03:35:26,495 --> 03:35:32,557
[SPEAKER_42]: What if he's on vacation and the original building inspector is not available?

2246
03:35:33,477 --> 03:35:34,757
[SPEAKER_42]: What is the policy?

2247
03:35:34,917 --> 03:35:41,859
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, it doesn't matter if it's happened in the past, but if it could happen, we need to be proactive.

2248
03:35:43,239 --> 03:35:43,620
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2249
03:35:44,700 --> 03:35:45,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2250
03:35:47,725 --> 03:35:48,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2251
03:35:48,826 --> 03:36:01,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I would make a recommendation if we can as a form of a motion that we meet with the mayor and her administration to figure out the protocol.

2252
03:36:01,413 --> 03:36:05,296
[SPEAKER_20]: So public safety is paramount in this situation.

2253
03:36:05,676 --> 03:36:15,582
[SPEAKER_20]: But in the meantime, we reinstate the policy that the building inspectors that have been on call for years dealing with what their

2254
03:36:16,354 --> 03:36:20,819
[SPEAKER_20]: charged to do by mass law, that we go back to that practice.

2255
03:36:22,101 --> 03:36:24,864
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be my recommendation, Mr. President, if we can.

2256
03:36:24,884 --> 03:36:26,906
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that an amendment to the resolution?

2257
03:36:26,926 --> 03:36:28,228
[SPEAKER_20]: An amendment to the resolution, please.

2258
03:36:28,468 --> 03:36:28,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2259
03:36:28,908 --> 03:36:29,289
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2260
03:36:33,273 --> 03:36:34,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins.

2261
03:36:39,531 --> 03:36:40,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

2262
03:36:40,992 --> 03:36:43,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the thorough discussion around this.

2263
03:36:43,492 --> 03:36:45,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard a lot of concerns.

2264
03:36:45,033 --> 03:36:48,574
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also heard a lot of context from the mayor and members of the administration.

2265
03:36:48,594 --> 03:36:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna thank the department heads for staying on the call quite late to be on hand to answer questions around this.

2266
03:36:57,378 --> 03:37:03,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on what I have learned so far and heard tonight, I'm not ready to endorse the wholesale return to the status quo.

2267
03:37:04,581 --> 03:37:06,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things I honestly find pretty shocking.

2268
03:37:06,302 --> 03:37:10,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm shocked to hear that a timesheet system wasn't in place for hourly employees.

2269
03:37:10,765 --> 03:37:12,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really glad that's been fixed.

2270
03:37:12,185 --> 03:37:13,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably about 30 years late.

2271
03:37:13,666 --> 03:37:17,869
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that's for everybody's protection, employees included.

2272
03:37:20,951 --> 03:37:34,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on what I'm hearing, it's not clear to me that the new system is any less safe or more expensive, or that there's been cases where qualified decision makers haven't been available, or that it means less availability for qualified inspectors when they're needed.

2273
03:37:35,221 --> 03:37:40,524
[SPEAKER_04]: This sounds to me like a case of new best practices being promulgated by our new building commissioner.

2274
03:37:40,544 --> 03:37:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very grateful that there are contingencies for when Commissioner van der Waal isn't available to field calls, and I find it hard to get angry about

2275
03:37:49,470 --> 03:37:54,351
[SPEAKER_04]: former Commissioner 40 being paid $240 over the past year to be a knowledgeable backup.

2276
03:37:55,371 --> 03:38:00,773
[SPEAKER_04]: With that in mind, I'm gonna find it hard to vote yes on the paper as submitted this evening.

2277
03:38:00,793 --> 03:38:07,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a suggested amendment that I'd like to offer instead, or if the councilor is not amenable to it, I'll offer it as a B paper.

2278
03:38:07,434 --> 03:38:13,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we've gotten some helpful info to serve as context for this issue tonight, and I think it'd be helpful to have it in writing.

2279
03:38:15,056 --> 03:38:16,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So that amendment or B paper.

2280
03:38:17,327 --> 03:38:40,296
[SPEAKER_04]: would be, whereas public safety is a priority for the City Council, be it resolved that the administration submit a report detailing new overtime policies within the building department, as well as a report on current policies relating to building department and fire department hierarchy of oversight and decision making on incidents involving building structures after business hours, along with written answers to Councilor Scarpelli's questions.

2281
03:38:41,137 --> 03:38:41,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2282
03:38:46,963 --> 03:38:51,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Collins, if you have that in writing, could you submit that to the clerk?

2283
03:38:53,068 --> 03:38:53,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2284
03:38:54,009 --> 03:39:00,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you read that again, Councilor Collins?

2285
03:39:10,663 --> 03:39:10,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2286
03:39:11,143 --> 03:39:11,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll read it again.

2287
03:39:12,644 --> 03:39:34,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas public safety is a priority for the city council, be it resolved that the administration support, submit a report detailing new overtime policies within the building department, as well as a report on current policies relating to building department and fire department hierarchy of oversight and decision-making on incidents involving building structures after business hours, along with written answers to your questions.

2288
03:39:51,223 --> 03:39:53,004
[SPEAKER_20]: I would not yield my paper.

2289
03:39:53,345 --> 03:39:55,826
[SPEAKER_20]: If my councilors want to vote no on that, so be it.

2290
03:39:55,906 --> 03:40:01,310
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think right now, public safety is imminent right now, waiting for a report to later

2291
03:40:02,409 --> 03:40:04,912
[SPEAKER_20]: we might be regretting that, and I don't want that ever to happen.

2292
03:40:04,952 --> 03:40:11,280
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for putting that forth, but I would not take place of my amendment.

2293
03:40:11,620 --> 03:40:13,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll submit it as a B paper instead.

2294
03:40:13,362 --> 03:40:14,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for considering.

2295
03:40:15,545 --> 03:40:18,349
[SPEAKER_18]: And just to be clear, we do not have the authority to change this policy.

2296
03:40:20,066 --> 03:40:38,494
[SPEAKER_20]: We understand, but I think where I'm asking for a vote is that this council asked the mayor to please implement what has been done in past practice to assure public safety immediately until we hear what Councilor Collins just mentioned as a very viable second option or follow-up option.

2297
03:40:39,055 --> 03:40:42,876
[SPEAKER_20]: So that would be my recommendation, but we'll leave it to the vote.

2298
03:40:43,357 --> 03:40:43,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2299
03:40:44,237 --> 03:40:47,078
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have the B paper as read by Councilor Collins and

2300
03:40:49,858 --> 03:40:59,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scrappelli, would it be fair to say that your original paper is now just be it resolved that we request that the mayor reinstate past practice in dealing with these emergency response processes?

2301
03:41:00,806 --> 03:41:06,149
[SPEAKER_20]: With the presentation of the mayor and her staff to answer all these questions, that would be fair.

2302
03:41:06,189 --> 03:41:07,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2303
03:41:07,090 --> 03:41:07,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2304
03:41:07,570 --> 03:41:09,572
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the B paper and the A paper.

2305
03:41:13,895 --> 03:41:16,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Any further discussion by members of the council on either paper?

2306
03:41:19,216 --> 03:41:20,537
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have public participation.

2307
03:41:23,078 --> 03:41:25,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record.

2308
03:41:25,379 --> 03:41:26,579
[SPEAKER_18]: You have three minutes.

2309
03:41:27,139 --> 03:41:29,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle Marcellino, local 1032 president.

2310
03:41:29,220 --> 03:41:30,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at 11 Spencer Road in Medford.

2311
03:41:31,161 --> 03:41:32,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a point of information.

2312
03:41:32,242 --> 03:41:37,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like everybody has an understanding that we are not able to get someone on the phone.

2313
03:41:38,204 --> 03:41:40,065
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that we're not able to get somebody on the phone.

2314
03:41:40,105 --> 03:41:47,668
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that we are being told no on scene at an emergency, that we are not gonna get an inspector out to help clarify that emergency.

2315
03:41:48,428 --> 03:42:05,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have companies, crews, deputies, everybody is there because of some sort of catastrophic issue with one of our citizens and somebody not on scene is conveying information that they got via the radio to somebody on the phone who is probably in bed and also not on scene.

2316
03:42:06,428 --> 03:42:23,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're making a decision about the emergency situation that we're all trying to, you know, mitigate for the what I was told last week was the elderly, the woman that was dealing with her, caring for her 90 year old mother in the home and they may have had to been taken from the home.

2317
03:42:23,838 --> 03:42:28,881
[SPEAKER_06]: They were hoping to get an inspector out to be able to mitigate that situation or at least tell them that it was safe to be there.

2318
03:42:29,401 --> 03:42:36,725
[SPEAKER_06]: We had deputies on scene for two and a half hours trying to help them get ServPro to help clear up water damage, things like that.

2319
03:42:37,106 --> 03:42:40,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are not things that we have, that's not our purview.

2320
03:42:41,448 --> 03:42:55,941
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of see it we've seen the building inspectors do it so we sort of have an idea but we're not the licensed professionals to be able to make calls to say yes you can stay in this house even though the water's been on or has been pouring out of you know a large

2321
03:42:56,767 --> 03:43:00,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Maine or whatever in your home for however long, we can't make those calls.

2322
03:43:01,069 --> 03:43:05,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're being told, no, you're not getting anybody out to do with this inspection.

2323
03:43:05,912 --> 03:43:09,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be done tomorrow morning by someone who has not seen the scene.

2324
03:43:09,534 --> 03:43:10,675
[SPEAKER_06]: They have not seen anything.

2325
03:43:10,695 --> 03:43:12,416
[SPEAKER_06]: They have not talked to our deputies on scene.

2326
03:43:12,856 --> 03:43:15,358
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just making these determinations from bed.

2327
03:43:16,278 --> 03:43:18,199
[SPEAKER_06]: or you know from home at some point.

2328
03:43:18,259 --> 03:43:20,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not not being disrespectful about them being at home.

2329
03:43:21,161 --> 03:43:25,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It's frustrating for us because we aren't able to care for our citizens the way that we always have.

2330
03:43:26,485 --> 03:43:35,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Making sure that they're safe in their home, making sure that they can stay there overnight, making sure their heat's okay, everything on these like awful really cold nights.

2331
03:43:35,631 --> 03:43:40,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're asking that we are able to get somebody out there on the I can't even

2332
03:43:41,294 --> 03:43:42,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Billy?

2333
03:43:42,334 --> 03:43:43,055
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times?

2334
03:43:43,155 --> 03:43:43,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't even tell you.

2335
03:43:43,895 --> 03:43:51,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't be more than a dozen times in the past couple of years that we've had to call somebody out in the middle of the night at these after-hour issues.

2336
03:43:51,739 --> 03:43:54,680
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't be that many times that it's breaking the budget.

2337
03:43:55,300 --> 03:44:05,745
[SPEAKER_06]: But that one time that we don't get that person out, and that we have a resident that dies in their home or it's in some catastrophic accident because we don't have an inspector on scene,

2338
03:44:06,585 --> 03:44:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going to be the cost and that's going to be the time that this all changes.

2339
03:44:09,887 --> 03:44:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's disgusting to me to think that this is the stuff that the city is waiting for to happen or we don't think it's that important yet until something like that happens.

2340
03:44:19,025 --> 03:44:29,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping that maybe we can try to get together and work something out so that we can get somebody out on scene when we actually feel, I mean, we're the emergency professionals.

2341
03:44:29,614 --> 03:44:36,740
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for the building professionals to come out and try to help us out so that we can get our citizens safe and cared for in their homes.

2342
03:44:37,721 --> 03:44:38,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2343
03:44:38,642 --> 03:44:39,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

2344
03:44:39,022 --> 03:44:42,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Danielle, if you don't mind, I actually have a question for you for a second.

2345
03:44:45,549 --> 03:44:48,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, the council doesn't make these determinations.

2346
03:44:48,570 --> 03:44:49,850
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand.

2347
03:44:50,571 --> 03:44:53,832
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to just clarify for my own understanding.

2348
03:44:56,312 --> 03:44:59,753
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, a call would go out through dispatch.

2349
03:44:59,993 --> 03:45:04,115
[SPEAKER_18]: The building commissioner or the former commissioner, if the building commissioner is not available, would answer.

2350
03:45:04,715 --> 03:45:07,616
[SPEAKER_18]: And they would make a determination about what their staff would do.

2351
03:45:08,756 --> 03:45:14,638
[SPEAKER_18]: And the prior policy was that the staff themselves would make a decision about who would go out to this, if they would go out to the site or not.

2352
03:45:15,185 --> 03:45:18,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We would call, and they would come out because we were asking for them.

2353
03:45:18,449 --> 03:45:18,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2354
03:45:18,949 --> 03:45:21,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we've determined that there was an emergency on the scene.

2355
03:45:21,833 --> 03:45:21,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2356
03:45:22,453 --> 03:45:22,714
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

2357
03:45:23,234 --> 03:45:29,161
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you would, I guess, in the past practice, you would call the individual cell phone number of one of the inspectors.

2358
03:45:29,561 --> 03:45:35,488
[SPEAKER_06]: There was, I believe, there was a time before dispatch was calling out.

2359
03:45:36,569 --> 03:45:41,991
[SPEAKER_06]: that we were able to call either there was somebody that was on call or there was somebody that was like a foreman.

2360
03:45:42,131 --> 03:45:43,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not 100% sure.

2361
03:45:43,231 --> 03:45:45,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't, I'm sort of a new officer.

2362
03:45:45,832 --> 03:45:48,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I'm also not the one making those calls.

2363
03:45:48,353 --> 03:45:49,253
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always our deputies.

2364
03:45:49,373 --> 03:45:56,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't exactly know how we got a building inspector out in the past, but I know that anytime we needed one, we got them.

2365
03:45:56,896 --> 03:46:02,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Deputy Young mentioned, they come out in these ungodly time period times.

2366
03:46:02,818 --> 03:46:03,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the worst weather.

2367
03:46:03,858 --> 03:46:05,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and they will always like,

2368
03:46:05,999 --> 03:46:08,480
[SPEAKER_06]: on the spot within 10 minutes.

2369
03:46:09,241 --> 03:46:12,943
[SPEAKER_06]: We always felt like they were the best people to call.

2370
03:46:12,983 --> 03:46:17,425
[SPEAKER_06]: If you needed to call the building, you knew somebody was coming for you because they were going to be there in about 10 minutes.

2371
03:46:18,285 --> 03:46:19,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it ended up changing

2372
03:46:20,427 --> 03:46:25,229
[SPEAKER_06]: about a year ago that we had to call dispatch, which is fine.

2373
03:46:25,609 --> 03:46:29,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And dispatch would be the one to go out through the appropriate channels, again, which is fine.

2374
03:46:30,050 --> 03:46:32,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's, A, delaying things.

2375
03:46:32,992 --> 03:46:36,413
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, if we have to go to dispatch, that is what it is.

2376
03:46:37,353 --> 03:46:41,695
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we're being told is that from dispatch, we're playing telephone.

2377
03:46:41,935 --> 03:46:48,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Dispatch is telling the commissioner, and then the commissioner is making a determination, having no information from the actual source on scene.

2378
03:46:48,839 --> 03:46:52,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're telling us, no, I'm not going to send somebody out.

2379
03:46:52,500 --> 03:46:54,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll get to it tomorrow morning.

2380
03:46:54,661 --> 03:46:59,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're expected to then find a way to go and circle back around tomorrow morning

2381
03:46:59,984 --> 03:47:02,185
[SPEAKER_06]: and make sure that building got around to that.

2382
03:47:02,505 --> 03:47:07,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And there has been a couple of incidences recently that building actually had no idea about it.

2383
03:47:07,166 --> 03:47:11,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And an insurance company called them to say, hey, what did you do about that thing at that house?

2384
03:47:11,928 --> 03:47:17,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had no idea because it was never conveyed to the actual building inspectors that some incident had happened.

2385
03:47:17,590 --> 03:47:21,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not because we didn't want to let the information out after the fact.

2386
03:47:22,051 --> 03:47:26,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It was that they were never told by their chain of command that there was an incident on scene.

2387
03:47:28,607 --> 03:47:30,969
[SPEAKER_06]: We went through our chain.

2388
03:47:31,089 --> 03:47:31,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We did our thing.

2389
03:47:31,909 --> 03:47:32,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We called dispatch.

2390
03:47:32,890 --> 03:47:34,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We said, hey, we need building.

2391
03:47:34,911 --> 03:47:36,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were told, no, they're not coming out.

2392
03:47:37,513 --> 03:47:42,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, I mean, we're not calling building out for the fun of it at 3 AM.

2393
03:47:42,096 --> 03:47:44,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the worst feeling in the world to have to call somebody at that hour.

2394
03:47:45,478 --> 03:47:47,879
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're calling, it's because we absolutely need somebody.

2395
03:47:48,660 --> 03:47:48,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2396
03:47:49,380 --> 03:47:53,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just saying, it sounds like what the administration is trying to change to say,

2397
03:47:54,315 --> 03:48:01,539
[SPEAKER_18]: that the call goes to the building commissioner and then if the building commissioner makes a determination, that's the chain of command to the people who work for the building department.

2398
03:48:01,760 --> 03:48:03,160
[SPEAKER_06]: How is he making the determination?

2399
03:48:03,300 --> 03:48:08,183
[SPEAKER_18]: But my point being that the building inspector is just changing who's making the determination.

2400
03:48:09,164 --> 03:48:15,568
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, no, the determination was made when we, when we're saying that a car ran into this house and it's now like

2401
03:48:16,300 --> 03:48:21,704
[SPEAKER_06]: impact, you know, it hit the doorway, and now we're not sure if the doorway is safe.

2402
03:48:22,145 --> 03:48:27,449
[SPEAKER_06]: We made the determination that we need a building inspector to inspect the situation to make sure that it's sound.

2403
03:48:28,650 --> 03:48:41,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, again, I don't care who makes the call to the inspectors, but if our deputies that are the emergency scene commanders at that point in time are saying, I need somebody to come out here, I need a professional here,

2404
03:48:43,251 --> 03:48:54,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't understand why there's another person coming in and saying it's not there and hasn't spoken to anybody there that can turn around and say, no, it's not that bad.

2405
03:48:56,385 --> 03:49:06,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it doesn't make sense to me, and I understand, you know, we live in this world, so it's a little bit, I don't know.

2406
03:49:06,916 --> 03:49:18,249
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's something lost in translation from us who actually respond to emergencies, the people that are making decisions that don't respond to emergencies, then I would love to try to help convey

2407
03:49:19,009 --> 03:49:26,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's going on and how to facilitate this so that we can get it so that it's not just a we're not looking up for our buddies to come and hang out at 3 a.m.

2408
03:49:26,874 --> 03:49:32,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking to make sure that our houses are safe or the you know apartment buildings are safe at 3 a.m.

2409
03:49:33,458 --> 03:49:33,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2410
03:49:33,998 --> 03:49:43,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean and again somebody who is not on scene who has not talked to anybody on scene is telling us no I'm not sending you an inspector.

2411
03:49:44,385 --> 03:49:44,505
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2412
03:49:44,721 --> 03:49:53,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I drove my car into your house at 3 o'clock in the morning and Deputy Young calls for an inspector, then they say, no, that can wait till tomorrow morning.

2413
03:49:54,577 --> 03:49:55,198
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens then?

2414
03:49:56,698 --> 03:49:58,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't know who to call.

2415
03:49:59,119 --> 03:50:02,821
[SPEAKER_06]: As a new company officer in the fire department, I don't know exactly who building calls.

2416
03:50:03,441 --> 03:50:08,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I also can't make the determination that your house is structurally sound, neither can Deputy Young or any of the other deputies.

2417
03:50:09,124 --> 03:50:11,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know who the disaster people are for the cleanups.

2418
03:50:11,965 --> 03:50:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know who the insurance people are that you're supposed to be talking to.

2419
03:50:14,847 --> 03:50:19,349
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know the proper channels that you're supposed to be going through to be able to make sure that your house is structurally sound.

2420
03:50:20,089 --> 03:50:25,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're supposed to wait until 8.30 in the morning when everybody else gets on shift.

2421
03:50:26,806 --> 03:50:33,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine going to bed at 3 o'clock in the morning with the car half-sticking out of your house.

2422
03:50:33,193 --> 03:50:33,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2423
03:50:33,293 --> 03:50:38,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me?

2424
03:50:38,038 --> 03:50:40,321
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you mean?

2425
03:50:40,801 --> 03:50:42,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the next morning is a different shift.

2426
03:50:42,964 --> 03:50:43,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2427
03:50:43,805 --> 03:50:44,265
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just saying.

2428
03:50:45,239 --> 03:50:48,702
[SPEAKER_18]: To be honest, we're coming to this body that has no authority to do anything about this.

2429
03:50:49,242 --> 03:50:49,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2430
03:50:49,883 --> 03:51:00,652
[SPEAKER_18]: And the administration is basically, it seems to me the administration has said, we would like a different, we want the building commissioner to determine instead of the individual building inspector to determine when to go out.

2431
03:51:01,813 --> 03:51:09,500
[SPEAKER_18]: And it sounds like there's, that has been a change that has caused some issues that some people are saying has caused some issues that need to be worked out.

2432
03:51:11,909 --> 03:51:16,631
[SPEAKER_18]: to be frank, it's the prerogative of the mayor if the mayor wants to say this is the person who makes that decision.

2433
03:51:16,671 --> 03:51:20,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, it doesn't mean that that doesn't mean that the process is working perfectly.

2434
03:51:20,392 --> 03:51:26,154
[SPEAKER_18]: And like, I just want to say like, it sounds like some communication needs to happen or like things need to be adjusted.

2435
03:51:26,714 --> 03:51:33,237
[SPEAKER_18]: But just to say that there are two options, and the option is that only the building inspector can decide to go out whenever they want, or

2436
03:51:34,758 --> 03:51:36,019
[SPEAKER_18]: the mayor's way is working perfectly.

2437
03:51:36,039 --> 03:51:38,361
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think either of those things are absolutes.

2438
03:51:38,601 --> 03:51:43,264
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not comfortable myself right now saying we must go back to the old system.

2439
03:51:43,724 --> 03:52:00,897
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds like there's some sort of disagreement internally or lack of communication internally that's going on within the executive branch and the people who work for the city that I agree like we would like to get more information on and understand how it's worked out.

2440
03:52:01,037 --> 03:52:03,479
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just don't think this is as easy as to say,

2441
03:52:04,636 --> 03:52:06,198
[SPEAKER_18]: There are only two ways to do this.

2442
03:52:06,278 --> 03:52:11,903
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you don't agree with this one way, I mean, it's just so far outside of our scope.

2443
03:52:13,225 --> 03:52:17,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand that I understand that this isn't even it's not the council's purview to change the protocols.

2444
03:52:18,150 --> 03:52:25,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be honest, this is the I guess I'm just hoping that this this is the platform to be able to at least say our part to be heard.

2445
03:52:26,158 --> 03:52:55,505
[SPEAKER_06]: sure as far like by anybody who's listening on zoom or whatever to be heard that this is this is why it's a concern of ours all right it's not a concern we're not concerned with the overtime we're concerned with the safety of the citizens yeah and i'm just saying that that my vote to want more information understand that i'm going to take versus we say that the mayor must go back to this thing tomorrow which i don't feel comfortable saying it doesn't mean i'm not hearing you and it sounds like some communication needs to get worked out i understand that i just wanted a player thank you and i appreciate you answering my questions um

2446
03:52:56,397 --> 03:52:58,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I will go.

2447
03:52:58,358 --> 03:53:00,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a bunch of Councilors, and then I'll go back to the podium.

2448
03:53:01,479 --> 03:53:03,420
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go to the Councilors, and I'm going to go back.

2449
03:53:05,841 --> 03:53:11,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure who went first, so I'll go to Councilor Callahan, and then Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Tseng.

2450
03:53:11,963 --> 03:53:12,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan?

2451
03:53:12,643 --> 03:53:13,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2452
03:53:13,403 --> 03:53:16,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually just hoping you could read back the B paper.

2453
03:53:17,405 --> 03:53:19,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, can I do that right before we vote?

2454
03:53:19,065 --> 03:53:21,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping to write an amendment while other people were speaking.

2455
03:53:22,227 --> 03:53:22,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2456
03:53:22,487 --> 03:53:23,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you don't mind.

2457
03:53:23,467 --> 03:53:25,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Collins, could you read the B paper, please?

2458
03:53:31,189 --> 03:53:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: The paper is whereas public safety is a priority for the City Council, be it resolved that the administration submit a report detailing new overtime policies within the building department, as well as a report on current policies relating to building department and fire department hierarchy of oversight and decision making on incidents involving building structures after business hours.

2459
03:53:52,417 --> 03:53:54,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2460
03:53:54,138 --> 03:53:58,959
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2461
03:53:59,300 --> 03:54:00,380
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

2462
03:54:13,365 --> 03:54:16,886
[SPEAKER_20]: of our community have been clear and precise.

2463
03:54:17,306 --> 03:54:18,867
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we definitely have some issues.

2464
03:54:19,427 --> 03:54:24,188
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe that Councilor Collins has put together a great format that we need to follow.

2465
03:54:25,029 --> 03:54:41,114
[SPEAKER_20]: But as a council, now that we've heard this from the professionals, that right now there is serious issues and people are watching this, that God forbid if anything happens and this council didn't follow through with the correct motion

2466
03:54:41,795 --> 03:54:44,617
[SPEAKER_20]: for liability and safety of our citizens.

2467
03:54:45,557 --> 03:54:47,098
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a slippery slope, my friends.

2468
03:54:47,798 --> 03:55:01,786
[SPEAKER_20]: I implore you to please, let's collectively as a group, let the mayor figure this out, but in the meantime, put the qualified people in place to make these decisions.

2469
03:55:02,226 --> 03:55:11,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Because from what we've heard, if there was a fire tonight, and we have the two authorities, both the commissioner and the former commissioner not answering,

2470
03:55:11,992 --> 03:55:21,417
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have a professional that's going to deem a home habitable or safe, which then would lead to something very dangerous and very serious.

2471
03:55:21,797 --> 03:55:32,583
[SPEAKER_20]: So please, Mr. President, I implore my colleagues that this is so important that what we've heard already, we're not professionals at this.

2472
03:55:32,963 --> 03:55:35,965
[SPEAKER_20]: We heard from the professionals how serious it is.

2473
03:55:37,206 --> 03:55:41,148
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I implore you to please listen and then

2474
03:55:41,852 --> 03:55:52,065
[SPEAKER_20]: vote to tell the mayor unanimously that we support, we bring them back to whole right now until we figure out the proper protocol.

2475
03:55:52,125 --> 03:55:52,545
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all.

2476
03:55:52,986 --> 03:55:55,028
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't us against you.

2477
03:55:55,068 --> 03:55:56,811
[SPEAKER_20]: This is common sense right in front of us.

2478
03:55:57,551 --> 03:55:57,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2479
03:55:58,292 --> 03:56:00,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2480
03:56:01,749 --> 03:56:02,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2481
03:56:02,629 --> 03:56:13,735
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to thank you, Danielle, for your explanation of it, because I think that clarifies to us on this side of the rail a bit of what you guys are concerned about.

2482
03:56:15,496 --> 03:56:25,261
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems to me that we're focusing a lot on who will be called onto the scene or not.

2483
03:56:25,321 --> 03:56:26,782
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's an important question.

2484
03:56:27,082 --> 03:56:28,223
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think when we think about

2485
03:56:29,669 --> 03:56:44,781
[SPEAKER_17]: the change that the mayor's administration has made, it seems like there's an additional refocus question of whether the building commissioner or the former building commissioner would send someone out to the scene.

2486
03:56:46,423 --> 03:56:53,028
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would be surprised if it's an emergency and they choose not to send someone out to the scene.

2487
03:56:53,048 --> 03:56:53,949
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think

2488
03:56:55,161 --> 03:56:59,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Your comment does help me understand where you guys are coming from.

2489
03:56:59,645 --> 03:57:05,271
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think the former system, the old system, has some holes in it.

2490
03:57:05,531 --> 03:57:09,975
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate the mayor trying to patch those holes.

2491
03:57:10,556 --> 03:57:19,524
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate Councilor Collins's B paper that will get us more, I think will get us more answers about all of this.

2492
03:57:21,220 --> 03:57:22,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2493
03:57:24,501 --> 03:57:26,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Go one minute, Mr. Young, Deputy Chief.

2494
03:57:27,462 --> 03:57:28,643
[SPEAKER_18]: You want me to turn on your microphone?

2495
03:57:28,663 --> 03:57:31,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I know what I've faced in the past.

2496
03:57:32,484 --> 03:57:39,546
[SPEAKER_24]: I had a home that I was under the impression that somebody manipulated a gas line in order to do harm to the house and themselves.

2497
03:57:40,427 --> 03:57:43,588
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was before the inspectors arrived for work.

2498
03:57:43,628 --> 03:57:47,269
[SPEAKER_24]: So I called for an inspector to check the gas line and tell me what they thought of it.

2499
03:57:47,884 --> 03:57:49,966
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was able to speak to the last commission.

2500
03:57:49,986 --> 03:57:52,809
[SPEAKER_24]: This was the last commission in their last week in the job.

2501
03:57:53,590 --> 03:57:55,672
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said, wow, you're a tough person to get a hold of.

2502
03:57:56,212 --> 03:57:57,734
[SPEAKER_24]: And they were reluctant to send somebody.

2503
03:57:58,174 --> 03:58:03,680
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the line, and I quote, well, those inspectors are pretty expensive.

2504
03:58:04,661 --> 03:58:05,842
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the line that I was told.

2505
03:58:05,862 --> 03:58:07,424
[SPEAKER_24]: They're pretty expensive.

2506
03:58:09,813 --> 03:58:15,815
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what the person said to me, trying to get somebody to inspect a gas line that could have been manipulated.

2507
03:58:16,255 --> 03:58:16,995
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we're dealing with.

2508
03:58:17,495 --> 03:58:17,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2509
03:58:17,955 --> 03:58:23,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Fiori, name and address for the record.

2510
03:58:24,477 --> 03:58:25,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Three minutes.

2511
03:58:25,737 --> 03:58:26,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2512
03:58:29,403 --> 03:58:39,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that, you know, so first of all, I like this discussion, because I think it's part of the checks and balances of the legislative branch checking on what the executive branch in this case, the mayor is doing.

2513
03:58:39,689 --> 03:58:42,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, I think this is a healthy discussion to have.

2514
03:58:43,491 --> 03:58:52,917
[SPEAKER_11]: More importantly, regarding to this particular scenario, I mean, to me, I think that as a resident, we need to listen and pay attention to the people actually doing the work.

2515
03:58:53,902 --> 03:59:03,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's an accident somewhere and any of the firefighters get sent there, they look at the situation, they are right there, and they are the experts that are assessing the thing.

2516
03:59:04,494 --> 03:59:09,416
[SPEAKER_11]: So, to me, personally, they should be the ones that should be grabbing the phone.

2517
03:59:09,996 --> 03:59:16,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they so deem necessary that someone from the building department comes and assesses something that they're not able to do themselves.

2518
03:59:17,039 --> 03:59:23,502
[SPEAKER_11]: But then someone from the building department comes and I just don't understand why the building commissioner is the one that you know should be doing that on the phone.

2519
03:59:24,863 --> 03:59:37,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we should look into medicine right this happens in amazing all the time that people are on call that, you know, if there's like you know I don't know like 20 people in the building department that can actually perform this task, they should, they should be on call periodically one every night.

2520
03:59:38,415 --> 03:59:44,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there's an accident somewhere the firefighters need, you know, the assessment of someone from the building department they just come out.

2521
03:59:44,861 --> 03:59:50,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do the job that they were trained to do, that the firefighters, unfortunately, cannot perform themselves.

2522
03:59:50,724 --> 03:59:56,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And in terms of efficiency, which I think should always be a priority, data can be taken, right?

2523
03:59:56,686 --> 03:59:59,287
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can take data about what kind of vaccine happened.

2524
03:59:59,607 --> 04:00:02,749
[SPEAKER_11]: This was what followed, that we got someone from the department here.

2525
04:00:02,909 --> 04:00:05,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after the fact, we can analyze, would it have been possible?

2526
04:00:05,690 --> 04:00:07,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that unnecessary that someone came?

2527
04:00:07,631 --> 04:00:09,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just collect all the data, and that should be analyzed.

2528
04:00:09,512 --> 04:00:12,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And then with time, we can actually make the process more efficiency.

2529
04:00:12,953 --> 04:00:27,630
[SPEAKER_11]: efficient by determining well maybe in these situations if someone from the building department is no longer necessary or um and things like that but I just think that to me it doesn't make any sense that if we have people on the ground doing the job those are the ones that should be determining we need help

2530
04:00:28,311 --> 04:00:38,521
[SPEAKER_11]: from the building department, and then someone from the building department should always be on call and then get to whatever they have to get to assess the situation and provide their expertise.

2531
04:00:38,541 --> 04:00:39,542
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that's what makes sense.

2532
04:00:39,582 --> 04:00:41,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, medicine does this all the time.

2533
04:00:41,444 --> 04:00:44,187
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not something that we're not like being rocket scientists here.

2534
04:00:45,328 --> 04:00:47,530
[SPEAKER_11]: They have figured it out in critical access.

2535
04:00:48,831 --> 04:00:56,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Hospitals, like there's not someone in the ER all the time, they're just on call, and if something happens, the person goes, he has to leave within a certain amount of time from the hospital.

2536
04:00:57,313 --> 04:01:09,437
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's keep the people that actually do the job, and then there, at the scene, make the decision about what kind of help they need to perform their job properly.

2537
04:01:09,577 --> 04:01:09,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2538
04:01:10,197 --> 04:01:10,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2539
04:01:13,598 --> 04:01:14,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to the Chief of Staff.

2540
04:01:18,288 --> 04:01:19,169
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you president bears.

2541
04:01:19,189 --> 04:01:31,569
[SPEAKER_39]: I think a lot has been stated in the course of the last I don't know how much time has passed since since kind of probably the last time I spoke on this issue but there have been a lot of comments that have made and I just like to address a few of them.

2542
04:01:34,986 --> 04:01:42,932
[SPEAKER_39]: First and foremost, the building commissioner, the city's building commissioner, Scott Van De Wall, is presently on vacation and unavailable.

2543
04:01:43,253 --> 04:01:57,584
[SPEAKER_39]: So that's a missing person to this conversation, and it's an important missing person to this conversation, considering that is the individual who's most knowledgeable as to the call-outs that have been placed, the circumstances behind them, and the reasons in which

2544
04:01:58,224 --> 04:02:02,768
[SPEAKER_39]: he believed that they could wait, that certain circumstances could wait until the next day.

2545
04:02:03,208 --> 04:02:15,158
[SPEAKER_39]: If he believes that certain circumstances cannot wait until the next day, and it's an emergent situation that requires a building commissioner, anytime there's a structural issue.

2546
04:02:15,178 --> 04:02:20,722
[SPEAKER_39]: So there would never be a circumstance where a car drives through a building and then it goes unaddressed.

2547
04:02:21,222 --> 04:02:22,363
[SPEAKER_39]: That would never happen.

2548
04:02:22,804 --> 04:02:24,565
[SPEAKER_39]: That would be an immediate circumstance.

2549
04:02:24,605 --> 04:02:26,867
[SPEAKER_39]: That's a structural issue with a building.

2550
04:02:28,487 --> 04:02:39,072
[SPEAKER_39]: So, and the second thing is, I think one of the Councilors may have said that there's a qualified person Councilor Scarpelli I think that you might have said a qualified person.

2551
04:02:40,092 --> 04:02:44,594
[SPEAKER_39]: The building commissioner is of course the qualified person to make these determinations.

2552
04:02:49,639 --> 04:02:50,539
[SPEAKER_39]: There's protocol here.

2553
04:02:50,679 --> 04:03:08,066
[SPEAKER_39]: If the protocol needs to be reviewed, which I certainly will want to do at this point because I haven't been heavily involved, but I know enough of this matter to speak to the issues I'm speaking on, one thing that we take very seriously, I know the mayor takes very seriously, is ethics.

2554
04:03:08,867 --> 04:03:17,050
[SPEAKER_39]: And putting someone responsible for placing the call-outs to which they can call themselves out

2555
04:03:18,166 --> 04:03:21,208
[SPEAKER_39]: is not likely going to be a protocol that's going to be put in place.

2556
04:03:21,869 --> 04:03:31,916
[SPEAKER_39]: As I stated before, I'm sure there's a way we handle circumstances if the current building commissioner and the former building commissioner are not available, but I will need to check on that.

2557
04:03:32,257 --> 04:03:37,721
[SPEAKER_39]: If there is not such a circumstance, that will need to be fortified and ensured that that is being handled.

2558
04:03:38,081 --> 04:03:42,584
[SPEAKER_39]: I do not take any of these matters lightly, and I certainly appreciate all the work of the

2559
04:03:43,365 --> 04:03:51,733
[SPEAKER_39]: fire officials and the building officials and the dispatchers and anyone who's handling these calls and these emergency scenes.

2560
04:03:51,914 --> 04:04:02,724
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm sure it's not an easy job, but I just want to make sure we set the record straight on what's missing from this conversation and the ethics and protocols that are in place, which I will review.

2561
04:04:04,266 --> 04:04:05,067
[SPEAKER_39]: But to be clear,

2562
04:04:06,482 --> 04:04:19,128
[SPEAKER_39]: the circumstances around placing somebody responsible to call their peers out as well as themselves out to take overtime is not a protocol I think that the mayor would be in support of.

2563
04:04:19,189 --> 04:04:19,529
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2564
04:04:25,011 --> 04:04:25,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2565
04:04:25,612 --> 04:04:27,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want me to go to public participation or do you want to go?

2566
04:04:27,593 --> 04:04:29,914
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to clarify.

2567
04:04:31,758 --> 04:04:46,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, what I said was, when the commissioner and the former commissioner are not available, the fire department members are not qualified to say that a structure is safe.

2568
04:04:46,886 --> 04:04:48,467
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I said to correct what you said.

2569
04:04:49,747 --> 04:04:59,573
[SPEAKER_20]: And the other piece that I want to follow up real quick with what was said is that I'd like to know, and part of this may be added on,

2570
04:05:01,344 --> 04:05:08,809
[SPEAKER_20]: as a C paper, that I think people might be misunderstanding that this might be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

2571
04:05:09,149 --> 04:05:09,570
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not.

2572
04:05:10,730 --> 04:05:11,131
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not.

2573
04:05:11,711 --> 04:05:17,835
[SPEAKER_20]: The overtime that our building inspectors are getting for overtime isn't a lot of money.

2574
04:05:18,616 --> 04:05:20,877
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're not talking about saving a teacher's job.

2575
04:05:21,217 --> 04:05:27,361
[SPEAKER_20]: You're talking about minimal money to make sure that public safety is paramount.

2576
04:05:27,982 --> 04:05:28,362
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all.

2577
04:05:28,942 --> 04:05:29,783
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2578
04:05:38,580 --> 04:05:38,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2579
04:05:38,921 --> 04:05:39,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2580
04:05:39,481 --> 04:05:41,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to see if I could make a friendly amendment to the B paper.

2581
04:05:43,181 --> 04:05:45,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I have sent the amendment to the clerk.

2582
04:05:45,822 --> 04:05:57,064
[SPEAKER_08]: The amendment is that we request that the administration work with the building department and other public safety departments to alleviate concerns about after hours building inspector availability.

2583
04:05:59,761 --> 04:06:02,042
[SPEAKER_08]: This really is the job of the administration.

2584
04:06:03,222 --> 04:06:13,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate that we've had quite a public forum here for folks to speak and really for us to understand what these issues are.

2585
04:06:15,146 --> 04:06:21,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the appropriate move here is to both get information and also to encourage the administration to make sure that these issues are covered.

2586
04:06:25,710 --> 04:06:28,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Kiley and Councilor Collins accepts the amendment.

2587
04:06:30,216 --> 04:06:32,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Staub, since you spoke once, you can speak one more time for one minute.

2588
04:06:35,263 --> 04:06:35,623
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2589
04:06:36,164 --> 04:06:38,807
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to clarify a couple things.

2590
04:06:39,388 --> 04:06:46,017
[SPEAKER_29]: One is the previous policy was that when the fire professionals that have spoken tonight

2591
04:06:46,934 --> 04:07:08,551
[SPEAKER_29]: deem a emergency, and I'm not talking about a cat in a tree, I'm talking about a fire, a flood, a gas leak, a car hits a building, and they request a inspector on scene prior to now, dispatch or someone from police or fire would call the on-call inspector directly

2592
04:07:09,687 --> 04:07:25,455
[SPEAKER_29]: that person he would directly respond to the emergency himself or dispatch one of the other inspectors within minutes to arrive on scene in person to assess whether a structure was safe or not to remain inhabited.

2593
04:07:25,856 --> 04:07:35,321
[SPEAKER_29]: The new policy as has been stated by all the people here collectively is that when the fire professionals deem a true emergency,

2594
04:07:36,260 --> 04:07:39,301
[SPEAKER_29]: call the building inspector twice.

2595
04:07:39,321 --> 04:07:43,402
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know what that means, but calls them twice, not once, but twice.

2596
04:07:43,422 --> 04:07:56,606
[SPEAKER_29]: If he doesn't answer, they're going to call the previous building commissioner who lives and works in and around Brockton over an hour ride from here that cannot

2597
04:07:57,486 --> 04:08:04,109
[SPEAKER_29]: come here on scene, who, by the way, is taking calls from the city of Brockton after hours as well.

2598
04:08:04,709 --> 04:08:14,033
[SPEAKER_29]: If he doesn't answer, no one in this room or on the administration on Zoom knows what the policy is after that.

2599
04:08:14,353 --> 04:08:24,478
[SPEAKER_29]: But Deputy, I believe I can't Deputy Young, Deputy Chief Young is being told that it's up to him.

2600
04:08:25,498 --> 04:08:36,781
[SPEAKER_29]: And my friends in the back, the professionals with licenses for all of their stipends are the ones that are qualified to make the decisions.

2601
04:08:37,182 --> 04:08:46,544
[SPEAKER_29]: Their boss, the building commissioner is telling them that the mayor's administration is telling him that they should not be responding to these calls anymore.

2602
04:08:46,664 --> 04:08:50,846
[SPEAKER_29]: I just wanna make sure all the facts are on the table and I appreciate your time again.

2603
04:08:50,926 --> 04:08:51,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2604
04:08:56,121 --> 04:08:58,082
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, any further discussion?

2605
04:08:58,102 --> 04:09:05,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I would remind all my fellow Councilors that they can call the question on any question at any time.

2606
04:09:07,906 --> 04:09:09,927
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so we'll start with the B paper as amended.

2607
04:09:09,947 --> 04:09:20,471
[SPEAKER_18]: The B paper by Vice President Collins as amended by Councilor Callahan and seconded by... Is there a second on the B paper?

2608
04:09:20,791 --> 04:09:24,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilors saying... Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2614
04:09:41,999 --> 04:09:42,620
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2615
04:09:42,640 --> 04:09:44,061
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't get it for you.

2616
04:09:44,161 --> 04:09:44,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Tseng.

2617
04:09:45,802 --> 04:09:46,383
[SPEAKER_26]: President Bears.

2618
04:09:46,483 --> 04:09:46,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, 16.

2619
04:09:46,783 --> 04:09:48,564
[SPEAKER_18]: If I remember one negative, the motion passes.

2620

[SPEAKER_18]: On the A paper by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilors.

2621
04:09:53,268 --> 04:09:54,549
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand, I thought that was my thing.

2622
04:09:55,330 --> 04:09:56,711
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not, can you just hold it?

2623
04:09:57,335 --> 04:10:03,620
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the B paper by Councilor Collins.

2624
04:10:03,740 --> 04:10:05,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2625
04:10:05,561 --> 04:10:06,462
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

2626
04:10:08,804 --> 04:10:12,987
[SPEAKER_18]: On the A paper by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by.

2627
04:10:13,787 --> 04:10:24,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a second?

2628
04:10:26,315 --> 04:10:30,158
[SPEAKER_18]: on the second, seconded by Vice President Collins.

2629
04:10:30,178 --> 04:10:33,121

2631
04:10:42,048 --> 04:10:43,069
[SPEAKER_18]: A, sorry, I said A, right?

2632
04:10:43,889 --> 04:10:44,570
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the A paper.

2633
04:10:44,630 --> 04:10:45,391
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the A paper.

2634
04:10:45,411 --> 04:10:48,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, and that's Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Vice President Collins, correct?

2635
04:10:48,533 --> 04:10:51,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Collins.

04:11:26,260 --> 04:11:32,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearings 24514, amendment to the special permit for signs 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, Meadow Glen.

2651
04:11:32,447 --> 04:11:36,371
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a public hearing that is continued from December 17th, 2024.

2652
04:11:36,792 --> 04:11:38,694
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm opening the public hearing.

2653
04:11:38,714 --> 04:11:41,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have the proponent for this project?

2654
04:11:41,176 --> 04:11:41,677
[SPEAKER_18]: We do.

2655
04:11:41,817 --> 04:11:42,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for staying with us.

2656
04:11:45,916 --> 04:11:49,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli is the chair of the subcommittee on licensing permitting and signs.

2657
04:11:50,799 --> 04:11:52,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just recognize you microphone.

2658
04:11:52,861 --> 04:11:55,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I met with the building department.

2659
04:11:56,243 --> 04:12:04,469
[SPEAKER_20]: We had in depth conversation the two biggest things with size and illumination if it would affect any residents in the area, and the second would be

2660
04:12:05,129 --> 04:12:19,586
[SPEAKER_20]: that if the sign, the special permit would be a hindrance for public safety in that corner area, and I was informed that both are fine, so I would move approval for the sign change.

2661
04:12:21,308 --> 04:12:22,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2662
04:12:23,108 --> 04:12:28,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Pending the motion to approve, I've reopened the public hearing to anyone who'd like to speak for, against, or in any other way about the project.

2663
04:12:28,870 --> 04:12:30,010
[SPEAKER_18]: We have someone at the podium.

2664
04:12:30,830 --> 04:12:34,751
[SPEAKER_18]: Please provide your name and address, and you can share if you're in favor of the project.

2665
04:12:34,811 --> 04:12:36,731
[SPEAKER_18]: And it looks like you have a presentation.

2666
04:12:36,771 --> 04:12:39,432
[SPEAKER_18]: If you'd like to make it at this point, we'd happily entertain it.

2667
04:12:39,512 --> 04:12:45,073
[SPEAKER_32]: No, for the record, my name is Fred Pino, representing NH Signs in Auburn, New Hampshire.

2668
04:12:45,753 --> 04:12:46,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2669
04:12:46,133 --> 04:12:47,033
[SPEAKER_18]: The floor is yours.

2670
04:12:47,633 --> 04:12:49,914
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, if you have any questions, I can read this real briefly.

2671
04:12:50,567 --> 04:12:51,127
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to hear it.

2672
04:12:51,147 --> 04:12:53,128
[SPEAKER_32]: I think you guys have a copy.

2673
04:12:53,248 --> 04:12:54,228
[SPEAKER_18]: You can abbreviate the reading.

2674
04:12:54,268 --> 04:12:55,009
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a copy.

2675
04:12:55,209 --> 04:12:55,609
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

2676
04:12:55,749 --> 04:13:10,334
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, basically, you know, vice-president Collins, Mr. Beers, we are just requesting for to add two smaller signs, fake of America and additional freestanding sign.

2677
04:13:10,354 --> 04:13:11,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2678
04:13:11,934 --> 04:13:15,615
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's our cause, you know, for the most part.

2679
04:13:15,836 --> 04:13:19,857
[SPEAKER_18]: All I can say, sir, is my preference was that we took this agenda in order.

2680
04:13:21,874 --> 04:13:26,817
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I mean, this has been going on for over a year on my end, so.

2681
04:13:26,937 --> 04:13:32,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And sadly, I am not able to make motions, so here we are.

2682
04:13:32,921 --> 04:13:36,683
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds like Councilor Scarpelli has reviewed and has made a motion to approve.

2683
04:13:37,564 --> 04:13:39,265
[SPEAKER_18]: There's seconded by Vice President Collins.

2684
04:13:39,305 --> 04:13:45,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any questions by members of the council regarding the signed proposal, which is a special permit to overturn a denial?

04:13:47,730 --> 04:13:50,251
[SPEAKER_18]: An amendment, sorry, an amendment to an existing special permit.

2686

2688
04:13:57,942 --> 04:14:01,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none in person or on Zoom, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

2711
04:14:50,530 --> 04:14:53,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anything you'd like to add?

2712
04:14:53,051 --> 04:14:53,172
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2713
04:14:53,192 --> 04:14:56,373
[SPEAKER_20]: I apologize for the delay that we should have moved you forward.

2714
04:14:56,433 --> 04:15:03,696
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I could take it back, I would, but we see everything is in order for the, the change of business.

2715
04:15:04,036 --> 04:15:09,239
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe it's the former porch is now the,

2716
04:15:11,615 --> 04:15:12,715
[SPEAKER_20]: the establishment.

2717
04:15:12,735 --> 04:15:15,196
[SPEAKER_20]: So, and I believe that everything is in order.

2718
04:15:15,996 --> 04:15:22,318
[SPEAKER_20]: I did see that the times that you're requesting fall in the parameters that do not need a special vote yet.

2719
04:15:22,438 --> 04:15:33,541
[SPEAKER_20]: If you extend those hours, we'd welcome a motion through the clerk's office to help in any way we can to make sure that we can help your business thrive.

2720
04:15:33,601 --> 04:15:37,322
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's the fear that the community heard was

2721
04:15:37,882 --> 04:15:47,788
[SPEAKER_20]: that an establishment being left open and I'm so glad that that the establishment is now moving in and I see nothing to hold back Mr. President.

2722
04:15:47,808 --> 04:15:51,691
[SPEAKER_20]: I would move approval after my colleagues have any questions or concerns.

2723
04:15:52,251 --> 04:15:52,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2724
04:15:53,692 --> 04:15:56,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Collins and then Councilor Callahan.

2725
04:15:58,800 --> 04:15:59,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

2726
04:15:59,520 --> 04:16:00,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here with us.

2727
04:16:00,841 --> 04:16:02,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for sticking it out this long.

2728
04:16:02,401 --> 04:16:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: We apologize for keeping you here so late.

2729
04:16:04,742 --> 04:16:13,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I know like many others in the community, it was really sad to hear when the porch vacated its current tenancy and really excited to hear that something new is moving in.

2730
04:16:13,586 --> 04:16:17,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that many jokes will be made about the new establishment at the establishment.

2731
04:16:17,867 --> 04:16:22,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for providing a really easy conversation starter for your future patrons.

2732

[SPEAKER_04]: No further questions, I'd happily motion to approve or second.

2734
04:16:28,813 --> 04:16:29,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Callahan.

2735
04:16:29,713 --> 04:16:31,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2736
04:16:31,494 --> 04:16:33,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very sad that the porch closed.

2737
04:16:33,976 --> 04:16:39,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I went there many times and I would love to hear your 30 second elevator pitch for your vision for what you're creating.

2738
04:16:41,961 --> 04:16:42,822
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me one second.

2739
04:16:43,843 --> 04:16:45,985
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you could just provide your name.

2740
04:16:46,565 --> 04:16:50,909
[SPEAKER_35]: I am originally from Malden and my family's from Malden, Sargas, Everett, Medford.

2741
04:16:50,929 --> 04:16:54,051
[SPEAKER_35]: So we started out my family to buy a restaurant about nine years ago.

2742
04:16:54,371 --> 04:16:56,593
[SPEAKER_35]: We really wanted to be in this area, but we just couldn't.

2743
04:16:56,693 --> 04:16:57,574
[SPEAKER_35]: Two years we looked.

2744
04:16:57,994 --> 04:16:59,115
[SPEAKER_35]: Finally we went to Chelmsford.

2745
04:16:59,135 --> 04:16:59,856
[SPEAKER_35]: Someone asked us.

2746
04:16:59,916 --> 04:17:01,697
[SPEAKER_35]: We had to go there three different times.

2747
04:17:02,078 --> 04:17:07,102
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're just really excited to be back in our neighborhood because we know a lot of people, a lot of families.

2748
04:17:07,142 --> 04:17:08,283
[SPEAKER_35]: So we love the community.

2749
04:17:08,563 --> 04:17:10,885
[SPEAKER_35]: We want to get everybody involved, the sports teams,

2750
04:17:11,485 --> 04:17:15,447
[SPEAKER_35]: you know, the chamber I already met with them, the Malden chamber, the Medford chamber I'm going to meet with.

2751
04:17:15,467 --> 04:17:20,030
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm just trying to get the community involved and just enjoy it since we're all from this area.

2752
04:17:20,070 --> 04:17:21,891
[SPEAKER_35]: So we want it to be back in our home city.

2753
04:17:21,951 --> 04:17:23,431
[SPEAKER_35]: So, so we're pretty excited.

2754
04:17:23,491 --> 04:17:25,493
[SPEAKER_35]: Our other restaurant's been open seven and a half years, so.

2755
04:17:26,413 --> 04:17:26,773
[SPEAKER_35]: Great.

2756
04:17:27,293 --> 04:17:28,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and just so I have your name for the record.

2757
04:17:28,974 --> 04:17:29,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

2758
04:17:29,415 --> 04:17:30,315
[SPEAKER_35]: Don Zanazzo.

2759
04:17:30,555 --> 04:17:30,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

2760
04:17:30,875 --> 04:17:31,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2761
04:17:31,696 --> 04:17:39,340
[SPEAKER_30]: Sean Bieg and I represent, uh, the, uh, owners, uh, just so you, the council members are aware, uh,

2762
04:17:40,171 --> 04:17:40,371
[SPEAKER_30]: Ms.

2763
04:17:40,592 --> 04:17:50,423
[SPEAKER_30]: Zanazzo and her brother and a couple other people who are the owners here already have a restaurant up in Chelmsford, which is thriving, which is about an 11 or 12,000 square foot spot.

2764
04:17:50,604 --> 04:17:52,786
[SPEAKER_30]: This is almost an 8,000 square foot spot.

2765
04:17:52,826 --> 04:17:56,531
[SPEAKER_30]: So I hope everyone comes out to a large place, can accommodate a lot of people.

2766
04:17:56,731 --> 04:17:58,273
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think they're gonna do very well there.

2767
04:17:58,956 --> 04:18:00,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Two questions, if you don't mind.

2768
04:18:00,457 --> 04:18:01,238
[SPEAKER_18]: No, go ahead.

2769
04:18:01,258 --> 04:18:02,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Councilor Scarpelli.

2770
04:18:02,338 --> 04:18:03,639
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we'll be here.

2771
04:18:03,679 --> 04:18:04,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2772
04:18:04,920 --> 04:18:10,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Just, are you keeping the, there's kind of a back room that was, you could use for kind of private function, is that what you're doing?

2773
04:18:10,263 --> 04:18:15,647
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, actually we're keeping that, it's 40 people, and then we're extending it so that we can make it a 100 person function room.

2774
04:18:15,667 --> 04:18:16,167
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, wow.

2775
04:18:16,227 --> 04:18:16,928
[SPEAKER_35]: And block it off.

2776
04:18:17,388 --> 04:18:22,271
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're trying to keep it so it can be a small meeting room and close off, or a 100 person function room.

2777
04:18:22,511 --> 04:18:22,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

2778
04:18:22,672 --> 04:18:23,972
[SPEAKER_35]: So we have one big event room.

2779
04:18:24,413 --> 04:18:25,634
[SPEAKER_35]: So everybody can enjoy.

2780
04:18:25,654 --> 04:18:27,615
[SPEAKER_35]: 40 isn't really big enough.

2781
04:18:28,015 --> 04:18:28,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2782
04:18:28,355 --> 04:18:30,797
[SPEAKER_18]: And what kind of food will you guys just- Sure.

2783
04:18:31,518 --> 04:18:36,462
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, we call it American Fear, but it's mostly our big sellers are steak tips and marinated.

2784
04:18:36,542 --> 04:18:38,203
[SPEAKER_35]: We make them ourselves.

2785
04:18:38,243 --> 04:18:39,324
[SPEAKER_35]: We tumble them for hours.

2786
04:18:39,364 --> 04:18:40,084
[SPEAKER_35]: So they're really good.

2787
04:18:40,224 --> 04:18:44,508
[SPEAKER_35]: Fish, steak tips, pizza, burgers, chicken parm.

2788
04:18:44,528 --> 04:18:45,208
[SPEAKER_35]: We have everything.

2789
04:18:45,228 --> 04:18:48,531
[SPEAKER_35]: We have 15 appetizers and we have about 20 entrees.

2790
04:18:48,571 --> 04:18:49,672
[SPEAKER_35]: So a lot of food.

2791
04:18:50,432 --> 04:18:51,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

2792
04:18:51,513 --> 04:18:52,554
[SPEAKER_18]: And any live music?

2793
04:18:53,738 --> 04:18:54,018
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

2794
04:18:54,538 --> 04:18:55,578
[SPEAKER_35]: We have not in the past.

2795
04:18:55,638 --> 04:18:58,539
[SPEAKER_35]: We tried it in Chelmsford, and people told us to tell them to stop.

2796
04:19:00,779 --> 04:19:01,499
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll see.

2797
04:19:01,680 --> 04:19:03,660
[SPEAKER_35]: We don't know what this will bring, right?

2798
04:19:03,700 --> 04:19:05,620
[SPEAKER_35]: We might come to Medford that might be a little different.

2799
04:19:05,640 --> 04:19:06,360
[SPEAKER_35]: You don't know the feel.

2800
04:19:06,380 --> 04:19:08,381
[SPEAKER_35]: You don't know what foods will work, what won't work.

2801
04:19:08,421 --> 04:19:11,361
[SPEAKER_35]: So you've got to pivot as you go, depending on what people want.

2802
04:19:11,781 --> 04:19:13,022
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll figure it out as we go.

2803
04:19:13,362 --> 04:19:14,302
[SPEAKER_35]: But I haven't had it yet.

2804
04:19:14,762 --> 04:19:18,703
[SPEAKER_18]: As the son of a live musician, I won't hold it against you.

2805
04:19:18,763 --> 04:19:19,383
[SPEAKER_35]: There you go.

2806
04:19:21,209 --> 04:19:26,434
[SPEAKER_35]: To be honest, we're trying to maybe open next weekend for a soft opening, just family and friends.

2807
04:19:26,934 --> 04:19:27,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

2808
04:19:27,655 --> 04:19:35,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, um, any further questions by members of the council or any comments by members of the public on this item?

2809
04:19:36,823 --> 04:19:40,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, we'll take a vote, but I expect that it will be a positive vote.

2810
04:19:40,367 --> 04:19:46,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and we wish you best of luck, um, on the motion of council vice-president Collins, seconded by councilor Scarapelli to approve.

[SPEAKER_18]: The motion, no, yes.

2875
04:21:18,705 --> 04:21:20,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes to table six to one.

2876
04:21:22,914 --> 04:21:25,095
[SPEAKER_18]: We still have, hold on, hold up.

2877
04:21:25,516 --> 04:21:26,276
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody slow down.

2878
04:21:28,117 --> 04:21:29,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Public participation.

2879
04:21:29,378 --> 04:21:31,939
[SPEAKER_18]: We're taking public participation.

2880
04:21:31,979 --> 04:21:35,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anyone in the room or on Zoom who would like to participate?

2881
04:21:35,681 --> 04:21:37,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Talk about anything they want for three minutes.

2882
04:21:42,184 --> 04:21:43,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Rd. 

2883
04:21:43,365 --> 04:21:49,088
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just wanted to see whether there's actually, we developed a protocol to try to

2884
04:21:50,510 --> 04:21:54,153
[SPEAKER_11]: foresee how long resolutions are going to take.

2885
04:21:54,373 --> 04:21:57,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the meeting, I couldn't come, unfortunately, to the last meeting of the year.

2886
04:21:57,976 --> 04:22:00,599
[SPEAKER_11]: But that one, I tried to watch it.

2887
04:22:00,639 --> 04:22:02,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very, very long.

2888
04:22:02,340 --> 04:22:04,142
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this one also ended up being long.

2889
04:22:04,162 --> 04:22:06,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there have been ones in June being very long.

2890
04:22:06,744 --> 04:22:13,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just feel that it makes it super hard for people to come and participate, and for all of us here as well, obviously.

2891
04:22:14,390 --> 04:22:17,213
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe there is a way to try to

2892
04:22:17,914 --> 04:22:20,766
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, spread out things and I know it's hard.

2893
04:22:23,373 --> 04:22:24,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we never know what's going to happen.

2894
04:22:25,413 --> 04:22:29,534
[SPEAKER_11]: But just as a suggestion for, in particular, for all of us that come here, right?

2895
04:22:30,274 --> 04:22:36,555
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the public as well, that people just can't have kids, work, they just cannot do it.

2896
04:22:36,575 --> 04:22:39,296
[SPEAKER_18]: My best suggestion is ask Councilor Scarpelli.

2897
04:22:39,616 --> 04:22:41,036
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

2898
04:22:41,116 --> 04:22:42,977
[SPEAKER_18]: He's not always responsive.

2899
04:22:43,217 --> 04:22:45,177
[SPEAKER_18]: And with that, I'm going to recognize.

2900
04:22:45,197 --> 04:22:47,878
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, this is shared among all the members of the council.

2901
04:22:48,498 --> 04:22:49,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, mine are short.

2902
04:22:50,698 --> 04:22:51,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm not.

2903
04:22:51,539 --> 04:22:51,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not.

2904
04:22:51,939 --> 04:22:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: This is shared among everyone.

2905
04:22:53,220 --> 04:22:56,783
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to recognize Councilor Collins the Councilors are vice president.

2906
04:22:58,244 --> 04:22:59,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a really beautiful question.

2907
04:22:59,726 --> 04:23:14,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a question on a lot of people's minds on both sides of the rail, I think that there's been a lot of strategies that have been tried by the city council and maybe also modeled by the school committee, not endorsing any one or the other, for example, I believe, maybe still are used to the school committee had a rule that

2908
04:23:14,898 --> 04:23:42,217
[SPEAKER_04]: they do the regular agenda until a certain time of the night and at that time maybe when the clock strikes nine or ten then they say are we going to table all remaining items or are we not i don't quote me on that it's just something that i think was present at their rules at some time again i'm not endorsing that but i think everybody kind of feels this tension in between we have to have these meetings after business hours so that people can participate and because we start at 7 p.m that kind of creates a funneling effect on the other side

2909
04:23:42,757 --> 04:23:46,541
[SPEAKER_04]: as well, because not everybody can stay here until 11 12 one in the morning.

2910
04:23:47,843 --> 04:23:57,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We've, we've tried mitigating you know how long people can speak for so that more people can speak to kind of keep things moving I know that's also been, you know, weighing of a cost and benefit.

2911
04:23:57,974 --> 04:23:58,194
[SPEAKER_04]: there.

2912
04:23:58,755 --> 04:24:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you can, uh, I know you're kind of a stem person.

2913
04:24:02,018 --> 04:24:05,621
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can develop an A I that can combine what's on the agenda.

2914
04:24:05,721 --> 04:24:11,306
[SPEAKER_04]: People's moods of Councilor Scarpelli has sent any mass emails recently and, you know, create a model of what we can expect.

2915
04:24:12,547 --> 04:24:13,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see it.

2916
04:24:14,329 --> 04:24:14,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

2917
04:24:15,089 --> 04:24:17,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not in favor of restricting people's participation.

2918
04:24:17,651 --> 04:24:18,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So but I think, but thank you.

2919
04:24:19,733 --> 04:24:21,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you. Councilor Lazzaro?

2920
04:24:23,646 --> 04:24:26,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for bringing that up, Mr. Fiore.

2921
04:24:26,889 --> 04:24:40,141
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree that this meeting lasted too long, and the meeting on December 17th also lasted too long, and I had to go home because I also have kids, and I have to get up early with them every single morning, no matter how late the meetings go.

2922
04:24:40,922 --> 04:24:45,887
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Vice President Collins mentioned,

2923
04:24:48,734 --> 04:24:52,577
[SPEAKER_16]: this council did attempt to deal with this.

2924
04:24:52,657 --> 04:24:54,678
[SPEAKER_16]: It hasn't really been as successful as we would have hoped.

2925
04:24:55,719 --> 04:25:01,643
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, I'm definitely interested and willing to find a way to solve this problem.

2926
04:25:02,323 --> 04:25:04,865
[SPEAKER_16]: But thanks for your willingness to discuss it.

2927
04:25:05,565 --> 04:25:06,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, everybody.

2928
04:25:07,787 --> 04:25:09,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

2929
04:25:12,489 --> 04:25:14,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Many other cities do have a hard stop in their rules.

2930
04:25:15,552 --> 04:25:25,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So they will have, as Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins mentioned, that they will have something in their rules that says at X time, everything is tabled.

2931
04:25:27,403 --> 04:25:34,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think personally that, I'll go to Councilor Leming, but that's just what enabled filibustering to obstruct.

2932
04:25:35,850 --> 04:25:36,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Leming.

2933
04:25:36,811 --> 04:25:37,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to adjourn.

2934
04:25:38,911 --> 04:25:46,074
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to adjourn, seconded by, I certainly wouldn't have a mind by saying this item is over now, so that we can get to everything on the agenda.

2935

[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Tseng.
