It's my distinct pleasure to welcome all of you to the Medford Public Schools. My name is Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, and I am so honored to be the superintendent of the Medford Public Schools. Medford is a welcoming community, and in our schools, we thrive to be inclusive and offer so many educational and athletic opportunities for our students.

The Medford Public Schools has always encouraged our parents and caregivers to collaborate with us to benefit your students' education. We know that it takes all of us, parents, caregivers, teachers, administrators, the Medford School Committee, and the community at large to work together for the betterment of our students.

Medford is one of the oldest communities in the United States, settled in 1630 and established as a city in 1892. It is a community rich in diversity and history. As a district, our guiding pillars are achievement for all, collaboration for all, equity for all, and support for all. As Maya Angelou once said,

We should all know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry, and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value, no matter what their color. I look forward to us working together. In closing, I welcome everyone to the home of the Mustangs. If you ever see me out and about,

When I say Mustang, you say Pride. Mustang Pride. This is your proud superintendent.
