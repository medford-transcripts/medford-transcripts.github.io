1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,763
All right, good evening, and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Community Development Board.

2
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:07,604
My name is Emily Hedeman.

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:11,166
I am the chair of this board, and I'm going to call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:14,228
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,273
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

6
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:29,498
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:38,816
Anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the City of Medford website.

8
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:43,940
A recording of this meeting will be posted on Medford Community Media website as soon as possible.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,084
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

10
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:57,029
Please know that project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website, medfordma.org,

11
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:01,695
I'm clicking on current CD board filings.

12
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,258
I believe Daniel has also dropped the link in the chat.

13
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,338
Thank you for that, Daniel.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,022
We're going to kick things off with roll call attendance.

15
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:14,845
Vice Chair, Peter Calves.

16
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:17,887
Present.

17
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:19,608
Great.

18
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:20,829
Good to see you on the morning commute, Peter.

19
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,350
Yeah, nice to see you as well.

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,832
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

21
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:25,713
Present.

22
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:27,494
Thanks, Ari.

23
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,195
Great to have you here.

24
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:30,014
Sabrina Alpino.

25
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:31,235
Present.

26
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:32,676
Hi, Sabrina.

27
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:34,997
John Anderson.

28
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:35,937
Present.

29
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,838
And a special welcome to John Anderson.

30
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,579
This is his first board meeting.

31
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,360
We're delighted to have him here.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,604
He brings a wealth of experience and knowledge, connections to the community, and we're very lucky to have him on the board with us.

33
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:53,825
Adam Behrens.

34
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:57,346
Present.

35
00:01:58,287 --> 00:01:58,667
Hey, Adam.

36
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,013
Ben LaValle.

37
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,456
Ben's not here this evening.

38
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:07,518
And myself, Emily Hedeman, I am here.

39
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,860
Danielle, can you wrap on the call?

40
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:13,001
Yes.

41
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:18,705
Tonight is myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

42
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:23,208
We have Director Alicia Hunt, the Director of PDS.

43
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:29,051
And we also have a graduate student intern, Christian Zepeda-Lepowski,

44
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,905
or Lipovsky, I'm so sorry, Christian.

45
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:36,448
I realized that I'd never pronounced your last name before.

46
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,831
I think that's everybody we have tonight.

47
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:41,893
Awesome.

48
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:42,714
Well, welcome, Christian.

49
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:43,474
I'm glad to have you here.

50
00:02:53,887 --> 00:03:02,971
All right, so the first item agenda before us is the continuance of the public hearing for the neighborhood residential urban residential zoning amendments.

51
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:16,037
We did put this out in an updated agenda, but we are as a board expecting to continue this to continue the public hearing to a date certain.

52
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:27,267
The primary reason, well, there's many reasons for this, but one of them that we're very mindful of is that there are some procedural issues related to quorum.

53
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:42,071
In order to preserve eligible voting members, we are not able to discuss it tonight and then maintain the eligible voting members.

54
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,172
So what I'm looking for

55
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:50,746
is a motion to continue the public hearing to a date certain.

56
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:58,209
And the date certain, I believe we're looking at the 18th or the 25th.

57
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,771
Madam Chair, the 18th.

58
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,472
The 18th, okay, great.

59
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:10,734
Moved.

60
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:12,855
So moved, do we have a second?

61
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:15,744
Thanks, Ari.

62
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,926
We're going to do a roll call vote.

63
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,828
I'm just going to call you all as I see you on the Zoom interface.

64
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:23,770
So be ready.

65
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,110
Adam Behrens?

66
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:27,292
Yes.

67
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:29,213
Peter Kalb?

68
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:30,674
Yes.

69
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:32,915
John Anderson?

70
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:33,836
Yes.

71
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:35,857
Sabrina Alpino?

72
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:36,758
Yes.

73
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:38,499
Ari Fishman?

74
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,240
Yes.

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,782
And I, myself, also an aye.

76
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:50,920
So we'll be continuing the public hearing for neighborhood residential urban residential zoning to June 18th.

77
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:54,623
That's one of our regularly scheduled meetings, it's been on the agenda.

78
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:59,186
And we look forward to continuing that hearing.

79
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:08,975
Um, we do have some additional zoning related items on our agenda today.

80
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:14,518
Um, I'm gonna kind of call an audible and combine two of the topics.

81
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:21,901
I think this may help us build comprehension and understanding as a board and then any members of the public who are listening in.

82
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:27,124
Um, I hope this will help us look at these topics more holistically.

83
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,245
Um, so

84
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:35,559
We're gonna have a public hearing for Medford Square and West Medford Square.

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,923
It's a new public hearing, so I have to read the public hearing notice into the record, which I'll do in a moment.

86
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:56,473
But what I'm also hoping we can do is our consultant and his associates can also share some information on the draft zoning of the other corridors agenda item.

87
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:08,486
I think that will help us understand the connections between the various squares and maybe put some perspective for those topics.

88
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:13,928
So with that, I'm going to read the public hearing notice into the record.

89
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:20,910
It's a little long, so if you want to grab a drink before the public water, please.

90
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,850
Let's stay civil.

91
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:27,118
If you want to grab a drink before we start this hearing, this could be a good time to do so.

92
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:44,004
The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 4th, 2025, after 6.30pm via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map.

93
00:06:45,820 --> 00:07:02,990
Amend section 94-2.1, Division into Districts, and section 94-9.0, Special District Regulations, to add the Medford Square District, MSD, and West Medford Square District, WMSD.

94
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:20,332
Amend Section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, Table A, by incorporating the MSD and WMSD zoning districts into the existing table and to designate the uses permitted therein.

95
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:37,150
Amend section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, Table B, by incorporating the MSD and WMSD zoning districts into the existing table and to state the dimensional requirements therein.

96
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:44,693
Amend section 94-12, Definitions, to amend and add various definitions.

97
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:50,515
And last one is amending the zoning map to change the zoning district designations.

98
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:02,987
of various properties to the MSD and WMSD zoning districts as shown on maps entitled Medford Square Zoning and West Medford Square Zoning Proposal prepared by Innis Associates.

99
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:11,211
The Zoom link to the Community Development Board is how you all found us this evening.

100
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:17,255
Do we need to post that in the chat for any public record reasons?

101
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,461
I don't think so.

102
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,744
The Zoom link is also posted in the city website calendar.

103
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:40,034
A subsequent public hearing on the same matter will be open and held pending receipt of the Community Development Board recommendation by the Medford City Council on June 10th, 2025 at 7 p.m.

104
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:42,836
So next Tuesday.

105
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:47,660
In the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall,

106
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,841
85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom.

107
00:08:52,882 --> 00:09:00,930
A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than June 6th, 2025, which is this Friday.

108
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:11,720
Danielle or Alicia, do you have any introductory comments before we hear the presentation or the introduction by Emily and Paula of Innocent Associates?

109
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,263
Madam Chair, I believe that the presentation they have prepared covers all the introductory stuff that I would otherwise say.

110
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:24,424
Great.

111
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,446
So with that, I'm going to hand it off to Emily and Paola.

112
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,027
Great to see you both.

113
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,908
Looking forward to what you have to show us this evening.

114
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:34,828
Thank you, Madam Chair.

115
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:35,749
We appreciate it.

116
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:41,832
Again, for the record, Emily Innis of Innis Associates, and I'm here with my colleague, Paola Ramos Martinez.

117
00:09:41,992 --> 00:10:01,302
She is just sharing her screen, but I'm going to walk you through a little bit more detail on the agenda and give a general overview of where we are, and then I'm going to turn it over to Paola to provide the updates on the different proposals and then focus on the squares and then the introduction to the corridors.

118
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,243
So, Paola, if you can just go to the next slide.

119
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:08,085
Yes, one second.

120
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,067
I think that I need to stop sharing.

121
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:10,708
One second.

122
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:11,329
Sorry.

123
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:12,831
No worries.

124
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,895
Technology always stops you.

125
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,881
Yeah, I just lost and I had you all.

126
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:21,864
Very big, but no presentation.

127
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:22,545
So here we are.

128
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,615
So I'll take you through the process and timeline.

129
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:40,182
This will be familiar to anybody who's been part of the process, talk a little bit about where the public can continue to comment and the next meetings, the immediate next meetings that are coming up.

130
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:47,427
And then I'll turn it over to Paola for the citywide approach, a little bit about our interactive map, which is available to everybody.

131
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:54,532
And then we'll go into the squares, which are the subject of tonight's public hearing, of course, and then the other corridors, which, as you said,

132
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:58,248
we believe will provide additional context to this conversation.

133
00:10:58,688 --> 00:10:59,468
Next slide, Paola.

134
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:14,372
So this zoning, citywide zoning effort comes out of two separate documents, which represent two planning processes.

135
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:19,453
The first you see on the left there, the Medford Massachusetts Comprehensive Plan.

136
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:26,987
And then the climate action and adaptation plan and the text you see below are the goals from the comprehensive plan.

137
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:31,653
that feed into the different zoning updates that we've been looking at.

138
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,894
However, these are not the only parts of the zoning process.

139
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:47,399
In fact, the city's been working on it since I believe about the year 2000, as they started their recodification process, which looked at very specific changes to update the zoning.

140
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:53,681
The citywide effort is really focusing on the implementation of these two plans in terms of zoning.

141
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:54,802
Next slide, Paola.

142
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:06,785
So the comprehensive plan had a future land use map, and this is where some of the terminology that we have been using of squares, quarters, neighborhoods, gateways are coming.

143
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:18,434
The blobs, as we refer to them, are the areas that have been of particular focus in different ways of this process, but we are looking at the entire city.

144
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:19,675
Next slide, please.

145
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:30,242
So the general process, the high-level process for approval is that we've been starting with the Planning and Permitting Committee of the City Council, presenting the new topic.

146
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,803
We've generally spent two to three meetings, sometimes more with those presentations.

147
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:42,245
The Planning and Permitting Committee refers it to City Council, who then refers that topic to yourselves, the Community Development Board.

148
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:50,747
You hold your own hearings, as we're doing tonight, and then vote, and your vote is to send a recommendation back to City Council.

149
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:55,625
And then city council takes a final vote on the topic that we are discussing.

150
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:57,867
Next slide please, Paula.

151
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:09,396
This is, although we've been working on this since last spring, these are the most recent dates and these are the planning and permitting committee meetings that we've had since March.

152
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:11,557
You can see the topics for each.

153
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:17,862
And then as we go forward, you can see the top where we have been coming to you, the community development board,

154
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,307
to discuss those same topics.

155
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:22,668
Next one.

156
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:31,591
And then finally, we have inserted because of questions that have come up and a request for more time to talk and think about these topics.

157
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:40,495
The city has sponsored public meetings where we've been able to make the presentations on each of the topics and hear directly from people.

158
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,925
both in person and more recently with the meetings hybrid as well.

159
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:52,411
And then finally, we've been asked for a chart that was a little bit easier to read the most immediate meetings.

160
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:59,296
So we have the public meeting coming up on Monday for parking and transportation demand management.

161
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:05,701
We're back to the planning and permitting committee on Wednesday to talk about the other corridors and start

162
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:16,905
a framework for the institutional district, parking and transportation demand management, and then back to yourselves because of your vote tonight for the residential districts and ADUs.

163
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:18,526
Next slide.

164
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:26,308
And I'm going to turn it over to Pella at this point to discuss the mapping, where we are, and then take you more in depth into tonight's topics.

165
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:26,888
Thank you.

166
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:30,249
Thank you very much.

167
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,510
Madam Chair, if I may, I will continue with the presentation.

168
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:50,753
As Emily was talking about the process, these are, for example, the residential that we are looking for in the next meeting on the 18th.

169
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:59,482
This was the latest and more updated residential neighborhoods that we are working in citywide.

170
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:09,614
And we are looking at this separately because of how it was a structured division, but also to help us build more.

171
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:22,763
First, we try to isolate certain topics, work in depth as much as possible, and then we will bring them back and forth when we insert the other topics.

172
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:27,887
So usually we look at them parallel, but to explain for people, we try to break it down.

173
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,309
So it's a little bit more simple to

174
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:40,413
to explain and to be able to have less information and more broken.

175
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:45,394
So these are the corridors only.

176
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:50,696
We see very faded the residential below, beneath the corridors.

177
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:54,837
But these are the corridors and the squares we already have passed.

178
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:57,104
and studied Mystic and Salem.

179
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:11,532
We are looking today at Medford Square and West Medford, and we're just introducing the corridors that we will see later on Boston Avenue, Harvard Street, Main Street, and Broadway.

180
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:20,752
And here we have them already start to see it, how we apply them all together, both, and how they start work together.

181
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,315
And this will be a discussion for later.

182
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:30,259
We just wanted to explain or to show one of them all together.

183
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:36,044
As Emily also said, we have an interactive map.

184
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:45,989
it has been explained where you can check and it's constantly being updated whenever we make changes to the map so that you can really

185
00:16:48,335 --> 00:17:13,541
go deeper, we have some layers that you can turn on and off with the current zoning, the proposed zoning, the already passed zonings like Salem and Mystic, a lot of different layers as, for example, the existing building types, some of the dimension studies that we have done are in here.

186
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:17,442
Whenever you click into one parcel, you would have on the left

187
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:25,163
the information for that parcel, the requirements for the existing zoning, and the requirements for the proposed zoning.

188
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:35,345
So that is easy to see if it's now conforming or how different it is from the current to the new proposed one.

189
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:46,427
There is a legend and there are some filters that you can use on the arrow here on the right, so that you can filter by neighborhood, by dimension,

190
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,048
different variables.

191
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:52,891
So it's very useful.

192
00:17:53,751 --> 00:18:00,596
People, the feedback that we have is that they like it and it is a bit complex because this is a very complex process.

193
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:09,162
So to make it, we try to make it as simple as possible, but also that there are other features there so that if somebody wants to explore, they can do it.

194
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:15,087
I just want to quickly add that Emily dropped the link to the map in the meeting chat.

195
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,280
perfect.

196
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:25,884
There's also the QR code and it's possible to do it with the phone, but sometimes we understand that it's not so easy and we want to see it in a computer.

197
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:28,426
So there is the link.

198
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,667
So we're going to start with Medford Square.

199
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:40,931
Well, I think that everybody knows where it is, but we want to first start with the existing zoning.

200
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,472
So what is there right now?

201
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:44,733
What is the current zoning and

202
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:49,404
what we can do in that area.

203
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:56,614
So we have four different districts in this boundary that we have.

204
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:00,960
There is the commercial one, apartment two, that's the orange,

205
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:05,115
A lighter orange in here, it's general residential.

206
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:09,936
And then we have single family in this area, the lighter yellow.

207
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,838
So what can we do now with commercial one?

208
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:21,781
We can have residential building up to six stories by right, commercial buildings up to four stories by right.

209
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:27,564
And then any other permitted structures can go up to 15 stories by right.

210
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:30,465
So all in the pinkish area.

211
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:39,454
The more bright orange, the apartment two, we can have residential building, six stories by right.

212
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:42,155
Commercial use is not allowed.

213
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:46,738
And then hotels can be built up to 15 stories by right.

214
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:59,404
General residential, so in these smaller areas, we have single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling, and the ADUs, the accessory dwelling units, the protected use.

215
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:07,987
And then we have single family, single unit dwelling, and then AD use, again, by the protected use.

216
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:17,312
So here we have, if somebody wants to explore, and I don't know if the presentation is already being shared.

217
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:24,896
Otherwise, it will be shared and anyone can go a little bit more in depth of what the current and existing zoning allows.

218
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:28,578
But I'm just going to continue.

219
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:32,995
And if anyone has any question, we can go back to the table and look at it.

220
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:39,140
But I just wanted to give it more of a bigger idea of what is permitted.

221
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,503
So what are we trying to bring?

222
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:46,767
So what is our proposal for the Medford Square area?

223
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,329
We have mixed use one.

224
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:51,904
and that is the light blue.

225
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:55,865
It's basically on the side of High Street.

226
00:20:55,945 --> 00:21:04,329
There are a lot of historical buildings in this area, and they are very, very narrow.

227
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:06,309
Also, there is no way to grow.

228
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,431
There's the Mystic River on the back.

229
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:18,094
What we allow is mixed use one, and this is four stories by right, plus one story of incentive zoning just

230
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:31,093
or if somebody is new to the process, incentive zoning is from a menu that are different strategies for community benefit.

231
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:42,578
And so the developer, if they want to add another story, they will have to choose from that menu and give something back to the community.

232
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,801
So in that incentive zoning, they can do up to one given the total of five, but by right is four.

233
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:51,922
Then we have the blue.

234
00:21:52,502 --> 00:22:05,624
So this darker blue in these areas, and we have mixes to A. This is five stories by right plus two with incentive zoning.

235
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,265
So up to seven with incentive zoning.

236
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:30,252
The purple and it's the darker purple or the more dark one is the mixed-use 2B and it's seven stories by right plus two with incentive zoning so it can go up to nine but it's

237
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,562
all only with incentive signing by right seven.

238
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:38,927
And then we have these more brighter violet or purple, which is mixed use three.

239
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:43,831
This is eight stories by right, plus four, so up to 12.

240
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:49,116
And that is in this area near along the 93 route.

241
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:54,080
So a lot of existing buildings in here already quite tall.

242
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:57,003
And so we just allow them to be

243
00:22:57,718 --> 00:23:05,739
As that, we also studied a little bit of what are the consequences with the 93 on the other side is very, very wide.

244
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,820
So there are no problems with shadows.

245
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,961
And we have the city hall, which also we had some studies, as you can see in this red lines, we did some sections.

246
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:21,202
If anyone wants to see them, we can pull those from our previous presentations.

247
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:25,483
And then we have some neighborhood residential three.

248
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,883
So from single family one,

249
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,074
to neighborhood residential.

250
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:32,475
Three is this area between Governor's Terrell area road.

251
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:50,243
This allow for single unit, two unit, three unit townhouses, historic conversions, and then you can add to all of this ADUs, one by right and another one by special permit.

252
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:56,326
And then urban residential one in these areas as transitions, and these are going to

253
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:01,133
It's from two up to six units residential.

254
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:09,354
So that is for Medford Square, and now we go to West Medford.

255
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:14,615
You're going to see that the districts are very similar, so are the same.

256
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:16,876
We're not changing the districts in this case.

257
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,237
It's just where we apply them.

258
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:25,598
So this is the existing, the current, our current,

259
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:28,016
zoning.

260
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:40,123
And so we have again, these are the same commercial one is the same all the pinkish area along around the T the commuter rail station, which is in this area.

261
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:50,910
And we have residential is residential building six stories commercial building for and other permitted structures up to 15 stories by right.

262
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,591
so in all the pink areas.

263
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:55,753
Then we have general residential.

264
00:24:55,813 --> 00:25:08,400
These are these, as we said before, these orange, very clear orange, and these are the single, two units, and then ADU.

265
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:12,587
Single family one, it's all around is this yellow area.

266
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:19,210
And then apartment one, we have them in corner of High Street and Boston Avenue.

267
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,771
And then we have it along Canal Street.

268
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,593
And these are up to three stories by right.

269
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:26,313
It can be a multifamily.

270
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,975
There is no cap to units.

271
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,736
It's just by height.

272
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,317
And the commercial use is not allowed.

273
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:44,244
So again, we have the table if anyone wants to see them, to see the area as the minimum requirements, and then what we are proposing.

274
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:47,867
So again, we don't have mixed-use 1 in here.

275
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:57,175
We go to mixed-use 2, mixed-use, sorry, mixed-use 2A, mixed-use 2B, and then we have urban residential 2.

276
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:01,758
So in this area, all that is around

277
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:18,642
along High Street, around the commuter rail, Canal Street, all that is back to the rail trails, those are mixed use to B. So seven stories by right, plus two with incentive zoning.

278
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:21,506
also along Harvard Avenue.

279
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:37,553
Just to clarify, everything that is outside that thick black line, that is subject to the larger neighborhood residential, urban residential conversation, where we're specifically talking about what's within this thick black line.

280
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:39,309
Yes, that is correct.

281
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:47,154
We also have, we will talk it later on the corridors because of community and public engagement.

282
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:59,763
They ask us to include this Boston Avenue and high street towards Arlington downtown to have some kind of neighborhood quarters.

283
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:06,408
So we will talk about them in the introduction of the quarters, but for the rest, yes, it's for the residential.

284
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:36,815
And then, so mixed use 2B, and from mixed use 2B, so from the purple towards the residential, we have mixed use 2A, so that's when we see that kind of transition on Boston Avenue, on Prescott Street, and then we have all the

285
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,700
all the rest is urban residential too.

286
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:48,566
And again, this includes the townhouse, three units, from three units, that's the minimum.

287
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:58,314
And then we allow multiplex from four to six, and then any multiple unit dwelling that goes higher than six units, and there is no maximum cap.

288
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:06,240
So yes, just so that we understand, these are the districts and we are only

289
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:12,007
in the squares, it's only what is inside that very thick black line.

290
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:24,217
So we have some district comparison between, so we have the districts Medford Square, West Medford Square, and what is allowed in each of these districts.

291
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:30,081
So mixed use 1B is allowed in Medford Square.

292
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:33,444
We don't have it in West Medford Square.

293
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:38,964
Mixed to A, we have it in both, five stories plus two of incentive zoning.

294
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:42,286
This was the dark blue.

295
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:49,071
Then we have the mixed to B. This is the purple that we just saw, seven stories plus two incentive zoning.

296
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,613
We allow this in both Medford and West Medford.

297
00:28:53,074 --> 00:28:56,816
We have mixed use three, eight stories plus four with incentive zoning.

298
00:28:57,296 --> 00:29:02,380
It's only in Medford Square along the 93, not in West Medford Square.

299
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:08,373
And then the residentials that we have is in Medford Square, we have NR2.

300
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:17,597
And this is one, two units, historic conversion, and then up to two ADUs, one by right and one by special permit.

301
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,460
NR3, I'm sorry, we allowed in West Medford Square.

302
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:29,343
Yeah, so in here, we actually added the area of West Medford.

303
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,008
Yeah, that was my fault, Paula.

304
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:41,393
We had had so many questions about what the adjacencies were to the squares that I wanted to just make sure that they were in the table.

305
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:45,476
So what you and what the chair said earlier is correct.

306
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:54,302
It's the black boundaries that determine what we're talking about, but we wanted to make sure that people understood what was next to those black boundaries.

307
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,204
So I didn't mean to confuse the issue.

308
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:58,045
No, the context is helpful.

309
00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:00,547
So I appreciate them being in the table.

310
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:00,987
Thank you.

311
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:13,391
NR3 is 1 to 3 units, historic conversion, townhouse up to 3, and then up to 2 ADUs per lot, one by ride, one by special permit.

312
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:26,121
UR1 is from 2 to 6 units, so 2 unit, this is your typical duplex, 3 unit, multiplex from 4 to 6, historic conversion, townhouse maximum up to 6.

313
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:33,980
And then the IDUs are only for one in three units, and is one by ride and one by a special permit.

314
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:39,502
And then the urban residential two is from three units.

315
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:41,263
There is no maximum cap.

316
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:55,730
So what we have is multiplex from four to six, multifamily more than six units, then historic conversion townhouses, and then up to two IDUs per lot for one to three unit dwellings.

317
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,804
Again, one by right and one by special permit.

318
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:06,886
So if we see where are inside, we have Medford Square.

319
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:11,367
Inside, we have NR3, UR1, and UR2.

320
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,087
We don't have NR2.

321
00:31:13,587 --> 00:31:21,329
And for West Medford, looking only to what is inside, we have UR2.

322
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,270
We don't have any of this.

323
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,002
So sorry for the confusion, but it's good to have it as a reference.

324
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:29,624
What is the letter?

325
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:39,391
In the last row, going all the way to the left, MX1B is no, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, yes.

326
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:40,512
Perfect.

327
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,233
That's what it should be.

328
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:41,713
Okay.

329
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:42,133
Yes.

330
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:43,575
Yeah.

331
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,797
Just update that for future iterations, if you don't mind.

332
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:47,498
Absolutely.

333
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:47,718
Yeah.

334
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:49,499
Yeah, sorry, it's confusing.

335
00:31:51,060 --> 00:32:03,148
We also wanted to talk that we are working on development standards to protect as much as possible residential districts that are abutting these areas.

336
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,712
So even though they can go quite high, they need to.

337
00:32:07,932 --> 00:32:14,776
So let's say, for example, that we allow in some of these districts, seven stories by right.

338
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:20,004
plus whatever is the incentive zoning.

339
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:25,526
We have certain restrictions when they abide a residential district.

340
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:29,508
And so this was only to study.

341
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:33,630
We have the example was done in this area.

342
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,951
So we are using these sections, which is cutting through.

343
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:41,814
If we take a knife going through this area, the street,

344
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,744
which is Salem Street and Garden Street in here.

345
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:51,027
If we took a knife, this is what we will see in the existing.

346
00:32:53,128 --> 00:33:01,854
What the possibilities would be are shown in these two, the sections that are below.

347
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:13,261
Even we allow a higher than four stories, we need to understand that from we have first is

348
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:15,956
the abutting residential, the height.

349
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:28,539
So we take from the lot line, we throw a 45 degree angle, and they can build up to that angle, it cannot go more than that.

350
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,361
So we make sure that there is enough space.

351
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:35,822
So that's for one.

352
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:39,162
And then the second is the minimum daylight standard.

353
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:40,563
So what we want is that there

354
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:45,190
a lot more complex sun studies than what we have here with the section.

355
00:33:45,210 --> 00:34:04,123
We are looking how to do this, but we want to make sure that there is a protected way to ensure that there is a minimum daylight for the existing residential areas.

356
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:10,107
We are looking into average of time in the months that are the

357
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:24,519
And this is one way that is being done in other countries, which is the average hours of sun in the darkest months, in the sixth darkest half a year that is the darkest.

358
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,964
And so ensure that at least there are two or three hours that are consecutive of sun.

359
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:33,678
So we need to continue to study that.

360
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:41,883
So again, this is to show just that it's not only about what zoning the district allows, but that there are other requirements.

361
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:54,090
And these are going to be development standards that we will incorporate to make sure that the existing residential areas are protected.

362
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,712
And that would be on top of these zoning changes.

363
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:01,433
Yes, so yeah, exactly.

364
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:14,220
You would apply these standards not only to these West Medford and Medford Square, this would be applied citywide?

365
00:35:15,902 --> 00:35:24,967
Yes, so it will be applied for all the corridors, all the districts that are in the corridors and the squares mainly.

366
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:26,188
Okay.

367
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:30,735
So I mean, this is kind of going back.

368
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:40,639
But the Tufts issue is especially poignant in my mind with the issues that area residents had on the shadows that were cast.

369
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:48,062
So if this is done correctly and well, this could potentially prevent issues like that in the future.

370
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:50,283
Yeah.

371
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:50,523
Yes.

372
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:51,504
I'm into it.

373
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:52,404
Thank you.

374
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:53,464
Sure.

375
00:35:55,842 --> 00:36:03,948
And so this is an option that was, there is a lot one and lot two, we have here two lots, one very long, then smaller ones.

376
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:12,515
So if we continue to keep those lot one and lot two, this would be the

377
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:24,350
let's say that the consequences is that you don't have a lot of space in your lot one, so you do the minimum setbacks, and then you have to adhere to these two.

378
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:34,678
But the other chance would be if I combine lot one and two, then I can do a bigger setback, and then I can go higher with also setbacks.

379
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:36,900
So there are many different ways of doing this.

380
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:46,204
But we always want to make sure that these two things are protected so that we always have this angle and then that we also have the minimum daylight.

381
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:58,089
And so I'm going to pause here to see if the board has any question about these squares.

382
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:02,471
Or if you want me to continue with the other corridors, let me know.

383
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:03,681
What do you prefer?

384
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:07,084
I have one question and then I'd love to open it up.

385
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:09,245
Just.

386
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:18,831
Just emphasizing that, like, maybe let's hold on our overall discussion until after we hear quarters, but if there's any clarifying questions that the board has.

387
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:23,213
I'll recognize you and you can ask them.

388
00:37:23,694 --> 00:37:29,957
So I noticed that the MX3 is really only in that one spot next to 93.

389
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:37,235
Is that the only place it'll ever be in Medford?

390
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,618
I mean, you know, right now, I guess.

391
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:43,680
We don't know what future Medfordians are going to do.

392
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:53,669
So for now, it is in this area and then Mystic Avenue, all that it was on along as well, highway.

393
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:58,373
So for now, it's only where we have it in this area and Mystic.

394
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,083
Okay, great.

395
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:02,205
That was my only question.

396
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:04,846
The other ones I interrupted you all.

397
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,587
So I think I got those out.

398
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:14,291
Looking at other members of the board, just raise your hand if you want to be recognized.

399
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:15,371
Peter?

400
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:27,638
Yes, I just have one question about the urban residential two in West Medford Square that seemed to have

401
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:50,646
no upper limit on units and I'm curious what you think will control the units there like I mean obviously looking at the parcels they're pretty small parcels you can't because you can't reasonably fit that much more than six units on them anyway just looking at the size but I just I mean that was just something that I wanted to ask about.

402
00:38:52,907 --> 00:39:00,528
If there was any kind of unit cap here, just expect the, it's just expected that the parcel size will do that on its own.

403
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,509
Emily, do you have any thoughts on that?

404
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:17,831
Yeah, so if I may, if we see the existing around Canal Street and in this area, when we go to apartment one, also there is no cap of units.

405
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:21,572
That's something that we are introducing now, more gradients, so that we also have that

406
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:27,837
missing middle housing, and to give a lot more variety in housing.

407
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:34,643
Right now, your current zoning multifamily is more than three, and it can be three, it can be 100, if the same applies.

408
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:38,005
So we want to do a bigger gradient with that.

409
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,487
Now, your question, absolutely true.

410
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:43,390
In the red areas, we don't have a maximum unit.

411
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:50,676
What we want to make sure is that in this quarter of a mile, we don't have single family or two units.

412
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,697
So that we start with three units.

413
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:56,700
That's basically the thought process behind this.

414
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,663
So there are a lot of other, we have parking requirements.

415
00:40:03,587 --> 00:40:08,049
The lot minimums are quite small, but it will fit only a three unit.

416
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:15,534
With all the different requirements that we have, we have permeable surface, we have landscape, we have parking.

417
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:24,498
So with all that, it's very difficult that in these lots, if they are not combined, that they will make more than three units.

418
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:25,959
Okay, no problem.

419
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:26,299
Thank you.

420
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,361
I just wanted the clarification.

421
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:30,402
I appreciate the thought that went into it.

422
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,797
Any other members of the board with clarifying questions?

423
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:53,601
Peter, you might have just sparked a question for me, but I'm using the interactive zoning viewer to potentially answer on my own.

424
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:55,842
You can always ask.

425
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:08,268
But I'm glad to hear you say that, because that is what we were hoping that people would do with the interactive viewer, is really explore it.

426
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:13,329
The layers we put in there are very much tied to the questions we've heard throughout the process.

427
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,531
So I think that would allow people to get more data on their own and inform their thinking on it.

428
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,312
So glad to hear you're using it.

429
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,212
Yeah, I think I answered my own question.

430
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:32,878
It was, um, you made a comment about, you know, we want to make sure that there's no single family within a quarter mile.

431
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:38,693
ish of the West Medford commuter rail station.

432
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:42,794
I was trying to figure out like, you know, how many single families are there now.

433
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:53,277
Because the other thing with this zoning is, you know, we need to make it super clear that this is not requiring anyone to do anything differently with their property now.

434
00:41:53,777 --> 00:42:02,079
If you live in a single family home, you are not required to, you know, add another unit by any means.

435
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,760
It just means that

436
00:42:04,737 --> 00:42:10,860
you know, if you as the landowner were interested in developing, you could add more units.

437
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:13,581
Exactly.

438
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:19,424
And it's not a prohibition in any way, shape or form or a change to existing single family.

439
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:23,466
It is a prohibition on new single family that is not replacing.

440
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:26,187
I think we've had this conversation before.

441
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:39,415
Yeah, but yeah, anybody who owns a single family now in any of these districts are protected on your under your current non conforming provisions and the ordinance.

442
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:48,713
And just to also add to that, the protection is you can tear it down, rebuild a single family.

443
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:55,519
You can even add, I think it's double of what you already have of girls floor area.

444
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:05,888
And you could add also ADUs, for example, because it's also for the, so if you want to build an ADU, you're very welcome to do it.

445
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:08,250
So the protections are quite high.

446
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:09,713
Great.

447
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:11,315
Thanks for clarifying.

448
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:13,456
John, I see your hand.

449
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:14,978
Do you have a question?

450
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:15,078
Yes.

451
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,819
Yes, to Paula.

452
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:23,204
Those rights that the single family owner would have, those are by right?

453
00:43:23,224 --> 00:43:31,791
I mean, or would that require a trip to get a, what do you call it, a variance?

454
00:43:35,217 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm pulling up the, sorry to jump in on your answer, Paul.

455
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,823
I just want to let everybody know I'm pulling up the section now, and I'll put it into the chat.

456
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:55,612
I mean, I know of people who have a home that's non-conforming for one reason or another.

457
00:43:56,373 --> 00:44:02,156
And just about anything they need to do, anything they want to do with it requires a hearing, notifying the neighbors.

458
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:05,198
Is it a detriment to the community, et cetera, et cetera.

459
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,640
I'm sorry.

460
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:14,462
I'm going to defer that question to Emily.

461
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:16,803
Do you know, Emily, if that meets the variance?

462
00:44:19,098 --> 00:44:32,942
So it says if the building commissioner determines that the proposed alteration extension or change exceeds all of this, exceeds the criteria that are set forth, then the Board of Appeals would need to do a special permit.

463
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,472
which is a slightly lower bar than a variance.

464
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:40,335
A variance can be quite tough, so it gives a special permit process.

465
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:50,582
But if the, by extension, if the language is, if the criteria is met, then the building commissioner can make that determination.

466
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:54,805
So I'm putting the section number on.

467
00:44:54,865 --> 00:45:00,129
I'm just about to put the link on so people can find it and read it themselves.

468
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:02,531
But there's no need for the variance.

469
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:09,155
It would either be a building commissioner determination or a special permit based on the criteria.

470
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:16,280
And to clarify, the special permit would be issued by the Zoning Board of Appeals?

471
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:16,740
Yeah.

472
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,401
So people don't always

473
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:33,665
know what the difference is, that a variance is a very tough legal test, and a special permit is a much easier thing to receive, but it does involve going to the Board of Appeals.

474
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:46,567
How many non-conforming structures are there in this West Medford Square area?

475
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,102
That is a very good question.

476
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,563
We did some analysis in the very beginning.

477
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:56,086
The nonconformities in Medford are quite high.

478
00:45:56,106 --> 00:46:02,590
In this area, because it's very historic, I can imagine that there are a lot of nonconforming existing.

479
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:09,775
So the single family requires already, single family one that I think applies

480
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:15,286
here requires already a 7,000 square foot lot as minimum.

481
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:19,889
So you're going to have a lot of non-conforming existing.

482
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:31,759
We can absolutely prepare for next time a non-conforming map for the lot area and certain requirements that are already there.

483
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:42,131
And we had done a lot of the nonconforming analysis back last June, actually, and discussed it with the Planning and Permitting Committee.

484
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:48,933
I believe those maps are all online now, but we don't have the exact number in this particular area.

485
00:46:49,193 --> 00:46:56,356
But we could certainly research that and bring it back to you, and as Paola said, show a localized map of the work that we did last year.

486
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,498
Since you brought up the issue of historic structures,

487
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:04,873
I would like to ask this.

488
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:08,063
There'll be a lot of economic incentive.

489
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:17,286
for a lot of people to give up their single family home to construct something much bigger with many more units.

490
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,169
And of course, that's part of the point of what you're doing.

491
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:33,922
I guess my question is, what protections are there to kind of maintain the historic character of the area and also the streetscape?

492
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:45,914
We also have the historic conversion, even though it's more on the outside of this area.

493
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:48,878
So we do have a historic conversion, which is

494
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:59,666
Anything that instead of tearing the house and building a new one, just to be able to add new units into that historic building.

495
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:13,690
So we do want to preserve the historic character and it's an easier way to build more units and preserve that historical character of the area, which we do have in West Medford.

496
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:22,223
And I'll add that zoning is an imperfect tool for historic preservation, unfortunately.

497
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:36,056
So we have tried to consider it in different ways as we looked at the different geographic areas, as Paola mentioned, for the residential, which includes the urban residential too, in the West Medford Square here.

498
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:45,713
the idea of historic conversion to create an incentive for people to keep those existing buildings and make fairly minor modifications to allow

499
00:48:46,514 --> 00:49:09,626
uh, entry into, uh, additional units within it, um, in terms of, uh, some of the other things that we have talked about that aren't part of tonight's public hearing, but with accessory dwelling units, uh, we in, in consultation with the planning and permitting committee and city staff are proposing a special permit for historic, uh, accessory structures.

500
00:49:09,706 --> 00:49:12,307
So for example, if somebody has a carriage house or a barn,

501
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:16,305
There's a relaxation to be able to do an accessory dwelling unit.

502
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:38,382
Part of today's conversation in terms of the squares in Medford Square, Paola mentioned the area along the river that is basically a historic block is not really suitable for a lot of redevelopment in terms of the parcel depths, the adjacency to the river, the adjacency to the seawall in the river.

503
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:47,929
So by making that mixed use one, we are effectively zoning it for what it already is and providing some protections there.

504
00:49:47,949 --> 00:50:04,021
If additional historic protection is of interest to the board and to the community and to the City Council, as we look at the incentive zoning, we may be able to place some additional incentives around historic development in that.

505
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:12,745
In terms of the streetscape, again, for the public right-of-way, zoning doesn't address the public right-of-way.

506
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:28,473
However, the green score that the City passed earlier this year, while it does address principally stormwater management and other components, has aspects of it that on the private side can reinforce the streetscape.

507
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:45,436
In Mystic Avenue, we started with that, and then in other portions of this, we have requirements to widen the sidewalk on the private property side so that there is a wider sidewalk that would allow for

508
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:49,459
a better, more active use of the area.

509
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,380
That's also built into some of these.

510
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,522
Of course, that only comes into play with a redevelopment of a parcel, not with a historic building.

511
00:50:56,922 --> 00:51:12,710
There are waiver provisions under certain circumstances, but we are considering how and where zoning can contribute to both historic preservation and the

512
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:17,521
the public experience of being on the street and the streetscape.

513
00:51:19,762 --> 00:51:24,046
I appreciate all of those comments and also that, of course, zoning is an imperfect tool.

514
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:34,974
One of the things I noticed in the comprehensive plan was the idea that the Community Development Board could actually come up with design standards.

515
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:39,317
Now, is that part of this effort?

516
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:41,459
Because it would seem to me that that would

517
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:49,133
close a lot of gaps, which your zoning-based approach just can't do?

518
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:51,996
Yeah, that's a great question.

519
00:51:52,236 --> 00:51:56,060
So there's two ways that we can think about it relative to zoning.

520
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:05,328
I break up the design standards and design guidelines are used in so many different ways that people get very confused about what you're talking about.

521
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,251
I usually talk about development standards, which are mandatory.

522
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:11,751
They're baked into the zoning.

523
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:21,315
We do have those in all of the districts, and we will be continuing to refine them based on public comment and probably do another round of changes.

524
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:34,386
at the end of the process, but the development standards speak to the criteria that you, the Community Development Board, would be using in both site plan review and in the special permit process.

525
00:52:35,547 --> 00:52:42,492
So they deal with access, stormwater management, lighting, trash management,

526
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:46,933
the relationship of buildings to the lot and to adjacent buildings.

527
00:52:47,613 --> 00:53:01,037
When you start getting into components of building style, yeah, actually these development standards here that Paola talked about earlier and is illustrating now, those are development standards that would be in the zoning that would be mandatory to meet.

528
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,977
with a possible waiver for certain types of them.

529
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:21,587
When you start talking about architectural styles, materials, colors, going into that, we usually recommend design guidelines which the CD board can adopt and use in the site plan review and in the special permit process.

530
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:30,295
Those are, when you say to people that they're advisory, people often think, oh, that must mean that they're weak.

531
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:35,080
But in fact, they can be a powerful tool for discussions between members of the board.

532
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:46,904
a development team, and members of the public, because it allows a community to define what they value, what they think is important, either citywide or neighborhood by neighborhood.

533
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:53,970
And then the board has a tool that they can say to, you know, a developer, these are the things we want to see out of your proposal.

534
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,692
So it can be a very powerful tool for those discussions.

535
00:53:58,012 --> 00:54:09,814
Typically by making the process and the discussion shorter, it's generally in a developer's best interest to work with the community with their design guidelines, but they don't have the same teeth as a development standard in the zoning.

536
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:14,775
So that's usually how we think of breaking those two into two different sections.

537
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:23,797
Would it be possible to require design review for any new building that's built within a particular district?

538
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:29,917
Yeah, another great question.

539
00:54:30,077 --> 00:54:38,601
We tend to be very careful about design reviews, so it doesn't typically apply to, say, single-family homes unless you have a local historic district.

540
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:46,604
So one of the other things about historic preservation is we'll get comments from people in communities saying, oh, well, it's a National Register district.

541
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:48,705
It must be protected, and it's not.

542
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:54,808
It's the local historic district that provides the protections, and historical commissions can have their own design.

543
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:59,171
Um, guidelines and review for that, although it tends which we do.

544
00:54:59,752 --> 00:55:00,773
Yes, exactly.

545
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:04,195
So, you know, that that sits kind of adjacent to the zoning.

546
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:10,601
Um, so, in terms of reviewing every single building, we would have to look at.

547
00:55:12,146 --> 00:55:24,729
A, some of the protections under the Zoning Act for single family and other uses, and then B, generally it's more effective when it's tied to a threshold such as site plan review and special permit.

548
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:38,112
The smaller projects that might fall under building commissioner or an administrative site review typically don't trigger a design review process, but it's certainly something we can continue to discuss.

549
00:55:38,372 --> 00:55:39,592
I appreciate you bringing it up.

550
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:44,333
And I certainly wouldn't advocate for design review for single-family homes.

551
00:55:44,993 --> 00:55:48,674
That would just go against all custom, you know?

552
00:55:48,694 --> 00:55:49,134
Right.

553
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:49,974
Exactly.

554
00:55:50,194 --> 00:55:50,634
Exactly.

555
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:51,815
It's not commonly done.

556
00:55:51,835 --> 00:55:53,715
Thank you.

557
00:55:57,296 --> 00:55:59,576
Coming out strong in your debut meeting, John.

558
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:00,597
Those are some great questions.

559
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:01,937
Oh, thank you.

560
00:56:02,337 --> 00:56:03,397
I really appreciate it.

561
00:56:04,137 --> 00:56:05,298
I tried to do a little homework.

562
00:56:06,118 --> 00:56:07,058
Yes, as we should.

563
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,468
Any other questions from members of the board?

564
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,150
Penny, I see your hand.

565
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:21,274
We are not doing public comment at this point, but we will be doing that after we hear about the corridors.

566
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:23,336
So keep that hand ready.

567
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:26,738
We will hear from the public shortly.

568
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:33,929
Um, maybe 1 last question, and I feel like I think I know the answer, but I want to ask it anyways.

569
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,051
In the old zoning or in the present zoning.

570
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:43,114
You know, buildings up to 15 stories are allowed in some areas.

571
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:45,896
I feel that, like, that number has kind of been kind of floating around.

572
00:56:46,757 --> 00:56:49,879
It's almost like a scary way.

573
00:56:51,125 --> 00:57:02,297
So I'm wondering, how did we come up with the four, five, seven, eight plus incentives for the number of stories?

574
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:03,899
Was it pulled out of a hat?

575
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:06,182
Was it based on, I don't know?

576
00:57:06,962 --> 00:57:07,983
your lottery numbers.

577
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:09,744
I'd love to hear some thoughts on that.

578
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,686
Because I know it's not those two things.

579
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:15,469
Definitely not pulled out of the hat or the lottery numbers.

580
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:17,811
And I'll let Pallas speak to some of this as well.

581
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:29,020
I think we heard loud and clear through various discussions that sort of 15 throughout the city was not an appropriate, 15 stories throughout the city was not an appropriate number.

582
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,742
Some of it is,

583
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:40,789
Some of it is based on building code for the change between structures, right?

584
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:51,916
You can go up to, I think it's six stories, six built, and after that, you need to be moving into steel construction, but you can also have a certain number of stories on top of a podium.

585
00:57:52,587 --> 00:57:57,953
So, hearing or understanding from past work what might be feasible to do.

586
00:57:58,053 --> 00:58:01,477
I think actually the image that Pella has on screen is a good one.

587
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:08,645
That middle image where you see the gray parking, that is a podium parking and the building is kind of wrapping around it.

588
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:15,086
And we like to see that because underground parking is very expensive to do.

589
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:28,149
But this way of building the podium parking and then putting on the main street, the ground floor commercial and the residential above keeps that active streetscape, that walkable streetscape that we've talked about.

590
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:33,231
So part of it was understanding how this works.

591
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:38,592
And then I think the other thing, and Polly may want to speak to this as well, but the idea that the base

592
00:58:39,592 --> 00:58:54,602
The base should be reasonable, right, the base number of floors should be reasonable, but that we wanted the higher heights to be tied to those public benefits, and so figuring out what level of height above base

593
00:58:55,162 --> 00:58:58,665
would make sense for the type of benefits we were asking for, right?

594
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:04,850
You want to get something out of the development that's important for the public, so it's a balance.

595
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:20,923
I think we've received a lot of input on that balance that I certainly appreciate from the public comment, but making the incentive zoning desirable so that the community will get those public benefits was part of that.

596
00:59:21,283 --> 00:59:22,745
Pally, I don't know if you want to add anything else.

597
00:59:24,054 --> 00:59:36,442
Yes, so we do a lot of internal studies and analysis of the height and basically how would it feel walking on those streets.

598
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:37,823
So we do a lot of sections.

599
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:43,226
As you see here, all these red lines were sections that we've shown.

600
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:46,448
And so that height goes

601
00:59:48,479 --> 01:00:05,107
depends on how high we can go without starting to cast shadow on both sides of the street and how the tunnel starts to feel very tight, if the lots are quite big and deep.

602
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:13,171
And so we know that there can be a lot of setbacks and setbacks to make that height a lot more livable and breathable.

603
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,953
And so we do a lot of internal fit studies

604
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:19,872
see a little of parking, et cetera.

605
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:27,836
And we try to see within certain requirements, the existing and how those could change how much we can really go.

606
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:37,221
And so we always need to think about not only what we can do right now, but where the tendencies are going in our trends of living and et cetera.

607
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:42,744
And so how that could be flexible enough so we can adapt to those new ways of living.

608
01:00:43,861 --> 01:00:53,731
uh, cars, et cetera, are going decreasing the number of cars that we, and each family owns, the families are smaller than what it used to be, uh, 50 years ago.

609
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,873
So the types of buildings and.

610
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:56,713
Yeah.

611
01:00:56,814 --> 01:01:01,878
So we try to give that flexibility, not only for the now, but also what it will be.

612
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:05,462
Those numbers will come in with those analysis.

613
01:01:05,482 --> 01:01:06,663
Sure.

614
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,856
and community comments as well.

615
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:14,579
Community staff, city council comments, et cetera.

616
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:20,103
Yes, I'm very much looking forward to comments from my fellow board members and the public.

617
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:21,704
Last question.

618
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:23,025
I promise this is the last.

619
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:24,326
OK.

620
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:35,533
I don't know if everybody else thinks it's ugly, but we have our little parking blobs on those two bottom sections.

621
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:41,558
I completely recognize that, you know, parking is necessary.

622
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,624
But like, let's say we reduce the parking requirements.

623
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:52,688
Would that gray blob be replaced with other uses?

624
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:54,890
Yes, absolutely.

625
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:55,591
So, okay.

626
01:01:56,268 --> 01:02:02,974
This is only, and again, every time that we do a section and show a section, it's not what it has to be there.

627
01:02:03,074 --> 01:02:06,537
It's just a potential development that could happen.

628
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:15,084
We just want to make sure that we show that we want to activate the street, so the active uses are towards the street, and to show how that could be done.

629
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:19,368
But absolutely, we want also flexibility on the parking so that

630
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:31,217
that can change and become more residential or bigger commercial area, maybe with surface parking in the back is more than enough.

631
01:02:32,758 --> 01:02:35,520
And that is the flexibility that we're talking about, right?

632
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:43,985
If those numbers change, if there is more public transit and there are more reductions, how this can be adapted.

633
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:56,970
And I'll just add what you're saying, maybe for people who are listening in today who aren't used to seeing as sections, is that that gray blob is the interior of the lot, right?

634
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:05,415
So what you're seeing that's facing the street is the commercial ground floor on the bottom and the residential above.

635
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:13,520
But you make a critical point, which is if you're thinking of the ground plane of the lot, the base of the lot,

636
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:20,356
There's different uses that are competing for that base, right?

637
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:27,958
You've got either the building itself or the open space, the green space, or the parking.

638
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:29,258
So those three.

639
01:03:29,298 --> 01:03:33,580
So if you reduce one, then you have opportunities for others.

640
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:42,962
So if you think about a more suburban area, an area of single families, you've got the house, you've got the driveway, and you've got a lot more green usually.

641
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:45,128
as a percentage of the lot.

642
01:03:45,228 --> 01:03:51,950
As you come into the more urbanization, that's when you have to start thinking more about how these relate to each other.

643
01:03:52,030 --> 01:04:07,977
And so, as Paola said, the flexibility, creating something that provides flexibility over time in how these uses are arranged on a lot is really important, but part of the development standards are to guide them, so guide future development.

644
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:20,115
so that you have the active spaces that are facing the street, and then the remainder can be the parking, the open space, and there are opportunities to deal with that.

645
01:04:20,135 --> 01:04:24,457
We have some sections, for example, where you can see the green on top of the parking, right?

646
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:28,799
So that parking deck isn't just a parking deck.

647
01:04:28,919 --> 01:04:31,580
It may be providing a green amenity space.

648
01:04:32,147 --> 01:04:33,648
for the residents on there.

649
01:04:33,868 --> 01:04:37,290
So there are other ways of using that.

650
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:43,874
And we've tried to think about how you set the rules to make that options for future development.

651
01:04:45,075 --> 01:04:45,595
Very nice.

652
01:04:47,056 --> 01:04:47,216
Cool.

653
01:04:47,236 --> 01:04:49,197
All right.

654
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:56,281
So with that, I think we're ready to go on to the introduction to the draft corridors.

655
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:57,442
Yes.

656
01:04:59,242 --> 01:04:59,622
Perfect.

657
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:04,224
If I may then, I will start with the introduction of the other corridors.

658
01:05:05,725 --> 01:05:25,433
The corridors that have been identified were Boston Avenue, Main Street, Broadway, Harvard Street, and then, as we said, by community request, we did in West Medford the High Street and Boston Avenue part, which are smaller and neighborhood-scale type of corridors.

659
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:30,105
Just a quick logistical note on this and reminder to the board.

660
01:05:31,025 --> 01:05:38,091
This topic has not been referred to us yet, so we're not opening a public hearing on it.

661
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,433
This is just for context.

662
01:05:41,614 --> 01:05:48,979
We can still ask questions, of course, but just giving a little bit of context for us all.

663
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,600
I'm sorry about that, Paola.

664
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,161
Please continue.

665
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,470
You can interrupt me whenever you want.

666
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:54,870
That's totally fine.

667
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,592
And ask all the questions you want.

668
01:05:58,312 --> 01:05:58,812
Sure.

669
01:05:59,653 --> 01:06:05,275
So here are the existing, again, I'm going to zoom in this area of the corridors.

670
01:06:05,415 --> 01:06:07,596
These are the corridors that we want to talk about.

671
01:06:09,157 --> 01:06:12,078
Again, the corridors that we saw before are the same.

672
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:13,379
These are the existing ones.

673
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:20,162
We have C1, that's the commercial, and we have them in all those pink areas.

674
01:06:20,827 --> 01:06:31,291
some in Boston Avenue, intersection between Harvard Street and Main Street, and then at the Broadway line between Somerville.

675
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:42,136
And again, some of the cuts between Somerville and Medford, especially in Broadway, but also

676
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:46,782
some a little bit more in here on the west side.

677
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:52,964
These are, they are cutting through lots.

678
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:57,326
So it's very difficult to put them together.

679
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:02,088
That's why there has been a study in Broadway between Medford and Somerville.

680
01:07:02,548 --> 01:07:09,210
And so what you will see is a little bit of that, what it came out from that study.

681
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:16,790
that Medford and Somerville did on that corridor.

682
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:26,814
So commercial one, again, residential building, six stories by right, commercial, four stories by right, other permitted structures, 15 stories by right.

683
01:07:28,034 --> 01:07:37,758
Apartment one is this kind of salmon color that we can find in Main Street and in Boston Avenue area.

684
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:42,377
And so we have residential building, no cup of maximum units.

685
01:07:43,499 --> 01:07:44,141
They are only

686
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,224
let's say that they are capped by the height and it's three stories by right.

687
01:07:51,024 --> 01:07:56,608
We have a little bit of industrial area in Boston Avenue towards Broadway.

688
01:07:57,189 --> 01:08:00,671
We have office to Boston Avenue.

689
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:09,318
This is the north area that goes towards Somerville and they are permitting six stories by right.

690
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:20,175
then the rest of this orange is that is mainly everywhere is the general residential one in two units.

691
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:27,719
And then we have the single family, which is mainly on the high street on West Medford area.

692
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:35,725
And so what the proposal is, as we have said many times, we want to try to

693
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:45,772
place the density where we have services, public transit, job opportunities.

694
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:49,073
And so the corridors are mainly those areas.

695
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:57,435
So we want to also bring mixed uses that are not allowed in all of these residential districts.

696
01:08:57,902 --> 01:09:00,785
that are not allowed in Apartment 1, for example.

697
01:09:01,306 --> 01:09:07,332
And so we want to bring Mixed Use 1B, Mixed Use 2A, Mixed Use 2B.

698
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:15,881
There is only one area with Mixed Use 2B, and it's where we have right now the Office 2 area on Boston Avenue.

699
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:18,865
And then we have

700
01:09:19,965 --> 01:09:24,686
mainly mixed use one on the northern part of Main Street.

701
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:34,308
In this area, we have a lot of commercial, existing commercial, and it's not allowed in by the current zoning because it's in apartment one.

702
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:48,530
We want to make them conforming and be able to do any changes or have more residential on top or whatever they consider it's good for their business as well.

703
01:09:49,327 --> 01:09:59,372
So we are doing all that apartment one, we are converting them into mixed use 1B, and it's four stories by right, plus one of incentive zoning.

704
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:10,797
Then we have in the, wherever we have usually intersections, or there is something important of a public space.

705
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:16,019
And so intersection we have on Harvard and Main Street,

706
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:20,107
which is already allowing six stories by right on the current zoning.

707
01:10:21,688 --> 01:10:24,289
We have Metrotops Park.

708
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:28,430
We have also increased the possibility for height.

709
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:45,597
And then where we have intersections, we go, or that existing buildings are already higher, we bring that higher of mixed use to A, which is five stories by right, plus two with incentive zoning.

710
01:10:46,608 --> 01:10:54,312
Um, and then we have the urban residential to, um, in the, in the rest of the areas, um, which.

711
01:10:55,053 --> 01:11:01,376
We bring, um, urban residential to three stories plus one with incentives.

712
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:02,277
So here we are.

713
01:11:02,877 --> 01:11:07,940
Um, this is an update that we had from the previous urban residential to.

714
01:11:09,136 --> 01:11:16,440
we are proposing to have three stories plus one, so it can go up to four with incentive zoning.

715
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:23,023
In the area of the West Metro, what we wanted is to make conforming what is there.

716
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:27,886
So wherever we have business, that block is converted into mixed use one.

717
01:11:29,006 --> 01:11:32,668
So again, we want the smallest scale in these areas.

718
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:34,787
We don't want to go very high.

719
01:11:35,767 --> 01:11:44,516
So we go for the four stories by right, one incentive zoning, mixed use 1B on High Street on the southern side.

720
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:48,459
So wherever we have the existing business.

721
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:54,585
And then at the very end, because there is, if I'm not mistaken, some restaurants in here,

722
01:11:56,584 --> 01:12:06,770
At Boston Avenue, West Medford area, just in the south, we have the urban residential, sorry, the mixed-use one.

723
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:10,892
We have a small area of urban residential one.

724
01:12:11,012 --> 01:12:12,973
Sorry, that is not on the legend.

725
01:12:13,113 --> 01:12:14,974
That is a mistake from my side.

726
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:19,177
We have a very small area of urban residential one.

727
01:12:19,337 --> 01:12:24,820
This was up to six units, from two to six units on the very end.

728
01:12:25,794 --> 01:12:38,481
We have some changes in here that will come later to do more NR3 because certain street is not really able to get through, so it creates a little bit of dangerous area.

729
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:45,205
So some parcels in here will be changed and then we have some also

730
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:52,142
urban residential one in connection with Somerville at the very end of Main Street.

731
01:12:52,582 --> 01:13:00,507
So very small also in here, this little triangle, mainly because it cannot grow.

732
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:11,112
It's not possible to do urban residential two, or there is some kind of problematic areas with circulation and streets.

733
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:14,594
So these are the

734
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:20,244
the existing districts and the existing proposal.

735
01:13:20,664 --> 01:13:28,526
We had community engagement last week, so we need to add those comments into this map.

736
01:13:29,186 --> 01:13:31,087
It stays pretty much the same.

737
01:13:31,567 --> 01:13:34,148
There will be some adjustments in

738
01:13:35,559 --> 01:13:37,420
Boston Avenue on this side.

739
01:13:38,301 --> 01:13:41,023
There are some existing business, so we want to include them.

740
01:13:41,863 --> 01:13:45,786
And it came from public comment.

741
01:13:46,847 --> 01:13:49,489
They will be mixed use 1B.

742
01:13:49,649 --> 01:13:57,755
So it will stay on the lower scale so that it's transitioning to the neighborhood in this area.

743
01:13:59,296 --> 01:14:01,857
Not very big changes in general.

744
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:08,730
they were quite positive, that's what I can tell you from the community engagement that we had.

745
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:31,059
So to look at the comparisons so that you can have them all in the table, and these are really focusing inside these areas, these corridors, we have mixes 1B, four stories plus one, mix 1 to A, five plus two, mix to B, seven plus two.

746
01:14:32,765 --> 01:15:00,586
mixes one mixes three we don't have it anywhere so we just as you can see no no no no we don't have it mixed to be it's only on boston avenue where we have office two right now on the very north part towards somerville that is the only place we have it otherwise we do not have any of this district mixes to a we have in so not in the west metford areas

747
01:15:02,266 --> 01:15:05,948
because we only go with the very lowest mixed use that we have.

748
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:18,496
And then on Boston Avenue, Main Street, Harvard Street, and Broadway, we do have some in certain intersections, certain areas where we could go higher.

749
01:15:19,076 --> 01:15:20,637
That's where we have it.

750
01:15:21,137 --> 01:15:28,622
And then mixed use 1B, we have it everywhere except for Harvard Street, because the intersection, as we showed

751
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,099
are mainly as it is already six stories by right right now.

752
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:40,282
So we let them in mixes to a five by right plus two with incentive zoning.

753
01:15:40,862 --> 01:15:43,203
And then the rest is mainly residential.

754
01:15:43,603 --> 01:15:46,024
And then this will belong to Boston Avenue.

755
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:52,186
So and then we have urban residential one urban residential to

756
01:15:53,192 --> 01:16:01,138
We do have Urban Residential 1, as I was explaining, in very smaller areas on Boston Avenue and Main Street.

757
01:16:02,139 --> 01:16:09,165
And then we have Urban Residential 2 in all of them as filling that residential areas.

758
01:16:10,146 --> 01:16:12,047
So it's allowed in every corridor.

759
01:16:13,688 --> 01:16:19,433
Again, just to remember, the UR2 is three stories by right plus one incentive zoning.

760
01:16:22,818 --> 01:16:25,218
That's the overall.

761
01:16:25,779 --> 01:16:28,019
Now questions, please ask.

762
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:41,882
Now I kicked off questions last time, but I see John's hand.

763
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:45,823
It's a quick one.

764
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:47,903
Just looking at the map.

765
01:16:49,595 --> 01:17:00,341
These sort of large gray areas like Greenleaf Avenue, Brooklyn Street, how are those areas zoned?

766
01:17:04,043 --> 01:17:05,924
You know, like if you go down Boston Avenue.

767
01:17:05,944 --> 01:17:11,067
Right, those are the residential districts, so they'll be the subject of the June 18th meeting.

768
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:14,269
Okay, so now the block

769
01:17:14,903 --> 01:17:18,304
line around Mystic Avenue.

770
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:19,524
That's one of the corridors.

771
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:26,725
Yeah, the two black lines, the ones that have the black lines around them are the ones that have already been approved.

772
01:17:26,805 --> 01:17:28,146
We wanted to call them out.

773
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:28,686
Okay.

774
01:17:28,986 --> 01:17:29,206
Yeah.

775
01:17:29,306 --> 01:17:29,606
Okay.

776
01:17:29,806 --> 01:17:30,186
Okay.

777
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:36,087
So it's, it's, it's the, the blue, green, purple and red colors today.

778
01:17:36,407 --> 01:17:36,667
Yeah.

779
01:17:36,868 --> 01:17:37,188
Okay.

780
01:17:37,668 --> 01:17:38,108
Thank you.

781
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:39,048
You're welcome.

782
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:47,185
Any other board questions?

783
01:17:49,546 --> 01:17:51,547
And I do see hands from members of the public.

784
01:17:51,567 --> 01:18:03,034
So I want to remind you all that we're going to be taking public comment after board questions, and the public comment should be focused on Medford Square and West Medford Square.

785
01:18:03,614 --> 01:18:14,260
The reason we're hearing the corridors is to try to provide some additional context on the connection between the districts, Medford Square and West Medford Square.

786
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:19,838
And also please refrain from messaging any members of the board through chat.

787
01:18:20,799 --> 01:18:21,959
It's not part of the public record.

788
01:18:22,419 --> 01:18:30,724
So we just wanna make sure that any comments are either sent via email or mentioned in the public hearing.

789
01:18:37,288 --> 01:18:44,252
All right, if there's no board questions about the other corridors,

790
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:46,676
Um.

791
01:19:02,975 --> 01:19:21,603
I think what we usually do is, and I kind of want to pull the board first, is what we have been doing in the past is hearing public comment and then doing a larger discussion with our comments, our thoughts and feedback, as well as the public.

792
01:19:22,864 --> 01:19:24,445
Is that something that we'd like to do again?

793
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:30,247
I don't think I need a motion on this, but like, okay, cool.

794
01:19:30,507 --> 01:19:31,708
I think it makes sense to.

795
01:19:32,419 --> 01:19:36,202
do that to be able to incorporate what we hear from the public in our final discussion.

796
01:19:36,402 --> 01:19:36,823
I agree.

797
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:37,203
Okay.

798
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:38,484
Awesome.

799
01:19:39,845 --> 01:19:40,386
Thanks, gang.

800
01:19:41,427 --> 01:19:48,012
So if people are eager to participate in the public comment period, please go ahead and raise your hand.

801
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:50,174
I'm going to read the

802
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,653
I'm going to read the standard blurb.

803
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:16,266
I would ask that if people have something that's not a name, like iPhone or a bunch of numbers, if you wouldn't mind just changing it to a name, even if it's just your first name, that'll help us.

804
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:21,131
that'll help us just kind of call your name when you're ready.

805
01:20:21,412 --> 01:20:28,120
And we do ask everybody to say their name and address as part of their comment to put it into the public record.

806
01:20:29,081 --> 01:20:32,345
So I see an admin, I see

807
01:20:38,511 --> 01:20:39,372
What else do I see?

808
01:20:39,392 --> 01:20:40,312
I see an iPhone.

809
01:20:40,332 --> 01:20:49,715
If you're not planning to comment, then like, you know, don't worry about it, but it'll just help us kind of keep track and make sure that everybody has an opportunity to speak.

810
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:53,736
I know that, where are they?

811
01:20:53,756 --> 01:20:57,457
I think Rick or Rich had raised their hand.

812
01:20:57,637 --> 01:21:01,098
So I don't want to make sure that they're in the mix too.

813
01:21:05,272 --> 01:21:09,615
If you're having any trouble with technology, just ping us.

814
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:13,377
Alicia, did you want to say something before I did my blurb?

815
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:29,894
I have one comment for that, but I also have, I would like to maybe comment on some of the zoning, but for the public comment, just as a member of the staff in between the board and the public.

816
01:21:30,474 --> 01:21:32,035
Okay, so let's do that.

817
01:21:33,396 --> 01:21:35,577
And then I'll read my blurb.

818
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:41,079
But in the meantime, members of the public, if you do wanna participate, please go ahead and raise your hand.

819
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,021
Alicia, great.

820
01:21:45,437 --> 01:21:57,760
So one of the things that as the presentation was going on and the board was asking questions, particularly about parking, I did want to sort of raise this conceptually.

821
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:04,242
So as you are aware, we've put out the Medford Square RFP for these lots.

822
01:22:04,762 --> 01:22:08,963
And it's part of that we put out sort of conceptually what we thought we were looking for.

823
01:22:09,623 --> 01:22:13,166
and how much parking we thought was necessary as part of that.

824
01:22:14,107 --> 01:22:19,531
And we asked for proposals, and we have been test fitting the proposal against the zoning.

825
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:31,560
And one of the things that has come up is this idea that on sort of the main, most main roads like Riverside have, we can do active frontage, which is what we want.

826
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,221
We would love to have everywhere.

827
01:22:34,122 --> 01:22:35,963
But even with a parking garage,

828
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:46,725
in order to support the residential and the uses that we are looking at, we need the side streets.

829
01:22:47,146 --> 01:22:59,612
So it's a full, if you look at it as almost a full block, to actually have first floor parking under that with just the front edge on the main street being active.

830
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:17,723
And I'm phrasing it that way, not because I'm necessarily saying we should change the zoning to allow what we ask for in our RFP, but rather to acknowledge the amount of parking that we actually think is necessary and how that takes up space and how that takes up frontage.

831
01:23:18,263 --> 01:23:28,065
And this desire for frontage on our streets to be active, but also we may need to be flexible about that

832
01:23:29,019 --> 01:23:42,142
in terms of how does it actually work in the amount of parking that is necessary, because one would love to take the bus everywhere and the Chi and bicycle and walk, but it's not always possible.

833
01:23:43,142 --> 01:23:44,762
And we recognize that as well.

834
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:53,184
And so this meeting isn't about parking, but it does include stuff around active frontage, where parking is not that.

835
01:23:53,684 --> 01:23:57,985
And I just kind of wanted to put that sort of out there into the mindset

836
01:23:58,624 --> 01:24:01,825
as we're looking at this zoning in a big picture way.

837
01:24:01,865 --> 01:24:06,067
Because if we're seeing it on these parcels, we may see it on other parcels as well.

838
01:24:06,227 --> 01:24:07,827
And how does that play through?

839
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:11,888
All right, that's helpful context.

840
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:13,269
Emily, did you have something to add to that?

841
01:24:13,747 --> 01:24:37,866
I did I will put a plug in while that exactly as director hunt said this isn't the parking isn't part of this meeting but it is part of our public listening session on monday at the library and we would love to see anybody who is interested in parking or have thoughts about parking or concerns about parking to join us there we'll have a very short presentation on what the existing conditions are and some

842
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:42,870
examples from other communities, but it will be primarily a listening session on parking.

843
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:49,375
So I just wanted to add that because it is it is important subject we've heard from a lot of people on today.

844
01:24:49,395 --> 01:25:00,264
And recognizing that a lot of members of the public have already put in a lot of time, whether it's these meetings or emails or contacting city staff.

845
01:25:02,058 --> 01:25:10,166
Are people also able to, like if they can't make it on Monday, are they able to send emails to ask questions?

846
01:25:10,766 --> 01:25:11,447
Okay, great.

847
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:12,868
Good.

848
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:18,414
And I will just say, Madam Chair, that we attempt to answer questions that come in via email.

849
01:25:19,839 --> 01:25:30,286
But sometimes either the length of the questions or the volume of questions means that we literally can't answer every single email that we get individually.

850
01:25:31,187 --> 01:25:35,831
So we try, but I can't always promise the staff can have some bandwidth to do it.

851
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:38,112
Yeah, I appreciate that.

852
01:25:38,573 --> 01:25:40,714
Yeah, the robots haven't fully taken over.

853
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,957
So we're, we're doing our best.

854
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:49,054
All right, so I will now open the public comment period.

855
01:25:49,675 --> 01:25:52,558
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

856
01:25:53,659 --> 01:26:00,387
Last time I checked, that was either its own button or aligned with the react button.

857
01:26:02,842 --> 01:26:05,984
You can also send an email to OCD at Medford dash ma dot gov.

858
01:26:06,265 --> 01:26:09,447
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

859
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:18,874
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it is not part of the public record.

860
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:27,120
However, if you are having technical difficulties, you can message Alicia or Danielle in the chat, and they'll do as much as they can to help you out.

861
01:26:31,577 --> 01:26:43,359
We do have a pretty full meeting tonight, so I'm going to say each participant will have three minutes to speak, because I don't see a ton of hands.

862
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,021
And I want to make sure that we capture everybody's feedback.

863
01:26:49,081 --> 01:26:53,602
If you don't need the three minutes, you don't have to take it, but I want to give a little bit of additional space.

864
01:26:57,422 --> 01:27:07,770
So the first hand that I see, and Alicia, I'm fine managing the queue until my internet goes out like it has been doing.

865
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:18,397
The first commenter that I see, it's just a number, but you are going to get a request to unmute.

866
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:21,880
17816, please state your name and address for the record.

867
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,262
And then Alicia will be managing the timer.

868
01:27:25,202 --> 01:27:25,883
Jim Doherty.

869
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:27,981
36 Ellington Street.

870
01:27:28,762 --> 01:27:31,544
Since you asked to do that, I attempted to go in.

871
01:27:32,925 --> 01:27:40,991
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do it because it asked for a password to go in there, but I will do it by the time we get to the next public hearing.

872
01:27:41,812 --> 01:27:42,793
I apologize for that.

873
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:44,974
I'm not that technologically skilled.

874
01:27:45,815 --> 01:27:46,396
That's okay.

875
01:27:46,456 --> 01:27:49,038
And we'll give you that bonus 15 seconds, 20 seconds.

876
01:27:49,618 --> 01:27:49,978
Thank you.

877
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:50,639
Yeah.

878
01:27:51,628 --> 01:27:55,930
I have one quick question just on the question that John had previously asked.

879
01:27:57,331 --> 01:28:14,439
If you look at the West, and I realize that it's not a topic tonight, but the map on the West Medford Square that you showed, the surrounding area there outside of that now appears to be all NR3, where on previously maps, it was all UR1.

880
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:23,405
And on the map that he was just referencing, the color appears to still be UR1.

881
01:28:24,426 --> 01:28:27,349
Has that changed since the previous meeting?

882
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:34,735
I don't want to get too far down that, but I think just because you put it up, I'm just curious if I'm looking at the wrong map.

883
01:28:34,755 --> 01:28:36,937
Emily, do you have a quick answer?

884
01:28:37,963 --> 01:28:38,243
Yes.

885
01:28:38,964 --> 01:28:42,749
So that was from the previous proposal.

886
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:47,515
So the new one is UR1 up to the quarter of a mile.

887
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:54,764
So that is just when we were presenting this course to the city council, that was the map that was used.

888
01:28:55,004 --> 01:28:56,266
That's why it looks like that.

889
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,487
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

890
01:28:58,527 --> 01:29:02,328
We will update that with the latest for the next one.

891
01:29:02,348 --> 01:29:03,989
Madam Chair, can I clarify that?

892
01:29:04,009 --> 01:29:05,469
Because there's a legal thing here.

893
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:16,694
So the version that has the NR3 is in fact the version that has been referred to the City Board by the City Council to consider and make recommendations on.

894
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,355
The version that shows the UR1

895
01:29:20,673 --> 01:29:32,156
is in fact the changes that the board has requested to see, and the board is considering making that recommendation to the city council.

896
01:29:32,476 --> 01:29:44,979
So that was actually something I was gonna address with the consultants later, that I think we'd have some consistency on what our background is, and that it should be the, and we can discuss that offline, but that's the difference.

897
01:29:45,019 --> 01:29:47,960
It's what was proposed and what the board is considering.

898
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:51,472
And I will just add, we have made no further change.

899
01:29:51,532 --> 01:29:54,854
So the city council sent something to the CD board.

900
01:29:55,175 --> 01:29:57,396
We had one iteration back to the CD board.

901
01:29:57,436 --> 01:30:00,359
We have not made any changes since that one iteration.

902
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:02,620
We're holding it steady for public comment.

903
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:03,621
Thank you all.

904
01:30:04,302 --> 01:30:05,623
I appreciate the clarification.

905
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:13,229
Second question, at the last meeting, we didn't have a quorum either.

906
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,472
And I noticed at that point in time,

907
01:30:18,015 --> 01:30:23,960
John, if you will, was on the other side of the counter with the rest of us inquiring.

908
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:27,964
I'm just curious, congratulations, John, for becoming a member.

909
01:30:29,045 --> 01:30:31,988
I'm wondering, are there other seats available?

910
01:30:32,728 --> 01:30:35,110
What the process is for that?

911
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:41,997
And is there any type of way you can submit if there are space available?

912
01:30:42,157 --> 01:30:44,399
Because it seems like it was a pretty quick

913
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:47,447
thing, which I have no problem with.

914
01:30:47,507 --> 01:30:48,187
I'm just curious.

915
01:30:48,227 --> 01:30:51,409
I think the public should be aware if there are openings like that.

916
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:56,812
Before I answer that, do you have any other questions related to the districts?

917
01:30:57,592 --> 01:30:57,912
I do.

918
01:30:58,653 --> 01:30:58,813
Okay.

919
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:02,435
Do you want to ask that one and then I'll cover it just so we're not eating into your time?

920
01:31:03,015 --> 01:31:04,035
Yeah, I appreciate that.

921
01:31:04,075 --> 01:31:05,476
Thank you very much.

922
01:31:06,136 --> 01:31:13,020
Second question is, it seems like there's a lot of discussion about other public engagement for things that have changed.

923
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:24,695
And I'm curious, is there a different mechanism forum or anything like that, um, beyond, um, sending an emails that.

924
01:31:25,596 --> 01:31:37,286
Um, the public can elicit to be part of whatever the other community engagement is, or is all the community engagement based basically via emails or what we're, we're doing tonight.

925
01:31:40,182 --> 01:31:40,803
We have emails.

926
01:31:40,883 --> 01:31:43,364
We have, um, Medford alerts.

927
01:31:45,146 --> 01:31:45,346
Um.

928
01:31:47,648 --> 01:31:49,009
Emily or color.

929
01:31:49,049 --> 01:31:51,490
Alicia I don't I don't know if there's other things that I'm missing.

930
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:52,911
Madam chair.

931
01:31:53,051 --> 01:31:58,215
The mayor's office has been trying to do outreach to the community to let them know.

932
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:00,657
Sorry I didn't turn off the timer and.

933
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:02,138
I will change that

934
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:23,555
The mayor's office has been trying to do additional outreach to the community through Facebook, social media, through, I think they've been working on a press release to tell people about what's going on as well.

935
01:32:24,016 --> 01:32:31,260
And they've been using the city's robocall system, which some people get either phone calls, others get emails and some people get texts.

936
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:35,622
It depends what you have signed up for through the city's robocall system.

937
01:32:36,462 --> 01:32:37,583
Very good, thank you.

938
01:32:38,337 --> 01:32:55,764
Last question I have on the zoning itself is, I didn't quite follow it all, but I think it had to do with basically shadows where there was discussion earlier about West Medford Square and other areas about height, sunlight, different criterias like that.

939
01:32:55,844 --> 01:32:57,925
And then I think a statement was made that

940
01:32:59,322 --> 01:33:15,738
maybe it was a question someone asked that therefore will that impact the other squares or the other areas that that would affect that were already voted and I think the response was yeah it would probably apply to those other ones.

941
01:33:15,818 --> 01:33:20,223
So does that mean all of those other ones that were approved have to now be re-voted?

942
01:33:23,775 --> 01:33:25,097
I can answer that.

943
01:33:25,257 --> 01:33:27,479
Yes, excellent question.

944
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,883
Not the individual districts themselves.

945
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:38,051
We are realizing, actually we knew that this would happen and we have a process for it that

946
01:33:39,275 --> 01:33:42,798
Many of the development standards would be consistent throughout the city.

947
01:33:43,379 --> 01:33:49,604
And so we will be merging those into a separate section of the zoning bylaws.

948
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:58,091
And then there will be a modification that points the districts that have been approved to this new section.

949
01:33:58,471 --> 01:33:59,812
This is part of the final clean up.

950
01:34:00,614 --> 01:34:04,257
that we will be doing as a final stage in the zoning process.

951
01:34:04,758 --> 01:34:22,173
When you're working geographically, district by district, as we've been doing, we have been aware that due to public comment, due to other changes, that there would be things that we would want to modify after all of the individual geographic districts had gone through the approval process.

952
01:34:22,673 --> 01:34:27,918
So that will be cleaned up at that point, and those requirements on the sunlight

953
01:34:28,282 --> 01:34:38,529
will apply to all of the mixed use and commercial only districts and potentially to UR2 as well.

954
01:34:38,909 --> 01:34:47,995
I think the others know because what we're trying to do is apply that requirement to the districts to protect the other residential districts.

955
01:34:48,275 --> 01:34:50,297
So that will clean up at the end.

956
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:51,477
Appreciate it.

957
01:34:51,638 --> 01:34:53,899
And I fully understand it's a moving target.

958
01:34:53,919 --> 01:34:54,680
You have to do those.

959
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,500
Thank you very much.

960
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,641
You're very welcome.

961
01:34:58,898 --> 01:35:07,574
And then to address one of your middle questions, Mr. Jory, which I'm very thankful that you asked, because I love to talk about this when there's a lot of people on the call.

962
01:35:09,781 --> 01:35:16,003
And I mean no harm or insult to any members of the board, but there's nothing truly special about any of us.

963
01:35:17,043 --> 01:35:22,544
We may have one or two unique qualifications, but really we just care deeply about the city of Medford and our neighbors.

964
01:35:23,485 --> 01:35:31,147
We are homeowners, we are renters, we are parents, we are dog moms and dads, cat moms and dads, nothing against cats.

965
01:35:32,167 --> 01:35:34,568
Um, some of us know a lot about transportation.

966
01:35:34,648 --> 01:35:37,070
Some of us know about nonprofits or history.

967
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:40,772
My background is more, yeah, Adam's got a dog and a cat.

968
01:35:40,792 --> 01:35:41,232
Look at that.

969
01:35:42,392 --> 01:35:48,235
My background is, is real estate, economic development, sustainability.

970
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:49,336
I now work in renewables.

971
01:35:49,356 --> 01:35:51,497
So everybody's kind of all over the place.

972
01:35:52,097 --> 01:35:54,539
But I think what unites us is our passion for the city.

973
01:35:55,399 --> 01:35:59,081
And in terms of applying, I'm going to drop a couple links in the chat.

974
01:36:02,308 --> 01:36:04,169
But you really just have to apply.

975
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:16,297
And I think the next step for that is Alicia and Danielle review the applications, it gets shared with the mayor, the mayor makes their appointment, and then you get

976
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:18,859
sworn in.

977
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,741
There's a couple questions that get asked.

978
01:36:22,202 --> 01:36:26,545
I did a little interview process, but a couple of us have terms expiring.

979
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:36,473
Some of us may stay on and serve an additional term, but I'm assuming that there's going to be maybe a couple openings on the board.

980
01:36:36,533 --> 01:36:44,939
So I encourage anybody that's on this call to apply, especially if you've been a part of the zoning process, because

981
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,741
you're at these meetings anyways, you might as well have a more direct impact.

982
01:36:51,481 --> 01:36:59,103
The stipend isn't much, but you do get a little bit of a stipend to kind of commemorate your time.

983
01:37:00,283 --> 01:37:08,585
But there's two links in the chat, so whether it's Mr. Doherty or anybody else on this call, please apply.

984
01:37:08,605 --> 01:37:15,427
We need more people involved, whether it's the Community Development Board or other boards and commissions in the city.

985
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,005
And I will get off my soapbox.

986
01:37:19,987 --> 01:37:22,310
The next commenter that we have is Cheryl.

987
01:37:23,911 --> 01:37:26,094
Please state your name and address for the record.

988
01:37:26,294 --> 01:37:27,595
I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

989
01:37:28,116 --> 01:37:30,999
And Alicia's going to start a timer for three minutes.

990
01:37:33,924 --> 01:37:36,645
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street.

991
01:37:37,406 --> 01:37:49,372
I noticed that some of these extra conversations tonight about things that weren't before the board are a little confusing to members of the public, but I'm curious about how the NR zoning is now being passed.

992
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:51,253
by the square zoning.

993
01:37:51,893 --> 01:38:00,056
And the square zoning has some of the areas like, for example, West Medford Square zoned more densely than they are in the NR maps.

994
01:38:00,477 --> 01:38:10,981
So I'm wondering how they're going to reconcile that if just the square zoning passes first, then the NR zoning will down zone the square areas, particularly the UR areas.

995
01:38:12,322 --> 01:38:18,605
Also, when I'm looking at the Medford Square map, I noticed that the very large lots on the north side of High Street and Square are only zoned as NR2.

996
01:38:20,274 --> 01:38:30,918
Um, which is pretty low considering they're right on high street and the sound street corridor was given no such exemptions despite having no rapid transit or a large square that would support the density.

997
01:38:31,298 --> 01:38:32,659
So that seems misplaced.

998
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,340
I did mention it at the subcommittee meetings and it was ignored and bypassed.

999
01:38:36,957 --> 01:38:44,826
Um, NR3 and West in the rapid transit circle exactly matches the density of Glenwood, which again, we don't have any rapid transit.

1000
01:38:44,886 --> 01:38:49,671
So it seems right inside that quarter mile circle that West is zoned pretty low.

1001
01:38:49,691 --> 01:38:50,492
And if

1002
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:54,791
Glenwood is going to stand, and they should stand taller than us.

1003
01:38:56,132 --> 01:39:05,175
I noticed tonight we're talking about design and development standards, and Salem Street was placed on one of the maps that you showed that now we're concerned about shadow study.

1004
01:39:05,515 --> 01:39:10,737
When the Salem Street neighbors rallied and asked for shadow studies, we were told that that wasn't done.

1005
01:39:10,777 --> 01:39:12,698
We were quite shut down.

1006
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:16,439
And it's very concerning that the Salem Street zoning is live right now.

1007
01:39:16,879 --> 01:39:19,041
It doesn't have any of these design standards.

1008
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:22,703
It can happen just the way that it is with no regard for shadow.

1009
01:39:23,044 --> 01:39:34,432
So I'm not sure why we didn't wait to allow the zoning to be used before the design standards when there's so much developer pressure on Sale Street that we were rushing to get the zoning through so the developers wouldn't miss the summer.

1010
01:39:35,012 --> 01:39:41,634
And now those buildings can happen without consideration of our sunlight or design standards because those things don't exist.

1011
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:47,056
So I feel that it can be too little too late for many of us here on the South Street quarter.

1012
01:39:47,436 --> 01:39:50,196
And I wish that more attention and study had been paid to us.

1013
01:39:50,637 --> 01:39:55,058
I'm glad to see that now some of the other areas are getting more attention than we ever got.

1014
01:39:55,838 --> 01:40:02,540
But I'm concerned that suddenly the city is also notifying about the neighborhood zoning, eight meetings into the neighborhood zoning.

1015
01:40:03,072 --> 01:40:05,112
so that people didn't find out ahead of time.

1016
01:40:05,452 --> 01:40:11,113
And now we're scrambling and that's why it's taking extra meetings because people have questions because they're just finding out about this.

1017
01:40:11,753 --> 01:40:22,355
So I know that there's an urgent rush for the city council and I appreciate that this board is not responding to their pressure and is taking their time and trying to look through these proposals.

1018
01:40:22,755 --> 01:40:31,417
But I hope that when we do the cleanup that we can remember the areas that we really rushed through and didn't give as much consideration and thought as the areas that we're doing now.

1019
01:40:31,857 --> 01:40:32,157
Thank you.

1020
01:40:34,315 --> 01:40:34,936
Thank you, Cheryl.

1021
01:40:35,296 --> 01:40:39,200
I think those are some really thoughtful and valid comments that you just made.

1022
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:42,663
So really appreciate you bringing that up.

1023
01:40:43,584 --> 01:40:48,209
I'm wondering if Emily, Paola, or members of the city staff have some insight.

1024
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:50,471
I know Cheryl mentioned some process.

1025
01:40:50,997 --> 01:40:52,599
steps that maybe need to be clarified.

1026
01:40:52,619 --> 01:41:02,788
I hear what she's saying about, you know, we passed Salem Street and now we're looking at these kind of larger development standards.

1027
01:41:04,049 --> 01:41:10,035
But then there is this gap in time, like how do we... I'd be happy to address that, Madam Chair.

1028
01:41:10,075 --> 01:41:15,320
So the development standards were in fact included in the Salem Street zoning, they're a modification.

1029
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:16,181
We had

1030
01:41:16,621 --> 01:41:19,362
originally included development standards in the Mystic Avenue.

1031
01:41:19,802 --> 01:41:23,764
We modified those for us to be specific to Salem Street.

1032
01:41:23,784 --> 01:41:31,446
In fact, we learned a lot about looking at Salem Street, and some of those will be moving forward and being equally applied to the squares and the corridors.

1033
01:41:31,466 --> 01:41:33,507
Do you have some examples of that?

1034
01:41:33,967 --> 01:41:35,448
Yes, absolutely.

1035
01:41:35,468 --> 01:41:40,749
I don't have the text in front of me, although I can certainly pull it up, speak to it later.

1036
01:41:43,491 --> 01:41:53,595
set up standards for how the mixed-use buildings would relate to the residential-only buildings in terms of setbacks and stepbacks.

1037
01:41:54,016 --> 01:42:01,239
That 45-degree angle that Paola showed earlier was first instituted in the Salem Street Development Standards.

1038
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:07,822
In fact, in August of last year, there's a couple of slides in the presentation that we did.

1039
01:42:08,182 --> 01:42:09,443
I don't remember if it's in front of

1040
01:42:10,323 --> 01:42:16,125
uh, yourselves or in front of city, uh, the planning and permitting, I'd have to go back, but it does show shadow studies in there.

1041
01:42:16,246 --> 01:42:27,050
So, you know, I think the, the length of time that's passed and the number of other presentations that we've shown, it can be sometimes hard to remember what was shown at which meeting, but we did, we did look at those.

1042
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:31,051
Um, we did not do as many site sections, but we did site sections.

1043
01:42:31,651 --> 01:42:37,834
So, you know, Salem Street was something where we tried to respond to what we heard for public comments.

1044
01:42:38,374 --> 01:42:43,996
and also bring those lessons learned, right, listen to the community and bring them forward to the others.

1045
01:42:44,136 --> 01:42:50,638
So certainly there's been an iterative process, and that's how it should be when you're looking geographically.

1046
01:42:51,138 --> 01:42:55,500
And that takes us back to the wrap-up, and I think the speaker, Cheryl, made a good point.

1047
01:42:55,660 --> 01:43:04,563
When we go back and re-look at all the geographic districts, re-look at the lessons learned, if there are things that need to be modified,

1048
01:43:05,244 --> 01:43:08,308
for individual districts, and we will certainly be looking that as well.

1049
01:43:08,408 --> 01:43:11,152
So I appreciate her bringing that up so we could address it.

1050
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:21,953
And then I think there were some some questions on process in terms of like when we're notifying for things.

1051
01:43:22,854 --> 01:43:34,686
You know, if there is confusion around notification, I, you know, we've been trying to be very, very mindful in terms of how we're how we're putting out agendas, you know, coordinating with the mayor's office.

1052
01:43:35,967 --> 01:43:44,111
But by all means, if you have additional suggestions or feedback or specific examples, we'd love to respond to them.

1053
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:54,755
That's my goal as chair of this board, to be more transparent, include the public more, and try to be responsive to your concerns.

1054
01:43:56,556 --> 01:43:59,738
The next commenter we have is Penny Schwartz.

1055
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:04,399
Penny, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1056
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:09,273
Please state your name and address for the record, and Alicia will start the timer for three minutes.

1057
01:44:12,323 --> 01:44:12,583
Hello.

1058
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,383
Actually, this is Matthew Reich.

1059
01:44:14,464 --> 01:44:15,524
I'm using two computers.

1060
01:44:16,444 --> 01:44:16,484
Hi.

1061
01:44:18,685 --> 01:44:23,326
Thank you for taking my question, comment, and thanks for running this meeting.

1062
01:44:24,826 --> 01:44:28,707
I address 29 Adams Street, which is the corner of Adams and Capon.

1063
01:44:29,327 --> 01:44:33,048
My first question actually doesn't concern Medford Square.

1064
01:44:33,108 --> 01:44:40,890
I would just like to confirm that the proposed zoning for 29 Adams is neighborhood residential three,

1065
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:45,273
which is Adams South of Capon and Adams North of Capon.

1066
01:44:45,733 --> 01:44:49,896
As I see, if I'm reading the map correctly, it's Urban Residential 3.

1067
01:44:50,616 --> 01:44:59,583
Obviously, if that's out of the topic, fine, just tell me and I'll ask some other time or otherwise, please confirm.

1068
01:44:59,603 --> 01:45:02,785
Why do you keep asking other questions and we'll work to confirm that?

1069
01:45:02,825 --> 01:45:04,586
That was what, 29 Adams Street, you said?

1070
01:45:04,846 --> 01:45:07,088
Yeah, 29 Adams, corner of Adams and Capon.

1071
01:45:07,561 --> 01:45:12,543
Okay, so if you have other questions, I'd say keep asking and we'll double check that one for you.

1072
01:45:12,963 --> 01:45:23,547
So for West Metro Square, if I understand what you said in the map correctly, it's the proposed zoning is mixed use three.

1073
01:45:23,667 --> 01:45:28,549
And if I understand that correctly, that's by right 15 stories maximum.

1074
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:31,730
Is that correct?

1075
01:45:33,611 --> 01:45:36,852
I believe the 15 stories is the current zoning.

1076
01:45:38,813 --> 01:45:41,434
And then MX three is the proposed zoning.

1077
01:45:41,594 --> 01:45:45,615
That's eight stories plus up to four with incentives.

1078
01:45:46,175 --> 01:45:46,775
So it could be up to 12.

1079
01:45:47,755 --> 01:46:05,139
But that delta of four incentive would be public, theoretically public benefits on the developer, the developer of the land, who's not necessarily a capital D developer could just be the property owner includes.

1080
01:46:06,573 --> 01:46:06,853
I see.

1081
01:46:08,055 --> 01:46:08,416
OK.

1082
01:46:09,818 --> 01:46:11,140
Then a comment.

1083
01:46:12,301 --> 01:46:20,694
The 45 degrees cornice to cornice seems to me rather steep, so a kind of comment and request would be helpful, I think.

1084
01:46:21,995 --> 01:46:36,366
For people to understand what that looks like visually, if somebody could produce a map showing anywhere in Medford which actually has that comment, it might be more realistic to have 45 degrees from Foundation to Cornice.

1085
01:46:37,307 --> 01:46:51,770
And I think a more appropriate angle would be roughly 26 degrees, which gives roughly 2 to 1 run to rise, which would be more appropriate for Medford, particularly Medford Square.

1086
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:58,432
And one more comment, which may be somewhat off topic to this meeting.

1087
01:46:59,192 --> 01:47:06,514
The proposed density of the immediate neighborhood where I live, the other corner of Adams and Capon,

1088
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:20,202
I think is much too high, and I think that particularly the homeowners in the area would be disappointed in that.

1089
01:47:25,725 --> 01:47:27,186
So that's what I have.

1090
01:47:27,226 --> 01:47:28,407
I've asked a few questions.

1091
01:47:28,467 --> 01:47:31,609
If you have answers, I'd appreciate them.

1092
01:47:31,649 --> 01:47:31,909
Thank you.

1093
01:47:33,381 --> 01:47:33,621
Awesome.

1094
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:34,342
Thank you, Matthew.

1095
01:47:34,522 --> 01:47:41,505
So I think we answered your question about the MX3, the 15 stories while we were chatting.

1096
01:47:41,525 --> 01:47:44,867
I know you had the question about 29 Adams Street.

1097
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:48,629
I see in the map it's proposed neighborhood residential three.

1098
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:55,652
And then I might have missed another question.

1099
01:47:57,754 --> 01:47:59,915
Yeah, I think just the general comment about

1100
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:03,792
the proposed zoning for the neighborhood?

1101
01:48:04,813 --> 01:48:09,395
Two things, a general comment about a pro zoning for the neighborhood and also the 45.

1102
01:48:11,116 --> 01:48:13,998
Oh yes, the 45 degree angle.

1103
01:48:14,078 --> 01:48:15,779
Are there any real life examples of that?

1104
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:16,360
Yes.

1105
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:17,260
Thank you.

1106
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:18,441
Thank you very much.

1107
01:48:19,301 --> 01:48:24,865
Madam Chair, I'm not sure we, or I'm not sure I understood the 45 degree angle question.

1108
01:48:25,945 --> 01:48:30,928
So what I heard, and I'll unmute you in a second Matthew is,

1109
01:48:33,135 --> 01:48:45,078
He was curious, number one, are there any real life examples, like any photos, any case studies of this angle being put into place so they could maybe see it more in context?

1110
01:48:45,398 --> 01:48:50,799
Recognizing you have the section, but a section doesn't always translate to a lived experience.

1111
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:56,061
And then I believe he also proposed that the 45 degree angle, rather than

1112
01:48:57,201 --> 01:49:13,878
starting from the, I think it was the cornice of the house, start from the foundation, which would cut off more of the adjacent buildings.

1113
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:15,619
Thank you.

1114
01:49:15,699 --> 01:49:17,181
I think I missed a statement.

1115
01:49:17,481 --> 01:49:19,343
We'll obviously have to look into that for you.

1116
01:49:19,363 --> 01:49:20,204
We can't answer that.

1117
01:49:20,224 --> 01:49:21,205
Kathy, was that a fair summary?

1118
01:49:24,219 --> 01:49:27,621
Yes, that's a fair summary, yes, thank you.

1119
01:49:28,301 --> 01:49:30,323
Okay, so it sounds like we need to do some follow-up there for you.

1120
01:49:30,743 --> 01:49:31,083
Thank you.

1121
01:49:31,584 --> 01:49:31,984
Thank you.

1122
01:49:33,765 --> 01:49:37,067
So I can maybe answer a small thing.

1123
01:49:38,288 --> 01:49:52,178
Usually for street, for sun and shadow studies, usually you do one-to-one to do that relation

1124
01:49:53,068 --> 01:49:54,249
What does that mean, one-to-one?

1125
01:49:57,351 --> 01:50:03,934
The 45 degree angle, so that it, yeah, exactly.

1126
01:50:04,134 --> 01:50:06,696
So the proportion will be one-to-one.

1127
01:50:08,177 --> 01:50:19,363
So there are many urban designers that use that one-to-one in order to get good light and air and quality.

1128
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:22,832
So that's using that 45 degree.

1129
01:50:25,333 --> 01:50:32,457
We want to study a little bit more on how those, especially the step backs, how that can be done.

1130
01:50:32,477 --> 01:50:42,604
And so we can do a little bit of more diagrams to show those step backs and setbacks, how those could work.

1131
01:50:43,364 --> 01:50:48,307
So to study a little bit more this standard.

1132
01:50:49,938 --> 01:50:50,258
OK.

1133
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:57,240
Yeah, just quick Google searches showing me some examples, maybe in Cambridge, Chelsea, Lowell.

1134
01:50:58,981 --> 01:51:03,362
So that 45-degree angle is out there.

1135
01:51:03,722 --> 01:51:05,683
But yeah, let's make sure it's right for Bedford.

1136
01:51:06,923 --> 01:51:07,063
Yep.

1137
01:51:09,044 --> 01:51:09,164
Cool.

1138
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:14,251
The next commenter that I see is Susan Altman.

1139
01:51:14,912 --> 01:51:16,735
Please state your name and address for the record.

1140
01:51:17,997 --> 01:51:22,083
You're going to get a request to unmute and then Alicia will start a timer for three minutes.

1141
01:51:24,526 --> 01:51:25,007
Hi, Susan.

1142
01:51:26,048 --> 01:51:26,349
Hi there.

1143
01:51:27,254 --> 01:51:27,935
Thank you very much.

1144
01:51:29,096 --> 01:51:35,523
So I have a question that may not be appropriate for this group, but if so, maybe you can direct me.

1145
01:51:35,543 --> 01:51:39,927
I am, I heard a lot about parking but nothing about driving.

1146
01:51:39,947 --> 01:51:49,457
And there, there are some streets in Medford that are concerned with this such as particularly Harvard Street I believe the one that runs off Main Street.

1147
01:51:50,037 --> 01:51:52,758
it's already back to back three quarters of the day.

1148
01:51:52,778 --> 01:52:18,885
And I'm curious how parking considerations feed into the zoning decision making and how that process works and would just be interested in finding out more about how those considerations get effectuated before zoning allows additional building in a way that's just not sustainable.

1149
01:52:21,211 --> 01:52:23,013
I think that's a valid question for us.

1150
01:52:23,453 --> 01:52:26,976
I do want to ask if you have any other questions, just so we're not eating into your time.

1151
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:27,737
That's it.

1152
01:52:28,177 --> 01:52:28,457
That's it.

1153
01:52:28,538 --> 01:52:28,798
Okay.

1154
01:52:29,338 --> 01:52:29,698
Yep.

1155
01:52:30,139 --> 01:52:31,960
I mean, I think that's an appropriate question.

1156
01:52:33,842 --> 01:52:37,205
Emily or Alicia, Danielle, if you have anything to add to that.

1157
01:52:38,493 --> 01:52:43,474
I can speak to the zoning to date and then obviously welcome others to join in.

1158
01:52:43,554 --> 01:52:50,416
So to date, we have made no recommendations to change the existing parking requirements.

1159
01:52:50,996 --> 01:53:05,159
The meeting on Monday night, because we have heard so much about parking, both from people who don't want to change them and people who do, the meeting on Monday night is to kind of bring everybody in the same room and talk about parking and listen about parking.

1160
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,700
But so far, we have made no changes to that.

1161
01:53:08,461 --> 01:53:17,591
based on what we hear from the public and with the discussions with the Planning and Permitting Committee, which will start on Wednesday about parking, that may change.

1162
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,413
But to date, there's been no change.

1163
01:53:21,482 --> 01:53:28,706
I think maybe the meat of Susan's question was more around how is everything connected?

1164
01:53:28,726 --> 01:53:38,190
If we're not changing parking, how do we consider the impact that these zoning changes are going to have on parking?

1165
01:53:38,431 --> 01:53:42,353
And maybe not just parking, but also I heard traffic in there as well.

1166
01:53:44,141 --> 01:53:50,988
You know, there's a couple of things I think that have fed into what we've discussed so far in these meetings and others.

1167
01:53:51,148 --> 01:53:55,332
One of them is the difference between the public streets and the private streets.

1168
01:53:55,472 --> 01:54:00,117
And plug for the interactive map, you can put that up as a layer and see where those are.

1169
01:54:01,258 --> 01:54:08,325
Right now, all of the zoning that has either been passed to date or has been brought forward requires that parking be off street.

1170
01:54:08,905 --> 01:54:13,847
In other words, if you're going to do a development, you have to park that development on site.

1171
01:54:14,688 --> 01:54:18,690
Again, that's something that we're going to talk about on Monday.

1172
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:21,451
There can be strategies for parking reductions.

1173
01:54:22,332 --> 01:54:36,358
There can be strategies for, and this is where the transportation demand management discussion comes in, there can be strategies for providing alternative links to transit that don't require the use of car or can supplement the use of the car.

1174
01:54:38,339 --> 01:54:38,779
Excuse me.

1175
01:54:39,579 --> 01:54:43,620
We are very aware that different conditions exist in different parts of Medford.

1176
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:45,521
I think Director Hunt spoke to it earlier.

1177
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:55,063
And I see your hand up, so I'm going to let her.

1178
01:54:55,603 --> 01:55:04,405
So something that we have been talking about has come up in a number of meetings, so I feel like I have an almost rehearsed answer.

1179
01:55:05,237 --> 01:55:23,286
With this idea that zoning does not control the roads and that infrastructure and increasing the ability to, like encouraging people to not drive, for example, we are working here in City Hall hand in hand with some of our other department heads.

1180
01:55:23,727 --> 01:55:27,449
So we're working very actively with our Director of Traffic and Transportation,

1181
01:55:28,727 --> 01:55:33,611
people do use bicycles more often when it's safer and when there are bike lanes.

1182
01:55:33,691 --> 01:55:43,140
And so we are actively working and I'll actually plug this next Tuesday night is a traffic commission meeting to consider a contra flow lane on the Clippership Drive.

1183
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:45,362
It's a public meeting, Zoom at five.

1184
01:55:45,782 --> 01:55:48,484
So we are looking at that.

1185
01:55:48,985 --> 01:55:53,649
We are looking to design more density where we have transit.

1186
01:55:54,420 --> 01:56:10,710
But I was in fact just talking to somebody today who works in the field about the fact that over in Cambridge, for example, they redesigned the Longfellow Bridge and they thought that it would get all backed up with traffic all the time because there'd be less room for cars and more rooms for pedestrians and bicycles.

1187
01:56:11,110 --> 01:56:21,737
And he was saying to me that he has observed that actually it's not more backed up with cars, that because it's more comfortable for bicyclists and pedestrians, they're seeing dramatically more

1188
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,462
bicycle and pedestrian traffic going through.

1189
01:56:24,482 --> 01:56:33,308
And every time I ride my bike in town, I'm thinking, do the people in the cars think that here is one less person in a car taking up road space?

1190
01:56:34,009 --> 01:56:36,611
So we are actively trying to make it safer.

1191
01:56:36,731 --> 01:56:40,414
We hope to open the Clippership Connector Path in July.

1192
01:56:41,875 --> 01:56:46,098
So to encourage that, but it is not part of the zoning process.

1193
01:56:46,138 --> 01:56:48,760
It is something else that the administration is working on.

1194
01:56:49,203 --> 01:56:53,866
to make it safer and better for people to walk and drop and bicycle around the city.

1195
01:56:54,507 --> 01:57:02,833
And we are working on a transit program we project, we actually are working with me PC to look at potentials

1196
01:57:03,254 --> 01:57:10,700
for local small transit within the city to provide options for people that are not using cars.

1197
01:57:10,841 --> 01:57:14,724
And we literally had our kickoff meeting for that earlier this week, so.

1198
01:57:14,964 --> 01:57:15,424
That's great.

1199
01:57:15,945 --> 01:57:16,966
That's all really great to hear.

1200
01:57:16,986 --> 01:57:21,510
I think I saw a picture of a bike traffic jam.

1201
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:26,194
I think it was the Longfellow Bridge when I was scrolling Reddit.

1202
01:57:27,008 --> 01:57:28,149
uh, within the past couple days.

1203
01:57:28,189 --> 01:57:29,370
It was really cool to see.

1204
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:38,118
I mean, I don't think we'll ever hit, you know, uh, like, you know, Copenhagen levels of biking, but, you know, maybe we can get a little bit closer.

1205
01:57:38,339 --> 01:57:39,520
But yeah, everything's connected.

1206
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:42,202
Um, okay, cool.

1207
01:57:46,886 --> 01:57:51,170
Um, the next public commenter that we have is Steven Pompeo.

1208
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:55,272
Stephen, please state your name and address for the record.

1209
01:57:56,153 --> 01:57:57,694
I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1210
01:57:58,034 --> 01:58:01,317
Alicia is going to start a timer for three minutes.

1211
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:07,201
Thank you.

1212
01:58:07,441 --> 01:58:08,562
Am I unmuted?

1213
01:58:09,423 --> 01:58:10,303
Yes, we can hear you.

1214
01:58:11,744 --> 01:58:12,785
I just have a couple of questions.

1215
01:58:14,346 --> 01:58:16,668
One on Medford Square and one on West Medford Square.

1216
01:58:17,349 --> 01:58:20,271
And I'm wondering, can we bring up the zoning map

1217
01:58:21,388 --> 01:58:26,131
Yep, you can start asking your question, but Paolo will bring it up for you.

1218
01:58:26,972 --> 01:58:27,893
Yeah, let's see.

1219
01:58:27,933 --> 01:58:47,406
The question in Memphis Square is regarding the, and I sent this question to the board, so you may have already looked at it, regarding the map in particular with the zone, I guess it's the 2A zone.

1220
01:58:47,426 --> 01:58:47,466
OK.

1221
01:58:50,693 --> 01:58:53,296
or the mixed-use one zone.

1222
01:58:53,716 --> 01:58:56,859
So that light is blue, mixed-use one.

1223
01:58:56,879 --> 01:59:06,368
So there's only a few properties there, right in the center across from Governor's Ave.

1224
01:59:07,329 --> 01:59:13,775
And I know it was mentioned about historic, but most of the properties in that section aren't historic.

1225
01:59:17,615 --> 01:59:35,578
And I just want to confirm, it's being changed from C1, which is six stories by right, and it's being rezoned to MU1, which is only four stories by right.

1226
01:59:36,099 --> 01:59:40,799
So my question is, can we just scrap that mixed use one zone there?

1227
01:59:40,859 --> 01:59:43,680
It's only a few properties in the heart of Medford Square.

1228
01:59:45,337 --> 02:00:03,773
rather than those being the lowest properties in the square, can we just rezone those the way all the abutters to those which are mixed-use 2A so that it's equal and fair with its abutters and not zoned lower than what it's currently allowed?

1229
02:00:05,814 --> 02:00:12,319
Yeah, that's certainly something that the board could include it in its recommendations based on feedback that you just provided.

1230
02:00:12,419 --> 02:00:17,663
So we'll take that into account when we provide our recommendations for this.

1231
02:00:18,524 --> 02:00:19,445
All right, I appreciate that.

1232
02:00:19,545 --> 02:00:30,853
And in West Medford Square, the question there is, so same thing, it's being rezoned C1, which is six stories by right.

1233
02:00:31,774 --> 02:00:34,997
And I don't know if this was a mistake or not,

1234
02:00:37,783 --> 02:00:49,350
several properties now in West Medford Square are going to become nonconforming because the new zone, which I guess I'm referring to the purple, the mixed-use 2B.

1235
02:00:50,431 --> 02:00:55,995
Am I correct that that is being raised to a 5,000 square foot minimum lot?

1236
02:00:59,717 --> 02:01:00,898
We have a quick answer for that.

1237
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:06,710
I can't see.

1238
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,752
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

1239
02:01:09,772 --> 02:01:20,816
The issue is we have several properties that are in C1 being zoned mixed-use 2B, but now they're going to become non-conforming.

1240
02:01:22,537 --> 02:01:29,020
Currently, they're allowed to build up to six stories, but because they'll be non-conforming, technically, they won't be able to do anything.

1241
02:01:29,476 --> 02:01:43,806
So I'm wondering if the 2B zone, rather than putting a minimum lot size of 5,000, whether you could change that to 4,000 and that would open up a lot of the new nonconforming structures that have been created.

1242
02:01:46,407 --> 02:01:46,688
Okay.

1243
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:54,173
Are we able to confirm the lot size for mixed use 2B?

1244
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:03,263
The lot size for mixed-use 2B is 5,000 square feet.

1245
02:02:03,884 --> 02:02:10,629
I'm just looking to see on the interactive map, another plug, if I can see the palette.

1246
02:02:10,649 --> 02:02:12,891
Did you have the existing commercial one?

1247
02:02:13,532 --> 02:02:15,233
I thought it was higher than that.

1248
02:02:15,253 --> 02:02:20,698
I think it actually, existing says zero.

1249
02:02:21,298 --> 02:02:22,679
So the existing,

1250
02:02:28,563 --> 02:02:31,383
Yes, for other permitted principal structures.

1251
02:02:31,424 --> 02:02:32,784
So it depends on what you're wanting to do.

1252
02:02:32,824 --> 02:02:38,725
If you're wanting to do a multiple dwelling in C1, the minimum is a 10,000 square foot lot size.

1253
02:02:39,945 --> 02:02:43,926
If you're wanting to do assisted living, it is also 10,000 square feet.

1254
02:02:44,686 --> 02:02:50,787
And if you're wanting to do other permitted principal structures, there is no minimum lot size on that.

1255
02:02:52,987 --> 02:02:56,008
Yeah, so could we consider changing that 5,000 to 4,000 so that

1256
02:02:57,858 --> 02:03:01,965
there would be fewer newly created non-conforming structures.

1257
02:03:02,466 --> 02:03:10,240
We can take a look at the non-conforming maps and see what the percentage is, and then come back to the city staff CD report with a recommendation.

1258
02:03:12,675 --> 02:03:15,876
I think it will accomplish that goal of reducing the nonconforming parcels.

1259
02:03:16,196 --> 02:03:17,216
That seems to be a big goal.

1260
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:21,358
And also now allowing a property to become more dense.

1261
02:03:21,758 --> 02:03:35,823
So it would accomplish those two goals and also be more fair for any property owners that currently have just under 5,000 square feet, who are currently allowed to go up to six stories, but would be restricted under the new zoning.

1262
02:03:35,943 --> 02:03:37,724
So that would be great if you could consider that.

1263
02:03:39,164 --> 02:03:40,625
Yeah, we can certainly look into that.

1264
02:03:41,577 --> 02:03:53,955
Just as a clarification, if I may, the zoning in Medford is a little bit different from others in the sense that the standards, the dimensional standards go by use.

1265
02:03:54,435 --> 02:03:57,500
They can be the same district but have different heights.

1266
02:03:58,071 --> 02:04:06,876
And so that is the occasion, for example, for commercial buildings, they can only go up to four by right, and it's in here.

1267
02:04:07,297 --> 02:04:12,360
And then you can do, you don't have a minimum, but you can only go up to four stories by right.

1268
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:20,565
It's only the residential that can go up to six, but then you need to be 10,000 square foot minimum.

1269
02:04:20,825 --> 02:04:23,146
So there are a lot of different things.

1270
02:04:23,267 --> 02:04:27,089
We want to make it more easier and having only

1271
02:04:27,719 --> 02:04:35,648
one standard as a minimum and then you can go higher than that but we will look into the non-conformities absolutely.

1272
02:04:36,049 --> 02:04:36,349
Thank you.

1273
02:04:36,389 --> 02:04:44,739
Yeah look into that because even if four stories is the only allowed height it's currently allowed four stories now under the proposed zoning

1274
02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:49,312
it would be nonconforming and therefore technically not allowed to have anything done to it.

1275
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:53,515
So if you want to keep it four stories, that's fine rather than six.

1276
02:04:54,115 --> 02:05:00,839
But yeah, don't make these under 5,000 square foot lots in West Memphis Square become nonconforming lots.

1277
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:01,719
I think that would just

1278
02:05:03,337 --> 02:05:10,240
Well, we wouldn't achieve the goal of having fewer non-conforming properties, and it wouldn't help with the increase in the density goal.

1279
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:17,503
And I don't think it would be fair either to take a property that's currently allowed to go four stories and make it a non-conforming structure.

1280
02:05:18,243 --> 02:05:19,003
Yeah, absolutely.

1281
02:05:19,123 --> 02:05:19,424
Thank you.

1282
02:05:19,964 --> 02:05:24,566
I really appreciate your comment and the specificity of the feedback you provided.

1283
02:05:24,586 --> 02:05:28,547
That's very helpful for us as we look to review and make our modifications.

1284
02:05:28,948 --> 02:05:29,308
Thank you.

1285
02:05:29,468 --> 02:05:29,968
Thank you, Stephen.

1286
02:05:32,292 --> 02:05:36,297
The next comment or that we have actually Christian I saw that your hand was up.

1287
02:05:37,318 --> 02:05:38,379
Did you want to add anything.

1288
02:05:38,980 --> 02:05:41,884
Christian is a member of city staff, so I just wanted to recognize.

1289
02:05:42,724 --> 02:05:48,071
I just would like to remind people to state their address because the last few participants did not.

1290
02:05:48,331 --> 02:05:48,932
I'm just taking.

1291
02:05:48,992 --> 02:05:49,212
Okay.

1292
02:05:53,494 --> 02:05:59,058
If the previous commenters could message their address, well, no, they have to say it, right?

1293
02:05:59,078 --> 02:06:00,339
Because then it's in the public record.

1294
02:06:00,359 --> 02:06:08,004
Madam Chair, I do have Mr. Pompeo's and Susan Altman's.

1295
02:06:08,404 --> 02:06:13,527
Mr. Pompeo submitted a public letter, so I have that as well.

1296
02:06:14,047 --> 02:06:17,169
I actually have a very weird administrative request.

1297
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:21,212
I need to rename Peter because he had to drop and come back in.

1298
02:06:21,958 --> 02:06:26,141
but there are two people in the meeting who are iPhone.

1299
02:06:26,582 --> 02:06:29,244
So, and I can't do it from the private chat he sent me.

1300
02:06:29,304 --> 02:06:31,386
Peter, can you please raise your hand?

1301
02:06:32,106 --> 02:06:33,948
And then I'll know which of these is you.

1302
02:06:33,968 --> 02:06:36,590
Are you able to do that?

1303
02:06:37,351 --> 02:06:42,295
Or if you turned on your camera, I could tell.

1304
02:06:43,816 --> 02:06:45,097
I'm so sorry about this.

1305
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:53,972
I'm unmuting one of the iPhones, just taking a guess.

1306
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:55,833
Sorry, is that you, Peter?

1307
02:06:55,853 --> 02:07:00,677
All right, I don't think that was, I think that was the wrong one.

1308
02:07:00,697 --> 02:07:03,739
All right, is this you, Peter?

1309
02:07:03,759 --> 02:07:04,839
Yep, that's me.

1310
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,961
Yes, I got him.

1311
02:07:06,981 --> 02:07:12,825
Thank you, sorry, I had to turn on my phone and the app is updated and I don't know where any of the settings are anymore.

1312
02:07:14,132 --> 02:07:23,696
the joys of technology, and then appreciation to members of the public and the board for your patience with- I'm very sorry about that.

1313
02:07:24,117 --> 02:07:25,677
With the human element of this.

1314
02:07:26,818 --> 02:07:27,998
It always makes it exciting.

1315
02:07:32,921 --> 02:07:34,541
And yes, Christian, great reminder.

1316
02:07:35,682 --> 02:07:40,064
And I'll try to catch that in the future.

1317
02:07:42,485 --> 02:07:47,393
So the next commenter that we have is Sheila Ahrens.

1318
02:07:49,235 --> 02:07:52,120
Sheila, please state your name and address for the record.

1319
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:56,647
I'm going to unmute you and Alicia will start a timer for three minutes.

1320
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:00,811
Aaron's 19 Sagamore Park.

1321
02:08:01,791 --> 02:08:03,192
Just a couple of questions.

1322
02:08:04,693 --> 02:08:19,800
You had mentioned something about the river on Clippership Drive and I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more about why there can't be development along the river there because that's just you know

1323
02:08:20,792 --> 02:08:24,014
the most exciting cities have access to the river.

1324
02:08:24,094 --> 02:08:26,456
I was just in Chicago and it's amazing.

1325
02:08:26,996 --> 02:08:28,977
Places like Newburyport, et cetera.

1326
02:08:29,418 --> 02:08:36,202
So could you elaborate a little bit more why we wouldn't be able to do that or can we do that?

1327
02:08:38,167 --> 02:08:39,648
Do you have other questions, Sheila?

1328
02:08:39,908 --> 02:08:41,209
Just so we're not using up your time.

1329
02:08:41,989 --> 02:08:46,672
And the other question was about that John mentioned about design review.

1330
02:08:46,812 --> 02:08:48,793
And you said that there would be.

1331
02:08:48,813 --> 02:09:04,702
So I was wondering if you're going to develop some sort of criteria about what exactly is going to be required for the design of new developments so we can continue to have beautiful squares and a beautiful Medford.

1332
02:09:08,307 --> 02:09:11,270
Oh, and I also wanted to comment one thing is thank you.

1333
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:16,254
You guys did an amazing job about getting the word out about this meeting.

1334
02:09:16,314 --> 02:09:22,420
I've gotten like six different emails and notifications from many different ways.

1335
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:28,645
And thank you for making such a concerted effort to make that happen.

1336
02:09:28,685 --> 02:09:30,227
I really, really appreciate it.

1337
02:09:31,719 --> 02:09:32,879
Thank you for saying that, Sheila.

1338
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:40,262
We're hoping we're not going to the extreme where we're annoying people, but we would prefer to have people be aware.

1339
02:09:40,642 --> 02:09:42,042
It's good to get the positive feedback.

1340
02:09:42,562 --> 02:09:44,283
Yeah, no, you did an amazing job.

1341
02:09:44,343 --> 02:09:44,823
Thank you.

1342
02:09:45,543 --> 02:09:47,164
Yeah, well, thanks to members of the city staff.

1343
02:09:47,764 --> 02:09:53,946
They're kind of the boots on the ground with that work, and not just this office, the communications office, mayor's office.

1344
02:09:55,086 --> 02:09:58,587
But as always, open to critical feedback or suggestions as well.

1345
02:09:59,905 --> 02:10:01,627
So we had a couple of questions.

1346
02:10:01,827 --> 02:10:09,756
We had, why can't we turn this into Medford's version of the Chicago Riverwalk?

1347
02:10:11,338 --> 02:10:12,199
What was the other one?

1348
02:10:12,219 --> 02:10:14,381
About design review.

1349
02:10:14,662 --> 02:10:15,643
Yes, design review.

1350
02:10:15,783 --> 02:10:16,584
Yes, thank you, Sheila.

1351
02:10:17,833 --> 02:10:19,434
Madam Chair, I can address those.

1352
02:10:20,574 --> 02:10:27,497
I think it might've been my comment and it was possibly I did not speak as well as I could have done.

1353
02:10:27,597 --> 02:10:29,237
So I'm gonna take you on a little tour.

1354
02:10:31,178 --> 02:10:37,980
The comment that I made in terms of development was in reference to where the MX1 buildings are.

1355
02:10:38,081 --> 02:10:40,201
This is the section, this is obviously the river.

1356
02:10:40,882 --> 02:10:44,043
This is the section that we have proposed for MX1.

1357
02:10:45,223 --> 02:10:48,705
If we walk a little bit down here, you can see it's two stories.

1358
02:10:49,386 --> 02:11:02,153
As we go around the corner, you can see, to move a little bit further away, this is also an imperfect tool, but you can see two stories wrapping around the corner, and as you go down the side, you've got these historic areas.

1359
02:11:02,794 --> 02:11:13,100
What you will have noticed from that is that these buildings butt up, not just against the river, but some of them in some cases are bang on top of the seawall.

1360
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:21,904
And so our concern is those, those, and then looking at the map, those parcels are also not particularly deep.

1361
02:11:22,524 --> 02:11:28,187
And so if you're requiring parking on site, and you're, you're.

1362
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:36,042
putting it in place that those buildings could be significantly higher, there's not actually a lot of room to do that.

1363
02:11:36,742 --> 02:11:51,547
The buildings, if they are structurally capable of doing that, potentially you could add a story or two on top of them if the building's already set like that, but you'd have to have structural engineering, that question is outside of zoning.

1364
02:11:51,647 --> 02:11:55,228
So it's not that Medford can't develop along the river,

1365
02:11:56,249 --> 02:12:02,625
It's not that we want to restrict development in Medford Square, it's that as a practical matter,

1366
02:12:03,457 --> 02:12:13,364
The ability for that particular stretch to develop to the height of some of the other districts is somewhat limited and that was our thinking on that.

1367
02:12:13,744 --> 02:12:20,949
So, well, not quite as high as other parts of the square.

1368
02:12:20,969 --> 02:12:25,251
And also, visually, it's a little bit hard for me to.

1369
02:12:26,412 --> 02:12:50,001
see that with what you're you know showing it's my issue that it's hard for me to visualize it but when you're going down clipper ship drive you see the river to the right of you where the street is and i guess i was talking about that area as well you know because i know they've reconfigured medford square several times um and you know

1370
02:12:50,805 --> 02:12:57,869
could that area where the street is possibly be buildings overlooking the river?

1371
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:01,311
Absolutely.

1372
02:13:01,871 --> 02:13:08,354
The rest of your comments on the rest of Clippership Drive, I just wanted to make clear I wasn't speaking to that part.

1373
02:13:08,715 --> 02:13:12,136
We have higher areas zoned in Medford.

1374
02:13:12,176 --> 02:13:14,598
Polly, you could put the map up if it makes sense.

1375
02:13:15,498 --> 02:13:24,621
Um, to see that, and I apologize, I just wanted to kind of give people an idea of maybe to look to walk down there or to look at the maps.

1376
02:13:24,701 --> 02:13:34,185
It's so it's where I was talking about was the light blue area, which is MX 1 for as of right with a story of incentive for a maximum of 5.

1377
02:13:35,365 --> 02:13:44,508
If you look at where Paola is pointing out, the purple, the 2B, that's seven stories by right with two as an incentive zoning.

1378
02:13:44,689 --> 02:13:46,589
That's right along Clippership Drive.

1379
02:13:46,949 --> 02:13:50,451
Absolutely, you can see those parcels are deeper.

1380
02:13:50,471 --> 02:13:58,694
They're also not sitting directly on the seawall, the river wall, I suppose, the way the others were.

1381
02:13:59,694 --> 02:14:04,636
We think in our conversations, there's more opportunity in that stretch,

1382
02:14:05,237 --> 02:14:08,178
than there is in the stretch that's colored light blue.

1383
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:17,502
But obviously, what we're doing here is listening to comments as to whether or not people have spotted something that we haven't and taking that into account.

1384
02:14:19,447 --> 02:14:29,711
And also those buildings like Real Gusto has a, I think they do actually have a patio on the back of the building that overlooks the river.

1385
02:14:29,771 --> 02:14:37,413
And it would be wonderful if there could be, you know, patios in the back of those buildings overlooking the river.

1386
02:14:39,694 --> 02:14:41,795
So, you know, that's a thought.

1387
02:14:44,228 --> 02:14:46,190
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1388
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:47,631
I love outdoor dining.

1389
02:14:47,651 --> 02:14:52,214
We don't get a lot of time for it in New England, but what we do have, we want to take advantage of.

1390
02:14:52,735 --> 02:15:07,587
And then just, I don't know if this was in your head, Sheila, but you had mentioned the road, Clippership Drive, and zoning is only for the regulation of private land, not public land, so the road wouldn't be subject

1391
02:15:08,187 --> 02:15:10,508
to these zoning updates.

1392
02:15:11,108 --> 02:15:21,050
If something was to happen to the road, that would have to be an effort by the city to redo the transportation plan and lay out there.

1393
02:15:21,250 --> 02:15:27,011
But that is, for better or for worse, not part of this topic.

1394
02:15:27,111 --> 02:15:27,972
But who knows?

1395
02:15:28,492 --> 02:15:37,534
If there is more development in that area, if there's more pedestrian activity, if we have more accessible transit and bikes,

1396
02:15:38,037 --> 02:15:40,534
then maybe some of these roads can be rethought.

1397
02:15:41,395 --> 02:15:41,755
Alicia.

1398
02:15:41,915 --> 02:15:52,020
So let me just ask you, so I'm kind of puzzled why it isn't the overall master plan that takes all of these into consideration.

1399
02:15:52,040 --> 02:16:01,024
It seems like it should be the whole plan is with this as well, with how the square is configured, if you're going to do zoning.

1400
02:16:01,105 --> 02:16:09,549
I mean, I don't know, this is not obviously my expertise, but I'm just sort of puzzled why it wouldn't be the overall design and master plan.

1401
02:16:10,629 --> 02:16:23,864
um meaning the like the public roads too yeah exactly exactly it's a good question and i bet you're not the only one alicia might have a more eloquent answer but you know i don't know

1402
02:16:24,598 --> 02:16:27,019
So I'll actually, I'll just shift one.

1403
02:16:27,139 --> 02:16:28,799
So I have both answers a little bit.

1404
02:16:29,739 --> 02:16:30,940
So there are plans.

1405
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,540
There have been many plans for Medford Square.

1406
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:39,362
We have actually shared many of those with Emily and her team so that she's seen these plans.

1407
02:16:39,442 --> 02:16:43,103
And some of them talk about, can we redirect where these roads go?

1408
02:16:43,643 --> 02:16:46,704
With the development of the lots on the right end of the city.

1409
02:16:46,744 --> 02:16:51,925
So right now the area that's the darkest purple and then the light purple, you can see the city hall circle.

1410
02:16:52,385 --> 02:17:10,999
those lots that are out for RFP, we are talking with our traffic director, our engineer, and DPW about should we redo how some of these roads flow, and actually that purple area between Clippership Drive and Riverside Ave, the part that is not owned by the city is all owned by one owner,

1411
02:17:11,426 --> 02:17:13,507
And I'm in active conversations with him.

1412
02:17:13,947 --> 02:17:18,068
One of those buildings is the one that you may have seen 65 Riverside.

1413
02:17:18,189 --> 02:17:23,390
All the tenants have had their leases end because the building needs to go down.

1414
02:17:23,951 --> 02:17:24,171
Right.

1415
02:17:24,531 --> 02:17:25,571
He owns the whole thing.

1416
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:31,313
I've said to him that we really want to talk with your architect about can we make these buildings river facing?

1417
02:17:31,433 --> 02:17:32,514
How do we make that happen?

1418
02:17:32,978 --> 02:17:35,060
So that is actually an active project.

1419
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:38,503
I'm hoping to meet with them next week with our economic development director.

1420
02:17:39,004 --> 02:17:40,845
So we are thinking about those things.

1421
02:17:41,326 --> 02:17:46,551
It's just, they're not controlled by zoning and therefore they're not part of this public hearing.

1422
02:17:47,051 --> 02:17:50,494
But in fact, the city staff are working on those things at the same time.

1423
02:17:51,595 --> 02:17:52,296
Right, right.

1424
02:17:52,977 --> 02:17:53,337
Okay.

1425
02:17:53,717 --> 02:17:53,998
All right.

1426
02:17:54,058 --> 02:17:54,899
Thank you very much.

1427
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:57,121
Great questions, Sheila.

1428
02:17:57,241 --> 02:17:57,921
Thank you so much.

1429
02:17:58,914 --> 02:18:09,641
If I may, I just wanted to add that we could add some incentives specific for this area to address the riverfront.

1430
02:18:10,842 --> 02:18:15,245
So to encourage riverfront design.

1431
02:18:16,226 --> 02:18:22,770
I think that could be some recommendations that we consider as a board after discussion.

1432
02:18:27,265 --> 02:18:28,486
I see two hands left.

1433
02:18:29,006 --> 02:18:31,407
Just a reminder to the public, if you, oh, three hands, nice.

1434
02:18:32,228 --> 02:18:34,769
If you want to make comment, please use the raise hand function.

1435
02:18:35,289 --> 02:18:38,071
The next commenter that I see is Kellogg Kellogg.

1436
02:18:39,031 --> 02:18:40,992
Please state your name and address for the record.

1437
02:18:41,012 --> 02:18:44,855
Alicia is going to start a timer for three minutes and I'm going to unmute you.

1438
02:18:46,956 --> 02:18:56,621
Hello, this is Jonah Dacola and I'm at 11 Killscythe Road in Medford.

1439
02:18:59,408 --> 02:19:10,120
I would like to take advantage of, Emily, your street viewer in reference to my question.

1440
02:19:11,561 --> 02:19:18,348
If you could bring up 30 Killscythe Road.

1441
02:19:18,949 --> 02:19:20,110
It's a Scottish word.

1442
02:19:21,158 --> 02:19:30,984
probably meant to give the British the finger at the time it was named, K-I-L-S-Y-T-H Road.

1443
02:19:32,826 --> 02:19:43,212
I'm at 11 Killscythe Road and my question is related to Paola's explanation of the shading and the 45 degree angle

1444
02:19:45,885 --> 02:19:51,849
and the reference to elevation for abutters.

1445
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:54,711
So in looking at this street,

1446
02:19:56,242 --> 02:20:18,502
uh... you can see that uh... somerville did what they always do they don't take into any account in their zoning review of broadway with suggesting six stories on either side of broadway and you know shading medford as a already have with their large apartment buildings on the top of winter hill

1447
02:20:21,741 --> 02:20:45,036
I've just done quite a bit of work for the community in getting a new transformer put in, so that when I placed solar on our system, on our building, we wouldn't take all the capacity of the infrastructure of National Grid, so that our neighbors could also put solar on their buildings.

1448
02:20:46,373 --> 02:20:58,179
But if you bring up the street, Emily, you can see that there is an inclination, the terrain.

1449
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:03,202
So please explain how we could put a four-story building.

1450
02:21:03,842 --> 02:21:08,945
It seems like our building would become nonconforming as it stands.

1451
02:21:10,068 --> 02:21:27,996
and our abutters, which I appreciate because I can see the shadow that our building casts, not only on our street, but many streets over in the time period that you're explaining.

1452
02:21:28,856 --> 02:21:38,260
So I'm not a proponent of trying to go up higher and shade more of my neighbors, considering the prices of electricity.

1453
02:21:39,252 --> 02:21:50,719
Furthermore, Emily, if you could also bring up in the answer to the question, the top of Killsite Ave is what we call around here Upper Broadway.

1454
02:21:52,179 --> 02:21:55,981
And how does that affect emergency services?

1455
02:21:56,542 --> 02:21:58,463
I'm not talking about traffic and parking.

1456
02:21:58,883 --> 02:22:07,148
I'm talking about a ladder truck for a multifamily building that has very short setbacks to abutters.

1457
02:22:08,331 --> 02:22:15,795
made of wood construction and the use group and the facades of our combustible facades.

1458
02:22:16,355 --> 02:22:22,538
After seeing what happened in California, it makes me a little concerned about what more density will do.

1459
02:22:22,898 --> 02:22:30,442
Maybe I'm just a, you know, have a long memory for Chicago and Chicago fires with wood structures tightly packed.

1460
02:22:31,365 --> 02:22:39,211
So I'm going to ask you to just wrap up your question so we can start to get an answer because that might trigger some additional feedback from you.

1461
02:22:39,811 --> 02:22:40,231
Thank you.

1462
02:22:41,312 --> 02:22:41,612
Please.

1463
02:22:43,214 --> 02:22:47,577
And if you have a street view, it would be helpful if you could bring that up like you did the last.

1464
02:22:50,066 --> 02:22:54,630
I'm just looking for direction from the, the chair, I do have the street view on my computer.

1465
02:22:55,751 --> 02:22:57,332
Please go ahead.

1466
02:22:57,612 --> 02:23:10,302
This is the area that's in corridors, this is not under the area that's of the public hearing tonight so this zoning is in pre draft, nothing has actually gone to the city council to be referred to you yet.

1467
02:23:11,593 --> 02:23:12,934
Okay, recognize that.

1468
02:23:12,974 --> 02:23:14,936
So maybe let's do a quick answer for this.

1469
02:23:16,977 --> 02:23:27,084
But Jonah, it sounds like this might be feedback that we're able to implement at future recommendations or other opportunities.

1470
02:23:28,285 --> 02:23:29,346
I like the shading.

1471
02:23:30,126 --> 02:23:40,013
So I think that's a great idea, but just how it would relate, maybe we'll answer some questions for folks if they could see the street view.

1472
02:23:41,673 --> 02:23:45,575
I am adding the street view now having been directed by the chair, you should all see it.

1473
02:23:45,695 --> 02:23:54,458
So I think we can safely say, sir, that you have significant typography on your street and I appreciate you bringing this up.

1474
02:23:54,858 --> 02:23:58,700
I think 1 of the things that's been most helpful to us as we.

1475
02:24:00,380 --> 02:24:07,442
uh, as we've had these conversations is hearing specific speed feedback about specific streets and asking what those conditions are.

1476
02:24:07,482 --> 02:24:09,183
So this is, this is very useful.

1477
02:24:09,803 --> 02:24:15,565
It is part of, uh, the, the corridor zoning as, uh, Director Hunt mentioned.

1478
02:24:15,685 --> 02:24:18,285
So there's nothing final on that.

1479
02:24:18,385 --> 02:24:24,007
What your comments allow us to do is to go back and check some of the conditions along these streets.

1480
02:24:24,847 --> 02:24:27,569
and see what's appropriate.

1481
02:24:27,909 --> 02:24:35,755
There are two things that I do want to very quickly address because they're more general comments about zoning.

1482
02:24:36,375 --> 02:24:44,801
One is, I mentioned zoning was an imperfect tool in some ways for things like historic preservation.

1483
02:24:45,301 --> 02:24:49,103
It also doesn't cover everything and what does sort of

1484
02:24:50,264 --> 02:24:56,067
work with it are the building codes, and the building codes have strict requirements.

1485
02:24:56,087 --> 02:24:59,829
You mentioned concerns about the distances between buildings.

1486
02:25:00,209 --> 02:25:03,071
The building code does have requirements for that.

1487
02:25:04,312 --> 02:25:12,256
In general, our setbacks also are similar to those, and we can certainly look at it on a case-by-case basis.

1488
02:25:12,836 --> 02:25:19,720
When we are looking at older neighborhoods that may be nonconforming in terms of setbacks, either front, side, or rear,

1489
02:25:20,652 --> 02:25:25,793
building sizes or building heights, it's also possible that they don't conform to the current building codes.

1490
02:25:25,953 --> 02:25:31,195
So just to keep that in mind, but thank you for bringing this area up.

1491
02:25:31,275 --> 02:25:42,958
We will take a note of it and see if we need to make any recommendations the next time we go to planning and permitting to continue the discussion of this draft.

1492
02:25:43,018 --> 02:25:46,699
Again, it hasn't been referred to the CD board just yet, so we appreciate it.

1493
02:25:48,487 --> 02:25:49,167
Great, thank you.

1494
02:25:49,748 --> 02:25:53,651
The next commenter that I see is Zoe Mutsos.

1495
02:25:54,831 --> 02:25:57,093
Please state your name and address for the record.

1496
02:25:58,294 --> 02:26:03,017
I'm going to go ahead and unmute you, and Alicia is going to start a timer for three minutes.

1497
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:09,561
Hi, Zoe Moobsos, 33 Johnson Ave.

1498
02:26:10,081 --> 02:26:18,785
My question is specific to the squares zoning, West Medford Square in particular, but I think it applies to Medford Square as well.

1499
02:26:20,245 --> 02:26:23,387
You know, if we could see the ranges or the

1500
02:26:24,907 --> 02:26:29,632
MXs that are happening in those in West Medford Square, it might help a little bit.

1501
02:26:29,752 --> 02:26:43,247
I remember at one of our meetings, Emily and Paola talked about when a parcel is redeveloped, when

1502
02:26:45,675 --> 02:26:53,543
The zoning, I think it's the zoning, mandates that the sidewalk become a certain width.

1503
02:26:54,784 --> 02:27:01,511
Because West Memphis Square, I am always curious whether the high street to

1504
02:27:02,212 --> 02:27:07,773
between like Snappy Patty's and the ice cream shop are more narrow than anywhere else on High Street, because it feels that way.

1505
02:27:08,153 --> 02:27:14,775
And then you think about going up higher and that those sidewalks are narrow, not super narrow, but narrow.

1506
02:27:14,935 --> 02:27:22,696
And if we are successful in getting folks walking around there, we got to have some wider sidewalks if those places are redeveloped.

1507
02:27:22,756 --> 02:27:28,558
So could you remind us again when or how that would come into play?

1508
02:27:28,578 --> 02:27:30,398
Because I think that's really important

1509
02:27:30,978 --> 02:27:39,940
Also, for sense of space and scale that you're not going to feel like tall buildings are right up against the street, which makes it feel like a tunnel and kind of dark.

1510
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:43,520
And then I would just also say.

1511
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:53,862
Last week, the presentation at the Q and a that Emily, you gave, I thought was really, really helpful in, like, stepping through this full process.

1512
02:27:54,402 --> 02:27:59,283
So, if anyone hasn't seen it, or you have an opportunity to go to another Q and a, I would encourage.

1513
02:28:00,023 --> 02:28:06,749
in his team to do that presentation again, because that was really thoughtful, and I think answered a lot of the questions that people continue to have.

1514
02:28:06,929 --> 02:28:14,635
And you start to see the layered process, and it starts to click together how these things work separately, but also in tandem.

1515
02:28:18,138 --> 02:28:19,680
Zoe, did you have any other questions?

1516
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:20,180
That's it.

1517
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:21,081
That's my question.

1518
02:28:21,942 --> 02:28:22,282
Awesome.

1519
02:28:22,342 --> 02:28:23,022
Thank you so much.

1520
02:28:23,263 --> 02:28:24,304
Very thoughtful questions.

1521
02:28:25,649 --> 02:28:29,250
Emily or Paola, did you have any thoughts or feedback on this?

1522
02:28:30,171 --> 02:28:31,731
I should defer to Paola, yes.

1523
02:28:32,531 --> 02:28:34,372
Yes, if I may.

1524
02:28:35,132 --> 02:28:36,412
So thank you for your feedback.

1525
02:28:36,552 --> 02:28:39,073
Thank you for encouraging people to go.

1526
02:28:39,133 --> 02:28:43,675
We are there for answering any questions we are doing today, but more specific.

1527
02:28:43,715 --> 02:28:50,157
We usually have big maps so we can point out to specific areas, et cetera.

1528
02:28:50,217 --> 02:28:51,057
So thank you for that.

1529
02:28:52,678 --> 02:29:04,788
And the next one will be the ninth at the library about parking and TDM, which I think it's also very interesting in the TDM, the transportation management might be very interesting for a lot of people.

1530
02:29:04,968 --> 02:29:06,149
So very welcome.

1531
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:07,851
Just wanted to address that.

1532
02:29:08,632 --> 02:29:18,760
And second, so yes, we do have, we ask for whenever there's a new development, that they will address the sidewalk.

1533
02:29:20,307 --> 02:29:29,149
we don't ask for, it depends by lot, if they already have that space or if they don't.

1534
02:29:29,309 --> 02:29:44,412
So what we want is that at the long term, so whenever all that high street is being redone, that we at least have those, and I think it might be 12 feet of sidewalk, so that we have at least

1535
02:29:45,065 --> 02:29:53,428
space for good walking and even being able to have green between traffic and the sidewalk.

1536
02:29:54,250 --> 02:29:57,351
So sometimes when they are very historic, they are very narrow.

1537
02:29:58,691 --> 02:30:02,772
And so to adapt those areas, it is a little bit more difficult.

1538
02:30:03,432 --> 02:30:10,034
So this is the chance that we have with zoning to ask for that 12 foot sidewalks.

1539
02:30:10,494 --> 02:30:12,734
So it depends, you might already have that.

1540
02:30:13,135 --> 02:30:14,875
And so you don't have to do any extra.

1541
02:30:15,195 --> 02:30:19,316
But if your law does not allow that sidewalk, then you would have to step a little bit.

1542
02:30:21,084 --> 02:30:25,567
And just to clarify, that is extending the sidewalk onto the private property.

1543
02:30:25,788 --> 02:30:34,654
So for example, if you are adjacent to the public sidewalk, the public sidewalk is only six feet wide.

1544
02:30:34,814 --> 02:30:37,617
Then on the private property, you would have to bring it up.

1545
02:30:37,697 --> 02:30:43,021
In the areas that require 12 feet, you would have to bring it up an additional six feet on the private side.

1546
02:30:43,061 --> 02:30:47,724
So it doesn't, I think this was a source of confusion when we first started talking about it.

1547
02:30:47,764 --> 02:30:49,926
It does not affect the public right of way.

1548
02:30:50,905 --> 02:30:52,827
It's an addition on the private property.

1549
02:30:59,492 --> 02:30:59,712
Great.

1550
02:30:59,993 --> 02:31:01,074
Thanks for that, Emily and Paola.

1551
02:31:03,155 --> 02:31:07,299
So, Zoe, I saw your hand pop back up.

1552
02:31:07,939 --> 02:31:09,120
Do you have a clarifying question?

1553
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:09,941
I do.

1554
02:31:10,261 --> 02:31:10,581
I do.

1555
02:31:10,621 --> 02:31:11,462
Yeah.

1556
02:31:11,762 --> 02:31:12,263
Sorry about that.

1557
02:31:13,163 --> 02:31:15,906
When you say, do we, can you show us where

1558
02:31:17,281 --> 02:31:22,445
if this happened, it would be 12 feet, because I think those sidewalks are nowhere near 12 feet right now.

1559
02:31:25,608 --> 02:31:29,111
And it would be 12 feet on one side of the street, right?

1560
02:31:29,151 --> 02:31:41,061
We're not saying like, not 12 feet in total, two sides of the street, 12, because they are, I don't think they're 12 feet anywhere that I can think of, at least in West Medford, maybe in front of the school.

1561
02:31:42,276 --> 02:31:44,798
So think of it as changing over time, right?

1562
02:31:44,838 --> 02:31:48,400
This would be a development by development.

1563
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:57,006
So you would have a situation, because when we talk about zoning, we talk about something that might happen over 20 to 30 years.

1564
02:31:57,226 --> 02:31:59,788
Some things might happen within the next five years.

1565
02:32:00,728 --> 02:32:02,649
Maybe there's something that happens within a year.

1566
02:32:03,710 --> 02:32:15,080
So you would have a condition in which the sidewalk is going to widen or narrow depending on whether or not a building has been developed, but that requirement would apply throughout the district.

1567
02:32:15,461 --> 02:32:20,686
It just depends on when a property is redeveloped as to whether or not the sidewalk happens.

1568
02:32:21,206 --> 02:32:23,088
And remember, you're not thinking about the

1569
02:32:24,282 --> 02:32:29,345
the currents that you're adding on to the current sidewalk on the private property side.

1570
02:32:29,886 --> 02:32:39,171
So if you had buildings that were rebuilt on either side of the street and had sufficient depth to meet the requirements, then that's where you would get the sidewalks.

1571
02:32:41,292 --> 02:32:45,074
So it could potentially look a little bit like a zipper for a while.

1572
02:32:45,094 --> 02:32:48,036
It could, yes, exactly.

1573
02:32:48,296 --> 02:32:51,518
You see that in other places where there are historic buildings,

1574
02:32:52,342 --> 02:32:55,203
and new infill development has come in over time.

1575
02:32:55,303 --> 02:32:58,045
So it's not uncommon to see that effect.

1576
02:32:59,045 --> 02:32:59,305
Okay.

1577
02:32:59,445 --> 02:32:59,665
All right.

1578
02:32:59,685 --> 02:33:00,045
That's great.

1579
02:33:00,085 --> 02:33:00,446
Thank you.

1580
02:33:01,566 --> 02:33:02,186
Thank you, Zoe.

1581
02:33:05,188 --> 02:33:06,928
The next commenter that I see is Caitlin.

1582
02:33:07,629 --> 02:33:09,629
Please state your name and address for the record.

1583
02:33:09,649 --> 02:33:15,952
Alicia is going to start a timer for about three minutes, and I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1584
02:33:16,812 --> 02:33:17,953
Danielle's got the timer this time.

1585
02:33:20,952 --> 02:33:24,594
Hi, I'm Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street.

1586
02:33:25,814 --> 02:33:40,000
In response to a speaker earlier, Emily had brought up the street view of Medford Square, and we saw some of the historic buildings there, including like the building that has Real Gusto.

1587
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:41,160
And I

1588
02:33:43,693 --> 02:33:48,516
And she made a comment about, like, you know, redevelopment would now be subject to parking minimums.

1589
02:33:48,556 --> 02:33:58,262
And I just wanted to say, like, how alarming it is to me that, like, in the historic city center, that development might now have parking minimums.

1590
02:33:58,343 --> 02:34:08,589
So, like, even if it's, like, underground, that being, like, more, like, the driveway, like the curb cuts for driveways, I just feel like

1591
02:34:09,248 --> 02:34:13,229
it would be completely inappropriate for like the historic city center.

1592
02:34:14,210 --> 02:34:19,572
And then a question that I have, which I apologize, I missed most of this meeting.

1593
02:34:19,652 --> 02:34:21,332
So this may have already been addressed.

1594
02:34:21,792 --> 02:34:30,435
But as far as setbacks go, one of the things that I find really charming about Medford Square is that the buildings are right up to the sidewalk.

1595
02:34:31,756 --> 02:34:35,757
Are there setbacks required in that area of

1596
02:34:36,079 --> 02:34:39,936
Medford Square or will buildings still be allowed to be right up to the sidewalk?

1597
02:34:42,209 --> 02:34:42,469
Thank you.

1598
02:34:42,489 --> 02:34:43,569
Do you have any other questions?

1599
02:34:43,949 --> 02:34:44,570
No, that's all.

1600
02:34:45,350 --> 02:34:45,610
Okay.

1601
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:47,210
Just real quick on the parking.

1602
02:34:48,251 --> 02:34:50,671
We're not doing anything with parking right now.

1603
02:34:50,711 --> 02:34:58,873
That does not mean we agree with the parking, but it also means that the requirements that are being discussed today are the current requirements.

1604
02:34:59,814 --> 02:35:00,774
So we could do nothing.

1605
02:35:01,434 --> 02:35:08,536
And if Real Gusto was to be redeveloped, there would be some parking involved.

1606
02:35:09,136 --> 02:35:12,437
So this isn't like this isn't because of the work we're doing now.

1607
02:35:13,417 --> 02:35:17,618
This is like step one of like overall change in the city.

1608
02:35:17,978 --> 02:35:29,541
So just want to kind of put that out there because I agree with you, Caitlin, I think, you know, if they had to have like a bunch of parking spaces that took up, you know, the river or the street or the first, that would be awful.

1609
02:35:30,021 --> 02:35:36,383
And we don't want that, which is why we're kind of working towards, you know, I think what we're all imagining Medford to be.

1610
02:35:37,117 --> 02:35:42,140
you know, happy, healthy place for everyone to, you know, live, work, raise their family and have fun.

1611
02:35:42,961 --> 02:35:44,642
So that's just my first note on parking.

1612
02:35:45,642 --> 02:35:49,745
And then setbacks, I'm going to defer that to Emily and Paola.

1613
02:35:51,108 --> 02:35:56,050
Actually, Madam Chair, I'm going to take parking briefly and then turn it over to Paola.

1614
02:35:56,630 --> 02:36:09,494
But in terms of parking, again, driving people, no pun intended, to the Monday meeting, something that I have seen in other communities and is quite common for a

1615
02:36:10,454 --> 02:36:19,422
central commercial district like this one, a downtown area or a square, is relaxation of parking requirements.

1616
02:36:19,582 --> 02:36:28,651
I have seen, for example, the idea that if a historic building is preserved, that parking is not required for the historic part of the development.

1617
02:36:29,571 --> 02:36:34,656
I've seen others where there's an incentive to have the ground floor commercial

1618
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:39,672
by not requiring parking for that, but maybe there is a requirement for the residential parking.

1619
02:36:40,213 --> 02:36:59,123
All this to say that because we have not, we are not coming forward yet with any parking recommendations, that we're hoping that all of these topics are a conversation on Monday and really want to hear from people exactly some of the things that have been expressed about parking, about people's thoughts about parking today.

1620
02:36:59,843 --> 02:37:12,788
With that, I will turn it over to Paola, but just to remember that if there is no change to the existing building, there's no requirement for a setback, right?

1621
02:37:12,888 --> 02:37:16,650
The zoning does not affect what exists now.

1622
02:37:17,010 --> 02:37:19,651
It provides options for what could happen in the future.

1623
02:37:19,791 --> 02:37:21,832
So, Paola, I'll turn it over to you on setbacks.

1624
02:37:24,772 --> 02:37:37,117
Yes, so if I may, the front setbacks that we have, again, is to provide as much space for walkability and activation of the street.

1625
02:37:37,537 --> 02:37:40,218
So what we have is a minimum for front setback of three.

1626
02:37:41,117 --> 02:37:44,440
And that is always to add to the sidewalks that are usually narrow.

1627
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:49,503
So we ask for a sidewalk of 12 and then three setback.

1628
02:37:50,224 --> 02:38:04,855
So what we try to do that is if they want to do terrace, if they want to do any display, the menu, any sign that they have those three feet to at least be able to do that, we want to give some flexibility.

1629
02:38:07,627 --> 02:38:28,382
do you hear me now yes okay uh sorry my uh the the last time i heard was gone one second the battery is gone flexibility now i can hear you okay you're live uh in my living room um so if the um

1630
02:38:30,543 --> 02:38:37,967
So we wanted to create that flexibility between that inside and outside private and public space to give at least those three feet.

1631
02:38:38,167 --> 02:38:43,570
Now, we also give extensions up to 20, but you have to activate that area.

1632
02:38:44,010 --> 02:38:53,655
So you can use up to 20 if you do a terrace, if you do a green area, if you provide sitting, if you provide something that is activating or giving green.

1633
02:38:54,715 --> 02:38:55,396
to the street.

1634
02:38:56,336 --> 02:38:58,277
So those are the frontages that we have.

1635
02:38:58,317 --> 02:39:04,739
What we want is to create walkable areas, especially on the squares, to give a lot of public space.

1636
02:39:05,319 --> 02:39:07,460
So the minimum is the three.

1637
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:10,261
We want the buildings to be as close as possible.

1638
02:39:10,762 --> 02:39:13,563
And if they do setbacks, they need to be activated.

1639
02:39:13,583 --> 02:39:15,403
Okay, thank you.

1640
02:39:19,792 --> 02:39:21,272
Great comments, great questions.

1641
02:39:22,673 --> 02:39:23,553
Got a couple more.

1642
02:39:25,054 --> 02:39:29,475
The next commenter that I see is ADM, Sharon Diesso.

1643
02:39:30,375 --> 02:39:32,176
Please state your name and address for the record.

1644
02:39:32,196 --> 02:39:37,377
I'm going to ask you to unmute, and Danielle or Alicia will start a timer for about three minutes.

1645
02:39:44,259 --> 02:39:45,759
I can't hear you, unfortunately.

1646
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:47,620
Can you make sure that your audio

1647
02:39:48,678 --> 02:39:50,639
is synced with your computer?

1648
02:39:55,402 --> 02:39:56,242
I can't hear you.

1649
02:40:02,205 --> 02:40:08,188
So if you're talking, the microphone in the bottom left corner should be lighting up green.

1650
02:40:08,808 --> 02:40:12,951
If it's not, then I think you can go to test

1651
02:40:17,376 --> 02:40:20,238
And then that will walk you through a little troubleshooting exercise.

1652
02:40:22,580 --> 02:40:27,264
Yeah, I had to just do it myself because I forgot how to do it, so.

1653
02:40:29,025 --> 02:40:29,846
I'll give you a minute.

1654
02:40:48,170 --> 02:40:49,631
Unfortunately, I still can't hear you.

1655
02:40:53,313 --> 02:40:55,914
This is definitely one of the challenges of these virtual meetings.

1656
02:41:03,839 --> 02:41:09,122
Danielle or Alicia, would you be able to help Sharon troubleshoot in the background?

1657
02:41:20,972 --> 02:41:22,774
I'm going to send you a private message.

1658
02:41:23,535 --> 02:41:26,518
Just definitely respond to it so that I know that you've seen it.

1659
02:42:04,653 --> 02:42:09,357
Sharon, while you're troubleshooting, I'm going to take another new commenter, but we'll come back to you, if that's all right.

1660
02:42:11,879 --> 02:42:20,445
And just to give the public a heads up, we typically only have each commenter comment once.

1661
02:42:22,827 --> 02:42:23,848
That's our usual practice.

1662
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:28,712
So I'd encourage those that have additional comments to send them via email.

1663
02:42:30,734 --> 02:42:33,756
We may get to a second comment, but we typically

1664
02:42:34,509 --> 02:42:39,552
don't do that, just to try to have equity across the commenters.

1665
02:42:41,272 --> 02:42:44,714
So the next commenter that I see is Fire East Ford Tau.

1666
02:42:47,596 --> 02:42:52,838
You're going to get a request to unmute, and please state your name and address for the record.

1667
02:42:52,858 --> 02:42:59,501
And Alicia, I can start a timer on my phone, just so you can focus on troubleshooting with Sharon.

1668
02:43:01,818 --> 02:43:03,640
Daniella's the timer going right now.

1669
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:07,244
Sharon, can you just give me a thumbs up if you saw my message?

1670
02:43:08,985 --> 02:43:09,526
Okay, great.

1671
02:43:12,889 --> 02:43:14,871
Okay.

1672
02:43:15,031 --> 02:43:17,693
I'll do the timer anyways, just in case.

1673
02:43:19,815 --> 02:43:21,397
Fire East Ford Tau, are you there?

1674
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:31,372
We can't hear you if you're speaking.

1675
02:43:31,392 --> 02:43:40,344
Looks like you just muted yourself or somebody muted you.

1676
02:43:40,364 --> 02:43:41,445
I'm going to try again.

1677
02:43:45,791 --> 02:43:47,133
Fire East Ford Tau.

1678
02:43:59,718 --> 02:44:01,300
All right, unfortunately, we're not able to hear you.

1679
02:44:03,763 --> 02:44:04,383
Let's see.

1680
02:44:04,403 --> 02:44:16,137
Oh, and the hand just dropped.

1681
02:44:21,375 --> 02:44:28,999
Karen sent me her message in text because she's not been successful in the troubleshooting.

1682
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:33,461
So I'm going to read her comments out loud.

1683
02:44:34,562 --> 02:44:34,922
Awesome.

1684
02:44:35,162 --> 02:44:35,442
Thank you.

1685
02:44:35,783 --> 02:44:43,046
I really appreciate you being patient with us, Sharon, and thank you for sharing your comment, Alicia, if you wouldn't mind.

1686
02:44:43,727 --> 02:44:45,968
She says, I hear real concerns here tonight.

1687
02:44:46,368 --> 02:44:48,269
We should not be planning, and this

1688
02:44:49,253 --> 02:44:54,775
planning should hold until safety, traffic and practability are addressed.

1689
02:44:55,255 --> 02:44:57,576
70% of our traffic is from out of town.

1690
02:44:57,696 --> 02:44:59,217
A bike rider will not make a point.

1691
02:44:59,277 --> 02:45:01,237
Sadly, that will not change.

1692
02:45:01,337 --> 02:45:01,818
Thank you.

1693
02:45:02,618 --> 02:45:07,320
In my math class, negative two and negative two is negative four.

1694
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:11,921
Yeah, I hear you.

1695
02:45:11,941 --> 02:45:14,082
A lot of concerns about traffic, parking.

1696
02:45:14,102 --> 02:45:18,824
You know, what impact will this have on everybody's experience in the city?

1697
02:45:19,462 --> 02:45:22,623
especially those that actually live and pay taxes here.

1698
02:45:22,643 --> 02:45:32,868
And we've talked a little bit about how, you know, zoning is, is really just the regulation of private, private land.

1699
02:45:33,628 --> 02:45:39,011
And it needs to be done in partnership with changes made in public lands like roads.

1700
02:45:40,511 --> 02:45:41,412
I don't know if there's there's

1701
02:45:42,499 --> 02:45:43,859
more we can say about that.

1702
02:45:44,820 --> 02:46:01,644
I'd encourage you to go to the parking meeting on Monday or share additional comments with Alicia, specifically if there's streets or addresses or corners that you have experiences on.

1703
02:46:05,865 --> 02:46:09,126
I see you typing, so I'm not sure if you're typing to Alicia again.

1704
02:46:10,367 --> 02:46:10,907
Yes, okay.

1705
02:46:12,277 --> 02:46:12,958
We'll make it work.

1706
02:46:14,679 --> 02:46:19,542
She said more so it should be in joint with property taxpayers by vote.

1707
02:46:20,903 --> 02:46:30,849
So I will say, I just do want to express that there's laws that control zoning and state law is that this is the process for zoning.

1708
02:46:32,290 --> 02:46:35,132
And it has to go through the city council and the planning board.

1709
02:46:35,488 --> 02:46:41,557
You cannot pass zoning in cities in Massachusetts through a popular taxpayer vote.

1710
02:46:41,677 --> 02:46:42,418
It's not allowed.

1711
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:48,127
So I just want to make it clear to people that it's not that we're not considering that it's not legal.

1712
02:46:48,147 --> 02:46:50,871
So I had heard that before.

1713
02:46:52,397 --> 02:46:55,419
Yeah, and there are indirect ways that you can influence this process.

1714
02:46:55,519 --> 02:46:58,981
One of them is being on this call right now, providing your input.

1715
02:46:59,001 --> 02:47:04,064
I know that some city councilors have also received messages from their constituents.

1716
02:47:04,805 --> 02:47:06,225
That's another way to influence it.

1717
02:47:07,166 --> 02:47:08,747
City council elections are coming up.

1718
02:47:09,587 --> 02:47:15,591
If you don't like what's happening, then there's an opportunity to try to get somebody new in there.

1719
02:47:15,611 --> 02:47:19,093
I don't mean to be glib about that at all.

1720
02:47:19,694 --> 02:47:21,475
And I'm trying to recognize,

1721
02:47:23,514 --> 02:47:27,617
that there should be as much public involvement as there could be within the laws that we have today.

1722
02:47:35,922 --> 02:47:36,722
Is there anything else?

1723
02:47:37,063 --> 02:47:38,944
She sent one other comment.

1724
02:47:39,264 --> 02:47:40,465
I'll just read it.

1725
02:47:40,765 --> 02:47:44,327
Non-safety is a violation of a mayor and a council oath.

1726
02:47:47,649 --> 02:47:50,651
Yeah, I mean, safety is definitely a value within Somerville.

1727
02:47:52,866 --> 02:47:55,769
I think that that's something we're, I'm sorry.

1728
02:47:56,990 --> 02:47:57,490
I'm sorry.

1729
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:59,292
I've been up for way too long.

1730
02:47:59,532 --> 02:48:02,574
I used to work for the city of Somerville and serve on their redevelopment authority.

1731
02:48:03,155 --> 02:48:04,916
Every once in a while, my wires get crossed.

1732
02:48:05,497 --> 02:48:11,762
I don't know if other board members are getting their wires crossed too, but yes, safety is definitely a value in Medford.

1733
02:48:11,782 --> 02:48:15,766
And I thank you for reminding us of that mission.

1734
02:48:18,249 --> 02:48:29,567
So what I see in front of us is two repeat commenters, Fire East Ford Tao, and then I see board member Adam with his hands up.

1735
02:48:30,288 --> 02:48:33,333
Adam, did you have something you wanted to add real quick?

1736
02:48:34,862 --> 02:48:35,122
I did.

1737
02:48:35,182 --> 02:48:35,783
Yeah.

1738
02:48:36,463 --> 02:48:40,025
I think it was mentioned in the, in the mystic Avenue rezoning.

1739
02:48:41,106 --> 02:48:43,727
But I just had a comment kind of on the, on the discussion.

1740
02:48:45,568 --> 02:48:49,951
And that was, I think one of the first ones that the board, we as the board had heard.

1741
02:48:50,431 --> 02:48:54,954
And so we sort of came in with a idea of like how zoning worked and how stuff worked.

1742
02:48:56,014 --> 02:48:59,577
And the thing that was a super helpful for me in that conversation was.

1743
02:49:01,926 --> 02:49:07,988
with Emily and Polly, you had kind of talked about how like zoning is really kind of a long term vision.

1744
02:49:08,568 --> 02:49:15,690
It's not a an overnight thing that just that that that dramatically happens, you know, sort of the next day.

1745
02:49:15,710 --> 02:49:24,113
And so it's a mechanism of like changing some of the incentives and some of the processes and what's allowable.

1746
02:49:24,553 --> 02:49:31,439
But that, you know, the built environment is actually takes a long time to then sort of graduate into that target state.

1747
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:48,191
And that's just kind of helped me just think about these changes, and then the other mechanisms that operate sort of on different timelines that the city has around, you know, okay, we have a kind of a 10 or 20 year zoning plan.

1748
02:49:49,495 --> 02:50:05,760
Okay, we can thread in with the city, how do we think about bus routes, how do we think about increased public transportation, how do we just how do we think about kind of stepping into this because there's, you know, going to be sort of all these interlocking things that we can then do together.

1749
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:07,541
over the coming years.

1750
02:50:07,621 --> 02:50:11,264
So that was just a, just kind of my thought.

1751
02:50:11,284 --> 02:50:19,793
I think often when I start the zoning meetings, I have to remind myself of that too, because I look at it and I'm like, oh, wow, this is so much, there's going to be so much change.

1752
02:50:21,674 --> 02:50:22,895
So that was my comment.

1753
02:50:24,197 --> 02:50:26,439
Yeah, I think that puts it into a helpful perspective.

1754
02:50:27,119 --> 02:50:29,462
And, you know, thinking about

1755
02:50:31,397 --> 02:50:37,700
I think it might have been Zoe who was talking about the sidewalk changes, and she made the comment like, oh, it might look like a zipper for a while.

1756
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:42,103
I thought that was a really good way to think about this.

1757
02:50:42,323 --> 02:50:47,506
There's going to be some old, some new, some changes.

1758
02:50:47,526 --> 02:50:49,907
And eventually, it's all going to come together.

1759
02:50:56,055 --> 02:51:02,080
It'll be a little awkward for a while, a little bit of a Medford adolescence coming at you.

1760
02:51:05,382 --> 02:51:07,243
But yeah, good comment, Adam.

1761
02:51:08,845 --> 02:51:15,009
All right, so I'm going to go back to FireEastFordTow, see if we can get one last public comment.

1762
02:51:20,553 --> 02:51:22,635
FireEastFordTow, are you able to chat?

1763
02:51:27,867 --> 02:51:31,567
Do you have any technical difficulties that you can share with Alicia or Danielle?

1764
02:51:42,813 --> 02:51:49,075
I'm not getting any information from FireEast4Tow, so I'm going to make my standard disclaimer.

1765
02:51:49,575 --> 02:51:59,298
If you are having technical difficulties and you're not able to comment this evening, please send an email to our Medford OCD email address.

1766
02:52:00,578 --> 02:52:05,500
It's OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

1767
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:08,741
Did I get that right?

1768
02:52:11,422 --> 02:52:12,102
Drop it in the chat.

1769
02:52:18,222 --> 02:52:29,509
Seeing no new public comments, I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

1770
02:52:29,529 --> 02:52:34,633
I'm going to open it up to the board for further questions or discussion.

1771
02:52:39,925 --> 02:52:43,968
This is when we start to think about, are we ready to vote on this?

1772
02:52:44,868 --> 02:52:47,650
Are there certain recommendations that we want to put forth?

1773
02:52:48,891 --> 02:52:49,992
Do we need more time?

1774
02:52:50,012 --> 02:53:05,162
If we do want to see changes, we want to provide direction to Emily and Paola, Alicia and Danielle, so that the revisions can be as thorough as possible, if we are to continue this public hearing.

1775
02:53:05,942 --> 02:53:08,384
So I'd like to open it up to the board for any

1776
02:53:09,758 --> 02:53:12,644
Any discussion, any thoughts on what we should do next?

1777
02:53:13,165 --> 02:53:14,107
Ari, I see your hand.

1778
02:53:14,127 --> 02:53:15,991
Hi.

1779
02:53:16,654 --> 02:53:17,114
Thank you.

1780
02:53:18,015 --> 02:53:28,960
I have actually a just very specific question for city staff and the consultants that was brought up as we were talking about parking and Medford Square.

1781
02:53:28,980 --> 02:53:38,325
Have there been any conversations with Atrius Health about using their parking garage outside of their business hours?

1782
02:53:38,385 --> 02:53:44,188
Because that seems like it could be a really nice multi-use and solve a lot of problems.

1783
02:53:45,581 --> 02:53:48,262
I think that every time I go there to my doctor office.

1784
02:53:48,402 --> 02:53:49,162
Yeah, that's a great.

1785
02:53:49,302 --> 02:53:51,183
I realize that's a private public partnership.

1786
02:53:51,223 --> 02:53:55,165
We can't control it, but would love to know if there are any discussions.

1787
02:53:55,885 --> 02:53:59,346
Madam chair, we have attempted to reach out to them.

1788
02:53:59,506 --> 02:54:01,687
We talked to them when they were the former owner.

1789
02:54:02,835 --> 02:54:21,228
And now actually the developer that we have selected for Medford Square Parcels is extremely interested in connecting with them because they think it could be extremely helpful to our, to everything, to the design and the construction phases.

1790
02:54:22,229 --> 02:54:28,313
So now they are trying developer to developer to see if they can make something happen there.

1791
02:54:29,574 --> 02:54:31,355
I think that's as much as I can say on that.

1792
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:39,324
And not only from like a parking perspective, but just, you know, it's such a great spot for a lot of different uses.

1793
02:54:40,004 --> 02:54:44,347
I do love having a parking spot when I go to visit my PCP there, but.

1794
02:54:44,987 --> 02:54:45,507
Absolutely.

1795
02:54:45,547 --> 02:54:51,051
And I hope everybody hears you because actually we're going to change the parking behind City Hall so that it's City Hall.

1796
02:54:51,071 --> 02:54:51,811
Oh, interesting.

1797
02:54:52,511 --> 02:55:00,616
So that like in the short run, because many people who go to visit their doctors there prefer to walk park in the City Hall lot.

1798
02:55:01,066 --> 02:55:06,532
and walk across the road, and then staff don't have enough spots when they're trying to park for work.

1799
02:55:08,294 --> 02:55:11,337
This sounds like a- More patients follow your example.

1800
02:55:13,058 --> 02:55:18,519
I mean, it's not the best garage, but I definitely don't want to run across three lanes of traffic.

1801
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:22,520
Anyways, great question, Ari.

1802
02:55:23,860 --> 02:55:31,862
I think maybe not 100% for tonight, but regardless, let's get those wheels turning.

1803
02:55:33,643 --> 02:55:39,684
Any other thoughts from the board, whether it's questions, reactions to comments made by the public,

1804
02:55:40,561 --> 02:55:41,842
know, thoughts on timeline.

1805
02:55:41,862 --> 02:55:50,169
I personally feel like, you know, if we were to put recommendations together tonight and vote on it, it would be rushed.

1806
02:55:51,150 --> 02:55:52,291
I think there's a lot of

1807
02:55:53,784 --> 02:55:55,365
questions that the public brought up.

1808
02:55:56,266 --> 02:55:58,127
They brought up a lot of really thoughtful comments.

1809
02:56:00,148 --> 02:56:20,279
So my gut is saying continue, but I also want to make sure that when we do continue, we're providing the city and its associates really thoughtful, specific feedback so when they come back, we can have a more productive discussion.

1810
02:56:20,299 --> 02:56:22,541
And we obviously don't have to pass it.

1811
02:56:23,341 --> 02:56:28,523
at that next meeting but we just want to keep getting closer to something that is right for Medford.

1812
02:56:29,304 --> 02:56:30,184
Peter I see your hand.

1813
02:56:31,024 --> 02:56:34,986
Yeah I think you you kind of captured my my sentence pretty well on this.

1814
02:56:35,366 --> 02:56:52,394
I couldn't can't really put my finger on anything specific but it just doesn't feel all the way there yet and I think it would be good to to continue to as well but like you said I want to be able to provide the city and the consultant team with with feedback so we're not just saying well

1815
02:56:53,945 --> 02:56:55,186
We don't know what.

1816
02:56:55,426 --> 02:56:56,247
Come back to us.

1817
02:56:56,467 --> 02:56:57,348
Yeah.

1818
02:56:57,388 --> 02:56:57,948
Come back to us.

1819
02:56:57,988 --> 02:56:58,749
We don't know what with.

1820
02:56:59,529 --> 02:57:15,560
I think it's important that we do include that specific feedback to them so that we give them something to do, because hopefully we would like it so that it comes back with something that hopefully we can pass at the next meeting.

1821
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:18,442
Yeah.

1822
02:57:18,502 --> 02:57:18,722
Adam?

1823
02:57:19,662 --> 02:57:20,043
Oh, sorry.

1824
02:57:20,063 --> 02:57:21,243
Peter, were you done?

1825
02:57:21,263 --> 02:57:22,024
No, that's good.

1826
02:57:23,444 --> 02:57:23,724
Sorry, Adam.

1827
02:57:24,144 --> 02:57:25,565
Yeah, I agree.

1828
02:57:26,846 --> 02:57:34,169
And then it does feel a little bit different than the prior corridors.

1829
02:57:35,789 --> 02:57:52,137
Just maybe to publicly sort of share my, my sort of immediate reaction where it just, it feels a little bit less of kind of the transformational rezoning that we were kind of talking about with mystic have and, and I forget the other Avenue.

1830
02:57:53,785 --> 02:58:02,791
And then the thing that would be helpful would be to obviously to digest a lot of the public comments to read through again, the written comments, there was a lot of written comments submitted.

1831
02:58:03,651 --> 02:58:17,680
And then just, it's always helpful also to kind of transparently for the public to like actually walk around the neighborhood with that like envisioned future state of like, what is this gonna feel like?

1832
02:58:20,173 --> 02:58:29,338
And then there's nothing obvious in my head right now about kind of the shape of like recommendations of what to change.

1833
02:58:29,398 --> 02:58:34,221
But again, it would be really helpful to digest the commentary from today.

1834
02:58:37,862 --> 02:58:38,062
Yeah.

1835
02:58:38,223 --> 02:58:47,047
And I would also ask that the presentation that was given tonight be put in the publicly available materials, as well as shared with the board, if that's an option.

1836
02:58:49,438 --> 02:58:55,722
It's there now it went up after 5 today, but it's there now with the Google files.

1837
02:58:57,083 --> 02:58:57,403
Okay.

1838
02:58:59,364 --> 02:59:02,966
Yeah, so it feels like as a board, you know, we're largely on the same page in terms of.

1839
02:59:03,687 --> 02:59:07,069
Continuing this, um.

1840
02:59:08,490 --> 02:59:12,632
You know, we can talk about date specifics later, but what.

1841
02:59:13,769 --> 02:59:15,609
What specific feedback do we have?

1842
02:59:15,869 --> 02:59:17,530
I have notes on lot size.

1843
02:59:18,170 --> 02:59:28,692
I have notes on the sunlight and air modifications, or the sunlight and air angles.

1844
02:59:29,552 --> 02:59:39,215
I have some specific questions on specific parcels in Medford Square.

1845
02:59:44,248 --> 02:59:45,149
What else do we have?

1846
02:59:45,169 --> 02:59:57,796
I don't have anything that specific.

1847
02:59:57,876 --> 03:00:05,460
I did generally have a note about the angles.

1848
03:00:05,960 --> 03:00:08,362
I can't remember the technical term.

1849
03:00:10,563 --> 03:00:14,065
But yeah, I don't.

1850
03:00:14,728 --> 03:00:32,802
The phrase has left me, but the shade angles or something along those lines being potentially too... I don't remember if it's too steep or not steep enough.

1851
03:00:36,305 --> 03:00:40,268
I think the desired output was lower buildings.

1852
03:00:41,569 --> 03:00:41,949
Okay.

1853
03:00:43,030 --> 03:00:43,230
Yeah.

1854
03:00:44,199 --> 03:00:44,519
Yeah.

1855
03:00:49,784 --> 03:00:55,870
Yeah, but maybe like some like a little comparison on like where that angle could be taken from.

1856
03:00:59,305 --> 03:01:07,327
just to help show the consequences of, looking at it now, it's the minimum daylight standard.

1857
03:01:10,047 --> 03:01:11,248
Looks like it's coming from the roof.

1858
03:01:11,428 --> 03:01:12,408
What if it's the cornice?

1859
03:01:12,448 --> 03:01:14,388
What if it's the foundation?

1860
03:01:14,408 --> 03:01:18,949
Just generally, what are the consequences of that?

1861
03:01:20,730 --> 03:01:21,530
Adam, I see your hand.

1862
03:01:22,565 --> 03:01:22,905
I know.

1863
03:01:24,106 --> 03:01:24,666
No, you're good.

1864
03:01:24,746 --> 03:01:26,868
This is what we're supposed to do.

1865
03:01:26,888 --> 03:01:28,849
So let's do it.

1866
03:01:28,989 --> 03:01:35,633
The other thing when I sort of look at the zoning, there's a lot of commercial in this one and these.

1867
03:01:36,613 --> 03:01:46,419
And just when I went through the written comments, I don't think I saw much from any of the like small businesses, local businesses.

1868
03:01:49,540 --> 03:01:59,047
I would just be curious if there was, if there, if there were thoughts from sort of like that, that like kind of segment just on things that they want to see in that corridor.

1869
03:01:59,067 --> 03:02:11,436
And I think, I think obviously like my headspace is, you know, we're really trying to design it for the people that live in the community and, and, and obviously the residents of the community and a lot of the small business owners.

1870
03:02:11,696 --> 03:02:15,599
My partner is a small business owner in Medford and, um,

1871
03:02:17,777 --> 03:02:21,921
It's just the input that I haven't heard in the last like couple couple meetings.

1872
03:02:22,421 --> 03:02:29,087
And so I don't know if it would help if if there was any of that if it would be pointed to just to be able to look at it.

1873
03:02:29,107 --> 03:02:30,889
I didn't I didn't.

1874
03:02:31,409 --> 03:02:32,090
I didn't see any.

1875
03:02:33,872 --> 03:02:39,817
Yeah, that's a great comment and I'm kind of flipping through now to remind myself, I don't think we have anything from.

1876
03:02:41,278 --> 03:02:45,260
like a non, like a business owner that doesn't also own property.

1877
03:02:45,700 --> 03:02:47,561
Like we have some property owners.

1878
03:02:48,982 --> 03:02:50,243
Sorry, Alicia, were you?

1879
03:02:50,263 --> 03:02:55,865
I was gonna say, let me direct you to, there's one who's been very thoughtful and deliberate.

1880
03:02:55,945 --> 03:02:56,366
Oh, awesome.

1881
03:02:56,426 --> 03:02:57,766
Her first name is Paige.

1882
03:02:59,027 --> 03:02:59,267
Okay.

1883
03:03:00,308 --> 03:03:01,708
I would look for that one.

1884
03:03:01,768 --> 03:03:05,210
She's included a lot of things.

1885
03:03:05,470 --> 03:03:09,852
She's also had some back and forth with us in the office about- Oh, awesome.

1886
03:03:11,318 --> 03:03:24,683
the city and economic development staff to support small business owners who might potentially get displaced because their building gets developed or somehow gets impacted by that.

1887
03:03:25,103 --> 03:03:36,167
And so we actually called her attention to something that you all, we've discussed before, but didn't come up this evening, which is the, you can get one story of incentive

1888
03:03:36,642 --> 03:03:47,947
for providing a 15% rent reduction for a minimum of three years to either a nonprofit or a business that has 10 or fewer employees.

1889
03:03:49,307 --> 03:03:54,129
So that was- I don't know if I see her comments in the folder.

1890
03:03:54,149 --> 03:04:03,193
I'm wondering if, because her email was back and forth with the staff, I wonder if it didn't actually go to OCD.

1891
03:04:03,313 --> 03:04:05,434
I've just have been assuming that everybody has.

1892
03:04:06,593 --> 03:04:08,834
Oh, I see a page on the line.

1893
03:04:08,854 --> 03:04:10,194
Page Boldini.

1894
03:04:10,874 --> 03:04:19,617
Yeah, I know we closed the public comment for the meeting, but can I, as the chair, make an exception?

1895
03:04:19,637 --> 03:04:23,198
Oh, that she's here on the call tonight.

1896
03:04:23,618 --> 03:04:33,721
Her emails actually went to me and the city counselors, and they did not realize that she had not copied the OCD email address.

1897
03:04:35,350 --> 03:04:38,213
Can I make an exception and is it legal for me to?

1898
03:04:38,233 --> 03:04:41,116
Did you guys vote to close?

1899
03:04:41,156 --> 03:04:43,958
Well, you haven't closed the hearing, so you've only closed it for tonight.

1900
03:04:43,998 --> 03:04:44,659
You could reopen.

1901
03:04:44,699 --> 03:04:46,020
I only closed the public comment.

1902
03:04:46,761 --> 03:04:47,021
Right.

1903
03:04:47,422 --> 03:04:48,422
And that didn't need a vote.

1904
03:04:49,243 --> 03:04:49,504
Right.

1905
03:04:50,244 --> 03:04:52,827
So I think you can reopen the public comment if you choose to.

1906
03:04:53,544 --> 03:04:53,824
Okay.

1907
03:04:53,844 --> 03:04:55,707
I'm going to reopen the public comment.

1908
03:04:57,129 --> 03:05:02,175
John, I see your hand up, but because it's on a topic, is it okay if we shoot to create?

1909
03:05:02,295 --> 03:05:02,956
Okay, thank you.

1910
03:05:02,996 --> 03:05:03,817
I really appreciate that.

1911
03:05:04,818 --> 03:05:07,421
Paige, please stay here.

1912
03:05:07,441 --> 03:05:09,103
We're going to have a brief

1913
03:05:11,782 --> 03:05:12,783
Republic comment.

1914
03:05:13,064 --> 03:05:13,965
Yeah, this is perfect.

1915
03:05:14,725 --> 03:05:16,087
I'm so happy you're here.

1916
03:05:16,187 --> 03:05:16,908
Thank you so much.

1917
03:05:18,530 --> 03:05:20,312
Please state your name and address for the record.

1918
03:05:20,332 --> 03:05:24,396
If you don't live in Medford, but you work in Medford, you know that address is great too.

1919
03:05:24,416 --> 03:05:30,303
You know, we recognize all connections to the city, you're going to get three minutes to talk and I'm going to unmute you now.

1920
03:05:33,355 --> 03:05:34,016
Thank you so much.

1921
03:05:34,036 --> 03:05:34,676
I apologize.

1922
03:05:34,716 --> 03:05:35,636
I'm joining late.

1923
03:05:35,756 --> 03:05:36,777
I just was out of a gun.

1924
03:05:37,457 --> 03:05:41,398
Um, this is such an honor to be chatting with everybody joining late.

1925
03:05:41,478 --> 03:05:43,139
So don't want to be repetitive.

1926
03:05:43,319 --> 03:05:44,839
Um, I did actually I emailed

1927
03:05:46,915 --> 03:05:55,238
the city councilors, Director Hunt, members of Director Hunt's office, but I also did email the OCD.

1928
03:05:55,558 --> 03:05:57,778
I'm not, maybe the wrong one, but yeah.

1929
03:05:58,418 --> 03:06:00,099
Okay, so I separate it down.

1930
03:06:00,499 --> 03:06:01,619
I did email that.

1931
03:06:01,739 --> 03:06:02,880
So just to clarify.

1932
03:06:02,900 --> 03:06:03,120
Yeah.

1933
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:10,004
Um, but yes, I spoke directly from coming as a business owner on the Boston Ave corridor and a resident.

1934
03:06:10,464 --> 03:06:12,365
I'm also a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

1935
03:06:13,025 --> 03:06:17,568
And my questions were about how we could be proactive to support our small businesses.

1936
03:06:18,528 --> 03:06:19,489
I am supportive of

1937
03:06:19,989 --> 03:06:20,510
zoning.

1938
03:06:20,650 --> 03:06:25,575
I'm very reform and housing in specifically where my business is.

1939
03:06:25,635 --> 03:06:26,336
It's mixed use.

1940
03:06:27,237 --> 03:06:29,199
It's not it's not zone from excuse.

1941
03:06:29,279 --> 03:06:29,780
Excuse me.

1942
03:06:30,901 --> 03:06:32,222
But it probably would make sense.

1943
03:06:32,423 --> 03:06:36,867
But as a business owner, what is the city going to do to support us?

1944
03:06:37,548 --> 03:06:40,850
Director Hunt had replied about incentivizing.

1945
03:06:41,971 --> 03:06:44,953
But I just want to, I have a whole list of questions.

1946
03:06:46,094 --> 03:06:47,495
So thank you for the opportunity.

1947
03:06:47,615 --> 03:06:52,799
And I think it might have been Adam, I was just listening into asking about that from the small business community.

1948
03:06:53,820 --> 03:06:57,983
It's really important that we also support the businesses that have chosen to be here.

1949
03:06:58,003 --> 03:07:01,866
And yes, I lease, I don't own my building.

1950
03:07:03,066 --> 03:07:10,292
And I'm up near Tufts, so I'm also very mindful of what that looks like when it comes to zoning and housing in the Dover Amendment.

1951
03:07:10,853 --> 03:07:19,520
And I just really want to be an advocate for the community where I don't know if I could afford to rent a space if it was fully developed.

1952
03:07:19,760 --> 03:07:22,122
I don't know what that would look like during development.

1953
03:07:22,742 --> 03:07:30,008
And granted, it might not happen right away with zoning, but the potential is to incentivize my landlord to probably do something like that.

1954
03:07:30,689 --> 03:07:34,232
So what are we going to do as a city to support our small business community?

1955
03:07:34,252 --> 03:07:36,573
Because I would hope that we don't want to lose us.

1956
03:07:36,694 --> 03:07:41,137
We've all worked really hard to help grow what these neighborhoods have become.

1957
03:07:41,157 --> 03:07:45,321
And yes, there are a lot of us that are in buildings that are not

1958
03:07:46,321 --> 03:07:47,462
probably zoned appropriately.

1959
03:07:47,482 --> 03:07:50,903
So I am hopeful that we can be supportive of that.

1960
03:07:51,103 --> 03:08:10,352
And then when it also comes to that proactivity of what we can do for our small business community, you know, if my business is rezoned, what are we gonna do to support where I could potentially be or my colleagues in the future and how to also incentivize the landlords or the building owners to develop for people like myself in mind.

1961
03:08:10,833 --> 03:08:15,595
So thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you for everybody working hard and everybody joining us tonight.

1962
03:08:17,607 --> 03:08:24,449
Thanks Paige, really appreciate you joining and joining early, joining late, everything is appreciated.

1963
03:08:25,229 --> 03:08:34,392
We really like these kind of robust discussions and yeah, I echo your appreciation of board member Adam for bringing up this perspective.

1964
03:08:34,472 --> 03:08:39,193
I think this is like the first time we've had like a lot of commercial before us.

1965
03:08:39,253 --> 03:08:41,633
So it's definitely an important perspective.

1966
03:08:42,274 --> 03:08:46,835
I know Alicia brought up the potential to incentivize landlords

1967
03:08:47,595 --> 03:08:51,417
um, to provide leases for existing businesses or local businesses.

1968
03:08:51,457 --> 03:09:00,362
I'm not sure what the exact language is, um, off the top of my head, but, you know, there is a world in which we have greater incentives than what's suggested.

1969
03:09:00,382 --> 03:09:13,389
Um, you know, thinking about Salem Street, we had the whole fountain, uh, fountain incentive where, you know, people could, I think, have one fountain and get an extra half story of space.

1970
03:09:13,990 --> 03:09:15,130
And we thought, like, you know, is that really

1971
03:09:16,411 --> 03:09:19,312
Is that really commensurate with the work that throwing in a fountain does?

1972
03:09:20,253 --> 03:09:34,598
So maybe something like this, preserving a local business, providing them with a long-term lease, maybe that's a more meaningful incentive, a larger incentive than other options, or I don't know.

1973
03:09:34,618 --> 03:09:37,399
There's some creativity we could have around there in terms of our recommendations.

1974
03:09:37,419 --> 03:09:39,420
So definitely noted.

1975
03:09:39,580 --> 03:09:45,322
And I don't know if any of the board members have any reactions or thoughts to what Paige said.

1976
03:09:52,613 --> 03:09:58,475
We're leaning towards continuing this, so I encourage you to come to the next meeting where we discuss.

1977
03:09:58,915 --> 03:09:59,475
Thank you so much.

1978
03:09:59,695 --> 03:10:00,635
Really appreciate your comment.

1979
03:10:02,556 --> 03:10:04,176
John, thank you for your patience.

1980
03:10:04,916 --> 03:10:05,696
Oh, my pleasure.

1981
03:10:06,676 --> 03:10:07,797
Although I am getting hungry.

1982
03:10:10,957 --> 03:10:17,959
I just want to, I just hope that, you know, I spoke about streetscape and historical context

1983
03:10:18,823 --> 03:10:24,107
And there was general nodding of heads and, well, we might be able to do this, we might be able to do that.

1984
03:10:25,308 --> 03:10:32,914
But I would hate to see it just get lost in the long list of things that maybe we should think about someday later.

1985
03:10:33,835 --> 03:10:35,556
Meanwhile, the zoning will be changed.

1986
03:10:35,617 --> 03:10:37,218
People will start building buildings.

1987
03:10:38,599 --> 03:10:39,780
All this will go on.

1988
03:10:39,800 --> 03:10:42,142
I mean, the,

1989
03:10:44,193 --> 03:10:50,218
Comprehensive plan mentioned this as something to do, and that was finalized, what, in 2023?

1990
03:10:50,678 --> 03:10:56,783
And now it's 2025, and nothing's happened with that.

1991
03:10:56,943 --> 03:11:01,167
And maybe in 2027, we're still thinking about it.

1992
03:11:01,687 --> 03:11:04,469
I don't know how to do it, but I would like to see our

1993
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:14,340
feedback to the city council somehow address these concerns and make some sort of concrete suggestion, if we can think of any.

1994
03:11:15,948 --> 03:11:23,630
Yeah, I mean, the classic saying is, you know, the best time to plant a tree was yesterday, like the time to preserve history is today.

1995
03:11:23,650 --> 03:11:24,630
Right.

1996
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:41,854
So yeah, maybe the specific suggestion there is, you know, investigate if historic conversions or, I don't know what the right word is, if it's preservation or whatever, if that can be included in more of the,

1997
03:11:46,856 --> 03:11:47,856
zoning categories.

1998
03:11:48,337 --> 03:11:53,519
So we like expand that some of like the mixed use zones, because I think it was missing from there.

1999
03:11:54,919 --> 03:12:04,984
Yeah, but I was also thinking, I was also thinking about the whole question of design review, and trying to have some sort of consistency.

2000
03:12:05,004 --> 03:12:10,406
I mean, I'm not an architect, I don't know, what's what's the most appropriate thing?

2001
03:12:10,786 --> 03:12:15,068
I mean, maybe we want to be thinking about red brick, or something else.

2002
03:12:16,913 --> 03:12:31,083
or ultra modern, you know, steel and glass, I don't know, but something that just keeps, so you don't just have a hodgepodge of whatever's easy and less expensive.

2003
03:12:32,384 --> 03:12:36,887
Yeah, well, I'm a failed architect, so I'm even less qualified than you.

2004
03:12:38,047 --> 03:12:44,752
But I believe the design review discussion, that is, that's like after zoning, right?

2005
03:12:45,521 --> 03:12:58,725
Yes, I think what we were discussing is it's going to be part of that wrap up, where we come back at the end, once all the geographic stuff is taken care of, and that's where we can do the design stuff.

2006
03:13:00,226 --> 03:13:01,406
Is there a risk?

2007
03:13:02,026 --> 03:13:11,530
I'm thinking about Cheryl's earlier comment about, and I think it was later addressed, but I remember her concern being something along the lines of,

2008
03:13:13,027 --> 03:13:29,835
we're doing, we're doing one thing, like we're doing rezoning, and then we're kind of leading leaving this gap period, where, you know, maybe people that care less about what their community looks like, you know, maybe they're just throwing up a random sketch up model and building that.

2009
03:13:31,035 --> 03:13:39,900
Are we creating this gap, where things that the community might not want to happen could happen?

2010
03:13:39,920 --> 03:13:42,341
I mean,

2011
03:13:45,028 --> 03:13:46,749
In theory, I guess.

2012
03:13:47,090 --> 03:13:53,795
But I don't know, from a practicality standpoint, to set up a whole design guidelines in the next two weeks.

2013
03:13:54,616 --> 03:13:57,198
Yeah, I mean, are we creating gap?

2014
03:13:57,878 --> 03:13:58,819
I think the answer is yes.

2015
03:13:58,839 --> 03:13:59,780
Can we avoid the gap?

2016
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:02,702
I think that answer might be not really.

2017
03:14:03,343 --> 03:14:08,587
Yeah, I think the strategy might be to make the gap as short as possible.

2018
03:14:08,627 --> 03:14:13,651
But I don't think we can, assuming that's a conversation we should have, and I think it is,

2019
03:14:14,250 --> 03:14:27,893
I don't think we can, I think it would be unfair to city staff and to the consultant team to be like, we're not going to approve anything else until you spin up this whole new thing that is kind of tangential.

2020
03:14:27,913 --> 03:14:33,754
I mean, I think they're kind of two separate objects that work together.

2021
03:14:33,774 --> 03:14:36,615
Or at least that's my understanding.

2022
03:14:37,555 --> 03:14:41,836
Well, I'm not really comfortable with tangential.

2023
03:14:43,550 --> 03:14:45,094
I mean, I do see your point.

2024
03:14:46,397 --> 03:14:48,682
Are we operating under a two-week deadline?

2025
03:14:50,045 --> 03:14:50,205
No.

2026
03:14:51,047 --> 03:14:52,911
I just said that because that's the next meeting.

2027
03:14:54,288 --> 03:14:57,829
Yeah, like if we were to continue this, you know, we could continue it to the 18th.

2028
03:14:58,849 --> 03:15:01,189
There is also a special meeting scheduled for the 25th.

2029
03:15:01,829 --> 03:15:05,310
We could also decide to continue it at those meetings too.

2030
03:15:06,310 --> 03:15:10,051
So I think he was referring to the next meeting.

2031
03:15:10,231 --> 03:15:10,431
Yeah.

2032
03:15:10,671 --> 03:15:18,152
I know there hasn't been a motion yet, but I was just sort of the conversation seemed to assume that we were going to continue this tonight.

2033
03:15:19,192 --> 03:15:19,432
Yes.

2034
03:15:19,812 --> 03:15:20,012
Yeah.

2035
03:15:20,092 --> 03:15:20,493
Okay.

2036
03:15:21,293 --> 03:15:21,493
Yeah.

2037
03:15:22,713 --> 03:15:22,833
Yeah.

2038
03:15:25,161 --> 03:15:33,592
And I'll also, if Alicia wants to say something, I was going to say also in favor of continuing

2039
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:37,702
recognizing that it is about 10 PM.

2040
03:15:38,223 --> 03:15:55,256
And I did want to flag that a member of the Community Preservation Committee, which I serve as the Community Development Board representative to, Doug Carr, he has proactively created draft design standards over the last 10 years.

2041
03:15:55,617 --> 03:15:59,400
He said he brought it to a previous iteration of the Community Development Board.

2042
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:01,281
and there wasn't interest.

2043
03:16:01,621 --> 03:16:05,042
And he's asked me a few times if I thought there would be interest now.

2044
03:16:06,143 --> 03:16:07,803
And I've told him, yes, absolutely.

2045
03:16:07,823 --> 03:16:13,646
So I'm just flagging that that that's a conversation that he'd be great to bring it to.

2046
03:16:14,346 --> 03:16:21,769
Thank you so much for pointing that out, because I worked with him, you know, decades ago on this, and I'm sure he has lots of thoughts.

2047
03:16:25,391 --> 03:16:27,792
But kind of to my point that it is 10 p.m.

2048
03:16:29,044 --> 03:16:32,466
Does it make sense for me to make a motion to continue to a date?

2049
03:16:32,726 --> 03:16:34,127
I still see Alicia's hand.

2050
03:16:34,207 --> 03:16:35,108
Oh, sorry, Alicia.

2051
03:16:35,968 --> 03:16:37,329
And I'm curious.

2052
03:16:37,850 --> 03:16:51,518
I'd love to hear from Emily or Paula if after Alicia, if they have any specific questions for the board just to help guide their work between now and the next meeting.

2053
03:16:51,698 --> 03:16:57,362
And also here, when they would be able to come back to the next meeting.

2054
03:16:58,377 --> 03:17:02,299
realizing that you are both humans and have to actually do the work.

2055
03:17:03,399 --> 03:17:03,919
So Alicia.

2056
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:19,305
So on completely separate topics, if you were to continue this, I do recommend that you continue it to the 25th so that you have 18th for just residential, the 25th for the squares.

2057
03:17:19,425 --> 03:17:23,247
It will be easier on you as a board and it will be easier on the public.

2058
03:17:23,427 --> 03:17:27,048
And we would then help, like we would communicate that out

2059
03:17:27,401 --> 03:17:29,424
that separate dates for separate meetings.

2060
03:17:29,925 --> 03:17:30,746
So that's one thing.

2061
03:17:31,086 --> 03:17:33,229
Just very briefly on design guidelines.

2062
03:17:33,670 --> 03:17:36,975
First of all, if Doug sent them to me before, please send them to me again.

2063
03:17:38,196 --> 03:17:43,444
But I will remind this board that we still have site plan review for anything that is over 10,000 square feet.

2064
03:17:45,010 --> 03:17:51,975
or six or more residential units, or a couple of other weird things, the building has to go through site plan review.

2065
03:17:52,435 --> 03:17:56,858
And part of site plan review has been the architectural look and feel of the building.

2066
03:17:57,239 --> 03:17:58,620
And that comes first.

2067
03:17:59,320 --> 03:18:09,527
So I just, yes, there's a gap, but how big is that gap when you actually look at all the large buildings, or in that case, not so large buildings?

2068
03:18:11,229 --> 03:18:12,489
So you do have that.

2069
03:18:14,415 --> 03:18:19,597
So there might be fewer things that would actually be able to fall through that gap because of site plan review.

2070
03:18:20,038 --> 03:18:20,318
Right.

2071
03:18:20,578 --> 03:18:34,144
And the things that would tend to be, unfortunately, the single family homes, which tend to be something that it's much harder to do guidelines on, that should be, frankly, a conversation, I think, with the residential.

2072
03:18:34,384 --> 03:18:37,645
But yeah, it's a tougher conversation as well.

2073
03:18:37,705 --> 03:18:39,486
That's good to know.

2074
03:18:40,066 --> 03:18:41,067
Design is subjective.

2075
03:18:42,802 --> 03:18:43,262
It's tough.

2076
03:18:43,342 --> 03:18:54,850
Yeah, but that is, thanks for bringing that up, to kind of recenter that while there might be a gap, just because of the process of site plan review, it won't apply to that many things.

2077
03:18:56,170 --> 03:19:00,173
Yeah, it's not like a chasm.

2078
03:19:00,633 --> 03:19:02,974
It's maybe a little.

2079
03:19:03,215 --> 03:19:04,415
Okay.

2080
03:19:06,136 --> 03:19:07,017
Emily and Paola.

2081
03:19:09,446 --> 03:19:13,289
Have we in the public provided you some good stuff to work off of?

2082
03:19:13,909 --> 03:19:15,150
Is there anything we can clear up?

2083
03:19:17,652 --> 03:19:19,633
Thank you for that opportunity.

2084
03:19:20,294 --> 03:19:23,136
We agree with Director Hunt's assessment of the schedule.

2085
03:19:23,196 --> 03:19:30,180
I think that will make it easier for us to be responsive to you and to comments from the public for both topics.

2086
03:19:30,280 --> 03:19:32,402
So I appreciate that.

2087
03:19:33,042 --> 03:19:33,503
schedule.

2088
03:19:34,604 --> 03:19:40,813
We've heard a lot tonight from both you and the other people who have spoken and appreciate all those comments.

2089
03:19:40,893 --> 03:19:46,941
I think we have some direction in terms of providing you some additional information, especially on

2090
03:19:48,978 --> 03:19:55,923
how we're looking at sun and the incentive zonings and a couple of other things.

2091
03:19:56,803 --> 03:20:11,033
If the members of the board have, you know, you've been presented with this for the first time tonight, so if you have individual questions that, you know, you wake up tomorrow morning and say, why didn't I ask this, if you can funnel those

2092
03:20:11,633 --> 03:20:23,681
separately, obviously, through Director Hunt, so as to avoid a meeting law, but she is, of course, keeping us abreast of anything that she's heard that is germane to what we're doing.

2093
03:20:23,881 --> 03:20:26,623
So, we would greatly appreciate that.

2094
03:20:26,963 --> 03:20:31,166
I think in terms of direction, as per the other discussions,

2095
03:20:31,666 --> 03:20:32,867
Are the boundaries right?

2096
03:20:33,927 --> 03:20:35,308
Are the specific districts?

2097
03:20:35,328 --> 03:20:44,292
You'll note from this that we have broken up the mixed use districts into finer gradations, and that has been in response to public feedback.

2098
03:20:44,392 --> 03:20:45,333
So if there's

2099
03:20:45,851 --> 03:20:49,753
You know, we think this one would be better applied to this area versus that area.

2100
03:20:49,833 --> 03:20:51,994
I think that's that's important to us to hear.

2101
03:20:52,654 --> 03:21:02,178
And then we've heard a lot of things that could go into the incentive zoning or the community benefits or other or the development standards tonight.

2102
03:21:02,238 --> 03:21:04,779
So, again, feedback on those would be very helpful.

2103
03:21:06,388 --> 03:21:09,389
Yeah, one thing you just brought up was the boundaries.

2104
03:21:09,409 --> 03:21:11,931
I don't think we got a lot of feedback on that.

2105
03:21:12,511 --> 03:21:16,133
But we did have a couple of members of the public mentioned non-compliance.

2106
03:21:17,413 --> 03:21:27,418
I'm wondering if that may spark some discussion around boundaries, specific plots.

2107
03:21:27,658 --> 03:21:30,860
So I would add that to our want list.

2108
03:21:31,788 --> 03:21:33,593
I think we have it on our list.

2109
03:21:33,774 --> 03:21:37,785
And I'm also going to, Paola, did you want to speak or are you going to say it was on your list?

2110
03:21:39,089 --> 03:22:06,346
Uh, no, I was going to say that it did like a very quick filtering with the 5,000 and in that area specifically, almost all of them were more than 5,000, but we will look into more and see if effectively that is, um, a good one, or maybe we need to push them into other districts, uh, so that, um, they are better fitting in other, um, in another district, but absolutely we would look into that.

2111
03:22:08,368 --> 03:22:08,688
Awesome.

2112
03:22:09,982 --> 03:22:12,324
Anything else people can think of?

2113
03:22:12,604 --> 03:22:13,365
Okay, cool.

2114
03:22:13,865 --> 03:22:14,265
Thank you.

2115
03:22:14,385 --> 03:22:23,332
So with that, I'm looking for a motion to continue to a date certain.

2116
03:22:24,493 --> 03:22:26,995
Wait, do I have to, I don't have to close it, right?

2117
03:22:27,015 --> 03:22:29,817
No.

2118
03:22:30,598 --> 03:22:32,720
Closing the hearing would be a different thing.

2119
03:22:33,320 --> 03:22:34,201
Yes, okay.

2120
03:22:34,281 --> 03:22:35,562
Close the hearing before you vote.

2121
03:22:36,450 --> 03:22:36,730
Yes.

2122
03:22:37,131 --> 03:22:37,431
Okay.

2123
03:22:37,471 --> 03:22:45,738
So, um, I'm looking for a motion to continue the public hearing, um, for West Medford and Medford square.

2124
03:22:45,758 --> 03:22:59,190
Um, to June 25th, which is a special meeting, um, for the board.

2125
03:22:59,210 --> 03:23:02,052
I assume it wasn't regularly scheduled.

2126
03:23:02,993 --> 03:23:03,133
Yeah.

2127
03:23:04,388 --> 03:23:05,369
Are you making the motion, John?

2128
03:23:06,249 --> 03:23:06,950
I so move.

2129
03:23:06,970 --> 03:23:08,531
I'll second.

2130
03:23:08,551 --> 03:23:09,171
Is that a second?

2131
03:23:09,852 --> 03:23:10,352
Yeah.

2132
03:23:10,672 --> 03:23:11,613
We're going to roll call vote.

2133
03:23:11,633 --> 03:23:12,714
I'm going to call you as I see you.

2134
03:23:14,034 --> 03:23:14,795
John Anderson?

2135
03:23:15,495 --> 03:23:15,796
Yes.

2136
03:23:17,457 --> 03:23:18,057
Adam Behrens?

2137
03:23:18,778 --> 03:23:18,998
Yes.

2138
03:23:20,519 --> 03:23:21,419
Ari Goffman-Fishman?

2139
03:23:21,960 --> 03:23:22,220
Yes.

2140
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:23,841
Peter Kaufs?

2141
03:23:24,922 --> 03:23:25,162
Yes.

2142
03:23:26,002 --> 03:23:26,923
Sabrina Alpino?

2143
03:23:28,164 --> 03:23:28,484
Yes.

2144
03:23:29,565 --> 03:23:32,847
And I, myself, Emily Hedeman, am also a yes.

2145
03:23:33,592 --> 03:23:41,215
Okay, so we're going to continue the public hearing for West Medford and Medford Square to June 25.

2146
03:23:43,196 --> 03:23:45,657
Thank you so much members of the public for all your comments.

2147
03:23:46,498 --> 03:23:50,019
Emily and Paola, as always, out of the park.

2148
03:23:50,940 --> 03:23:52,600
Felicia and Danielle, can't do it without you.

2149
03:23:52,780 --> 03:23:56,062
We do have a couple more agenda items to get through, but we'll be quick on those.

2150
03:23:59,044 --> 03:24:03,028
We have two sets of minutes to review.

2151
03:24:03,048 --> 03:24:10,955
Is there any discussion on any modifications needed for the minutes for members of the board?

2152
03:24:10,975 --> 03:24:16,019
All right, seeing none.

2153
03:24:20,063 --> 03:24:24,627
We still don't have a clerk, but do a quick click through.

2154
03:24:27,878 --> 03:24:37,461
So seeing no discussion, I'm gonna ask for a motion to accept the minutes from our April 2nd, 2025 and May 21st, 2025 meetings.

2155
03:24:37,961 --> 03:24:47,524
Yeah, we're gonna do a roll call vote, call them as I see them.

2156
03:24:48,645 --> 03:24:49,345
John Anderson.

2157
03:24:49,365 --> 03:24:52,526
I think I should abstain since I wasn't a member then.

2158
03:24:54,816 --> 03:24:55,236
I agree.

2159
03:24:56,817 --> 03:24:57,457
Adam Behrens?

2160
03:24:58,657 --> 03:25:00,238
Aye, or yes.

2161
03:25:02,019 --> 03:25:02,799
Sabrina Alpino?

2162
03:25:03,779 --> 03:25:04,039
Yes.

2163
03:25:05,520 --> 03:25:06,380
Ari Goffman-Fishman?

2164
03:25:07,080 --> 03:25:12,902
Yes, although I will flag that we are just voting on the fact that we have received and cataloged them.

2165
03:25:12,962 --> 03:25:18,864
So you can, if you so chose, you could vote that we have received them.

2166
03:25:19,205 --> 03:25:20,165
But anyway, I'm a yes.

2167
03:25:22,004 --> 03:25:25,986
We don't have a parliamentarian role, but if we did, I think it would be you, Ari.

2168
03:25:28,026 --> 03:25:29,547
Peter Kalbs.

2169
03:25:30,167 --> 03:25:30,387
Yes.

2170
03:25:31,708 --> 03:25:38,771
And I, myself, Emily Hedeman, am also a yes or an aye, whatever we're saying at 10.03.

2171
03:25:40,211 --> 03:25:45,353
The next agenda item was the zoning updates presentation of draft zoning of other quarters.

2172
03:25:45,913 --> 03:25:48,814
We covered that during the West Medford Square

2173
03:25:51,870 --> 03:25:56,551
Um, Alicia, Danielle, is there anything else for zoning updates that needs to be discussed?

2174
03:25:58,052 --> 03:26:03,073
I will just tell you that we have, so the residential is continued to the 18th.

2175
03:26:03,554 --> 03:26:10,856
We have also formally had the ADUs referred to you, and we advertised that public hearing for the 18th.

2176
03:26:11,456 --> 03:26:15,137
So you can actually hear the ADUs on the 18th as well.

2177
03:26:16,377 --> 03:26:16,677
Awesome.

2178
03:26:17,358 --> 03:26:18,238
Looking forward to that.

2179
03:26:19,034 --> 03:26:28,298
And we're working on a new contract with Emily for next year, because this is not gonna end June 30th, and our current contract goes through June 30th, just FYI.

2180
03:26:29,539 --> 03:26:38,263
Yeah, and I appreciate the city providing the resources to do this work, and Edison Associates to be doing the work.

2181
03:26:38,863 --> 03:26:40,304
So thanks to all.

2182
03:26:41,344 --> 03:26:44,886
So with that, I am looking for a motion to adjourn.

2183
03:26:47,047 --> 03:26:47,767
So moved.

2184
03:26:50,095 --> 03:26:50,655
Thanks, John.

2185
03:26:51,116 --> 03:26:51,956
Can I get a second?

2186
03:26:52,677 --> 03:26:53,117
One second.

2187
03:26:54,278 --> 03:26:54,778
Thanks, Adam.

2188
03:26:54,798 --> 03:26:56,199
I'm going to call him as I see him.

2189
03:26:57,039 --> 03:26:57,760
John Anderson.

2190
03:26:59,221 --> 03:26:59,381
Aye.

2191
03:27:00,541 --> 03:27:01,162
Peter Calves.

2192
03:27:02,362 --> 03:27:02,483
Aye.

2193
03:27:03,743 --> 03:27:04,584
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

2194
03:27:05,304 --> 03:27:05,444
Aye.

2195
03:27:06,665 --> 03:27:07,285
Adam Behrens.

2196
03:27:08,006 --> 03:27:08,126
Aye.

2197
03:27:09,167 --> 03:27:10,768
Sabrina Alpino.

2198
03:27:10,788 --> 03:27:10,848
Aye.

2199
03:27:12,389 --> 03:27:15,250
And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

2200
03:27:16,211 --> 03:27:17,232
That concludes our meeting.

2201
03:27:18,261 --> 03:27:22,983
Um, as always, thank you so much to city staff for your work and your dedication in these efforts.

2202
03:27:23,363 --> 03:27:24,904
Thank you to my fellow board members.

2203
03:27:25,884 --> 03:27:30,607
Um, I think Eileen Paolo may have dropped off, but, um, also appreciate them.

2204
03:27:31,227 --> 03:27:40,471
And then would be remiss if I did not say thank you so much, members of the public, for your continued participation, enthusiasm, um, on these topics.

2205
03:27:41,231 --> 03:27:44,533
It means so much to us and the rest of your neighbors.

2206
03:27:44,573 --> 03:27:45,073
So thank you.

2207
03:27:46,074 --> 03:27:46,914
Have a nice night, everyone.
