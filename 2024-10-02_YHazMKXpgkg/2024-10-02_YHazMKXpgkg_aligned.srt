00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:26,429
Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings.

2
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,355
I am John Petrella, and we're going to do a show for and about the city of Medford.

3
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:38,341
Today, we have a special guest councilor, Medford City Councilor, George Scott Pelley.

4
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:46,063
He will be speaking on facts you need to know about the upcoming override that you will be asked to vote on on this election.

5
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:50,607
George, I want to welcome you, and I'm glad you can join us on the show.

6
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:52,689
Well, John, thank you so much.

7
00:00:53,549 --> 00:01:00,015
Medford Happenings, I think, is a very vital asset to our community, as well as our Medford community cable.

8
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:07,777
Access channel, I think that without a a Newspaper in Medford to get information out to our residents.

9
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:11,078
It's so important that you're doing this So I thank you very much for doing this.

10
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:12,018
All right, George.

11
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:12,858
Thank you very much.

12
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:20,620
I appreciate that Without getting into any further Hesitation here.

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,460
I'm gonna get right into the questions.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,982
Everyone's concerned about the two and a half overrides in the city We're seeing signs for we're seeing signs against

15
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:32,986
So, I'm going to get right into it, George.

16
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:39,335
As a Memphis City Councilor, what is your opinion on the upcoming override vote?

17
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:43,100
Well, it's a pretty in-depth opinion, I think.

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:59,111
You know, we, as a city councilor, it's my responsibility and our responsibility to make sure that we are the financial stewards of our residents' budgets and making sure that our tax money is being spent appropriately.

19
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:08,859
One thing we realized in our communities without, like I said, without a newspaper, we found it very difficult to get information out, and this being a good example.

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:25,137
So a few months back a group was organized called All Medford and the All Medford group started to really educate and communicate and really bring pride back to Medford and it's been super successful.

21
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,699
We've had hundreds if not thousands of people

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,485
join our group, and when I say our group, I as a member, as our group.

23
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:51,620
And we're now jumping right into a very serious, you know, situation and big step here in Medford, which is an override, Proposition 2 and F overrides and a debt exclusion.

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,723
So what I'd like to do, if you don't mind, John, I'd like to start with

25
00:02:55,303 --> 00:03:01,428
explaining to our constituents and our viewers that there are three votes that they'll be taking.

26
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:05,030
They'll be question six, question seven, and question eight.

27
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:14,678
Question six is a debt exclusion for a rebuild of a new fire station headquarters on Main Street.

28
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,120
That's a 30 million dollar project

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,542
that I will share with you.

30
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:43,814
The firefighters have come out publicly and they are not supporting the override for the fact that, you'll see a trend as I go through my speech today, but you'll see that there weren't really, the firefighters weren't involved in the final decision making of that fire station.

31
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:45,095
And they're,

32
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:55,002
In the conversations with the union leaders, one of the major issues is that there was really no, there was no partnership involved.

33
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,404
No one, no firefighters were really involved in the final decisions.

34
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:12,794
And what we were heard from firefighter Marcelino, Danielle Marcelino, who's the secretary for the union, she explained that they would not support the debt exclusion for the fire station because

35
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:21,957
It was an inferior product and it's not set up for success as they move forward in the lives of future Meffitt firefighters.

36
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:33,020
So with that, they said, you know, let's be responsible enough to share with the community that they would rather not let the citizens of Meffitt suffer with the tax

37
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:35,823
just to check a box.

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,308
So they responded back and they're not going to support it.

39
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:42,932
So question six is about a new fire headquarters on Main Street.

40
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:50,463
And question seven was presented from the mayor.

41
00:04:52,808 --> 00:05:17,387
for an override in question seven is $3.5 million of our property, our real estate taxes for our community for 2025 and from the general operations of Meffitt public school, $3 million for the Meffitt public schools, which includes but not limited for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, and administrative assistants and so on.

42
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:32,071
Question 8 was put forth asking for a $4 million override tax from our real estate and personal properties for 2025 as well.

43
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:42,495
And they're looking for increasing access to the arts and vocational programs and expanding classroom instructional opportunities.

44
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:51,420
These are simple taxes and they were put forth, and I'll publicly say, as scare tactics from the administration.

45
00:05:54,081 --> 00:06:06,106
We can see that the overrides, and let me just educate everybody a little bit because some people don't really understand what a debt exclusion is in comparison to a Proposition 2.5 override.

46
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:19,792
A debt exclusion is a tax to the community, to the residents, that will be put on their taxes every year until the project that it's funding is complete.

47
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:27,795
So if it's $30 million for a new fire station, you would then start the clock with paying off that bond of $30 million.

48
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:33,977
When that $30 million is paid, that tax will come off the resident's tax roll.

49
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:36,578
So they won't see that tax anymore once it's paid.

50
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:40,419
The misconception is the Proposition 2.5 override

51
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:43,270
is very simple.

52
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,197
You will get taxed a certain percentage from your home's assessed value, your real estate tax.

53
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,299
Which is going up, by the way, correct?

54
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:52,919
Yeah, it is.

55
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,140
And I'll explain more with that.

56
00:06:54,581 --> 00:07:04,951
And with that process, that's a tax that's being misled in the public by people that are saying that if it's just $400 for the year, it's not just $400 for a year.

57
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:12,735
Okay, let's start off by saying that when that tax is starting is January of 2025.

58
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:23,158
So it's voted in November Wow, it'll go into place starting in January of 2025 which our residents most of our residents Won't be prepared for that

59
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:46,056
We'll now start that tax and at the end of every year There is some understanding that some taxpayers have reached out to me and said oh, yeah, then then it's done I said no It doesn't what ends up happening is that tax bump that you're going to see for this override will then compound every year Every year at least two and a half percent every year.

60
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:52,878
It'll stay with you forever never goes away never goes away now in clear up a few other misconceptions

61
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,672
The comment that we're hearing is, it's just this, it's just that, it's not true.

62
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:16,242
We know that this council has put forth in the past rent control, transfer tax, a renter's and owner's registry fee, and what we're looking at down the line is a new high school.

63
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:20,729
Something that has already been taken out of free cash to start that process.

64
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,033
And we're looking at a close to a, if it's a refurbished, maybe $200 million.

65
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:28,314
And if for a new high school, it's $400 million.

66
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,456
Just for an example, neighboring community just did their high school.

67
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:35,478
Debt exclusion was put in for over $240 million.

68
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:41,022
It's $1,000 more a year in taxes for each household.

69
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,683
$1,000 more for each household, okay.

70
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:45,725
So it's not just what people are saying.

71
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:50,209
Now, I know the other side, the Yes Group, has a calculator in place.

72
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:50,970
They do.

73
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,470
They do.

74
00:08:51,510 --> 00:09:05,635
And the calculator is misleading because we've had phone calls from different organizations, different people that have questioned that, saying that I put my address in and the number that's coming out is wrong because my assessed value and what they're saying my house is assessed at is totally wrong.

75
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:20,329
So we've done our homework, and we reached out to the assessor, and the assessor has informed us that no one in his office has been involved in setting up any calculator for any organization to educate our community.

76
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,131
So they know nothing about that.

77
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:28,478
As a matter of fact, they also shared that the assessment team, our assessors,

78
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:40,101
don't even understand how they can even conceivably work in an override if it was voted in in November because it's such a daunting task.

79
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:49,507
So we asked, well, could you possibly put in place a calculator so residents can see what kind of an impact a true calculator through the assessor's office.

80
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:54,711
He said no one's asked him to do that and he doesn't plan on doing it right now because they are so busy.

81
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,312
And this is from the city's assessor.

82
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,612
This is the city assessor.

83
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,973
This is from the city assessor.

84
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:03,074
So the understanding that it's just this much money, it's not.

85
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:04,095
It's not.

86
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:13,878
And I think that what I see as a trend that's bothering me is that our most vulnerable members of our community are threatened right now, and they should be.

87
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:23,782
So if you're a senior citizen, you're living on a fixed income, if you are a veteran, if you are disabled, and you find it very difficult even just to survive right now,

88
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:25,505
This could destroy them.

89
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:26,709
Destroy them.

90
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:30,340
That's, you know, the people I talk to, George.

91
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:32,782
I know a lot of senior citizens.

92
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:33,783
I am one now.

93
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:36,043
I know it's hard to believe, but I am one.

94
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,243
But they're the ones.

95
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:38,944
I see them every day.

96
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:39,864
I talk to them.

97
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,345
They are very nervous about this.

98
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:46,585
They're afraid of actually losing their homes if this goes through.

99
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,486
And that's a realistic option.

100
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:48,986
It is.

101
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:54,347
The misconception of some of my colleagues on the city council that

102
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,908
Well, if the house is worth a million dollars, they could just take $100,000 out.

103
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:02,109
And I share a story, and I won't give my neighbor's name because I love her.

104
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:02,709
Okay.

105
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:03,850
Let's call her Mrs. Jones.

106
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,692
Mrs. Jones bought her house for $50,000 years ago with her and her husband, raised her family, lives there today.

107
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,532
She was a seamstress.

108
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:17,534
Well, Mrs. Jones' husband passed away 15 years ago, but the home is now appraised at a million dollars.

109
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:27,040
With her social security and her husband's retirement, it's very difficult for Mrs. Jones to survive in her home because her home is being assessed.

110
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:39,364
And just for taxes alone makes it very difficult for the choices she can make, whether it's eating something special during the week or paying for her medication.

111
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,585
So people don't realize the impact, and it's true impact.

112
00:11:43,445 --> 00:12:09,482
uh... so i i think that's important as hundreds people hundreds of people in the city just like in a right there is i mean let's be honest that's a big part of it i mean so this is really going to affect everybody what i mean what if you rent well and i think that people don't realize that unfortunately you look at you look at some people like mrs jones same situation right that on the two or three family met for it uh... you would see that

113
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:18,432
the trickle-down effect, where they can't afford to pick up the total cost that's being added to them, that they would have to put it onto their renters.

114
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:19,913
And they don't want to.

115
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:28,122
I will tell you, my dad was a homeowner of a two-family, and we took a lot of pride in making sure that our tenants

116
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:33,794
were secure enough in the rent that they can maybe move forward and purchase a house.

117
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:49,807
And we were lucky that we had five great tenants and four have moved on to own homes, and the fifth, my dad's moved on to heaven for a few years now, but my brother now owns the home and he still keeps that tenant's rent reasonable for them.

118
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:57,089
Unfortunately, the renters and, you know, you look at our tough students, they're going to be put in a bad situation as well.

119
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,771
Because a lot of our tough students do rent, and that's going to impact them.

120
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:13,455
Our small businesses, maybe you don't realize it, but when a family has to make a decision of just $400 or just X amount of dollars, they have to make cuts somewhere.

121
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:17,857
And unfortunately, it's going to trickle down to our small businesses as well.

122
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:19,718
There's a lot of money involved.

123
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:23,001
They keep talking like it's not a lot.

124
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:23,421
But it is.

125
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:26,964
For a lot of people, that is a lot of money on a monthly basis.

126
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:27,324
It is.

127
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:30,607
And I think what people have to realize, too, because we've done some homework.

128
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:46,379
I know that there are people on the other side that would like to say that there are organizations, like All Medford, who really have taken the leadership in this fight against the override because they see how it hurts most of the Medford residents.

129
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,525
that they've done the homework, and we have communications back and forth.

130
00:13:52,585 --> 00:14:02,896
I know that one member has talked with the assessor again, and just so people understand that own homes, your homes have recently been assessed.

131
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:04,814
So you can see that hike.

132
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:08,758
Then you see taxes that might possibly be added on.

133
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:12,042
Then you look at an override for a new high school that's going to be added on.

134
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:18,909
What people don't realize next year in 2025, Holmes and Medford will be reassessed again, but they'll be using

135
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,531
the numbers from 2023.

136
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:22,551
And why is that important?

137
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:27,174
Our homes were assessed a lot higher in 2023 than they are today.

138
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:31,316
So you're going to see a bump again in people's taxes.

139
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:40,660
And it's funny that people that, you know, might not understand this because they don't own a home yet, but what they need to understand is that

140
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:45,215
When the homes, they say in Medford, we're taxed low, and we are.

141
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,179
We're very fortunate that our homes are taxed low.

142
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,949
What they don't realize, the neighboring communities they want to compare us to.

143
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:55,456
don't have the assessments that we do.

144
00:14:56,316 --> 00:15:04,118
So apples to apples, our numbers are pretty complimentary to our neighbors next door that might think that they have lower taxes.

145
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,439
So it will play a huge factor in people's lives.

146
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,480
You know, another thing I always think about

147
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:15,502
And, you know, I wonder this all the time, okay?

148
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:23,958
The other side always says, you know, the fear, you mentioned that about they put fear into people, and that's, you know, that seems to be what they do.

149
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,881
I guess one of the questions that a lot of people have is, what are the alternatives, George?

150
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,341
Are there alternatives?

151
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,102
I mean, how do we get here?

152
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:39,383
Well, if I can, John, I think people have to understand where this all started from.

153
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:40,543
Yes, please.

154
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:52,005
And what's important is they understand that we're hearing it too, people from all Medford are calling me and saying, George, I can't believe what they're saying about the people that are involved with all Medford.

155
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,126
And again, people have to understand this publicly.

156
00:15:55,906 --> 00:16:00,907
The All Method group and the city council, George Scott Pelley, has never, ever said, we are fighting.

157
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,407
We never wanted an override.

158
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:07,349
All we actually said was, where is the transparency?

159
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:12,270
Explain to us the three most important things that I think that I've heard over and over again.

160
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,170
That's important when you look at an override.

161
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,351
One, how did we get here?

162
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:18,391
Two, how do we correct it?

163
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:20,992
And three, how do we never get here again?

164
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:33,024
And what we did is starting the process of city council, and the people that want to say that George Scott Pelley is not telling the truth, he's a liar, because that's out there too, and that's okay.

165
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:39,411
But the difference between what they can say and what's proof, it's the magic of television.

166
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:47,437
You can go to YouTube and watch every single meeting, and I'll tell everybody, if you're interested, start back from June 20th of 2023.

167
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:52,321
That was our budget meeting, and it started there, John.

168
00:16:52,361 --> 00:17:01,208
We had our meeting, and prior to that meeting, all seven counselors were pretty strong and pretty unified in the fact that what we were seeing financially

169
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:05,532
was frightening, and we were not going to support the budget.

170
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:11,557
The mayor's budget really lacked a lot of very, very important factors, and we said we're going to stand against it.

171
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:24,708
Well, I believe it was Councilor Carvialho and I who walked into the chambers ready for our Tuesday night meeting, and Councilor Behrs at the time came out of a meeting and said to Councilor Carvialho and I, he said,

172
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:33,492
I just want to let you guys know that Council President Morrell and I met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we came to an agreement.

173
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:37,213
So we're going to vote for the budget.

174
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:41,854
And I then said, well, what was the agreement?

175
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,455
Because we heard nothing of an agreement.

176
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:50,301
the people that we represent, their words and their wishes weren't expressed, and then we went on to that meeting.

177
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:54,545
That meeting was true and it did happen, and we didn't know what the agreement was.

178
00:17:54,605 --> 00:18:01,551
I know that Councilor Baird said something about setting up a budget team and working better with our budget, and okay, very vague.

179
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:08,357
Then we move forward to what we're seeing, and we hear that there was a financial task force that was created

180
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:10,413
right after that agreement.

181
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:24,000
And that financial task force consisted of the mayor, the chief of staff, Council President Behrs, Council Vice President Kit Collins, and I believe leadership team from the school committee member Jenny Graham.

182
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:29,605
So we didn't know what was going on.

183
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,926
We never had any public meetings.

184
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,286
We didn't see any minutes.

185
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:37,106
We didn't see any notes.

186
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:42,068
We didn't get any updates of any financial team working together and what direction we're going into.

187
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:48,629
So we fast forward to the meetings roughly around in May, and we can look at the meetings in May and June.

188
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,694
We had discussions with Council President Behrs, and I said, when are we hearing this information?

189
00:18:57,055 --> 00:19:04,782
When is a community going to get involved and be part of this financial task force results?

190
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:14,131
And the question was, we came to results, and we'll be notified, and everybody will be informed in a meeting.

191
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:14,631
I said, okay.

192
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:35,909
Well, in typical fashion, on Thursday or Friday, we get an email from the mayor's office and her communications team, and they come out with an announcement that the financial task force has worked diligently to find the alternative solution for our gap in our financial crisis.

193
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:38,651
At the time, it was $5 million coming from the school side.

194
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:42,353
And what the financial team expressed on a Friday

195
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:51,461
presented on a Tuesday was an override and dead exclusions to bring us whole.

196
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,446
Now why is that frightening?

197
00:19:55,992 --> 00:20:04,919
that meeting I had put in place an option that Medford had over 24 million dollars of free cash.

198
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:16,629
And for those people who don't know what free cash is, free cash is the money that is certified through the state that the city is approved for the budget that year.

199
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:17,269
So

200
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:27,412
Let's say, just for discussion's sake, let's say the budget was $10 million and you only spend $8 million.

201
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:38,635
Well, that $2 million gets carried over into an account, what's called free cash, which is the taxpayer's money that was supposed to be used for the citizens and the community that fiscal year.

202
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:48,965
Normally you see communities, but I think you'll see between 3 and 5 percent of an overage that carries over and then goes into that free cash account.

203
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:49,285
Okay.

204
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:55,912
Well, in Medford you saw an astronomical number that brought us for the last few years up to $24 million.

205
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:58,214
So I came forth with an option.

206
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:17,480
a pretty logical option that said, well, let's take that $5 million out of free cash, let's create a rainy day account, take $5 million out, let's level fund the school department so we eliminate any fear and confusion to our teachers, our students, and our educational process.

207
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:27,303
And as I was presenting that, one of my council colleagues decided that they were going to call what we call in our rules is Rule 21.

208
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:35,049
Rule 21 stops any discussions for that counselor for that week, and you can follow it up the next week.

209
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,354
Well, the reason why that was important, we knew that the next week the mayor was going to come in and present the budget.

210
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:50,382
So they halted me from doing that, and then as we moved on, we moved on to the next meeting, but the next meeting, there was a meeting between the next meeting,

211
00:21:51,243 --> 00:22:09,028
I was going to come in as we were presenting this and I was going to stop the meeting and use rule 21 so we can ask can we have public meetings, a public participation, be more transparent about what the financial task force did, what are the numbers, who did you work with, what financial minds did you work with.

212
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:24,070
went to the meeting, the city council leadership decided to suspend the rules and impose the freezing of the option to use rule 21.

213
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,891
That means I couldn't stop the meeting.

214
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,793
That means everything was pushed through.

215
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:32,656
Okay, so you had a solution is what you're telling us.

216
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:33,297
There was a solution.

217
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,879
We had a free cash $5 million solution.

218
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,860
And they don't want to hear about the solution.

219
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,906
They didn't want to hear it because the so-called financial task force came up with a $7.5 million override.

220
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:50,691
So now my next question, and I have to ask it, financial task force.

221
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:53,073
I've run some businesses.

222
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:57,095
I know a little bit about finance.

223
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:58,515
I'm far from an expert.

224
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:13,622
But when you use the words financial task force, I'm thinking accountants, bankers, maybe a lawyer in there, people with financial background, financial knowledge.

225
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:15,743
Did any of that take place?

226
00:23:15,864 --> 00:23:16,084
No.

227
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:18,186
As a matter of fact, it was the total opposite.

228
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,669
I know that this administration used the words transparency.

229
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:24,691
It's a very important word that got the mayor elected years ago.

230
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:25,172
Right.

231
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:26,633
And it's been totally opposite.

232
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:39,885
So if you allow me, we can go to the next meeting, John, when we had this next meeting and I reached out to our state delegate and asked him what happens if they impose and suspend the rules again.

233
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:49,667
Well, I went to the meeting, and they said, you know, so they said, George, you can impose general law, mass general law 43, section 22.

234
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,388
That supersedes the Methodist City Council rules.

235
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:56,149
It would end the meeting so you can have more transparency and ask for more meetings.

236
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:03,190
So as I did that, they suspended the rules again, eliminated the vote for rule 21.

237
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,971
I invoked section 22.

238
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,872
They then said, no, you cannot use it.

239
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:12,714
against the rules, but they did that.

240
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:26,678
And in that meeting, you realize we couldn't move forward because, again, we have a message coming out on a Thursday or Friday, and on Tuesday, we're going to vote on millions of dollars in the budget.

241
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:30,620
So we're going to push the budget through without having money.

242
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:39,863
So I'll revert back to a few weeks, a week prior when a constituent called and said to Council Beers, what if the override fails?

243
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,150
And his words were very strict and direct.

244
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,492
And he said, it'll be devastating to our schools and our children and our teachers.

245
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:53,053
And my words exactly were, we have a solution.

246
00:24:53,833 --> 00:25:04,857
Why would we not take that five million out of free cash, put everybody at ease, and then work together and find a solution with those three important things?

247
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:05,737
How do we get there?

248
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:07,198
How do we correct it?

249
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:08,658
How do we never get there again?

250
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,219
And so I'll give an example.

251
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:18,450
I've had the honor of working with one of the best mayors in the Commonwealth for years, Joseph Curtatone.

252
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,152
And we talked, and I said, Mr. Mayor, I'm at a crossroads.

253
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,793
What would you do with this situation?

254
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:28,074
He says, well, I don't have to make it up.

255
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:28,574
I'll show you.

256
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,735
And he sent me a bunch of information.

257
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,756
And in 2009, some of them were in the same situation.

258
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:35,196
They needed an override.

259
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,338
But before he did that, he opened up a forum

260
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:48,843
financial minds from Tufts University, financial minds from Harvard University, MIT, his own financial team that works with his budget every day.

261
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:50,824
He brought in community leaders.

262
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,645
He brought in bank leaders.

263
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:57,228
He brought in free support from the state that have gone through this process.

264
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:01,150
And they had open, transparent meetings to say, how do we get there?

265
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:10,773
So they focused on fees and fines for traffic and parking, which those fees came in and then supported the school department.

266
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:18,576
They had trash and builder's permits and fees there that went to the roads and sidewalks and streets.

267
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,137
And that finished that.

268
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:25,319
And then for the future, there's a little job called assembly row that they started.

269
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:34,301
And assembly row stopped any future issues of fear into any overrides because it was a new revenue stream.

270
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:45,263
Something that in Medford, when you look at our issues and concerns, when you talk about our budget, I know our council wants to talk about new growth being the best it's ever been.

271
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:46,623
That's not true.

272
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:54,165
We haven't had one shovel in the ground for one project since the mayor has been in business.

273
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:57,072
I just want to add that I drive around the city.

274
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,353
I do.

275
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:00,374
I go all over the city.

276
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:02,716
And you're 100 percent accurate.

277
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:06,598
I see a lot of things that why wasn't it developed.

278
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,719
There's plenty of opportunities here.

279
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:09,700
I mean it just seems like.

280
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,401
Well, I'll give you a couple for example.

281
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:15,405
We had at the time three projects a few years back that were ready to go.

282
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:17,428
They were called 40B projects.

283
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:32,683
And the 40B projects, they're special projects that you're giving more of a freedom to have that opportunity to build and develop without any question because you're really focused on affordable housing, something I think we drastically need here in Medford.

284
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:50,612
The mayor fought these projects to the fact that not only knowing that you were going to lose these in court, and she did, then she appealed them and she lost, she did, and unfortunately she stretched this out so long that these developers just turned and took their business to other communities.

285
00:27:51,391 --> 00:28:01,843
So I know that Councilor Carviello was very involved in these situations, and he talked about, you know, even for one job, you looked at $3 million in permits and fees.

286
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,104
That would have come to the city and nothing.

287
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:04,065
That would have come to the city, yep.

288
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:09,591
And then a new tax base of maybe even more, like $4 to $6 million, I believe, for our tax base.

289
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:12,514
You want to see where the gaps are.

290
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:13,375
That's where they are.

291
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:24,065
And that could be corrected if the mayor really puts her actions to her words, because nothing's being done except the beer hall, which is very good, by the way.

292
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:24,726
Yeah, no, I agree.

293
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,447
But that's not going to bring the revenue we need.

294
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:36,076
So when you see the issues that we have, and we see our going back to this financial task force, we're seeing that there really isn't much information.

295
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:36,536
For instance,

296
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:41,859
If it's not for you right now to bring this forward, most of our residents don't even know what's going on.

297
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:42,580
I'll give you a couple.

298
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,642
I had a constituent say, George, $7 million for a new high school.

299
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:48,402
Why wouldn't we do it?

300
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:52,604
And I had to explain to them, $7 million is for a new high school.

301
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:57,386
And that's what people are spinning as the truth.

302
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:57,987
And it's not.

303
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,946
This is very, these are very dangerous times.

304
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:09,671
Now, I will tell you, as we lead forward to this, when these meetings are going on in May and June, the fear came out.

305
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:14,013
The students, the kids, the teachers, our educational process.

306
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:17,035
If this doesn't happen, they will be hurt.

307
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:18,696
It'll be devastating.

308
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:28,645
And then I said, geez, I tell you what, as a city councilor, when we started talking about a newsletter, city council newsletter, we met five times in subcommittee.

309
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:31,888
It's an open process to talk about a newsletter.

310
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:35,011
But when you talk about $7.5 million, not one public meeting,

311
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:42,661
not one explanation of what the process was as they went through.

312
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:57,337
I believe that, I don't even think that they had a person from the finance team, you know, directly involved at every single meeting, because, and the reason why we don't know, this so-called transparent mayor had

313
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:01,960
put this in as a task force so they didn't have to follow rules.

314
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:10,663
So there were no minutes, there were no public participation, and we truly don't know really how we even got here.

315
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:16,365
All we hear is from the side that wants it is that this is why it's going to affect our schools.

316
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:22,868
We don't ever, we never give enough money to the schools, we don't give enough money to the city, and we're very, very undertaxed.

317
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:28,004
You don't fix issues financially through taxation.

318
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,847
You fix it with new growth and being creative.

319
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,488
And we aren't doing that.

320
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:34,489
And this is what's frightening to me.

321
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,032
Frightening to a lot of people, George.

322
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:48,120
And I'm so happy you came today because a lot of people, what you're talking about, the $7 million, oh great, let's build a school.

323
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,105
You're clearing up a lot of things.

324
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:54,586
There's so much misinformation out there.

325
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,908
And I'm just thrilled that you're here.

326
00:30:58,588 --> 00:30:59,588
We've got to get this out.

327
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:05,771
We want to get the information out so people can make their own decision.

328
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:07,092
And I appreciate that.

329
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:15,155
And I think that when we talk about bringing me on tonight and why I jumped at the opportunity, because people don't really know what's going on, especially our senior citizens.

330
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:26,606
When I bring it up to them, it's funny because people say, George Scott Pelley is A, B, and C, whatever fits their dialogue, and he's totally against it.

331
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:29,709
I never said it was against an override.

332
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:39,419
What I said was, let's bring everything forward, let's sit down at the table with all the stakeholders and people that are involved in finance and find a solution together.

333
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:40,938
And we didn't do that.

334
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,959
And here we are right now.

335
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:50,562
We're being told that we're pushing this, we're fighting this because we're angry.

336
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:51,982
I'm not angry.

337
00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:55,344
I was one of the counselors way back in the day.

338
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:59,025
I think I was the last counselor to do this, and I think in the history of Medford.

339
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:01,686
But I came forth years back.

340
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,516
offering a debt exclusion for a new fire station.

341
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:08,519
And at the time, I believe it was $17 million.

342
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:16,607
I met with the financial director because she had an open-door policy and she was amazing, Alicia Nunley.

343
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:27,857
And we sat together and I said, Alicia, how do we do this without hurting our seniors and our most vulnerable, our handicapped community and our, excuse me, our disabled community and our veterans?

344
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:35,298
And she eliminated that demographic and came back, and I believe it was $17 a month for a new fire station.

345
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:36,519
It was voted down.

346
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,703
As a matter of fact, I believe Council Beers was on that committee that voted it down.

347
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:47,670
And so to say that George Scott Pelley's city councilor has this agenda just to be negative, it's not true.

348
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,356
Not one time has anybody discussed how this affects all of our homeowners, and most importantly, our seniors.

349
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:56,133
And that's the other thing.

350
00:32:56,153 --> 00:32:58,294
I've said this before.

351
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:06,796
It just seems like this is an issue, and it's once again divided the city of Medford.

352
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:10,237
I mean, there's got to be some middle ground.

353
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:14,017
And you did a great job explaining everything, George.

354
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:24,060
I think people have a clearer understanding what the intent is, that there are solutions to this, that we don't necessarily have to do these overrides.

355
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:30,433
So if I can, I know that we talked about this so-called crisis.

356
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:33,119
And I want everybody to understand this.

357
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,941
We had a so-called crisis, financial crisis, that was presented.

358
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:42,023
Now, if you watch the video from June 2020, June 20th of 2023.

359
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,684
This is a city council meeting.

360
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:47,926
That's a city council budget meeting where I said, don't do this.

361
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:53,790
You're going to destroy and devastate our community financially this year.

362
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,891
And I felt like Nostradamus.

363
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,652
I hated it, but it came true.

364
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,513
So we all have to understand something though.

365
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:16,825
This financial crisis where we had an opportunity to look at free cash and the city knowing what was coming down the line, and I'll get to that, silencing me and moving forward to the vote to put this on the ballot.

366
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:22,770
Then we find out a few weeks after that vote that Medford was now

367
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:35,248
receiving nine million more dollars that were certified by the state that the city administration did not use during the fiscal year.

368
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:50,131
So the reason why we're in financial crisis is because the city administration didn't use the money accordingly that we the citizens and the taxpayers put forth that we voted on for our budget season.

369
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:54,287
So now let's move forward now, this financial crisis.

370
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:59,786
As a city councilor, I took what happened at those meetings pretty serious.

371
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:07,329
I reached out to the state auditor's office and the attorney general's office and how this was handled.

372
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:24,136
The auditor's office, Mr. Zaglia's office representative said, George, they said, their office said, we can't get involved unless the city council votes on it, and then the mayor approves it, and then we would come in and do an audit for you.

373
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:28,980
And what's important, people saying, no, no, the audit, we already do an audit.

374
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,942
Why should we pay anybody else to do an audit?

375
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:31,862
Not true.

376
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:35,305
The audit that comes in that we do every year is very simple.

377
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,970
The person, the group that comes in and does the audit, they look at apples to apples.

378
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,273
They say you start with 10 million, you spent 10 million, done.

379
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:47,635
With the state audit, it comes in and it looks at the processes.

380
00:35:48,155 --> 00:36:02,261
So they could tell us, as you look at the process, if the council voted on it and the mayor approved it, you could then see how did we get here and what mistakes we've been making over the last few years because we consistently have millions of dollars of free cash.

381
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,683
So that's voted down.

382
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:09,845
It's voted down, city council votes it down, so we can't move forward.

383
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:16,474
Then you move on to the next step, the next week, right before our summer break.

384
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:22,316
And my fellow counselors vote in during this financial crisis now.

385
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:29,819
They vote in a raise for themselves, they vote in a raise for the school committee, and they vote a raise in for the mayor.

386
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:46,734
And again, John, if you're in financial crisis, if in your home you were having financial issues and concerns, would you then carelessly, let me say, spend the tax mayor's money on something you truly didn't need?

387
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:49,176
And this is what we're seeing right now.

388
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:50,637
What we're seeing right now

389
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:54,639
with these overrides, and I think it's very important.

390
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:57,079
We had a great evening the other night with Al Medford.

391
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,240
We brought in financial minds.

392
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,540
We brought in great speakers.

393
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,341
We brought in, like I said, we brought in the fire secretary, the union secretary.

394
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:14,804
They came in, gave a pretty extensive response on why they will not support the debt exclusion, how the city should not support a $30 million fire station.

395
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:27,433
Roy Bellson, probably one of the smartest educational minds in the state, our former superintendent, broke everything down for our citizens to see where the gaps are.

396
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:30,494
And he has shown us that we do not need an override.

397
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,656
We just need to manage our funds better.

398
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:35,997
And with that being said, you'll be looking out.

399
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:39,399
I think that those speeches will be public very soon.

400
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:40,840
So pretty excited about that.

401
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,681
I attended those meetings, by the way.

402
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:46,964
Lot of good information came out of them a lot of good information.

403
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:58,194
Yep, so I want to thank you George unfortunately times getting the signal times running out I really really mean it.

404
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:06,282
I appreciate I'm sorry, but I'm very I'm very passionate about this because it's gonna hurt a lot of people and

405
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:21,398
Unless we know how we got here and how we're going to fix it and how this never happens again, I beg our constituents, I beg our residents, do not vote for this override.

406
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:34,106
We have an option that we still have, I believe, $23 million of free cash that we can stop the mayor from spending anymore, taking that $5 million so our schools, our children, our teachers are safe.

407
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,928
We're not gambling on an override vote.

408
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:47,477
And please remember our seniors and our residents that the so-called just 300 or just whatever isn't looked at as whatever.

409
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:52,381
This is people's lives and whether they can stay in their homes forever.

410
00:38:53,022 --> 00:39:03,811
And if their tenants, their renters can afford a rent hike that might be coming down the line.

411
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:04,772
So thank you.

412
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:05,092
Yep.

413
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:07,674
Unfortunately, we're going to come to a close now.

414
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:10,156
I want to thank you again, George.

415
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:15,399
I think what you're doing, and I got to put a plug in for all Medford.

416
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,821
I think what you guys are doing is really tremendous.

417
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,102
I think the city needs it.

418
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:24,485
And I think everyone appreciates you coming on to the show.

419
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:24,865
Thank you.

420
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:32,528
great job, and it's facts, it's the truth, it's information, and that's what we need to get out there.

421
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:40,151
And again, if people still want to question that, jump on any of the YouTube meetings from City Council and you could see firsthand how it came about.

422
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:42,672
This isn't something we made up.

423
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:43,593
These are all truths.

424
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:46,314
And I question everybody out there.

425
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:49,675
How many people that are for or against it

426
00:39:50,651 --> 00:40:02,393
have actually seen what the options are or had any interaction with our city leadership talking, discussing, or teaching them what that vote really means.

427
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:16,836
So that's a wide eye-opening example, John, that people can't look at George Scott Pelley or Al Medford and say they're liars and they're evil because they don't approve or believe in one organization's

428
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:22,958
vote and have that open mind to really think about it, because it will impact a lot of people.

429
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:23,598
Okay.

430
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,778
Thank you, George, so much.

431
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:26,259
This was a much-needed show.

432
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:41,444
And I just want to remind everybody, for more information about our future programming, you can visit either the Method Community Network at mcno2155.com.

433
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:43,925
You can also go to AllMethod.

434
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:48,796
And thank you for watching the show, and we'll see you again soon.

435
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,120
Thanks again, George.

436
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,762
Thank you, my friend.

437
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,764
Everyone have a good night.
