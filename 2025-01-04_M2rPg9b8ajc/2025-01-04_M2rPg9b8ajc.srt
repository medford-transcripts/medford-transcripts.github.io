00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I have to make all these great memories.

[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

12
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:07,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Whose broad stripes and bright stars

13
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:32,335
[SPEAKER_03]: ♪ Through the perilous fight ♪ ♪ O'er the ramparts we watched ♪ ♪ Were so gallantly streaming ♪ ♪ And the rockets' red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪

14
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:43,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

15
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:59,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave o'er the land of the free

16
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:09,919
And the home of the brave?

17
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:30,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to Brockton High Basketball.

18
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,457
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Miles Jackson along with my partner Orlando Galveo.

19
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:40,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here at Brockton High School in Staff Gymnasium playing on Coach Victor Ortiz's court.

20
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:44,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And Orlando, this is going to be an exciting one.

21
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,706
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an uphill fight for Brockton.

22
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,568
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in here one and four.

23
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:51,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge coming in here, three and one.

24
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,561
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a seasoned team, Brockton has a young team.

25
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:55,322
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you expect this evening?

26
00:04:55,602 --> 00:05:01,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like you said, I expect a very challenging game for the Brockton Boxers.

27
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:04,208
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you talk about Brockton and Cambridge, it's a rival game.

28
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Brockton's first home game of the season.

29
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So I expect the motivation level to be up and Brockton to be sky high taking the court here tonight.

30
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Brockton has a scoring freshman

31
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenon out here who's starting for this bodge team?

32
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's that?

33
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you talk about Clairverne's Patras very good player only a freshman and Sky's the limit for him.

34
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:45,978
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're getting ready to have the tip-off rocking in white Cambridge Ridge Falcons are in black and we're just about ready to start this game Cambridge you got to watch out number 44 for them Paris Moses very good player

35
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:55,797
[SPEAKER_01]: We got just about a packed house here at Staff Gymnasium, so a lot of electricity going through this gym this evening.

36
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brockton wins the tip-off.

37
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Three-point shot is no good.

38
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound no good by Brockton.

39
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice offensive rebound by the freshman we just talked about.

40
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:18,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Unable to get the put back, but Brockton retains possession.

41
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:20,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that'll be Fonts taking the ball out.

42
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive to the basket, in the corner.

43
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,714
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's gonna drive to the basket.

44
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:41,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Out top, in the paint shot is no good, but he's fouled.

45
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:48,601
[SPEAKER_01]: That was number one, Christopher Africo.

46
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:54,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice left handed player for Brockton, only a sophomore going to the hoop and able to draw the foul to the line for two.

47
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:07,631
[SPEAKER_01]: First free throw is missed, Africo a sophomore.

48
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:13,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to you miles before the game, this is one of Brockton's youngest team I've seen in years.

49
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:14,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.

50
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:21,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Second free throw attempt is good.

51
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We get our first point on the board.

52
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:29,952
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Moses with the ball.

53
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:37,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Drives right to the basket, uncontested, misses the shot, but an offensive rebound, no good by Correa.

54
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice clean up that time by Correa, unable to get the hoop, and he will go to the line for two shots.

55
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,668
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see the explosiveness of Moses going to the hoop that time.

56
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:50,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think he caught Brockton's defense off guard.

57
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:54,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Went straight to the hoop, just about uncontested.

58
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And he makes the second free throw attempt, so we got a tie game.

59
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,652
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Lambert with the ball, in the corner.

60
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:38,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right now our Cambridge Band of Men defense are two threes giving Broxson some issues here.

61
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:40,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much room to maneuver.

62
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:44,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice give and go is good.

63
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:52,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's the freshman, Brockton stay with it, good defense by Cambridge, but you see the freshman, Petrop to the hoop.

64
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice ball movement by Brockton.

65
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:03,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And here comes Lambert with the steal, lays it, gives a nice little pass, but the rebound is good.

66
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Offensive rebound by Africo.

67
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:10,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Petrop got hammered that time, but Africo again with the clean up.

68
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:19,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gonna call a blocking foul on number 10.

69
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:20,757
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the replay right here.

70
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you see Africo all over the cleanup, able to get two for Brockton.

71
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton out to a strong start, five to one.

72
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Inbound.

73
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:36,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses gets it over to his teammate, Zerman.

74
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Takes a long three, and that's gonna be an air ball.

75
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:39,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And way off.

76
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:41,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Back on the boxes.

77
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:48,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Furman.

78
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:51,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortz.

79
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Africo in the corner to number five, and it's gonna.

80
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the top.

81
00:09:58,283 --> 00:09:58,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the cables.

82
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, got a good look.

83
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:01,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Unable to hit the three.

84
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:06,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus Fortz starting off 0 for 2 so far from distance.

85
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cambridge looks like they're gonna talk things over here, Miles.

86
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:10,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Marcus Fortz.

87
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,692
[SPEAKER_01]: He was with this boxer team last year.

88
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,971
[SPEAKER_01]: along with Cody Lambert, again, young boxer team.

89
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,219
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will be tested this evening.

90
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:27,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, during the course of the year, Miles, so far, Brockton has handled the first half pretty, pretty good.

91
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:33,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Last game, they played Franklin, who's considered by most one of the best teams in the state.

92
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brockton was only down six at halftime.

93
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:39,234
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a tale of two halves for the Brockton boxers.

94
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:42,116
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been unable to execute in the third quarter.

95
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:45,539
[SPEAKER_00]: That's led to their three losses starting the season, one and three.

96
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:55,499
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first home broadcast this year at Staff Gymnasium.

97
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And you couldn't ask for a better game.

98
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look at this crowd.

99
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,341
[SPEAKER_00]: It is completely packed.

100
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:05,222
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have stands behind us open, which is sometimes not open.

101
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:10,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you the magnitude of this game, Cambridge versus Brockton.

102
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and Cambridge fans have come out this evening also.

103
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,502
[SPEAKER_01]: to support their team.

104
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:20,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Cambridge Falcons coming in here at three wins and one loss.

105
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:26,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only loss is to a really good team, Attaborough, who some think can win that state championship too, so.

106
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:27,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

107
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:28,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

108
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:30,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you think about Cambridge, right?

109
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:33,906
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the Patrick Ewins, Ramil Robinson, Brockton, Curtis Bostick.

110
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:38,887
[SPEAKER_00]: The list goes on with this game between Brockton and Cambridge.

111
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Brockton puts a little pressure on the inbounds.

112
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses.

113
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Great defense by Brock, as you can see.

114
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot is missed.

115
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Good defense by the Boxers.

116
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:57,547
[SPEAKER_01]: They get it up quickly.

117
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice pass!

118
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Right to the freshman, Lambert!

119
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice pass by Lambert.

120
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:08,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, playing without the ball is Petrop, and he has four to start off in.

121
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Long three.

122
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Good!

123
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:18,624
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Howard.

124
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Dante Howard saying.

125
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:20,985
[SPEAKER_00]: From downtown.

126
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:22,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me that.

127
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:24,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shot.

128
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Africo at the top of the key.

129
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:40,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Long shot is good.

130
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:43,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lambert said, whatever you can do, I can do better.

131
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,842
[SPEAKER_00]: He responds with a three of his own.

132
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:53,468
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what they need.

133
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,632
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a travel, but a great rebound that time by Curry.

134
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,274
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate he lost his balance.

135
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:02,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good sign, Orlando.

136
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Box is shooting that long ball and hitting.

137
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,724
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna have to hit him tonight to stay with this Cambridge team.

138
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:13,226
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the replay of that Lambert three.

139
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good stroke by Cody.

140
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and pop is no good.

141
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Great defense by the Boxers.

142
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:31,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound, yep, rebound Boxers.

143
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, there's some contact.

144
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, no whistle.

145
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:38,125
[SPEAKER_01]: In the corner, the Lambert, he's gonna take it.

146
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:38,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang!

147
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,446
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't leave that guy open!

148
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody starting off two for two.

149
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:44,667
[SPEAKER_00]: You sure do.

150
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:45,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to back threes.

151
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:47,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton out to an explosive start.

152
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Long bomb is no good.

153
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be Boxer Ball.

154
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:07,522
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see Cody once again with his second three-pointer in a row to give Brockton a 13-4 lead.

155
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,183
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful stroke by Lambert.

156
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:13,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they need out of the guard.

157
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambert, a sophomore.

158
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:23,848
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be Junior.

159
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,010
[SPEAKER_01]: In and out, tough break for the boxers here.

160
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses, shaking and baking.

161
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:36,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Stolen!

162
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Here come the boxers.

163
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:42,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gonna call travel.

164
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,001
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be a travel by the freshmen.

165
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:49,801
[SPEAKER_00]: That time he should have just put his head down and go straight to the hoop.

166
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, maybe get a foul.

167
00:14:51,182 --> 00:15:04,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Tough defense by the boxers right now.

168
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Long bomb, good!

169
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's another one by Howard, wow.

170
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:10,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's a senior.

171
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't leave that guy open, looks like.

172
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:17,067
[SPEAKER_01]: This Falcon team is a veteran team.

173
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,968
[SPEAKER_01]: They got two seniors and three juniors starting.

174
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Boxers moving around.

175
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:33,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside, back to Forks, and they can call travel again.

176
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:38,635
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times that travel can be caught just by good defense.

177
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,347
[SPEAKER_00]: by the opponent.

178
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:40,828
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

179
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:54,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge's defense intensity is lost.

180
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:59,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox is playing man-to-man defense.

181
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:07,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses back to Desire.

182
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:09,383
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

183
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:12,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job on the offensive boards by the boxers.

184
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:13,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Here they come.

185
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:16,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot, no good.

186
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Offensive board, puts it back up, no good.

187
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, it looked like Africo got followed there, no call.

188
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:26,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no call.

189
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,222
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like what I see Orlando as far as crashing the boards.

190
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:30,762
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to.

191
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike Cambridge, Brockton stops four underclassmen out there.

192
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:50,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Very young, including the freshman, who just took a break.

193
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:51,215
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Howard.

194
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:57,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Over to 21, he hits it.

195
00:16:57,038 --> 00:17:02,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge Falcons are showing they can hit that three right now, so Brockton's gonna have to step up their three-point defense.

196
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive to the basket, lays it up and in!

197
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:17,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Cody!

198
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job by Cody Lambert.

199
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Off to a strong start, that's eight for Cody.

200
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses drives, passes out.

201
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,259
[SPEAKER_01]: One-handed shot, air ball.

202
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And here come the boxes.

203
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice juggle pass, and it's in!

204
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:46,528
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number 10, O'Kerry.

205
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:51,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, off a great feed by number 15.

206
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

207
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:55,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Nazir Pereira.

208
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Pereira.

209
00:17:57,112 --> 00:18:01,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Just came in for the boxers and beautiful pass.

210
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:03,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a replay here.

211
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:05,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Nazir Pereira taking it to the hoop.

212
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:09,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go, O'Kerry ready right there with a nice layup.

213
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:13,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Great transition offense by Brockton that time.

214
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, kick it out of there.

215
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:22,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

216
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:24,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Great defense by the Boxers.

217
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:25,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

218
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Looked like a follow through, but will take the hoop.

219
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful play by Forts.

220
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,480
[SPEAKER_01]: He just, two men on him, Orlando.

221
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:40,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocked it out to a blazing start here in the first quarter, 19-10, Boxers.

222
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:41,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, stolen.

223
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like he got fouled!

224
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:47,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lays it in!

225
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:48,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And fouled!

226
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:58,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Pereira out the bench and making it work right now with his passing and you see the hoop and a chance for an and one.

227
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job, here's a replay.

228
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:10,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, Pereira able to hold his balance with the lefty, two off the glass and now a chance for a three point play.

229
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Outstanding by Pereira.

230
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:14,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, Boxer's playing with a lot of confidence at the moment.

231
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Another underclassman for Brockton.

232
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:30,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And a shot, free throw's good, three point play, 22-10 with 40 seconds to go in this first quarter.

233
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's gonna be a chance, that's a good call that time.

234
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:37,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good call.

235
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:42,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Referee's right there to make the call, easy for him, and he'll go the other way.

236
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that was on Furman.

237
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:45,951
[SPEAKER_00]: The Falcons.

238
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,594
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the potential of these young boxers.

239
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:53,416
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good Cambridge team, make no mistake.

240
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:06,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Box is gonna hold it for the last shot as Coach DeBaros calls out the play.

241
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:12,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Pereira with the ball.

242
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:17,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting it wind down.

243
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:22,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking firing.

244
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, too much dribble in that time.

245
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:34,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he should've took a shot with at least six seconds on the clock.

246
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the boxers could've got the offensive board because they've been doing a great job in this first quarter for offensive boards.

247
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:46,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but make no mistake, Pereira made his presence felt when he came in the game off the bench.

248
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Unable to hit that three-pointer there, but great stop by Brogdon out to a blazing 12-point lead here in the first quarter.

249
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Lando, what do you see as far as the boards?

250
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:59,180
[SPEAKER_01]: How are the boxers you consider as far as defense and offensive boards?

251
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:03,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, you see the intensity of the defenses.

252
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,845
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had a lot of turnovers, had points off turnovers as well.

253
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like you said, Miles, they are crashing the boards.

254
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you got to do to beat a good team like Cambridge.

255
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:14,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

256
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So, at the end of this first quarter, you see the score 22 to 10.

257
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:26,886
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes gotta figure a way to hold that, hold that lead to at least eight, nine points if they can.

258
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be tough.

259
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here's that block, unbelievable.

260
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's occur, pinning it off the glass.

261
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:42,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 10 occur, and then the other way, Brock goes in transition, points off big plays.

262
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The Brock to boxes that in the first quarter.

263
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:53,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cambridge Falcons, right, Miles, 14 state title, that leads the entire state.

264
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:56,909
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rich program, and they're about winning.

265
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And this rivalry with Brockton goes back years and years.

266
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:02,535
[SPEAKER_00]: The home of Patrick Ewing.

267
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:03,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.

268
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:09,562
[SPEAKER_01]: This is his high school alma mater, Cambridge Range in Latin.

269
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton, they're in these four games, their first half has been good.

270
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:19,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they can withstand this going forward.

271
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxing with the ball.

272
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:29,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Africo has it.

273
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Cambridge Falcons, they make you work.

274
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:35,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost throws it away.

275
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough Falcon defense.

276
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:43,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And the long bomb is in and out.

277
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Offensive board to the spot.

278
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:45,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's good!

279
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:47,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Nathan!

280
00:22:48,907 --> 00:22:51,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Nathan O'Curry making his presence felt.

281
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Miles with another offensive board and put back.

282
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:54,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

283
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:56,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's really hustling.

284
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:57,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the replay on that.

285
00:22:58,573 --> 00:22:58,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.

286
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:05,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Just staying with it, crashing the boards, and just getting points, big points for Brockton here in this first half.

287
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:06,978
[SPEAKER_01]: See, and that's what they need on them.

288
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,920
[SPEAKER_01]: They need the big man, which is,

289
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:12,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 10, O'Kerr.

290
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:13,245
[SPEAKER_01]: O'Kerr, yep.

291
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:15,846
[SPEAKER_01]: O'Kerr and that's what they need out of the big guy.

292
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,228
[SPEAKER_01]: They need for him to crash the boards every time that he's out there.

293
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:21,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Offense as well as defense.

294
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:27,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And he misses the free throw.

295
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And number 12.

296
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,958
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Falcons, gets that one off the boards.

297
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Burziquin stayed with it with the putback that time.

298
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:48,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Good position.

299
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:50,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, by mistake, but able to get the two.

300
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:55,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice drive by number 15 for the Foxes.

301
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:56,749
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Pereira again.

302
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:00,998
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice move.

303
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:01,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

304
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:01,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

305
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,579
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit too easy.

306
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.

307
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Fawkes.

308
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Fawkes found the lane.

309
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, frowned on that one.

310
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:13,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Long bomb.

311
00:24:13,442 --> 00:24:14,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Good!

312
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:15,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Fawkes!

313
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Fawkes with the hot hand.

314
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:19,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And he can do that.

315
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:20,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Marcus Fawkes.

316
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:23,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside to the big man.

317
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:24,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Falcon.

318
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:24,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what a block.

319
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:25,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice block.

320
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:40,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiera, and the paint, dishes it out to the corner.

321
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa, excuse me, Africo.

322
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:44,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Should've followed his shot.

323
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:45,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

324
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:51,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's gonna be a foul there.

325
00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:52,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Good call by the ref.

326
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:58,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Africo should've followed that shot and came right back to him,

327
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:00,889
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of looked at his shot, it was flat.

328
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:03,470
[SPEAKER_00]: He followed that, but it had a probably easy layup.

329
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:09,872
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing really bad to say here in this first half.

330
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:10,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has come out playing.

331
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,133
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the lead 15.

332
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people looking at the score right now, they're like, wow.

333
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:17,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said it.

334
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:18,896
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go again.

335
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Orlando, they came to play.

336
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:23,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice transition game right there.

337
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:25,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wonder when this coach is going to call a timeout.

338
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,559
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead has ballooned to 17.

339
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:30,303
[SPEAKER_00]: for Brockton.

340
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:45,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Harker's right on him.

341
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Long bomb, he's gonna foul Tiki Tack, but it's a foul.

342
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:51,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that, Carl.

343
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:52,497
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a freebie right there.

344
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:56,723
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call that every time.

345
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:57,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

346
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:58,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here's the replay.

347
00:25:58,885 --> 00:25:59,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that call.

348
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:00,927
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a great defense.

349
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:01,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Kid misses the shot.

350
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:03,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can reward him with three shots.

351
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

352
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:09,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So I question that call, but refs have been good to now, you know?

353
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:10,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have.

354
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,018
[SPEAKER_00]: That shot had no chance of going in either.

355
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:18,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.

356
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:27,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So number 12.

357
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:33,200
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a weird form, but you see right there, it's all net.

358
00:26:35,722 --> 00:26:36,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's Amir.

359
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,684
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you pronounce that?

360
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:38,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Bariziqui.

361
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Good enough, Bariziqui.

362
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:41,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

363
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:44,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Bariziqua.

364
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:45,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

365
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:59,910
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't lob the ball like that.

366
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad pass.

367
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,514
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't lob the ball like that.

368
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:08,875
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making it easier for Cambridge.

369
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:10,415
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically giving them possession.

370
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:13,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the replay right here.

371
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:14,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a simple lob.

372
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:15,078
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a no-no.

373
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:18,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa's gonna sit out.

374
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:23,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't lobby because this Cambridge team is very fast, very quick.

375
00:27:23,703 --> 00:27:26,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Like ball hawks say, they're gonna go after that ball immediately when you do that.

376
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, backcourt.

377
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:33,677
[SPEAKER_01]: The defense brought some

378
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Amir wasn't paying attention where his feet were.

379
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too many seniors here in this Brockton team.

380
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,481
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a senior that just came in, Jaheim Willen, number four.

381
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton does not have many seniors that play.

382
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:50,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and as far as Cambridge goes, they've had two seniors come off the bench.

383
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:50,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

384
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a clean strip right there.

385
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:56,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And good transition.

386
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice steal by Carrera.

387
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark has got to be smarter with that ball.

388
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:02,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

389
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:03,687
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a better ball handler than that.

390
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:08,237
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Pierre with the ball.

391
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:12,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.

392
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:13,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.

393
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:14,896
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a jump ball.

394
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton looking like a little unraveled here and you can see the steal here, clean swipe.

395
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:27,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Last couple of minutes they haven't looked like the Brockton in that first quarter.

396
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:30,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coach senses that and he calls timeout.

397
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Good timeout by Coach DeBaros.

398
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:42,431
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the replay on the clean swipe there by Carrera, able to go to the hoop for two and Marcus gotta be smarter with that ball and they've cut a 17 point lead down to 13.

399
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the big thing now for the Foxes is like you said,

400
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:51,272
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't commit turnovers because turnovers.

401
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:54,046
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Cambridge Falcons will turn into points.

402
00:28:54,306 --> 00:29:05,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make a good point, Miles, because in analyzing Brockton's three straight losses, the turnovers in the second half have played a huge part in teams getting runs on a young team.

403
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:11,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you get a young team like that, you can go through waves of doing that.

404
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:11,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

405
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:14,936
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the learning curve that we talk about, right?

406
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:15,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

407
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:18,298
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're a young team, you're going to make mistakes.

408
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge crowd here in Brockton.

409
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too many much seats open.

410
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:29,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Front and back stands are open.

411
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it's been mostly all Brockton.

412
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton is hitting the shots they've had to.

413
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,571
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds.

414
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:44,994
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have to continue doing what they're doing and playing good defense and not having many turnovers.

415
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:45,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

416
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:47,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in their first quarter.

417
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:50,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've shut this guy down.

418
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:54,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Their main player, Moses, pretty much the whole game so far.

419
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:58,655
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a steal.

420
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:01,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice little fake, but he misses it, but he's fouled.

421
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, had a chance for Kent Pereira making his presence felt in this game.

422
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:11,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you see the replay going to the hoop.

423
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice fake.

424
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:18,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a chance for a three point play, didn't make the shot, but able to go to the line for two.

425
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, Pierre, a sophomore.

426
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:23,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Another youngster for Brockton.

427
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:24,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

428
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Mason's first free throw attempt.

429
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Second free throw attempt is good.

430
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice form by Pereira.

431
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:54,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Big guy for a guard.

432
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you can see his dribbling skills.

433
00:30:57,247 --> 00:30:58,549
[SPEAKER_00]: There go Marcus, that's a foul.

434
00:30:58,809 --> 00:30:59,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?

435
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:06,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised they're not going to call that a take foul because there was no one up ahead and he got leveled.

436
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:06,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

437
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:14,020
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the replay here, there's no one up ahead and Marcus just got clotheslined pretty much.

438
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,262
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to call it a simple foul.

439
00:31:16,562 --> 00:31:20,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprising that that's not anything bigger than that.

440
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:23,385
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see Gabe.

441
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:28,168
[SPEAKER_00]: My man Gabe just checking into the game for the first time for the Brockton Boxers.

442
00:31:41,452 --> 00:31:42,173
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the freshman.

443
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And the paint in the corner.

444
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gonna call travel.

445
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:51,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice idea, but too many steps.

446
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:57,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Another turnover for the Boxers here in this second quarter.

447
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:03,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And here come the Falcons.

448
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.

449
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Osmosis right there.

450
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,432
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a strong, that's a big boy.

451
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:14,233
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big boy move.

452
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:15,634
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big boy move right there.

453
00:32:15,754 --> 00:32:16,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

454
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:18,375
[SPEAKER_00]: First points, I believe, of the game.

455
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:24,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambert.

456
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,780
[SPEAKER_01]: The number 22.

457
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to Ford.

458
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:35,024
[SPEAKER_00]: He got smacked, no call, that's a foul.

459
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:36,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

460
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:37,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that all the way over here.

461
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:39,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how do you not call that?

462
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:43,868
[SPEAKER_00]: He traveled, but he got smacked before he traveled.

463
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:47,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough call there, going against the boxers.

464
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,331
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard smack from here, right?

465
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:50,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it from here.

466
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:01,056
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a nice pass.

467
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice pass.

468
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:03,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Correra, again, down below.

469
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:11,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, he's been the main guy for this Falcon team.

470
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:15,182
[SPEAKER_01]: 11-point lead for the Boxers.

471
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:15,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot.

472
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:16,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound.

473
00:33:16,543 --> 00:33:16,983
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

474
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:17,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.

475
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound, Cambridge.

476
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:19,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Here they come.

477
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:21,025
Oh, go all the way.

478
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:22,446
All the way.

479
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:26,588
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way.

480
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:27,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and pop.

481
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:27,929
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

482
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:32,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Offensive board, long bomb, no good.

483
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:35,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambert comes out of there and hit him in the boxes.

484
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Proctor gotta watch out here.

485
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,733
[SPEAKER_00]: A. Cambridge has stepped up the intensity.

486
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambert drives in the corner.

487
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:52,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Turnover.

488
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:14,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought you gotta watch out Cambridge to step up the intensity of defense and not good look Brock is not getting good looks at Manny Coach the barrels sense that he's gonna call a timeout to put a stop to this surge by the Cambridge Falcons Cambridge creeping back into this game.

489
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:22,620
[SPEAKER_00]: They only down by nine Yeah, you see the replay again off of Brockton turnover and

490
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:29,870
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get two buckets and close this 17 point lead down to just single digits, nine.

491
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:36,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a big, I would say this is a big two minutes for Brockford here left in this first half.

492
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:40,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Very big Orlando, very big because they feel the pressure.

493
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now Cambridge has a little momentum going.

494
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:49,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they brought it down to just one digit which is nine points.

495
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:54,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're coming to themselves now.

496
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing the real Cambridge starting to heat up here.

497
00:34:57,755 --> 00:35:01,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a slow start, but now they're starting to get into a groove.

498
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting to make some good defensive moves on the boxers.

499
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:08,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I think defensively, Cambridge has been sound.

500
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:13,202
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the offense, then, that's led to transition points for the Brockton boxers.

501
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:17,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brockton has not been able to run their offense consistently right now.

502
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:22,089
[SPEAKER_00]: You take away the two Lambert threes, it's been kind of tough sledding for this offense.

503
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:26,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's doing it from the defensive boards, offensive rebound and things like that.

504
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:39,490
So,

505
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:05,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost a turnover there, not on the same page, Lambert and Forts.

506
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:08,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Forts gonna take it, and makes it!

507
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:11,942
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about a huge shot!

508
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:13,263
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge one.

509
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:23,110
[SPEAKER_00]: To sense the rush, and wow, what a big shot by Forts right there, because Cambridge was really making a surge, and that stops that there.

510
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Long three, in and out.

511
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be Cambridge's ball.

512
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:42,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the second big three-pointer Fortes has hit for Brockton, and that one was probably the biggest.

513
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:51,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Moses, good.

514
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:56,772
[SPEAKER_00]: You see why he's probably their best player, Moses, because guys starting to heat up right now.

515
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:03,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has put the clamps on him for the start of the game, but now he's starting to heat up, and that's a foul.

516
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:05,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice call by the referees there on Moses.

517
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's never a good foul when you have to reach like that.

518
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:10,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that's not a smart move right there by Moses.

519
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:11,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Unnecessary.

520
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:16,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, here's the replay right there of the foul.

521
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly hit him.

522
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:21,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Peltrick with inbound.

523
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:26,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to Pelcher.

524
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And not a good pass stolen by Cambridge.

525
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:32,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Here they come.

526
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Falcons flying in there.

527
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:36,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Lays it up and in.

528
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice drop step.

529
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:43,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Lefty able to kiss it off the glass and again offer Brockton turnover by the freshman.

530
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:45,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven point boxer lead.

531
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:49,971
[SPEAKER_01]: 53 seconds in the second quarter.

532
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like a travel.

533
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:53,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps might have missed the call there.

534
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's fortunate.

535
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the glass and in!

536
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Pereira again!

537
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:04,519
[SPEAKER_01]: No fear going into that paint going up against the big boy.

538
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:06,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Sophomore looking good for Brockett off the bench.

539
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:14,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh!

540
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:16,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice block.

541
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:19,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though a foul was called.

542
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a little bit of talking going on there, the referee.

543
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,294
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the replay, that looked like it was all ball.

544
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:26,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know who the foul was, but they called it on him.

545
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:27,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't know about that call.

546
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,876
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it on Carroll.

547
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:30,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

548
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:40,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of that's going on in the other end too, so I don't understand that call, but ball don't lie, right?

549
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lie.

550
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Ball don't lie.

551
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,121
[SPEAKER_01]: First shot in and out.

552
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:44,661
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good ball.

553
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent block.

554
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:58,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge getting some height in there.

555
00:38:58,243 --> 00:39:01,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to box out.

556
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:06,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, didn't box out.

557
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:09,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Good defense by the boxers.

558
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:12,937
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be on the floor.

559
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:17,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's gonna be a bonus for Cambridge, but again, you have to box out.

560
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you, good move by the coach for Cambridge to put them big guys in there.

561
00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:24,263
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the replay here, no boxing out.

562
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:28,345
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be shooting.

563
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,285
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a bonus for Cambridge right now.

564
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,407
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a bonus.

565
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:36,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be going to the line.

566
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:38,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is.

567
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,730
[SPEAKER_01]: A little confusion by the players.

568
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:46,808
[SPEAKER_01]: but number four Nazir, a senior, will shoot the free throws.

569
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:54,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically gave him free buckets here.

570
00:39:54,412 --> 00:40:04,377
[SPEAKER_00]: All you had to do was box out, hold the ball for the last shot, and you go into the half with at least a nine point lead for the Proctor, so you gotta box out.

571
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Second free throw attempt is good.

572
00:40:11,347 --> 00:40:13,688
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 seconds on the clock, Boxers have the ball.

573
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:20,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot clock is off, Boxers need to hold on to this ball and get the last shot.

574
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:31,655
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the smart thing to do.

575
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:32,815
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 seconds on the shot clock.

576
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:39,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And got fouled.

577
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:40,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job by Forts.

578
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:43,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that time it was all Marcus Forts there in that last.

579
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:45,211
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not giving up that ball.

580
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,172
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew he was going to shoot it.

581
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:49,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolated this guy, able to go to Hoover.

582
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:53,835
[SPEAKER_00]: He did get hit in the arm and has a chance to give Brockton a nine point lead to go into the half.

583
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:02,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Forts a good free throw shooter.

584
00:41:05,826 --> 00:41:10,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing the boxers need, when they get those free throws chances, they need to hit them.

585
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:21,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortuny and Junior, another underclassmen for Brockton.

586
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:24,411
[SPEAKER_00]: That nearly went in for the Falcons that time.

587
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:31,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the first half complete, very exciting first half.

588
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:32,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Orlando, what'd you see in that first half?

589
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,499
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Brockton's best first half of the season right there.

590
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:41,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the one they won in at Western North, because of the caliber of the team they're playing.

591
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:47,204
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 points up, considering Brockton has barely cracked a 40 in the previous three games.

592
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:49,606
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an impressive first half, I would say that.

593
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:51,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point, Orlando.

594
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:54,588
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm Miles Jackson along with Orlando Galveo.

595
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:56,389
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back with exciting

596
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:58,391
[SPEAKER_01]: second half action in a moment.

597
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:44,163
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for those of you who don't know, last year, last year, we had a chance to have a senior position down here.

598
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:48,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for four or three and a half years, and I started working there, and then after I did, I stopped for a year, before I used to play, I was seven, eight percent.

599
00:42:56,954 --> 00:43:00,856
[SPEAKER_02]: In the year after that, it was a reason for me to be on set and use the work I was doing to develop a game, to be able to recalibrate on both bodies what blocker basketball is all about.

600
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,377
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure that you give them the knowledge they're looking for.

601
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:02,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them that too.

602
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,957
Ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate the love of our hearts.

603
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:25,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We thank you for being such a good student athlete and being a very good representative of a lot of rock and roll students, including me.

604
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate the love that's ever been there for you, always been there for us.

605
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:30,342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the love of football and everything you do.

606
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:34,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just want to make sure that we acknowledge you tonight for seeing life as it is and being a special, special gift to everyone who did it.

607
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:57,961
Hey guys, make sure we're good.

608
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:58,281
Let's go team.

609
00:43:58,301 --> 00:43:58,561
Let's go team.

610
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:34,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And now just a few, just a few episodes.

611
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, love you guys.

612
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:38,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, goodnight.

613
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:36,203
you

614
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:19,643
you

615
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:07,113
you

616
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,441
[SPEAKER_01]: and welcome everybody to Brockton High Basketball.

617
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:55,142
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got an exciting one in this staff gymnasium.

618
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:58,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out jacking along with Orlando Galveo.

619
00:54:59,103 --> 00:55:05,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And Orlando, Brockton has risen to the occasion to at least give these Cambridge Falcons a run for their money.

620
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, surprise, surprise.

621
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:12,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said though earlier, the first half hasn't been the problem for Brockton just off the season.

622
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:14,226
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done great in the first half.

623
00:55:14,366 --> 00:55:15,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.

624
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:16,607
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the third quarter,

625
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:24,151
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people say, okay, they gotta make adjustments, but players gotta step up too, all right?

626
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:33,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is gonna be the telling, the third quarter, in terms of how the season has gone, Miles, this third quarter is gonna be the telling for the Brockton Boxers.

627
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:37,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely so, as this Falcons defense started to clamp down on the

628
00:55:38,313 --> 00:55:40,374
[SPEAKER_01]: on Brockton's offense in that second quarter.

629
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:43,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you see Paris Moses.

630
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:48,137
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut him down early in the game, but you see he's catching his groove now, right?

631
00:55:48,477 --> 00:55:50,258
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's starting to get comfortable.

632
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:57,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Brockton, in that first half, Cody Lambert and Marcus Forts led the way for the Brockton Boxers.

633
00:55:57,741 --> 00:56:02,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the talent of the freshman, Claire Burns-Peltrack.

634
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,826
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just, he plays beyond his years.

635
00:56:07,846 --> 00:56:09,287
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not look like a freshman.

636
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,308
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see him out on the court, but at times he do, right?

637
00:56:12,568 --> 00:56:15,049
[SPEAKER_00]: With that lazy pass and things like that, he has to work on it.

638
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:23,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order for this Brockton team to hang with Cambridge, they're going to have to cut down on the turnovers because that's where Cambridge took advantage.

639
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:25,655
[SPEAKER_01]: and that second quarter was Brockton's turnover.

640
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:34,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and Brockton to Cambridge Defense too, their turnover has led to Brockton transition points as well.

641
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:41,528
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third quarter, like I said, Miles, that's been the problem for Brockton, so I'm pretty sure Coach Farris is talking about that.

642
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:46,152
[SPEAKER_00]: How we come out in the third quarter is gonna indicate if we're gonna win this game or not.

643
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:49,034
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're getting ready to start this second half.

644
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:52,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Third quarter, here at Staff Gymnasium,

645
00:56:54,112 --> 00:56:59,574
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Brockton Community Access Sports bringing the best in high school basketball.

646
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:03,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Marcus Ford's led Brockton in that first half with 12.

647
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:07,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget about Nazir Pereira, who has nine off the bench.

648
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:09,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Cody Lambert followed up with eight.

649
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:14,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Pereira did a nice job coming off the bench, giving the boxers some help on offense.

650
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:19,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So the boxers will inbound it, begin this third quarter.

651
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:24,942
[SPEAKER_01]: sports.

652
00:57:26,483 --> 00:57:28,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody off the rim.

653
00:57:28,663 --> 00:57:29,404
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good look.

654
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:30,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Good setup.

655
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:32,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Unable to hit the three.

656
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And the paint.

657
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:37,766
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is off black.

658
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:38,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

659
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:41,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, another missed call by the referees.

660
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a clear miss.

661
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:45,128
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get the replay on that, that just went off his leg.

662
00:57:45,749 --> 00:57:49,710
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to the hoop erratically and gets awarded with the ball again.

663
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable.

664
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And the referees will have a little meeting.

665
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're talking about it.

666
00:57:54,861 --> 00:57:56,302
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it went off his leg.

667
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:01,885
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stay here.

668
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:02,606
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about it.

669
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:03,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It still stays here.

670
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:10,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot.

671
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:11,351
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

672
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:15,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Cambridge scrambling for that ball.

673
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:16,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge still with the ball.

674
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:18,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Long bomb by Moses is good.

675
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you see he got the shooter's roll.

676
00:58:21,115 --> 00:58:23,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, he continues his momentum.

677
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:25,318
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads down to six.

678
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:31,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, Josh Fowler.

679
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:34,527
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that freshman, Claire Burns.

680
00:58:35,067 --> 00:58:36,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Pelt drop with an and one.

681
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:39,772
[SPEAKER_00]: This kid's gonna be a stud.

682
00:58:39,972 --> 00:58:42,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice job by Peltrop.

683
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:44,434
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll go to the free throw line to shoot one.

684
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a replay on the freshman.

685
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:57,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice hoop, nice teardropper to the line for a three point play.

686
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:01,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice answer that time by Brockton off the Moses three.

687
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,101
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Furman with the ball.

688
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,611
[SPEAKER_01]: In-your-face defense right now by Brockton.

689
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:16,672
[SPEAKER_01]: They try to get inside, stolen by Cody Lambert.

690
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:20,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Boyds.

691
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:24,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Another freshman.

692
00:59:30,878 --> 00:59:32,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Afriko Lambert.

693
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Good defense by Cambridge.

694
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:37,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

695
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:39,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot by Lambert, no good.

696
00:59:42,526 --> 00:59:43,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Freshman's up.

697
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:45,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Just misses it.

698
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they come out of there.

699
00:59:48,913 --> 00:59:50,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice move by the freshman.

700
00:59:50,214 --> 00:59:52,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Unable to hit it, but good move.

701
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses.

702
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Gets it out top.

703
00:59:59,284 --> 00:59:59,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and pop.

704
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:01,547
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

705
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:02,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound.

706
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton, here they come.

707
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:09,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa just got leveled, no call.

708
01:00:09,755 --> 01:00:15,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been one rep, they're just calling it one way right now.

709
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:18,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed that one, that was a lot of body contact, but no call.

710
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:20,419
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a terrible call, I mean.

711
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:28,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Falcons with the ball.

712
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:38,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge works it around.

713
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,004
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Furman.

714
01:00:44,427 --> 01:00:45,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice defense by the freshman.

715
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to Moses.

716
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses spins in the paint, puts it up.

717
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:50,253
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

718
01:00:50,933 --> 01:00:52,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brockman comes out of there.

719
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:56,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice dish off.

720
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:57,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

721
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, and number 22 for the Boxers puts it in.

722
01:01:03,203 --> 01:01:07,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was actually a curve with the follow-up off the freshman miss.

723
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:10,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a curve, stay with it, crashing the boards.

724
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job by O'Kerr.

725
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:15,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wild shot, no good.

726
01:01:18,194 --> 01:01:21,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot missed again by Moses, and he, excuse me, number 15.

727
01:01:22,197 --> 01:01:25,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrera, numerous attempts, and the second time he was able to

728
01:01:27,582 --> 01:01:28,142
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the hoop.

729
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:30,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a great hustle by Cambridge.

730
01:01:35,464 --> 01:01:38,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine point box to lead, shot from the out, Key misses.

731
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:42,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses comes at it and they push it up.

732
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:46,246
[SPEAKER_01]: In the corner, no good.

733
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses, block, and here they come.

734
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:54,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a great pass that time.

735
01:01:55,652 --> 01:01:58,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And bye-bye Marcus just throws it up there.

736
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:01,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock is getting a little sloppy with the ball right now.

737
01:02:01,536 --> 01:02:04,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he should have held on to it and just brought it up.

738
01:02:05,258 --> 01:02:06,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like he was by himself.

739
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,420
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple guys down there with him.

740
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:09,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a good pass.

741
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:18,947
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Furman.

742
01:02:20,248 --> 01:02:21,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark's not moving.

743
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:22,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark's not moving.

744
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:33,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, another clean-up that time, and Brock is getting... Beat under the boards right now.

745
01:02:33,658 --> 01:02:34,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Handled on the boards right now.

746
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:36,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Leads down to seven.

747
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:43,740
[SPEAKER_01]: For it.

748
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the glass, off the rim, and no good.

749
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mind that shot.

750
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:52,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice pass.

751
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:57,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And Cambridge starting to heat up underneath.

752
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of their baskets in this second half have been underneath the boards.

753
01:03:02,861 --> 01:03:04,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath the rim, excuse me.

754
01:03:04,482 --> 01:03:05,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And watch out here for Brockton.

755
01:03:05,822 --> 01:03:10,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the third quarter has been where Brockton has fell apart early in the season.

756
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:11,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Another turnover.

757
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:15,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's a back court.

758
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:33,167
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got some substitutions here by Brockton.

759
01:03:34,387 --> 01:03:37,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pereira, the hot guy in the first half of Brockton comes into the game.

760
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:41,369
[SPEAKER_00]: And the freshman will take a breather.

761
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:51,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Good anticipation by Marcus, unable to get the steal but.

762
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:53,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice job.

763
01:03:53,574 --> 01:03:55,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost had an easy two going the other way.

764
01:03:56,676 --> 01:04:02,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely would have been an easy two.

765
01:04:02,419 --> 01:04:05,261
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 seconds left on the shot clock for Cambridge Ridge.

766
01:04:11,105 --> 01:04:13,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive to the basket, dishes underneath.

767
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good, and he's fouled.

768
01:04:15,547 --> 01:04:16,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice dish off.

769
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:18,972
[SPEAKER_01]: by Furman.

770
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Cambridge rolling to the hoop and finding the guy underneath.

771
01:04:23,474 --> 01:04:28,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the replay, this has happened numerous times tonight for the Cambridge Falcons.

772
01:04:28,717 --> 01:04:31,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Very skilled with the ball, going to the hoop is Furman.

773
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:43,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Able to find number 33, Aaron Abib, the junior forward for the Falcons and has a chance to complete a three point play.

774
01:04:47,936 --> 01:04:52,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four, Desir just skied up there for the offensive boards.

775
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:55,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the lead is down to one, ladies and gentlemen.

776
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new game here.

777
01:05:02,964 --> 01:05:06,787
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a foul on Desir.

778
01:05:06,867 --> 01:05:15,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, almost a turnover and Marcus did get fouled, but again, third quarter rules for Brockton is

779
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:18,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it's happening again.

780
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:29,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

781
01:05:31,655 --> 01:05:33,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And a turnover that time.

782
01:05:33,836 --> 01:05:35,998
[SPEAKER_00]: No call and a timeout by Brockton.

783
01:05:36,078 --> 01:05:38,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Good timeout here by Costa Verde.

784
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Antoninus to the Falcons.

785
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:42,003
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like he just lost the ball out of bounds.

786
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:54,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted the foul, but he might have lost the ball just before he was fouled That doesn't count so uh nine-point lead to stop the

787
01:05:55,588 --> 01:05:57,150
[SPEAKER_00]: The third quarter's been cut down to one.

788
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:10,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been, Cambridge has finally come around and started controlling these boards on the offense as well as the defense, and most importantly, the offensive end, because most of their points have been coming underneath the rim on those offensive rebounds.

789
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:16,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you look at Brock, they've been outscored here in the third quarter with three minutes and 12 seconds to go, they've been outscored 13 to five.

790
01:06:16,688 --> 01:06:18,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not good.

791
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,732
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still hold a one point lead.

792
01:06:21,865 --> 01:06:25,028
[SPEAKER_01]: but they gotta start producing some points.

793
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:29,953
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, Cambridge plays some really tough defense in this third quarter.

794
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,415
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been smothering Brock's offense.

795
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:42,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what Coach DeBarros draws up here, and it will be going the other way with Cambridge off the turnover.

796
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge has a chance to take the lead for the first time in a great while.

797
01:06:49,322 --> 01:06:50,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for the first time tonight.

798
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:52,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's just unheard of.

799
01:06:53,004 --> 01:06:57,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought that Cambridge, if they take the lead, would be in the third quarter for the first time.

800
01:06:57,826 --> 01:06:58,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

801
01:07:02,688 --> 01:07:03,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.

802
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive to the basket, and a call travel.

803
01:07:26,235 --> 01:07:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Good defense by Brockett.

804
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:31,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that time he spun around and had a guy right in his face in too many steps.

805
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:33,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, nice job by Cody Lambert.

806
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:35,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing tough defense.

807
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:42,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Sierra.

808
01:07:43,763 --> 01:07:44,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost lost it.

809
01:07:44,443 --> 01:07:46,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is fouled.

810
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:08,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Good move by time by Africo, going to who?

811
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:17,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton stayed patient with it, passing the ball around the perimeter and is able to get rewarded right here maybe with two shots here at the line for Africo.

812
01:08:18,018 --> 01:08:18,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here's the replay.

813
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:23,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed like it took a little time for them refs to blow that whistle.

814
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:25,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, looked like it got hammered, two guys there.

815
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:38,990
[SPEAKER_01]: First free throw attempt is good.

816
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:44,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how Brockton responds here.

817
01:08:45,313 --> 01:08:47,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge able to cut the lead down to one.

818
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:01,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice touch at the free throw line for Africo.

819
01:09:13,347 --> 01:09:14,828
[SPEAKER_00]: You really gotta get in his face.

820
01:09:15,128 --> 01:09:19,531
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big guy, a junior forward, Aaron Abebe with a three pointer.

821
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,033
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all tied up.

822
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:30,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice strong move, but he missed it.

823
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:34,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And Fultz will be called to the foul.

824
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:40,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a... That's a... See the three here by Abebe.

825
01:09:41,535 --> 01:09:42,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't waste no time.

826
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:45,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked confident in shooting it, nailing it, tying this game.

827
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:49,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other way, Cambridge had a three-on-one break if that foul wasn't committed.

828
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:58,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So... I like how the boxers go into the paint and attempt the shot, but...

829
01:10:00,103 --> 01:10:03,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the tough Falcon defense, they're just not making them.

830
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:08,033
[SPEAKER_00]: You see why you're starting to see here in the third quarter why Cambridge is one of the better teams in this.

831
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're going to call a foul.

832
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:10,756
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to call a foul in the fourth.

833
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:11,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

834
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:18,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.

835
01:10:18,616 --> 01:10:20,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they come, boxes.

836
01:10:41,372 --> 01:10:42,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice shot, nice touch.

837
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:48,475
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Pereira who's been excellent off the bench that time with a nice teardropper.

838
01:10:49,576 --> 01:10:50,476
[SPEAKER_00]: He's up to 11.

839
01:10:52,797 --> 01:10:56,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And nice defense by, who's that, Fonts?

840
01:10:56,379 --> 01:10:58,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Cambridge coaches are

841
01:11:00,748 --> 01:11:01,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the foul?

842
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:03,851
[SPEAKER_00]: They're screaming, and they might have a point there.

843
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:04,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

844
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,092
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have a point there, Miles.

845
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:07,433
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe it's a make-up for that.

846
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:08,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe it is.

847
01:11:09,275 --> 01:11:09,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it is.

848
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:17,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Box is up by two.

849
01:11:19,123 --> 01:11:19,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Forts.

850
01:11:24,107 --> 01:11:24,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to Forts.

851
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:36,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop and pop, and he's fouled.

852
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did get hit in that guy forever again.

853
01:11:40,118 --> 01:11:42,160
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off the bench contributing.

854
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:57,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Very patient, handles the ball pretty good and that time got hit in the arm and has a chance to go to the line to extend the Brockton lead and most importantly this Cambridge surge and you see the replay here as he gets hit.

855
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:08,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, boxers have

856
01:12:08,964 --> 01:12:12,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but juniors, sophomores, and one senior.

857
01:12:14,687 --> 01:12:15,808
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been out on the court.

858
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:20,971
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the response by this young Brockton team to the Cambridge time again.

859
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:23,052
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Cambridge.

860
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:25,053
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a senior team, veteran team.

861
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:27,634
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of seniors, few juniors.

862
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:28,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot is good.

863
01:12:31,816 --> 01:12:34,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever giving Brockton a big lift with 13 tonight.

864
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:36,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Four-point lead for the Broxers.

865
01:12:39,383 --> 01:12:40,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And... Oh!

866
01:12:40,704 --> 01:12:41,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Offensive foul!

867
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:42,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice call!

868
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:43,945
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good call.

869
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:51,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, Furman is arguing about the call, but he clearly throws an elbow, and he's lucky he didn't get hit with a technical that time.

870
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he clearly threw that elbow.

871
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,249
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the replay on that.

872
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:58,690
[SPEAKER_00]: He's arguing, he's frustrated, but you can't just swing your elbows out there, right?

873
01:12:58,730 --> 01:12:59,050
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can't.

874
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,830
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can't.

875
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,131
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be taking out the game.

876
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Frustrated.

877
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:04,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Frustrated.

878
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:04,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Defense.

879
01:13:04,772 --> 01:13:05,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Good defense.

880
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:21,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Long bomb is no good.

881
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit too far out for Fonts.

882
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Shot in the corner is no good.

883
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses.

884
01:13:31,781 --> 01:13:34,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 33, no good.

885
01:13:34,902 --> 01:13:35,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And here come the boxes.

886
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:40,489
[SPEAKER_00]: This'll be a big shot right here.

887
01:13:45,992 --> 01:13:46,552
[SPEAKER_01]: In the corner.

888
01:13:48,193 --> 01:13:50,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no good.

889
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound boxes.

890
01:13:51,735 --> 01:13:56,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to call travel.

891
01:13:56,518 --> 01:13:57,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough call there.

892
01:13:57,738 --> 01:14:05,603
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a tough call, but I believe he did take too many steps, but brought the numerous opportunities that time to extend the lead.

893
01:14:05,903 --> 01:14:07,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Good looks, too, I would say.

894
01:14:09,865 --> 01:14:12,286
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 seconds left in this third quarter.

895
01:14:14,086 --> 01:14:15,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Box is up by four.

896
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:26,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Box is double teaming Moses.

897
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:31,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh wow, that looked like an elbow by Moses.

898
01:14:31,251 --> 01:14:32,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the call.

899
01:14:33,215 --> 01:14:36,577
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean now the game's starting, you see the physicality.

900
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:39,218
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to intensify.

901
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:42,119
[SPEAKER_00]: The referees are not adjusting to it because.

902
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,801
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right, they're not adjusting to it because that was an aggressive.

903
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:46,582
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the call?

904
01:14:46,722 --> 01:14:47,222
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the call?

905
01:14:48,343 --> 01:14:56,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they called a defensive foul but Moses was quite, quite aggressive with the senior and he got away with one.

906
01:14:59,768 --> 01:15:00,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Stops and pops.

907
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:02,113
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

908
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:03,514
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a foul.

909
01:15:03,954 --> 01:15:06,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he hammered him in the head off the rebound.

910
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:08,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Tough call.

911
01:15:08,815 --> 01:15:13,617
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to send Cambridge to the line, unfortunately, with one second.

912
01:15:17,498 --> 01:15:21,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Both teams in the bonus here for the right now.

913
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,020
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a good rebound.

914
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, crashing the boards.

915
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:29,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's a foul, you want the boxers to fight hard underneath the boards.

916
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,543
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the Falcons just to get an easy rebound and put it back up.

917
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:56,301
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be physical.

918
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:58,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Second free throw attempts in and out.

919
01:16:07,637 --> 01:16:15,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it into the third quarter boxes still have a lead Orlando and that's a good sign right there that they didn't fold.

920
01:16:16,112 --> 01:16:17,833
[SPEAKER_01]: They bent a little bit, but they didn't break.

921
01:16:18,213 --> 01:16:19,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, they still hold the lead.

922
01:16:19,714 --> 01:16:27,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge, where they did advantage in that third quarter, outscoring Brockton, 17 to 10.

923
01:16:28,758 --> 01:16:33,060
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, Brockton still holds a three-point lead, barely.

924
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,622
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know, we talked about the third quarter, but now you're going to have to continue it.

925
01:16:38,477 --> 01:16:41,804
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the third quarter, excuse me, but now you're going to have to continue into the fourth quarter.

926
01:16:41,984 --> 01:16:48,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you're going to see the physicality on both sides get even tougher in this fourth quarter.

927
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you see, especially in the Cambridge end, they ramped up in physicality.

928
01:16:54,102 --> 01:16:57,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brockton has responded pretty, pretty well.

929
01:16:57,884 --> 01:17:02,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see Pereira giving Brockton big minutes off the bench.

930
01:17:02,026 --> 01:17:04,527
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 points for Nysere Pereira.

931
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:05,807
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been big today.

932
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:09,009
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably, let's say, been the savior right now for the Brockton Boxers.

933
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:15,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Boxers really got to concentrate on number 44, the senior, Paris Moses.

934
01:17:17,014 --> 01:17:22,037
[SPEAKER_01]: good ball handler, good shooter, and he's got a little weight on him where he can get physical.

935
01:17:22,477 --> 01:17:26,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he handles the ball pretty good, very good player.

936
01:17:26,639 --> 01:17:30,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's probably going to look to take over right now.

937
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:30,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

938
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:36,084
[SPEAKER_00]: People in Cambridge know that he's probably their best player, and he's probably going to be the go-to guy.

939
01:17:36,104 --> 01:17:39,285
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, Cambridge is not just one guy, Miles.

940
01:17:39,325 --> 01:17:40,206
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a scary part.

941
01:17:40,306 --> 01:17:44,208
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got multiple guys that's more than capable of scoring and putting the ball in the hoop.

942
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:45,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes indeed.

943
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:48,590
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the scary part about this Cambridge team.

944
01:17:52,113 --> 01:17:55,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge will have possession here in this very big fourth quarter coming up.

945
01:18:00,617 --> 01:18:01,658
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be excited, Miles.

946
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,680
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a one good fourth quarter coming up.

947
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited.

948
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:05,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.

949
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about Brockton, they didn't make a lot of turnovers there in the third quarter, which was good.

950
01:18:16,322 --> 01:18:16,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at this.

951
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:17,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

952
01:18:18,263 --> 01:18:19,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, come on.

953
01:18:19,643 --> 01:18:20,643
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a pocket.

954
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:25,485
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked his pocket like a thief.

955
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:26,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a thief in the night.

956
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,725
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a bad call.

957
01:18:29,286 --> 01:18:30,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Big break for Cambridge.

958
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:31,266
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot reward.

959
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:31,766
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

960
01:18:31,786 --> 01:18:32,687
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot reward.

961
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:33,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

962
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:34,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at the replay.

963
01:18:34,647 --> 01:18:36,468
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a clean strip by Pereira.

964
01:18:36,488 --> 01:18:40,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, Cambridge clearly getting the advantage of the call.

965
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:41,629
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a terrible call.

966
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:42,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a terrible call.

967
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:44,430
[SPEAKER_00]: All ball.

968
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:45,310
[SPEAKER_00]: All ball.

969
01:18:48,271 --> 01:19:06,949
[SPEAKER_00]: foul now what do you do I mean you can't play defense they don't want the rest of watching to play defense is there underneath and that's a foul

970
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Good defense by the boxers, but right at the end there.

971
01:19:11,522 --> 01:19:14,804
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a legit foul, but Cambridge shouldn't even have the ball.

972
01:19:14,824 --> 01:19:15,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it real.

973
01:19:16,225 --> 01:19:18,887
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a clean pit rip by Pereira at the other end.

974
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,349
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a difference of four points right there.

975
01:19:21,429 --> 01:19:21,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

976
01:19:28,154 --> 01:19:31,016
[SPEAKER_00]: In fairness to the ref that made the calls, a very good ref.

977
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:34,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was right there on that pick.

978
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe he didn't.

979
01:19:37,876 --> 01:19:41,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he had a better angle to it, but as you can see in the replay, it was all ball.

980
01:19:42,019 --> 01:19:42,640
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all ball.

981
01:19:45,963 --> 01:19:48,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, the postman, Simmons, giving us great replay action.

982
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:53,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then Brock did, most importantly, two early fouls to stop the fourth quarter here.

983
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:54,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good.

984
01:19:56,652 --> 01:19:57,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Two-point boxer lead.

985
01:19:57,752 --> 01:19:58,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Long bomb.

986
01:19:59,454 --> 01:20:00,114
[SPEAKER_00]: In and out.

987
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mark has been really cold here in the second half.

988
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses takes the long bomb, good.

989
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:15,583
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Cambridge's first lead of the ball game and Moses.

990
01:20:15,783 --> 01:20:16,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Moses all money.

991
01:20:17,064 --> 01:20:17,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, heating up.

992
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:26,773
[SPEAKER_01]: They gotta try to get somebody in his face when he shoots that three.

993
01:20:27,234 --> 01:20:28,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockton needs a shot here.

994
01:20:38,218 --> 01:20:39,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton working it around.

995
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,820
[SPEAKER_00]: That got hammered.

996
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:46,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And I almost thought that was going to call that.

997
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:47,601
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a late call.

998
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:48,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Late call.

999
01:20:48,502 --> 01:20:51,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But nice decision by Spahn.

1000
01:20:51,543 --> 01:20:54,344
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the three here by Moses, who's heating up.

1001
01:20:55,124 --> 01:21:03,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the other end, Forts is able to go to the hoop and draw the foul and has a chance to get Brockton back the lead.

1002
01:21:03,267 --> 01:21:03,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1003
01:21:03,807 --> 01:21:07,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Orlando, somebody for Brockton has to get in.

1004
01:21:08,481 --> 01:21:12,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses' face from way out there, because he can hit those with ease.

1005
01:21:13,442 --> 01:21:15,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when the adrenaline is flowing.

1006
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:17,843
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to help him.

1007
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Brock needs to take advantage here in the fourth quarter.

1008
01:21:21,144 --> 01:21:24,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Every chance they get to go to the free throw line, they need to make these free throws.

1009
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:31,667
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the freshman coming in the game for Lambert.

1010
01:21:35,828 --> 01:21:36,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Beltran.

1011
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:41,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure Lambert's arrest is going to be very briefly.

1012
01:21:46,761 --> 01:21:48,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And he makes his second free throw attempt.

1013
01:21:49,942 --> 01:21:50,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Tie game.

1014
01:21:55,183 --> 01:21:55,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and park.

1015
01:21:56,264 --> 01:21:57,364
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a good move.

1016
01:21:57,724 --> 01:21:59,445
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sweet move that time.

1017
01:21:59,505 --> 01:21:59,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1018
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:00,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Dazeer.

1019
01:22:00,865 --> 01:22:04,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, by the transfer, Dazeer from New Mission.

1020
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Won a state championship last year for New Mission.

1021
01:22:06,887 --> 01:22:08,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Now doing work for the Cambridge Falcons.

1022
01:22:10,965 --> 01:22:16,348
[SPEAKER_01]: and Africo drives to the basket and it's rejected.

1023
01:22:16,889 --> 01:22:22,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see the replay there, Desair, Desair with a nice move, all net, that was beauty.

1024
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:28,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and pop.

1025
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,377
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be a bad ball.

1026
01:22:32,638 --> 01:22:34,479
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be Cambridge's ball.

1027
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:40,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice hustle by the big man, number 10, O'Keir trying to get the offensive boards.

1028
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:47,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And this young Brockton team with all underclassmen but one out there.

1029
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:50,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gonna call a blocking foul.

1030
01:22:50,155 --> 01:22:50,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's okay.

1031
01:22:50,955 --> 01:22:51,635
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a senior.

1032
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,135
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the only one, only senior that's been playing.

1033
01:22:56,776 --> 01:22:58,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see the replay again.

1034
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:01,037
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a suspect foul as well.

1035
01:23:01,097 --> 01:23:02,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he has his position.

1036
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:03,677
[SPEAKER_00]: He just got ran over.

1037
01:23:04,977 --> 01:23:06,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and his feet was planted.

1038
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:08,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Brockton's not getting the calls in.

1039
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:12,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's almost like they can't play defense, boss.

1040
01:23:12,983 --> 01:23:15,325
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get too close, you're going to get called for a foul.

1041
01:23:16,045 --> 01:23:16,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Cambridge.

1042
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:19,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Nazir spins.

1043
01:23:20,969 --> 01:23:21,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Gets it back to Moses.

1044
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:24,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses goes in the paint.

1045
01:23:25,152 --> 01:23:25,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Pops.

1046
01:23:25,893 --> 01:23:26,333
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

1047
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:28,074
[SPEAKER_01]: What a rebound that time by the curve.

1048
01:23:28,134 --> 01:23:29,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound by the senior.

1049
01:23:30,116 --> 01:23:30,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And here come the boxers.

1050
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:31,997
[SPEAKER_01]: In the corner.

1051
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:33,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Cody right back in the game.

1052
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:37,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Shakes, fakes.

1053
01:23:37,641 --> 01:23:37,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do that.

1054
01:23:39,331 --> 01:23:39,931
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a foul.

1055
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:43,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's all over him.

1056
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:47,517
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a push right there, and again, he doesn't like that.

1057
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:51,680
[SPEAKER_00]: And again.

1058
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And Apatow gets in his face.

1059
01:23:54,522 --> 01:23:55,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know what?

1060
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,044
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't like the push.

1061
01:23:57,444 --> 01:23:58,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Plain and simple.

1062
01:23:58,505 --> 01:23:59,746
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowing one team.

1063
01:23:59,766 --> 01:24:00,346
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the replay here.

1064
01:24:00,366 --> 01:24:01,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.

1065
01:24:01,307 --> 01:24:04,549
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowing one team to play one way, but you're not allowing the other team to play.

1066
01:24:04,569 --> 01:24:05,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happened.

1067
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's going to happen.

1068
01:24:10,148 --> 01:24:13,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically tackling him.

1069
01:24:13,989 --> 01:24:20,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to call it a double technical, but you're allowing one team to play one way, but you're not allowing the other team to play.

1070
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happened.

1071
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:21,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to happen.

1072
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,990
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the referee.

1073
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1074
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:24,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.

1075
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:25,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with you on that.

1076
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:32,312
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Procter wants to play physical too, you know?

1077
01:24:32,492 --> 01:24:32,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1078
01:24:33,052 --> 01:24:35,773
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got suspect calls where they just

1079
01:24:36,953 --> 01:24:39,995
[SPEAKER_00]: running over the Brockton player, a clean strip.

1080
01:24:40,496 --> 01:24:41,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And no call.

1081
01:24:41,796 --> 01:24:42,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And no call.

1082
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,618
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.

1083
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to sound like a homer.

1084
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:51,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to call it the same way.

1085
01:24:51,443 --> 01:24:52,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it fair.

1086
01:24:58,728 --> 01:25:03,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crowd right now is really not liking this referee and crew right now.

1087
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:12,581
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Cambridge foul, we have to mention on that, but double technicals, I believe.

1088
01:25:12,601 --> 01:25:17,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And the foul was on Correa.

1089
01:25:20,902 --> 01:25:25,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to fight Nadia, but I like... Yeah, it's also a Brock's fault.

1090
01:25:25,563 --> 01:25:32,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the defense of you coming to your player, but try to keep your calm and try to win this game.

1091
01:25:32,924 --> 01:25:34,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Africa has got to keep his calm.

1092
01:25:34,225 --> 01:25:35,085
[SPEAKER_00]: They need him out there.

1093
01:25:35,105 --> 01:25:35,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they need him, definitely.

1094
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:44,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a timeout, 5.47 on the clock.

1095
01:25:45,434 --> 01:25:46,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Very intense game.

1096
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:51,198
[SPEAKER_00]: This game is taking another turn here in the fourth quarter here.

1097
01:25:52,099 --> 01:25:53,921
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a fight to the finish with 5.47 left.

1098
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:57,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And the referee is going to have to do their job to keep control of this game.

1099
01:26:00,378 --> 01:26:09,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, like you said, Orlando, there's been some pretty physical contact by Cambridge, and there's no fouls, but when Brockton

1100
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,581
[SPEAKER_01]: comes and gets physical and met with that steal.

1101
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:15,902
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no physicality there.

1102
01:26:15,922 --> 01:26:17,603
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to call a tap foul.

1103
01:26:17,643 --> 01:26:26,167
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you something right now, and to Brock's defense, that strip of Pereira and the foul call, that has changed this game.

1104
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:34,611
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about going the other way and having a five-point lead to possibly giving the other team a chance to tie the game.

1105
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:41,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Brockton foul will put him in the bonus.

1106
01:26:42,174 --> 01:26:44,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cambridge has three here in the fourth quarter.

1107
01:26:52,058 --> 01:26:55,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crowd has gotten into this game as well.

1108
01:26:55,039 --> 01:27:03,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Well with the way Brockton played in that first half, the crowd has definitely helped them.

1109
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:08,790
[SPEAKER_01]: and the crowd has backed this boxer team since the tip-off.

1110
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:12,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see how Brockton responds to that fiasco that just happened.

1111
01:27:12,192 --> 01:27:13,073
[SPEAKER_00]: They're down by two.

1112
01:27:15,255 --> 01:27:18,797
[SPEAKER_00]: All possessions right now are really crucial for both teams.

1113
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:19,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Really crucial.

1114
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:24,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Brockton, the free throws would be more crucial for them.

1115
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,046
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go get to the Fonz.

1116
01:27:48,387 --> 01:27:49,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Fonz stops and pops.

1117
01:27:50,268 --> 01:27:51,849
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good look, good pull up.

1118
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:54,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Brock still has it.

1119
01:27:55,652 --> 01:27:57,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, threw it away.

1120
01:27:57,613 --> 01:27:57,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1121
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,801
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna put Cambridge to the line.

1122
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,200
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Orlando, I don't like the call.

1123
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:19,982
[SPEAKER_01]: The guard with the ball was throwing his hands out very aggressively, making the contact.

1124
01:28:20,002 --> 01:28:20,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a replay.

1125
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:23,543
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make the call at home.

1126
01:28:26,503 --> 01:28:26,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1127
01:28:28,644 --> 01:28:29,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Another break for Cambridge.

1128
01:28:32,064 --> 01:28:35,885
[SPEAKER_01]: As Correa, the junior, will go to the free throw line on the bonus.

1129
01:28:46,658 --> 01:28:49,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now Brockton only 12 points so far in the second half.

1130
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:05,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge gets it back outside on a defense opposite board, excuse me.

1131
01:29:05,684 --> 01:29:05,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

1132
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:09,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Another rebound.

1133
01:29:10,735 --> 01:29:12,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Long bomb is no good.

1134
01:29:13,116 --> 01:29:21,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's gonna be an offensive foul that time, but Cambridge just dominating the boards and making their presence felt down there.

1135
01:29:21,821 --> 01:29:30,406
[SPEAKER_01]: See, Brockton cannot let them get two and three chances on the board, on the offensive end.

1136
01:29:30,486 --> 01:29:32,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they got a tough order to fill here, but.

1137
01:29:34,908 --> 01:29:37,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, this is a big possession right now for the Boxers.

1138
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:37,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1139
01:29:51,147 --> 01:29:54,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockman still has a little spin move in the knee, and it's blocked.

1140
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:57,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Transition for Cambridge.

1141
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:01,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a foul.

1142
01:30:02,095 --> 01:30:04,436
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like the freshman got hammered out down there.

1143
01:30:04,456 --> 01:30:05,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no call.

1144
01:30:05,977 --> 01:30:07,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go again the other way.

1145
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:08,899
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of bodies back there.

1146
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:12,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your replay.

1147
01:30:16,271 --> 01:30:21,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Peltrop looked like he was hammered, but no call.

1148
01:30:22,013 --> 01:30:26,214
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a tough second half for these young boxers.

1149
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:29,395
[SPEAKER_01]: In and out.

1150
01:30:31,355 --> 01:30:37,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshman's gonna take a seat, and Peltrop and Pereira's gonna come in the game, who's been big tonight for Brockton.

1151
01:30:48,488 --> 01:30:53,132
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Howard at the free throw line, makes his second free throw attempt.

1152
01:30:54,534 --> 01:30:55,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge up by four.

1153
01:30:57,496 --> 01:31:00,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton hasn't got a field goal in a great while.

1154
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:01,560
[SPEAKER_00]: They need one.

1155
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:05,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Need a shot here.

1156
01:31:10,408 --> 01:31:11,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, contact.

1157
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:12,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And one!

1158
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:14,532
[SPEAKER_01]: No good, he's gonna call it before he's shot it.

1159
01:31:15,705 --> 01:31:16,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1160
01:31:16,506 --> 01:31:21,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's still going to go to the line to shoot two, because Cambridge is going to be in the bonus, I believe.

1161
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, yes, that's the fifth foul.

1162
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:25,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxers will be in the bonus.

1163
01:31:25,192 --> 01:31:26,253
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a good call.

1164
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:27,874
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get continuation in high school.

1165
01:31:30,016 --> 01:31:30,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Knee D2.

1166
01:31:31,077 --> 01:31:31,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Knee D2.

1167
01:31:32,638 --> 01:31:33,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Freak those right here, Miles.

1168
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:35,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, Pierre the Junior.

1169
01:31:37,502 --> 01:31:37,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo-hoo.

1170
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,432
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been perfect from the line.

1171
01:31:42,153 --> 01:31:43,313
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good free throw shooter.

1172
01:31:43,693 --> 01:31:46,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 14 points tonight for the sophomore.

1173
01:31:47,315 --> 01:31:48,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming off the bench.

1174
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:01,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be Brockton ball, and it is.

1175
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice hustle there by number 10, O'Kara.

1176
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:12,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Missed free throw, Brockton stays with the offensive board and able to get the possession.

1177
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:17,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Timeout.

1178
01:32:18,106 --> 01:32:22,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Coach Barrow calls a timeout with 4.15 on the clock here in the fourth quarter.

1179
01:32:23,048 --> 01:32:25,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge up by three, Orlando.

1180
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:26,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a struggle here in the second half.

1181
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:28,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it real here for Brockton.

1182
01:32:29,852 --> 01:32:46,370
[SPEAKER_00]: with that being said they're only down by three and uh so one possession game so in position to win this game even though the struggles of the second half uh miles yeah brockton these last four minutes they got to make shots and they cannot turn the ball over

1183
01:32:47,235 --> 01:32:51,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third thing is, if they get to the free throw line, they gotta make their free throws.

1184
01:32:51,618 --> 01:32:51,898
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a must.

1185
01:32:51,978 --> 01:32:53,179
[SPEAKER_01]: On this tough Cambridge team.

1186
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:58,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Brockton has gone ice cold here in the second half from three-point range.

1187
01:32:58,702 --> 01:32:59,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need a big one.

1188
01:33:00,003 --> 01:33:01,504
[SPEAKER_00]: They need one from the distance.

1189
01:33:02,044 --> 01:33:05,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're down by three, so this could be big.

1190
01:33:05,486 --> 01:33:08,968
[SPEAKER_00]: This possession, this three-pointer right here could be the calling card here.

1191
01:33:09,028 --> 01:33:11,630
[SPEAKER_00]: But been a struggle here in the second half.

1192
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:13,391
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been cold from outside.

1193
01:33:14,071 --> 01:33:16,753
[SPEAKER_01]: They really haven't hit that shot like they did in that first half.

1194
01:33:18,923 --> 01:33:21,204
[SPEAKER_01]: but we still got four minutes, 15 seconds left.

1195
01:33:21,744 --> 01:33:22,625
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot can happen.

1196
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:26,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Boxer's trying to come out of here with an upset.

1197
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:33,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Cambridge has outscored Brockton here in the second half, 25-13 to take this three-point lead.

1198
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:41,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, Brockton, early into the season, struggles in the second half has been real.

1199
01:33:42,095 --> 01:33:47,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can win this game, this can come a long way to fixing that second half woes.

1200
01:33:53,498 --> 01:33:54,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here we go.

1201
01:33:55,779 --> 01:33:57,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Brock has the ball.

1202
01:34:07,163 --> 01:34:07,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Out there to Africa.

1203
01:34:08,183 --> 01:34:14,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gonna call travel.

1204
01:34:15,246 --> 01:34:16,106
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked up his feet.

1205
01:34:16,706 --> 01:34:19,007
[SPEAKER_00]: He got caught in no man's land and nowhere to go now.

1206
01:34:19,627 --> 01:34:20,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Going the other way.

1207
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:21,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Another turnover for the Boxers.

1208
01:34:31,418 --> 01:34:32,059
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Howard.

1209
01:34:36,362 --> 01:34:36,883
[SPEAKER_01]: DeZear.

1210
01:34:39,685 --> 01:34:41,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes to the draft, drives, blocked.

1211
01:34:41,486 --> 01:34:42,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good defense.

1212
01:34:42,807 --> 01:34:43,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a foul, no call.

1213
01:34:44,449 --> 01:34:46,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, Howard down for the Cambridge Falcons.

1214
01:34:47,331 --> 01:34:47,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And a turnover.

1215
01:34:48,612 --> 01:34:50,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And here comes Moses, the senior.

1216
01:34:51,615 --> 01:34:53,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And, oh, come on, he had his.

1217
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:55,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a good call.

1218
01:34:55,629 --> 01:34:56,049
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call.

1219
01:34:56,069 --> 01:34:56,930
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call.

1220
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:59,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, he did not plant his feet.

1221
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:03,054
[SPEAKER_00]: But however, we saw a foul not get called.

1222
01:35:03,134 --> 01:35:04,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see the replay here.

1223
01:35:04,635 --> 01:35:06,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't look like Pereira planted his feet.

1224
01:35:06,256 --> 01:35:07,337
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get a replay on that.

1225
01:35:07,377 --> 01:35:10,439
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was planted.

1226
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,101
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have been miles.

1227
01:35:13,181 --> 01:35:15,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looked like he was planted.

1228
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:21,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And Moses was coming in full steam.

1229
01:35:23,491 --> 01:35:30,476
[SPEAKER_00]: You called it, Miles, but it looked like, for the replay, it looked like he did play it to his feet, but again, turnovers.

1230
01:35:31,396 --> 01:35:33,458
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hurting Brockton, killing Brockton right now.

1231
01:35:43,384 --> 01:35:45,705
[SPEAKER_01]: This Paris Moses is a pure shooter.

1232
01:35:49,027 --> 01:35:49,668
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been, uh,

1233
01:35:51,384 --> 01:35:53,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Story here in the second half.

1234
01:35:54,526 --> 01:35:55,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Paris Moses.

1235
01:35:57,587 --> 01:35:58,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Three-throw attempt missed.

1236
01:35:58,668 --> 01:35:59,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebound, Foxes.

1237
01:36:02,669 --> 01:36:03,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Africo.

1238
01:36:05,471 --> 01:36:05,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

1239
01:36:06,671 --> 01:36:14,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Africo has been sluggish with the ball of his last few possessions, and he's getting caught in a no-man's land, and it's forcing turnovers.

1240
01:36:14,415 --> 01:36:15,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just can't do that.

1241
01:36:16,816 --> 01:36:20,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a sophomore, but you've got to be smart.

1242
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:31,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Damon's slowing things down up for him.

1243
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,480
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Dazeer with the ball.

1244
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:38,281
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running down the shot clock.

1245
01:36:43,724 --> 01:36:44,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Dazeer.

1246
01:36:48,626 --> 01:36:49,307
[SPEAKER_01]: In the corner.

1247
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:50,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Good!

1248
01:36:51,147 --> 01:36:51,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1249
01:36:52,088 --> 01:36:53,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, set up by Dazeer.

1250
01:36:54,529 --> 01:36:55,770
[SPEAKER_00]: With the dribble, kick out.

1251
01:36:56,836 --> 01:37:02,027
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline three point of Falcons extends the lead to seven and Brockton's in trouble.

1252
01:37:03,312 --> 01:37:05,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, just tough break for Brockton.

1253
01:37:05,493 --> 01:37:08,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Good pass into the corner, to his teammate in the corner.

1254
01:37:09,435 --> 01:37:11,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did what Cambridge does.

1255
01:37:11,496 --> 01:37:12,816
[SPEAKER_01]: They hit that outside shot.

1256
01:37:12,836 --> 01:37:14,777
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been hitting him in this second half, Orlando.

1257
01:37:14,797 --> 01:37:15,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you saw it.

1258
01:37:15,598 --> 01:37:16,098
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw it.

1259
01:37:16,118 --> 01:37:18,339
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew what he was going to do the whole time.

1260
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:19,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting for the guy to come up.

1261
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the guy baseline.

1262
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice kick out.

1263
01:37:22,701 --> 01:37:25,322
[SPEAKER_00]: And able to make it all net in Cambridge.

1264
01:37:25,982 --> 01:37:26,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1265
01:37:27,143 --> 01:37:27,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Up 7.

1266
01:37:30,343 --> 01:37:33,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge again, coming in here with three wins, one loss.

1267
01:37:33,984 --> 01:37:40,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And your Brockton boxers coming in here with one win and four losses, trying to give the fans a win.

1268
01:37:40,985 --> 01:37:42,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've really been hustling hard.

1269
01:37:43,345 --> 01:37:46,426
[SPEAKER_01]: But a little bit too many turnovers, it's really hurt them.

1270
01:37:46,866 --> 01:37:53,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a 60-53 game, there's a little bit less than three minutes left, 2.57 to be exact.

1271
01:37:53,707 --> 01:37:57,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton can still get into, you know, you gotta do something in the office event.

1272
01:37:59,527 --> 01:38:03,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make a shot here, you're still in the game.

1273
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:04,530
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a three possession game.

1274
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:05,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot of time left.

1275
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:06,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a lot of time.

1276
01:38:07,812 --> 01:38:09,873
[SPEAKER_01]: But now Brockton has to make shots.

1277
01:38:10,013 --> 01:38:12,614
[SPEAKER_01]: When they have the ball, come down the court, they gotta make shots.

1278
01:38:12,634 --> 01:38:13,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta make shots.

1279
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:15,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Cambridge is making their shots.

1280
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:19,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now Cambridge feels the momentum.

1281
01:38:20,799 --> 01:38:23,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this crowd has been greeted by a great game here.

1282
01:38:24,201 --> 01:38:25,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they've gotten their money's worth this evening.

1283
01:38:40,053 --> 01:38:44,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge is gonna make Brockton work the ball coming up.

1284
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:00,672
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cambridge, a very tough defense.

1285
01:39:00,732 --> 01:39:03,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton did not find an open shot here.

1286
01:39:03,253 --> 01:39:04,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Ports with the ball.

1287
01:39:07,056 --> 01:39:07,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Lambe!

1288
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:09,538
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you need!

1289
01:39:10,138 --> 01:39:13,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton's first three-pointer in the second half, and that was a big one.

1290
01:39:13,221 --> 01:39:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, I can't believe that first three-pointer in the first, second half, excuse me.

1291
01:39:17,944 --> 01:39:18,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But they needed that one.

1292
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:27,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and pop inside.

1293
01:39:27,231 --> 01:39:27,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what a shot.

1294
01:39:28,677 --> 01:39:30,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard answers for the Falcons.

1295
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:38,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Six point, Cambridge lead.

1296
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:42,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Going away, here comes Cambridge.

1297
01:39:43,524 --> 01:39:44,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Long three, no good.

1298
01:39:45,225 --> 01:39:51,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice position by number 15 underneath the boards, Correa with the easy two.

1299
01:39:55,671 --> 01:39:58,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And again off another Brockton turnover unfortunately.

1300
01:39:59,737 --> 01:40:03,998
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're gonna call a foul on Paris Moses.

1301
01:40:05,278 --> 01:40:07,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a tale of two halves, Miles, unfortunately.

1302
01:40:08,339 --> 01:40:13,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight point, Cameron's lead at the moment with one minute, 38 seconds on the clock.

1303
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:21,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Fonts will go to the free throw line, and like I said, in the fourth quarter, you gotta make the free throw.

1304
01:40:22,001 --> 01:40:25,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock has been outscored 33 to 16 here in the second half.

1305
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,340
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is good.

1306
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:45,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if Brockton is going to go to a full court press here, down by seven at this point, if Marquez can make this shot and make it a two possession.

1307
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:50,906
[SPEAKER_01]: And second free throw is good.

1308
01:40:50,926 --> 01:40:52,647
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're going to do that.

1309
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:55,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little pressure on the Falcons.

1310
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:08,405
[SPEAKER_00]: almost had to steal it'll be falcons ball surprise procter to go to that earlier

1311
01:41:35,138 --> 01:41:36,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, upright here.

1312
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:44,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Desire gave him an elbow and they're gonna call a defensive foul.

1313
01:41:44,122 --> 01:41:45,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four initiated the contact.

1314
01:41:45,303 --> 01:41:48,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the replay, tough break for the Boxers.

1315
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:05,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed this Cambridge team, they're all good free throw shooters.

1316
01:42:05,634 --> 01:42:08,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good shooters, good ball handlers.

1317
01:42:09,615 --> 01:42:12,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good team, very impressive, Cambridge Falcons.

1318
01:42:17,276 --> 01:42:18,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, you chased them off.

1319
01:42:23,258 --> 01:42:23,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta make this.

1320
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:34,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a case like that, if you're the offense that's shooting at three and you're down by six, seven points, you gotta follow your shot.

1321
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,281
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to.

1322
01:42:37,922 --> 01:42:39,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're in desperate times right now.

1323
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:42,904
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Brockton will inbound the ball.

1324
01:42:42,924 --> 01:42:43,545
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Fonts.

1325
01:42:46,807 --> 01:42:47,667
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a push.

1326
01:42:48,387 --> 01:42:49,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshman will go to the line.

1327
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:54,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Peltrick will go to the free throw line.

1328
01:43:07,644 --> 01:43:11,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the freshman will shoot bonus.

1329
01:43:11,087 --> 01:43:14,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if he makes the first free throw tip, he'll get another one.

1330
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:16,811
[SPEAKER_00]: A stroke by the freshman.

1331
01:43:26,162 --> 01:43:30,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's automatic two at the free throw line for the freshman.

1332
01:43:35,248 --> 01:43:35,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And he makes the throw.

1333
01:43:35,888 --> 01:43:37,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stroke.

1334
01:43:37,929 --> 01:43:39,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Brocker gonna come with the full court press here.

1335
01:43:51,698 --> 01:43:53,099
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a foul on Cambridge.

1336
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brocker should go to the line.

1337
01:43:56,292 --> 01:43:57,533
[SPEAKER_00]: beat a freshman again in Brockton.

1338
01:43:57,573 --> 01:43:59,695
[SPEAKER_00]: He was hammered underneath.

1339
01:43:59,715 --> 01:44:01,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, see the replay here.

1340
01:44:01,656 --> 01:44:02,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1341
01:44:03,277 --> 01:44:06,440
[SPEAKER_00]: The freshman's gonna go to the other end to cut it to a one possession.

1342
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,241
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two big free throws coming up.

1343
01:44:08,261 --> 01:44:09,882
[SPEAKER_00]: This game is not over, ladies and gentlemen.

1344
01:44:12,845 --> 01:44:20,631
[SPEAKER_00]: You see on that play, uncharacteristically, Moses, I felt like he should've pulled that ball out, up five.

1345
01:44:21,191 --> 01:44:21,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.

1346
01:44:21,912 --> 01:44:23,012
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he goes to the hoop and take

1347
01:44:24,153 --> 01:44:29,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Reckless shot and Brockton able to get the rebound and as you say, Beltrop gets hammered.

1348
01:44:29,655 --> 01:44:33,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Gets a chance to go to line for two big free throws here for the boxers.

1349
01:44:36,218 --> 01:44:37,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to give it to Fonts.

1350
01:44:37,618 --> 01:44:42,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fonts will shoot the free throws.

1351
01:44:51,912 --> 01:44:57,174
[SPEAKER_00]: actually it was Forts who went to the line, I'm sorry and misses the free throw, that's huge.

1352
01:44:57,514 --> 01:45:00,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Forts gotta make these free throws.

1353
01:45:04,658 --> 01:45:05,218
[SPEAKER_01]: There he goes.

1354
01:45:05,238 --> 01:45:10,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a four point lead with about a minute to go in this ball game.

1355
01:45:12,301 --> 01:45:14,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton applying pressure in the backcourt.

1356
01:45:21,066 --> 01:45:22,347
[SPEAKER_01]: and the shot is good.

1357
01:45:22,447 --> 01:45:25,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the problem there, if you're gonna foul him, you gotta foul him.

1358
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:27,111
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't give him the continuation.

1359
01:45:27,652 --> 01:45:32,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, that's a big hoop right there, and he has a chance to put it to a three possession game.

1360
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:36,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has his backs really against the wall right now.

1361
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, missed free throws.

1362
01:45:39,421 --> 01:45:41,343
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Correa at the free throw line.

1363
01:45:42,744 --> 01:45:45,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's a solid free throw shooter, by the way.

1364
01:45:45,366 --> 01:45:46,887
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been outstanding tonight.

1365
01:45:47,308 --> 01:45:49,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath, a lot of boards, Correa.

1366
01:45:50,862 --> 01:45:51,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Big for Cambridge.

1367
01:45:51,562 --> 01:45:53,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not sure how many shots he made.

1368
01:45:54,183 --> 01:45:56,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you jinxed him.

1369
01:45:56,363 --> 01:45:58,544
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's got a number of quiet points.

1370
01:46:00,684 --> 01:46:02,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Foxes stop and pop.

1371
01:46:02,925 --> 01:46:03,425
[SPEAKER_01]: No good.

1372
01:46:08,686 --> 01:46:09,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Moses.

1373
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:15,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Falcons.

1374
01:46:15,888 --> 01:46:17,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Foxes got a foul here, they do.

1375
01:46:19,678 --> 01:46:20,879
[SPEAKER_01]: With 28 seconds left.

1376
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand.

1377
01:46:24,062 --> 01:46:25,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know a coach can run out on the court like this.

1378
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:29,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why is he out on the court like this?

1379
01:46:29,267 --> 01:46:29,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1380
01:46:29,547 --> 01:46:33,071
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know a coach can run out on half court in the middle of a play.

1381
01:46:33,551 --> 01:46:35,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after the whistle was blown, he's out on half court.

1382
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:37,695
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules have changed, I think.

1383
01:46:38,175 --> 01:46:41,939
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's not happy with something.

1384
01:46:44,663 --> 01:46:46,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Coach wants to come and sit down where we're at.

1385
01:46:46,765 --> 01:46:47,485
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not happy.

1386
01:46:47,686 --> 01:46:50,208
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, his adrenaline is up high.

1387
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:51,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's mad at his team.

1388
01:46:51,929 --> 01:46:52,209
[SPEAKER_01]: He is.

1389
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:55,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they weren't patient.

1390
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:56,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold the ball.

1391
01:46:56,413 --> 01:46:58,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what he's referring to.

1392
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:00,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's OK, right?

1393
01:47:00,797 --> 01:47:01,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1394
01:47:01,077 --> 01:47:07,182
[SPEAKER_00]: He's mad at his team, but can't run out of court, Coach Rodriguez.

1395
01:47:12,872 --> 01:47:14,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Boxer's gotta get a quick two.

1396
01:47:16,455 --> 01:47:17,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Lambert, no good.

1397
01:47:19,337 --> 01:47:28,725
[SPEAKER_01]: They need that one to fall.

1398
01:47:28,765 --> 01:47:29,686
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 seconds on the clock.

1399
01:47:30,867 --> 01:47:32,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Africo will go to the free throw line.

1400
01:47:32,829 --> 01:47:36,172
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately it looks like Boxer's gonna come short.

1401
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:38,761
[SPEAKER_00]: but not without a great effort.

1402
01:47:39,421 --> 01:47:40,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you something right now, Miles.

1403
01:47:41,782 --> 01:47:45,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Get these young boxers now, because going further, they're going to be a problem.

1404
01:47:45,924 --> 01:47:46,205
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?

1405
01:47:47,485 --> 01:47:48,526
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a very young team.

1406
01:47:48,646 --> 01:47:49,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1407
01:47:49,246 --> 01:47:49,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Very young.

1408
01:47:49,726 --> 01:47:58,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And have fun with them now, because going towards the future, this is going to be a very good group for these young boxers.

1409
01:48:07,735 --> 01:48:09,796
[SPEAKER_00]: The softbore, shoot two.

1410
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:12,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot crowdside to foul out now.

1411
01:48:20,478 --> 01:48:23,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And he makes his free throw attempt.

1412
01:48:23,939 --> 01:48:27,920
[SPEAKER_01]: First free throw attempt.

1413
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,560
[SPEAKER_01]: 10.8 on the clock.

1414
01:48:32,681 --> 01:48:36,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Foxes with a gutty effort trying to upset these

1415
01:48:38,411 --> 01:48:40,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge Ranch Falcons.

1416
01:48:45,301 --> 01:48:47,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And Coach Rodriguez will call a time out.

1417
01:48:47,024 --> 01:48:50,629
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to see no mistakes here, no turnovers like a good coach would do.

1418
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get out of here with a victory.

1419
01:48:52,932 --> 01:48:54,034
[SPEAKER_00]: No mistakes here with 10 seconds.

1420
01:49:03,681 --> 01:49:06,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge is going to walk out of here with a victory, but they know.

1421
01:49:06,643 --> 01:49:07,463
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a tough victory.

1422
01:49:07,483 --> 01:49:08,404
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tough one.

1423
01:49:08,444 --> 01:49:09,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Very tough.

1424
01:49:09,605 --> 01:49:10,366
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't expect this.

1425
01:49:10,386 --> 01:49:12,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Brockton really gave them a run for their money.

1426
01:49:13,388 --> 01:49:19,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the Brockton, like I stated earlier, Miles, a lot, a lot of other classmates, freshmen, sophomores.

1427
01:49:22,197 --> 01:49:23,598
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's a young team.

1428
01:49:23,718 --> 01:49:26,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Young team going up against a veteran team.

1429
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:32,123
[SPEAKER_01]: This Cambridge Falcon team, veterans, all juniors and seniors.

1430
01:49:32,183 --> 01:49:35,605
[SPEAKER_00]: The second half wasn't great for Brockton, but it wasn't that bad either.

1431
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:41,849
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a step in the right direction, considering how the other second halves have gone in the previous three years.

1432
01:49:43,090 --> 01:49:43,470
[SPEAKER_00]: They're young.

1433
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:44,051
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to learn.

1434
01:49:44,071 --> 01:49:44,911
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get better.

1435
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:48,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good group for Brockton going forward.

1436
01:49:51,493 --> 01:49:53,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.

1437
01:49:53,974 --> 01:49:57,976
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these Brockton fans are pretty sure it would be a different game.

1438
01:49:57,996 --> 01:50:01,317
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying it would be a different game if we had different referees as well.

1439
01:50:01,337 --> 01:50:06,719
[SPEAKER_01]: The referees kind of let this game get out of control a little bit because of their calls and non-calls.

1440
01:50:06,739 --> 01:50:08,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And they almost lost it.

1441
01:50:10,981 --> 01:50:17,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But Cambridge benefited from the referees.

1442
01:50:18,884 --> 01:50:19,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

1443
01:50:21,723 --> 01:50:22,083
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight.

1444
01:50:26,227 --> 01:50:27,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be Cambridge ball.

1445
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:32,933
[SPEAKER_01]: 68-63.

1446
01:50:32,993 --> 01:50:42,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick foul by Brogdon.

1447
01:50:44,745 --> 01:51:05,633
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about making free throws right about making these free throws for the Cambridge Falcons done an excellent job all all game making their free throws I Think they've only missed a couple Coach Rodriguez a geo they call him coach geo Excellent coach good good staff.

1448
01:51:05,673 --> 01:51:07,653
[SPEAKER_00]: He has here for the Falcons in out.

1449
01:51:07,694 --> 01:51:08,774
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be a

1450
01:51:10,218 --> 01:51:13,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Good team going forward here in 2025.

1451
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:19,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Ferman, a junior at the free throw line, misses his first free throw attempt.

1452
01:51:26,066 --> 01:51:27,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, misses both, gotta go here, gotta go.

1453
01:51:30,248 --> 01:51:31,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Cody!

1454
01:51:31,228 --> 01:51:31,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Good!

1455
01:51:32,569 --> 01:51:33,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow!

1456
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:34,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And now!

1457
01:51:36,253 --> 01:51:37,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, the whistle blew.

1458
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:38,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hold the brakes here.

1459
01:51:39,215 --> 01:51:42,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold the brakes here because... Are they going to back that time up or no?

1460
01:51:42,898 --> 01:51:44,799
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to back up some time here.

1461
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:45,940
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought.

1462
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:48,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Three seconds.

1463
01:51:50,844 --> 01:51:52,265
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to give him four seconds?

1464
01:51:52,365 --> 01:51:59,690
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to give him four seconds and hold the brakes here because with that shot by Cody, this game is not over, ladies and gentlemen.

1465
01:52:01,352 --> 01:52:04,354
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be four point seconds and Brock is going to have to foul.

1466
01:52:08,566 --> 01:52:14,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, if Cambridge hits both free throws, it's probably a wrap, right?

1467
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:18,173
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they miss one, if they're Cambridge, do you foul?

1468
01:52:18,673 --> 01:52:18,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1469
01:52:18,914 --> 01:52:23,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what happens here.

1470
01:52:23,037 --> 01:52:28,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton has made it very, very interesting in these last seconds of this ball.

1471
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Last 10 seconds, boxers have not given up.

1472
01:52:33,254 --> 01:52:38,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure Coach DeBaros is saying, okay, look, we're gonna have to foul as quickly as possible.

1473
01:52:39,596 --> 01:52:43,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to force the turnover off the inbound, maybe a five second call.

1474
01:52:44,998 --> 01:52:48,059
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that, we're talking about possibly winning this game, right?

1475
01:52:48,559 --> 01:52:59,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do foul, if they hit one out of two, you gotta have a set play off the possible missed shot or even the inbound.

1476
01:52:59,182 --> 01:53:01,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great job by Cody Lambert, the junior,

1477
01:53:02,591 --> 01:53:04,212
[SPEAKER_01]: with ice water in his vein.

1478
01:53:04,412 --> 01:53:05,233
[SPEAKER_01]: What a big shot, huh?

1479
01:53:05,373 --> 01:53:06,173
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big shot.

1480
01:53:07,074 --> 01:53:08,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big boy shot right there.

1481
01:53:08,695 --> 01:53:10,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inbound right now is very crucial.

1482
01:53:10,857 --> 01:53:16,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think, I believe Cambridge might have one timeout left.

1483
01:53:17,002 --> 01:53:18,283
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the scoreboard says.

1484
01:53:18,783 --> 01:53:21,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.

1485
01:53:21,325 --> 01:53:23,087
[SPEAKER_00]: This inbound is very crucial here.

1486
01:53:23,327 --> 01:53:25,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brockton knows that.

1487
01:53:25,548 --> 01:53:27,330
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent extra defenders in there.

1488
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:29,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, gonna have to foul right away.

1489
01:53:35,262 --> 01:53:36,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach again is on the court.

1490
01:53:48,594 --> 01:53:55,259
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a foul and a... They only lose a couple seconds there.

1491
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:58,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Maria throwing elbows out there.

1492
01:53:58,202 --> 01:53:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1493
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:01,445
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows he was gonna get smothered.

1494
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:04,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Big inbound that time by Cambridge.

1495
01:54:04,831 --> 01:54:07,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't look good, but they was able to do that.

1496
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:12,036
[SPEAKER_00]: And Carrera going to the line for two big shots.

1497
01:54:12,176 --> 01:54:14,378
[SPEAKER_00]: He hits two, it's probably game.

1498
01:54:14,658 --> 01:54:16,219
[SPEAKER_00]: All he needs to do is miss one.

1499
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crowd is into it.

1500
01:54:28,328 --> 01:54:29,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxes have to block out.

1501
01:54:30,129 --> 01:54:31,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask the box out is correct.

1502
01:54:39,148 --> 01:54:39,708
[SPEAKER_00]: misses it.

1503
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:45,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And Coach Barrow, he doesn't have any more timeouts.

1504
01:54:45,891 --> 01:54:46,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

1505
01:54:46,312 --> 01:54:47,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope his players know.

1506
01:54:49,013 --> 01:54:53,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So no timeouts for Brockton and I'm pretty sure he explained that during the huddle.

1507
01:54:53,776 --> 01:54:54,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.

1508
01:54:59,358 --> 01:55:00,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta get a chance to inbound it here.

1509
01:55:01,319 --> 01:55:02,240
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably gonna foul.

1510
01:55:11,138 --> 01:55:14,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the backboard by Florence, nearly setting this game.

1511
01:55:16,586 --> 01:55:19,407
[SPEAKER_01]: If he would have hit that, they would have won that.

1512
01:55:20,227 --> 01:55:23,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they didn't count the extra point, there was 69 to 66.

1513
01:55:24,688 --> 01:55:27,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, what an exciting game, Orlando.

1514
01:55:27,769 --> 01:55:30,730
[SPEAKER_01]: The boxers gave the Falcons a run for their money.

1515
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:39,633
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a couple of counter punches in that last minute or so to bring this game back to 2 point lead, 3 point lead.

1516
01:55:40,711 --> 01:55:41,512
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say about it?

1517
01:55:42,172 --> 01:55:45,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a young team never giving up, and this is what you want.

1518
01:55:45,735 --> 01:55:57,024
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we have to refer to the second half, because Brock had a nine-point lead going into the second half, and also had a three-point lead to stop the fourth quarter.

1519
01:55:57,064 --> 01:56:04,129
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the fight by the young team.

1520
01:56:04,169 --> 01:56:06,431
[SPEAKER_01]: By the young team, they did a good job

1521
01:56:07,455 --> 01:56:10,964
[SPEAKER_01]: They're playing a veteran team and they did the best they could.

1522
01:56:12,122 --> 01:56:16,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, hats off to the Boxers this evening for giving Cambridge a run for their money.

1523
01:56:16,743 --> 01:56:17,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Your last thoughts?

1524
01:56:18,043 --> 01:56:21,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you basically said it all, man.

1525
01:56:21,124 --> 01:56:24,865
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be exciting to watch the Boxers going further with this young team.

1526
01:56:25,245 --> 01:56:27,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like this is the team that's going to get better.

1527
01:56:28,025 --> 01:56:29,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, it's this year.

1528
01:56:30,466 --> 01:56:37,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make a mark in building towards the future, considering what happened last year, Miles.

1529
01:56:37,107 --> 01:56:41,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we have, we'd like to thank our cameraman, Curtis Reese, for doing an excellent job

1530
01:56:42,268 --> 01:56:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Simmons, our producer, Mike the Postman Simmons.

1531
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:45,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

1532
01:56:45,731 --> 01:56:47,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving us great replays.

1533
01:56:47,753 --> 01:56:49,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And Orlando, appreciate you, bro.

1534
01:56:49,634 --> 01:56:50,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

1535
01:56:50,115 --> 01:56:50,435
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1536
01:56:50,475 --> 01:56:51,095
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.

1537
01:56:51,115 --> 01:56:51,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.

1538
01:56:51,496 --> 01:56:52,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy New Year, ladies and gentlemen.

1539
01:56:52,256 --> 01:56:52,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy New Year, everybody.
