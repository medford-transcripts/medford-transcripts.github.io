1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:04,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't take that long and it doesn't cost that much.

2
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:13,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize you're trying to make some money, but I guess this is one of those cases where you gotta spend some money to make some money.

3
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:14,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

4
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:15,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

5
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you tell me, she's dressed in pink?

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

7
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:21,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,681
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's unfair, you know, bringing along a partner to,

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have a successful event.

10
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:39,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

11
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:44,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just get back in touch with Kevin with those two items and we'll be all set.

12
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:45,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

13
00:00:45,686 --> 00:00:46,606
[SPEAKER_04]: You better say goodbye.

14
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:48,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

15
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:49,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great day.

16
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:05,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

17
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:15,809
[SPEAKER_04]: This is that all day.

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Kickball.

19
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes.

20
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,892
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a turning event.

21
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,833
[SPEAKER_04]: This is October 11th.

22
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:26,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Columbus Day?

23
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:33,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's Columbus Day weekend, but I was actually hoping to see if October 12th, the Sunday was available instead.

24
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:40,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they actually take the whole thing.

25
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:42,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I take, I use all four fields.

26
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:47,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only conflict will be is girls softball, which I think is already in.

27
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:11,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the past the past two years, the softball league has been very nice and has given us the day.

28
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, obviously, that's totally up to them.

29
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:18,418
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I think so Sunday, that's right.

30
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sundays, I think softball doesn't start till 1230.

31
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:27,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, your event's still five o'clock though, right?

32
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:30,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it does go all day.

33
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:38,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't necessarily use all of the fields all day, but I definitely can't give like a set time on which field would be open at what, you know what I mean?

34
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know softball.

35
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:42,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's how it's been in years past.

36
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:47,477
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually just tell softball and they just make sure they don't schedule games that day.

37
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that would be an issue.

38
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Paulette is actually on the call

39
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here.

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.

41
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Shining in.

42
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:00,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be a problem.

43
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,238
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually a practice day more than a game day.

44
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:05,279
[SPEAKER_01]: We have double headers on Saturdays.

45
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure we can work something out.

46
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:08,622
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm always flexible.

47
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:12,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

48
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:13,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, October 12.

49
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:14,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We said right.

50
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:15,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Just Yes.

51
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:16,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

52
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:16,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

53
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions, Laura?

54
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:26,041
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

55
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:28,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Fee is usually $25, right?

56
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:29,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

57
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:32,326
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I paid in the past.

58
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

59
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, any questions?

60
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:41,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Chris.

61
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he just wrote, no issue.

62
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:48,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ms.

63
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:51,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocco, enjoy your day.

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

65
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,611
[SPEAKER_04]: and hope to see you next year, too.

66
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:00,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is year 10, so we'll see.

67
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,593
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be wonderful.

68
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:02,914
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be wonderful.

69
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:03,594
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wonderful.

70
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:05,455
[SPEAKER_04]: We like what you're doing.

71
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:06,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:08,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys very much.

73
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:08,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.

74
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:10,618
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hang on.

75
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:11,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's been doing it.

00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:23,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

80
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:24,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

[SPEAKER_04]: It's all fields, September 1st to October 31st on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from eight to 10.

83
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Fonz, what is he on the call?

84
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:44,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam.

85
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:46,145
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not.

86
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:47,686

[SPEAKER_04]: So... I don't see this camping right

113
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:06,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, we have, yeah, I don't think we have it.

114
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:14,574
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going from August 25th, which is next week, November 15th.

115
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there will be a little bit.

116
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:22,536
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll hit the first weekend.

117
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Although no, sorry, Victor, he only has Monday through Friday, right?

118
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently he needs weekends.

119
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:38,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's only weekends that there'll be a conflict.

120
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:39,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

121
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a repeat.

122
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:42,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, you all right with this?

123
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:45,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

124
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:47,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura?

125
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

126
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:49,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

127
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:58,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe so.

128
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it on the city calendar.

129
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:04,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, they do make changes quite often.

130
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't always tell us about it.

131
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:23,299
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a special meeting today at 11 a.m., but I don't see anything on the calendar for tonight.

132
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,641
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a special meeting at 11 a.m.

133
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,062
[SPEAKER_05]: today, but I don't, yeah, but I don't see one tonight.

134
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:32,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

135
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:34,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

136
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's on the way.

137
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:50,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, let's see.

138
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get two more, right?

139
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:57,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a couple of latecomers, too.

140
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:01,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of them is, you've been waiting for something to get started.

141
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:03,590
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do for you?

142
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:12,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking to go to, I started a program with, I want to say it's in between Netflix

143
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:20,267
[SPEAKER_02]: and then trying to be able to get the use of Morrison Field for training sessions for soccer.

144
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:28,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I have been doing for the last 25 years, I'm the regional manager for a nonprofit organization, which is called FC Stars.

145
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:37,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to be able to make sure that we didn't exclude some of the inner city kids from not being able to play club soccer.

146
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:41,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're giving them an opportunity to be able to do that at a much reduced price.

147
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're only paying a third of what anybody else spends.

148
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:46,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to be able to get the practices.

149
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:56,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We were supposed to get three teams, and unfortunately, I think it's only one team, and then hopefully two teams next spring to be able to play out of this area.

150
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:05,704
[SPEAKER_02]: The person that's coaching the team is actually probably someone that you've dealt with in the past, William Lewis, which is a baseball, he does hockey here in town.

151
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's a, he's gonna be the coach of that team.

152
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking to be able to get more method kits.

153
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:19,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I reached out to the athletic director, which is John Preston and waiting to hear from him.

154
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know from him, but we do have a lot of modeling kits.

155
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:28,079
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some method kits and we have kids that are also from different areas.

156
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking to be able to see if we can get this going.

157
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done this in the past with

158
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of, um, we've been successful where we've had teams here in the past and we were at the high school and we were able to do a lot of different things and it was great.

159
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,893
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the kids went on like the Salve's, uh, Aiden Salve and then Aiden was trying to pick up.

160
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:52,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

161
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, um, and, and it's been, it's been great.

162
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:58,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had a bunch of kids that come from all the method.

163
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:02,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm telling them to restart this all over again and then make sure that we can turn it on and

164
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:12,926
[SPEAKER_02]: have the opportunity to do that.

165
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:14,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're a non-profit organization.

166
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:19,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a 501C designation?

167
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:26,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and I can make sure it's CLI as well.

168
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:32,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a copy of the schedule in front of me, so I have to rely on

169
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:39,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Bailey and his only copy of the schedule.

170
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:40,789
[SPEAKER_05]: My defense, I only got it today.

171
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:43,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I did get it printed out and I got you a copy.

172
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,652
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have a schedule, right?

173
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: online.

174
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:54,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

175
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:55,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I can see it.

176
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:56,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

177
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to Morrison.

178
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Morrison is the one part that we don't have much going on.

179
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,883
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we just give somebody something more for Saturday.

180
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:06,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

181
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one Saturday.

182
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:10,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday was it a Sunday?

183
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:13,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I looked at it.

184
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:16,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was the young lady that just Saturday or Sunday.

185
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:17,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got what day.

186
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:18,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

187
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,675
[SPEAKER_06]: A Sondra drive organization.

188
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

189
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:24,056
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a Saturday.

190
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:24,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

191
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:26,197
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

192
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:26,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday.

193
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:26,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

194
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:50,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no conflict.

195
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing is, what time does it get DACA once you start hitting October 29th?

196
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,207
[SPEAKER_02]: October 27th?

197
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:57,589
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 29th.

198
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:01,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

199
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:04,735
[SPEAKER_02]: October 29th is the next day is homing.

200
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:06,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

201
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And our last game is November 7th.

202
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So you changed it too?

203
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,601
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

204
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:12,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you play your games at?

205
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:13,482
[SPEAKER_02]: In Bedford.

206
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:14,684
[SPEAKER_02]: In Bedford?

207
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:15,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

208
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,385
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing is there's no light.

209
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So sunset for October is 541.

210
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:30,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You think that we, if there's nobody before us, you think we'd be able to come in earlier to be able to offset that?

211
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's nothing, there's nothing on the calendar.

212
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to do like a three to five as it gets darker.

213
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they get out at- At 3.30.

214
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that age group is, what are they?

215
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:48,475
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014, so there'll be 11 years old, right?

216
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to think of, do they get out of school at 2.30, or is it 3 o'clock?

217
00:12:54,338 --> 00:13:02,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you went from 3.30 to 5.30, you'd probably be able to get the season in reasonably.

218
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:08,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the last half hour will probably be just about dark, I would think.

219
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:08,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

220
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

221
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:10,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

222
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:14,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, you know, 5 to 7, we're getting there.

223
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:22,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could in the beginning of September, but once you get into October, you're going to, yeah.

224
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:26,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was more concerned about having someone come in after us.

225
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:30,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, if I, if I do earlier and someone comes in.

226
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:36,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got the whole.

227
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:37,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's no lights.

228
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:38,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

229
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:41,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody's coming in after.

230
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

231
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just, that's just not going to happen.

232
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:44,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

233
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:50,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably our most underutilized park in our portfolio.

234
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that draw by it's actually pretty nice.

235
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They cut the grass.

236
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:54,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

237
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:54,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

238
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:55,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

239
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:56,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.

240
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:57,013
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't get out.

241
00:13:58,214 --> 00:13:58,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get out.

242
00:13:59,154 --> 00:13:59,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

243
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:05,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just going to tell you, you know, we've had some dog issues in the past.

244
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:12,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might want to just check that, you know, and give us a heads up before you start.

245
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:20,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have a great director.

246
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:22,952
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very good.

247
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:28,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll kind of fill in the holes if there are any.

248
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:29,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had that in the past.

249
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:40,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I dealt with that when I was the DOC over in Reading.

250
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:44,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny because it was about conservation land.

251
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did, obviously, I brought a bucket and sand, right?

252
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I sat in front of the board, the Reading board, and they're like, you're not supposed to do that.

253
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's conservation land.

254
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, how long would it take for someone who comes out

255
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,586
[SPEAKER_02]: and covers the whole, because we're not going to be able to play.

256
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:02,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if I've sent you an email, then it becomes a liability.

257
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just on your part, because you haven't done your work, right?

258
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as I mentioned that, that thing was like, you know, and then they covered everything.

259
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I was more worried about liability than that's a big thing.

260
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:16,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about that fourth kid breaking his hand?

261
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what I was concerned about.

262
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,672
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I wanted to take care of it myself.

263
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just an interesting situation.

264
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:33,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we want to do 3.30 to 5.30 or do you want to just look at the sunset times and then just tell me what you want?

265
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if, uh, if you tell me no one's going to be there, I will say great.

266
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:45,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, you know, if you can use the time, the daylight for now, and then if you have to keep on cutting back, if it's okay with you guys, I would be, it will be okay with me.

267
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:49,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start off from the 27th, but today is the 19th.

268
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's next week.

269
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, 19 and seven was 26, right?

270
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,233
[SPEAKER_04]: August 27th, yeah.

271
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's next Wednesday?

272
00:15:58,873 --> 00:15:59,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

273
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:01,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to start next Wednesday.

274
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And why don't we start at 5 to 7?

275
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:11,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you find that it's getting a little dark, let us know that you're going to be there.

276
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:15,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you don't want to issue a second order.

277
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,339
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pain in the butt.

278
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd rather know ahead of time.

279
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,821
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we making from 3 to 7?

280
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,399
[SPEAKER_00]: and giving them the flexibility to go when he wants.

281
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what are we going to do for fee then?

282
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:28,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do a flat fee if you want.

283
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:28,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

284
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:30,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

285
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:31,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

286
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:34,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do like a per day, but what are we charging?

287
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,251
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have to look.

288
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have that stuff at the top of my head anymore.

289
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:46,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually for outside organizations, it's $50 an hour.

290
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

291
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:51,196
[SPEAKER_05]: But I could do a flat fee.

292
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:55,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though it's more hours, I can do $50 a day, I could do $100 a day.

293
00:16:55,621 --> 00:17:01,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would reserve the four hours.

294
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would do a flat fee.

295
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:10,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So you do three to seven, I would just say flat free $100 and figure it's going to be a two hour reservation.

296
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:22,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be $90 to $50.

297
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:27,917
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the outside organizations charge.

298
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:29,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously you guys set the price.

299
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,238
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do a sport fee.

300
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:38,741
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $200 for the whole season, but that usually has to be open for just Method kids and all.

301
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:44,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking that into consideration, you know, cause we got a multiple kids.

302
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:45,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We got other kids from other places.

303
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:46,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

304

[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you put down 19, not me.

00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I meant the LSU that I said.

313
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, when William said he couldn't be there.

[SPEAKER_02]: Is that good?

317
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:20,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you couldn't do Fridays.

318
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the Wednesday, Friday, and then I changed the Wednesday, Thursday.

[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes out to 20 days.

320
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:25,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:35,579
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:54,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Bailey will take care of the rest.

327
00:18:55,835 --> 00:19:00,736

[SPEAKER_00]: 20 days, right?

331
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:03,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:06,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

335
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:09,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're reserving three to seven, right?

336
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:10,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

337
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's your permit, from three to seven.

338
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Utilize it as you will.

339
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't over abuse it.

340
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:24,057
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what we'll do this year.

341
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:30,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now if you get two teams next year, we'll talk about it next year, that's fine.

342
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:30,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

343
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:33,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds great, I really appreciate it.

344
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:35,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, anything else?

345
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Christian, do you have any other questions?

346
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he still there?

347
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:44,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good with this.

348
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,343
[SPEAKER_02]: physically like a copy of it so I can have it with me.

349
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give it to the pro just in case if anybody else.

350
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:07,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, you'll get a you'll get a person, you know, people come in, they're like, Oh, we're supposed to be here.

351
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,449
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be on on our website, you'll be on the calendar.

352
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is also a public view.

353
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you'll have something something you can say, we have this time.

354
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:18,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

355
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So the public can view it that way, or your coach can always pull up and say, here's the calendar, it's here.

356
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:30,573
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I put this in the computer, you'll also get an email with the permit number, with all the dates listed.

357
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:35,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to print that out and have that on you as well, that would be your hard copy of the permit.

358
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:37,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

359
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

360
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,105
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot that we do in Nigeria to be able to have the opportunity because in this country it's pay to play.

361
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can give these kids an opportunity to play in this real thing.

362
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love to be able to give back.

363
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, this is good.

364
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.

365
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:51,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

366
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a Somerville guy, huh?

367
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Cambridge guy.

368
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:55,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we.

369
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:56,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

370
00:20:56,642 --> 00:20:59,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I moved back down the street.

371
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved down the street from Prospect Street, from Prospect Street in Cambridge to Prospect Street in Somerville.

372
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,948
[SPEAKER_02]: But I used to hang out with all the Metro guys when I was growing up.

373
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:08,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

374
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell me about that before we move every book together.

375
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,150
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

376
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,790
Move it inside.

377
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,151
That's great.

378
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:16,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

379
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:16,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

380
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:17,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

381
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us for the next hour.

382
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

383
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Night.

384
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:20,581
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

385
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:25,644
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, the last permit that I see.

386
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:26,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Paulette?

387
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Paulette for MYGS.

388
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:31,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have one.

389
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:32,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

390
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:33,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Paulette.

391
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:33,889
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

392
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well.

393
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,751
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

394
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:37,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too bad.

395
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:44,215
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make you sit for 30 seconds while we

396
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Confer on yourselves.

397
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions?

398
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:50,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I have any information on it.

399
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:52,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Trish, you don't have any information on this?

400
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.

401
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these, yes.

402
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for Paulette's name.

403
00:21:58,702 --> 00:21:59,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Trish?

404
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,584
[SPEAKER_03]: No issues with softball.

405
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:03,986
[SPEAKER_01]: No issues.

406
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Paulette?

407
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:08,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

408
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,651
[SPEAKER_04]: For being so patient and kind and letting that young man go before you,

409
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,312
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.

410
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:17,433
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

411
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:18,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

412
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:20,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have one quick question.

413
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,820
[SPEAKER_01]: We are planning the spooky scrimmage again for this year, but we don't have the date last year.

414
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,822
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to extend it on the day that we did it.

415
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:33,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just throwing that out there now that Kevin, if you don't mind, I'll be back in touch.

416
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:38,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm actually sitting outside of my next meeting to figure out when we're trying to get that done.

417
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:39,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

418
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:49,283
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all set for an additional day.

419
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:50,304
[SPEAKER_04]: You said one day?

420
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:59,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually just a couple hours on one of those days were already permitted because we do the trick-or-treating under the lights at Columbus.

421
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:00,354
[SPEAKER_04]: At Columbus?

422
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:01,796
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Columbus, yeah.

423
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:02,056
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.

424
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

425
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And come out and watch.

426
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:09,460
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun.

427
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that wants to come.

428
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I will.

429
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I will.

430
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should.

431
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:17,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen you in a while.

432
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:18,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Come out and hang.

433
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:22,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do that.

434
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:23,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do that.

435
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:25,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

436
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can go to your next meeting.

437
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:29,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

438
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:30,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait.

439
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,050
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

440
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

441
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good day.

442
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

443
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:40,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

444
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:45,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The one, the one permit that we did not look at was the box and ultimate.

445
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

446
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I, no, there's one more.

447
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:51,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I do this.

448
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just came in today.

449
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're supposed to reject them.

450
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,333
[SPEAKER_04]: because that was a couple of weeks in advance.

451
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:00,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Kate's right here.

452
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:00,894
[SPEAKER_05]: You can.

453
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:01,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here.

454
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,856
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys already know this one.

455
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:10,479
[SPEAKER_08]: You've already approved it for the Royal Park, but this is just the same thing.

456
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

457
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:13,661
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

458
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:14,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

459
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:15,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm great.

460
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:24,187
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a great exhibit the first time around and we had some interest to install it by the slave wall at the Brooks Park.

461
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:29,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So we saw the art and we didn't have any questions.

462
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't think we had any issues with any of the artwork that was done.

463
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually went back, I went back up to the, to the Royal house and I couldn't, I couldn't quite figure out where you guys were going to put it, but I'm sure.

464
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was, it was right along the, that brick wall in the Royal park.

465
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:57,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

466
00:24:58,048 --> 00:24:58,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

467
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:07,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, we had pretty, I think you were unable to make the last meeting because we looked at the odd one meeting.

468
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:07,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

469
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:12,335
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd had the meeting and then she gave me the yeah.

470
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:19,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she sent out an email with no one objected and we just approved it.

471
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:19,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

472
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:20,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

473
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:21,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have to go to it.

474
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

475
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,280
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't miss a meeting.

476
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:29,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're looking to move the installation to just another location.

477
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:33,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

478
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:41,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the Brooks Park on Grove Street by the Grove Street and Ravine intersection.

479
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:49,317
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the slave wall that is there and we have some of the artwork is relevant to that slave wall, so we wanted to move it there.

480
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:54,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's it's on kind of the West side of the.

481
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,076
[SPEAKER_08]: train tracks along Grove Street.

482
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on Method Land Trust, right?

483
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Method Land Trust land?

484
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:04,462
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

485
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Brooks Park.

486
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:08,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Brooks Park is a part of the land trust?

487
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:14,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the Brooks Estate.

488
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Brooks' son.

489
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:18,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Brooks' son's house was there.

490
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: We had given some money from the CPC

491
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:26,719
[SPEAKER_04]: can then do some exclamation last year or two years ago.

492
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And so where the slave wall is, behind the slave wall is where his house was.

493
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:36,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can do an exclamation and so on and so forth.

494
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:39,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So what side of the wall are you going to put the artwork?

495
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:48,307
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't fully scoped it out, but I think it's going to be, it'll either be behind the wall or it'll be just south of the wall.

496
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And how will you, so if you're not going to attach it to the wall, are you going to have like sticks, you know?

497
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we have frames that we stake into the ground.

498
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:04,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

499
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:05,415
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

500
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:09,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be done a lot of times?

501
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:10,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

502
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is an additional one.

503
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,338
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be moving back to another location.

504
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling art show, I guess.

505
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:16,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

506
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:17,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

507
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's going to be at the event them in October, I think.

508
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:26,234
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're just making the most of it by the insurance policy runs out in the middle of September.

509
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:28,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought maybe I'd get another chance to make use of that.

510
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I just have one, one kind of question.

511
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:42,280
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do you anticipate we'll see this over a period of time?

512
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about, what do you mean, a little bit more than?

513
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Two weeks.

514
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:54,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Two weeks.

515
00:27:54,849 --> 00:28:01,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we had about 150 visitors.

516
00:28:01,794 --> 00:28:05,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say for sure, because we had visitors that were coming in just online.

517
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:12,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So Royal Park, it was a place where a lot of people were walking and traveling to.

518
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:17,147
[SPEAKER_08]: with just walking their dogs in the neighborhood and it's near the bus stop.

519
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:21,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't necessarily know, you know, it's just along the side of the road.

520
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:31,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't necessarily know how many people would actually stop and walk along there to see it, but it would give it visibility.

521
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:38,258
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I asked the question is because that's a passive park, if you will.

522
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:45,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite frankly, it's passive for a reason, because there isn't an awful lot of parking.

523
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:55,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're talking about Ravine Road and Jackson Road and so on and so forth, you're talking about residence areas.

524
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:04,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had requests to use that park for weddings and so on and so forth over the years.

525
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:07,823
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't really allowed that.

526
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

527
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:19,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I kind of question how spread out you're going to anticipate, because it's in anticipation.

528
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been done, obviously, at that place.

529
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:33,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't have any idea about how many people you're going to have and how much participation you're going to have.

530
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:36,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess that's the question I ask is,

531
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:45,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that on average, we probably had at most like 10 people a day visiting when it was in Royal Park.

532
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:58,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't, we didn't have like a massive number of people and it would only be, you know, when I was visiting, there were only a handful of people that would be there at one time.

533
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:07,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I just, I thought, like I said, there's not enough, A, you can't park on Grove Street,

534
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:10,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd have to pop on the side streets.

535
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:21,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we'll probably hear some rebuttals from some of the residents maybe after a while, but c'est la vie.

536
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is a park.

537
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:24,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

538
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris.

539
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:25,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris.

540
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:25,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Chris.

541
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he sent a message that he says he was good.

542
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,455
[SPEAKER_03]: No issues, sorry.

543
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:46,636
[SPEAKER_04]: No issues.

544
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

545
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:49,577
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ms.

546
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:50,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Godin.

547
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

548
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:52,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Godin?

549
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:53,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

550
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

551
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:55,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

552
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Godin, I guess we'll okay, and good luck with it.

553
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:01,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

554
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:07,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the police will have to say about it, but you know, sometimes people,

555
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:12,003
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they get very territorial, especially in that area.

556
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:20,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy to hear that as far as if that feedback comes back to us and that way we know how to plan for the next one.

557
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,350
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, good luck with it.

558
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

559
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

560
00:31:25,512 --> 00:31:33,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I go down Grove Street quite a bit, so I might have to stop in front of the Paul Beale House and walk over and check it out.

561
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:34,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out, yeah.

562
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:38,373
[SPEAKER_08]: some prizes up last time.

563
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:42,776
[SPEAKER_08]: So there might be some things you can enter in to win some artwork.

564
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:43,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So please do.

565
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:45,258
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

566
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:45,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

567
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:45,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

568
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:46,739
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

569
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:47,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Super.

570
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

571
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

572
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:58,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other surprises over there, young man?

573
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:10,086
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no the last minute permits the USTA right now the city solicitor is looking at the draft of the contract between USTA and the city.

574
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:17,976
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some legal concerns that he has first before we even really discuss the smart access and everything else.

575
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:18,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

576
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:28,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already reached out to USTA with some of our city solicitor's concerns and just bringing it back from USTA's legal team.

577
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:31,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I reached out to USTA after talking to the city solicitor about his concerns.

578
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't ask the questions you did?

579
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:51,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, and we thought it would be easier to not have the two head lawyers all over the world, that I should just reach out to them directly, talk about where the concerns are.

580
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:51,522
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

581
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:54,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

582
00:32:56,004 --> 00:33:01,306
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I think the city solicitor has a good point, once you start bringing in lawyers, that it just gets overly complicated.

583
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:10,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So he brought his concerns, and the USCA, if their lawyers have more questions or more legal terms that I don't know about, then

584
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:15,269
[SPEAKER_05]: then we'll have them reach out to our city solicitor to get the information.

585
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll take this till the next meeting or until such time as we receive an answer back from USTA.

586
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:25,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a list of questions that we'll move on to that.

587
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:38,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, when you were out last month, we distributed the original letter to the commissioners.

588
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:38,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

589
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:40,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked them,

590
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:44,967
[SPEAKER_04]: if they had any questions to write them down for this meeting.

591
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why.

592
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we need to first even see if we can get this past the legal term.

593
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:58,955
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk about the logistics.

594
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:02,217
[SPEAKER_05]: We also need to just approve meeting minutes of last month.

595
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:07,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll entertain a motion to entertain the meeting note from July.

596
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:18,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I entertain a motion to accept the meeting notes from July.

597
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:20,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to accept the meeting notes from July.

598
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,297
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

599
00:34:25,537 --> 00:34:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

600
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passed.

601
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other items to discuss?

602
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:40,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to adjourn.

603
00:34:41,694 --> 00:34:42,174
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

604
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:44,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine for that one.

605
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:44,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

606
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:45,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see.

607
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:46,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you later.

608
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:47,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

609
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:48,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

610
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:48,819
