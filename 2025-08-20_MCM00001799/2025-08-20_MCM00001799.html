    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=0.984">I</a>  mean, it doesn't take that long and it doesn't cost that much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=5.788">I</a>  realize you're trying to make some money, but I guess this is one of those cases where you gotta spend some money to make some money.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=14.274">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=15.135">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=15.955">And</a>  can you tell me, she's dressed in pink?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=20.079">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=20.919">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=21.8">You</a>  know, that's unfair, you know, bringing along a partner to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=29.96">I</a>  hope you have a successful event.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=38.643">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=40.224">And</a>  you just get back in touch with Kevin with those two items and we'll be all set.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=45.306">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=45.686">You</a>  better say goodbye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=47.527">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=48.447">Have</a>  a great day.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=65.286">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=67.526">This</a>  is that all day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=78.39">Kickball.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=79.811">Yes,</a>  yes, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=80.611">This</a>  is a turning event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=83.252">This</a>  is October 11th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=84.913">Is</a>  that Columbus Day?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=86.874">So</a>  that's Columbus Day weekend, but I was actually hoping to see if October 12th, the Sunday was available instead.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=97.418">I</a>  think they actually take the whole thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=100.902">Yeah,</a>  I take, I use all four fields. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=102.163">So</a>  the only conflict will be is girls softball, which I think is already in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=122.151">I</a>  know the past the past two years, the softball league has been very nice and has given us the day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=131.615">Yeah,</a>  obviously, that's totally up to them.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=135.777">But</a>  no, I think so Sunday, that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=138.919">So</a>  Sundays, I think softball doesn't start till 1230. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=144.983">Oh,</a>  your event's still five o'clock though, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=147.845">Yeah,</a>  so it does go all day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=150.506">I</a>  don't necessarily use all of the fields all day, but I definitely can't give like a set time on which field would be open at what, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=158.731">Yeah,</a>  I know softball. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=161.213">Yeah,</a>  that's how it's been in years past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=162.814">We</a>  usually just tell softball and they just make sure they don't schedule games that day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=167.497">I</a>  don't think that would be an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=169.718">I</a>  think Paulette is actually on the call</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=173.39">I'm</a>  here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=173.89">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=177.513">Shining</a>  in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=179.074">It</a>  shouldn't be a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=180.836">That's</a>  usually a practice day more than a game day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=183.278">We</a>  have double headers on Saturdays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=185.539">So</a>  I'm sure we can work something out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=187.381">You</a>  know, I'm always flexible.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=189.282">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=193.185">Sorry,</a>  October 12. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=193.926">We</a>  said right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=194.707">Just</a>  Yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=195.867">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=196.268">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=204.42">Any</a>  questions, Laura?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=205.861">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=206.882">Fee</a>  is usually $25, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=208.903">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=210.765">That's</a>  what I paid in the past.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=212.846">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=214.147">Chris,</a>  any questions?</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=220.792">Oh,</a>  Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=222.833">Yeah,</a>  he just wrote, no issue.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=226.996">So,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=228.277">Rocco,</a>  enjoy your day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=232.28">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=472.706">I</a>  do have a couple of latecomers, too.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=477.608">So</a>  one of them is, you've been waiting for something to get started.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=482.709">What</a>  can we do for you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=484.71">I'm</a>  actually looking to go to, I started a program with, I want to say it's in between Netflix <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=494.325">and</a>  then trying to be able to get the use of Morrison Field for training sessions for soccer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=500.687">So</a>  what I have been doing for the last 25 years, I'm the regional manager for a nonprofit organization, which is called FC Stars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=509.489">And</a>  we wanted to be able to make sure that we didn't exclude some of the inner city kids from not being able to play club soccer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=517.991">So</a>  we're giving them an opportunity to be able to do that at a much reduced price. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=521.932">and</a>  they're only paying a third of what anybody else spends. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=525.054">And</a>  we're trying to be able to get the practices. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=527.395">We</a>  were supposed to get three teams, and unfortunately, I think it's only one team, and then hopefully two teams next spring to be able to play out of this area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=537.98">The</a>  person that's coaching the team is actually probably someone that you've dealt with in the past, William Lewis, which is a baseball, he does hockey here in town. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=546.224">So</a>  he's a, he's gonna be the coach of that team. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=549.73">And</a>  we're looking to be able to get more method kits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=552.992">And</a>  so I reached out to the athletic director, which is John Preston and waiting to hear from him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=559.154">So</a>  I don't know from him, but we do have a lot of modeling kits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=564.017">We've</a>  got some method kits and we have kids that are also from different areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=568.679">And</a>  we're looking to be able to see if we can get this going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=571.06">I've</a>  done this in the past with <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=574.283">a</a>  lot of, um, we've been successful where we've had teams here in the past and we were at the high school and we were able to do a lot of different things and it was great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=585.19">A</a>  lot of the kids went on like the Salve's, uh, Aiden Salve and then Aiden was trying to pick up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=591.954">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=593.135">Just,</a>  um, and, and it's been, it's been great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=595.456">And</a>  I've had a bunch of kids that come from all the method. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=599.239">So</a>  I'm telling them to restart this all over again and then make sure that we can turn it on and <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=603.58">have</a>  the opportunity to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=613.106">And</a>  we're a non-profit organization. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=614.867">Do</a>  you have a 501C designation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=619.89">I</a>  do, and I can make sure it's CLI as well.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=628.755">I</a>  don't have a copy of the schedule in front of me, so I have to rely on <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=633.103">Mr.</a>  Bailey and his only copy of the schedule.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=639.468">My</a>  defense, I only got it today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=640.809">I</a>  did get it printed out and I got you a copy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=643.371">You</a>  do have a schedule, right?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=653.292">online.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=654.113">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=654.853">Oh,</a>  yeah, I can see it.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=655.674">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=656.315">So</a>  I just want to Morrison. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=658.817">Morrison</a>  is the one part that we don't have much going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=661.879">That's</a>  why we just give somebody something more for Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=666.083">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=667.364">That</a>  was one Saturday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=669.325">Sunday</a>  was it a Sunday? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=671.988">I</a>  think I looked at it.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=673.149">I</a>  think it was the young lady that just Saturday or Sunday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=676.511">Yeah,</a>  I got what day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=678.153">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=681.054">A</a>  Sondra drive organization.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=682.815">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=683.175">That</a>  was a Saturday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=684.296">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=686.137">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=686.237">Wednesday.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=686.457">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=709.962">It's</a>  no conflict. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=710.543">The</a>  only thing is, what time does it get DACA once you start hitting October 29th?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=714.226">October</a>  27th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=716.267">No,</a>  29th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=717.609">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=721.892">October</a>  29th is the next day is homing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=725.976">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=726.737">And</a>  our last game is November 7th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=729.479">So</a>  you changed it too? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=730.78">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=731.661">Where</a>  do you play your games at? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=733.062">In</a>  Bedford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=734.163">In</a>  Bedford? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=734.944">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=736.864">The</a>  only thing is there's no light. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=738.405">So</a>  sunset for October is 541.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=744.368">You</a>  think that we, if there's nobody before us, you think we'd be able to come in earlier to be able to offset that?</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=750.811">Yeah,</a>  there's nothing, there's nothing on the calendar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=752.792">So</a>  if you want to do like a three to five as it gets darker.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=756.174">I</a>  think that they get out at- At 3.30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=759.275">I</a>  mean, that age group is, what are they? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=765.533">2014,</a>  so there'll be 11 years old, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=768.955">So</a>  I'm trying to think of, do they get out of school at 2.30, or is it 3 o'clock?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=774.338">So</a>  even if you went from 3.30 to 5.30, you'd probably be able to get the season in reasonably. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=782.683">You</a>  know, the last half hour will probably be just about dark, I would think.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=788.307">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=789.387">You</a>  know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=790.088">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=790.548">But,</a>  I mean, you know, 5 to 7, we're getting there.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=795.311">I</a>  mean, you could in the beginning of September, but once you get into October, you're going to, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=803.557">Because</a>  I was more concerned about having someone come in after us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=806.699">And</a>  I was like, if I, if I do earlier and someone comes in.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=810.462">Yeah,</a>  you got the whole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=816.947">Because</a>  there's no lights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=818.408">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=818.888">So</a>  nobody's coming in after. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=821.83">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=822.17">That's</a>  just, that's just not going to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=824.212">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=824.766">And</a>  that's probably our most underutilized park in our portfolio.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=831.27">Was</a>  that draw by it's actually pretty nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=832.831">They</a>  cut the grass.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=834.231">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=834.672">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=834.832">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=835.532">It's</a>  nice.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=836.173">You</a>  didn't get out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=838.214">I</a>  didn't get out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=839.154">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=839.394">Well,</a>  I'm just going to tell you, you know, we've had some dog issues in the past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=845.658">So</a>  you might want to just check that, you know, and give us a heads up before you start. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=853.45">Because</a>  we have a great director. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=861.932">They're</a>  very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=863.672">And</a>  they'll kind of fill in the holes if there are any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=868.473">We've</a>  had that in the past.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=875.914">Yeah,</a>  I dealt with that when I was the DOC over in Reading. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=881.136">And</a>  it was funny because it was about conservation land. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=885.158">So</a>  what I did, obviously, I brought a bucket and sand, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=888.039">And</a>  then I sat in front of the board, the Reading board, and they're like, you're not supposed to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=892.421">It's</a>  conservation land. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=893.221">And</a>  I'm like, well, how long would it take for someone who comes out <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=897.405">and</a>  covers the whole, because we're not going to be able to play. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=899.606">But</a>  then if I've sent you an email, then it becomes a liability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=902.827">And</a>  then it's just on your part, because you haven't done your work, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=906.028">As</a>  soon as I mentioned that, that thing was like, you know, and then they covered everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=912.53">I</a>  was more worried about liability than that's a big thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=915.411">But</a>  what about that fourth kid breaking his hand? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=917.411">You</a>  know, that's what I was concerned about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=919.092">That's</a>  how I wanted to take care of it myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=920.692">And</a>  it was just an interesting situation.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=928.618">So</a>  do we want to do 3.30 to 5.30 or do you want to just look at the sunset times and then just tell me what you want?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=934.101">If,</a>  if, uh, if you tell me no one's going to be there, I will say great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=937.282">And</a>  then like, you know, if you can use the time, the daylight for now, and then if you have to keep on cutting back, if it's okay with you guys, I would be, it will be okay with me.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=946.407">So</a>  we're going to start off from the 27th, but today is the 19th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=949.829">So</a>  that's next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=952.09">Uh,</a>  19 and seven was 26, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=954.632">August</a>  27th, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=956.853">So</a>  that's next Wednesday? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=958.873">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=960.174">So</a>  you're going to start next Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=961.894">And</a>  why don't we start at 5 to 7? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=965.816">And</a>  when you find that it's getting a little dark, let us know that you're going to be there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=971.778">Because</a>  you don't want to issue a second order.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=975.519">That's</a>  a pain in the butt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=976.359">Yeah,</a>  I'd rather know ahead of time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=978.72">What</a>  are we making from 3 to 7?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=982.557">and</a>  giving them the flexibility to go when he wants.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=985.019">All</a>  right, what are we going to do for fee then? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=986.981">I</a>  can do a flat fee if you want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=988.663">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=989.784">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=990.825">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=992.186">I</a>  can do like a per day, but what are we charging?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=995.329">No,</a>  I have to look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=999.293">I</a>  don't have that stuff at the top of my head anymore.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1003.717">Usually</a>  for outside organizations, it's $50 an hour. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1006.74">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1010.014">But</a>  I could do a flat fee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1011.236">So</a>  even though it's more hours, I can do $50 a day, I could do $100 a day.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1015.621">And</a>  we would reserve the four hours.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1022.629">Yeah,</a>  I would do a flat fee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1023.991">So</a>  you do three to seven, I would just say flat free $100 and figure it's going to be a two hour reservation.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1038.153">So</a>  that'd be $90 to $50.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1046.016">That's</a>  what the outside organizations charge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1047.937">I</a>  mean, obviously you guys set the price. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1049.558">You</a>  can do a sport fee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1051.298">That's</a>  $200 for the whole season, but that usually has to be open for just Method kids and all.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1058.801">I'm</a>  taking that into consideration, you know, cause we got a multiple kids. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1064.183">We</a>  got other kids from other places. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1066.164">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1069.448">Usually</a>  what we do is we usually say the majority is Medford kids. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1074.031">So</a>  $950? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1074.311">$950</a>  is right, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1074.891">That</a>  would be $50 a day times 19 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1078.013">21</a>  to 20, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1078.654">Well,</a>  you put down 19, not me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1080.535">Well,</a>  no, I meant the LSU that I said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1083.597">I'm</a>  sorry, when William said he couldn't be there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1094.375">Oh,</a>  you're doing what's yeah, Tuesdays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1096.055">Yeah,</a>  you can do Tuesdays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1097.976">Is</a>  that good? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1098.716">I'm</a>  sorry, you couldn't do Fridays. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1100.976">I</a>  did the Wednesday, Friday, and then I changed the Wednesday, Thursday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1104.117">So</a>  it comes out to 20 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1105.477">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1107.297">Was</a>  it Wednesday, Friday, the first $1,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1108.958">Okay,</a>  that's good to me.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1115.259">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1115.679">Now,</a>  you know, you need your disability insurance obviously with the naming the city of Redford as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1122.413">additional</a>  insured, and you send that to Mr. Bailey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1129.534">And</a>  Mr. Bailey will take care of the rest.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1135.835">Sorry,</a>  we said $100 a day, flat fee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1140.976">$50</a>  per day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1372.146">It's</a>  actually just a couple hours on one of those days were already permitted because we do the trick-or-treating under the lights at Columbus.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1379.754">At</a>  Columbus?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1380.735">It's</a>  at Columbus, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1381.836">No</a>  worries.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1382.076">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1387.619">And</a>  come out and watch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1388.779">It'll</a>  be fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1389.74">Anybody</a>  that wants to come.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1390.961">Yeah,</a>  I think I will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1394.243">I</a>  think I will.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1395.203">I</a>  think you should. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1396.564">I</a>  haven't seen you in a while.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1397.805">Come</a>  out and hang. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1402.127">I'll</a>  do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1403.268">I'll</a>  do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1404.789">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1405.469">Well,</a>  you can go to your next meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1408.265">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1409.646">Can't</a>  wait.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1413.109">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1414.07">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1414.57">Have</a>  a good day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1417.132">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1419.714">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1420.295">The</a>  one, the one permit that we did not look at was the box and ultimate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1425.519">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1426.56">Can</a>  I, no, there's one more.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1430.203">I</a>  do this.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1431.304">Let</a>  me just came in today.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1432.805">So</a>  you're supposed to reject them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1437.312">because</a>  that was a couple of weeks in advance.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1439.653">Hey,</a>  Kate's right here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1440.554">You</a>  can.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1441.334">I'm</a>  here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1441.754">You</a>  guys already know this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1443.916">You've</a>  already approved it for the Royal Park, but this is just the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1452.14">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1452.881">How</a>  are you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1454.381">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1454.742">I'm</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1455.562">We</a>  had a great exhibit the first time around and we had some interest to install it by the slave wall at the Brooks Park.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1466.418">So</a>  we saw the art and we didn't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1469.219">And</a>  I didn't think we had any issues with any of the artwork that was done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1472.761">And</a>  I actually went back, I went back up to the, to the Royal house and I couldn't, I couldn't quite figure out where you guys were going to put it, but I'm sure.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1490.549">Yeah,</a>  it was, it was right along the, that brick wall in the Royal park.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1497.147">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1498.048">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1498.768">So</a>  we, we had pretty, I think you were unable to make the last meeting because we looked at the odd one meeting.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1507.593">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1507.833">She'd</a>  had the meeting and then she gave me the yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1512.655">And</a>  then she sent out an email with no one objected and we just approved it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1519.739">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1520.239">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1520.639">You</a>  didn't have to go to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1521.8">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1522.52">She</a>  didn't miss a meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1525.385">Yeah,</a>  you're looking to move the installation to just another location.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1529.667">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1534.069">So</a>  it's the Brooks Park on Grove Street by the Grove Street and Ravine intersection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1541.533">There's</a>  the slave wall that is there and we have some of the artwork is relevant to that slave wall, so we wanted to move it there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1551.538">So</a>  it's it's on kind of the West side of the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1555.254">train</a>  tracks along Grove Street.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1559.057">That's</a>  on Method Land Trust, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1562.1">Is</a>  that Method Land Trust land? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1563.721">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1565.583">It's</a>  Brooks Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1567.404">Brooks</a>  Park is a part of the land trust?</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1569.986">It's</a>  part of the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1575.331">It's</a>  Brooks' son. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1577.153">Brooks'</a>  son's house was there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1579.374">We</a>  had given some money from the CPC <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1583.418">can</a>  then do some exclamation last year or two years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1587.58">And</a>  so where the slave wall is, behind the slave wall is where his house was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1593.622">So</a>  they can do an exclamation and so on and so forth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1597.403">So</a>  what side of the wall are you going to put the artwork?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1601.625">We</a>  haven't fully scoped it out, but I think it's going to be, it'll either be behind the wall or it'll be just south of the wall.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1610.61">And</a>  how will you, so if you're not going to attach it to the wall, are you going to have like sticks, you know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1619.993">Yeah,</a>  we have frames that we stake into the ground.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1624.214">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1625.135">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1628.036">So</a>  they're going to be done a lot of times?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1629.956">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1630.677">And</a>  so this is an additional one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1632.257">It</a>  would be moving back to another location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1635.43">traveling</a>  art show, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1636.61">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1637.491">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1637.791">And</a>  then it's going to be at the event them in October, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1640.472">So</a>  we're just making the most of it by the insurance policy runs out in the middle of September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1646.274">So</a>  I thought maybe I'd get another chance to make use of that.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1650.236">So,</a>  um, I just have one, one kind of question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1657.578">How</a>  many people do you anticipate we'll see this over a period of time? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1663.46">Are</a>  you talking about, what do you mean, a little bit more than?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1670.585">Two</a>  weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1673.868">Two</a>  weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1674.849">I</a>  think we had about 150 visitors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1681.794">I</a>  can't say for sure, because we had visitors that were coming in just online. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1686.177">So</a>  Royal Park, it was a place where a lot of people were walking and traveling to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1694.345">with</a>  just walking their dogs in the neighborhood and it's near the bus stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1698.127">So</a>  I don't necessarily know, you know, it's just along the side of the road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1702.289">So</a>  I don't necessarily know how many people would actually stop and walk along there to see it, but it would give it visibility.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1711.034">The</a>  reason why I asked the question is because that's a passive park, if you will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1719.47">And</a>  quite frankly, it's passive for a reason, because there isn't an awful lot of parking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1726.994">So</a>  when you're talking about Ravine Road and Jackson Road and so on and so forth, you're talking about residence areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1737.938">We've</a>  had requests to use that park for weddings and so on and so forth over the years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1746.382">We</a>  haven't really allowed that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1748.847">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1749.967">And</a>  so I kind of question how spread out you're going to anticipate, because it's in anticipation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1759.369">It</a>  hasn't been done, obviously, at that place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1762.249">And</a>  we don't have any idea about how many people you're going to have and how much participation you're going to have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1773.711">So</a>  I guess that's the question I ask is,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1777.648">I</a>  would say that on average, we probably had at most like 10 people a day visiting when it was in Royal Park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1787.753">So</a>  it wasn't, we didn't have like a massive number of people and it would only be, you know, when I was visiting, there were only a handful of people that would be there at one time.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1800.379">Okay,</a>  well, I just, I thought, like I said, there's not enough, A, you can't park on Grove Street, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1808.042">So</a>  you'd have to pop on the side streets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1813.326">I</a>  think that we'll probably hear some rebuttals from some of the residents maybe after a while, but c'est la vie. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1821.753">I</a>  mean, it is a park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1823.734">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1824.315">Chris.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1824.935">Chris.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1825.376">Oh,</a>  Chris.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1837.772">I</a>  think he sent a message that he says he was good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1842.374">No</a>  issues, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1845.935">No</a>  issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1847.136">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1848.896">All</a>  right, Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1849.617">Godin.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1852.118">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1852.358">Godin?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1853.418">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1854.639">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1855.679">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1855.799">Godin,</a>  I guess we'll okay, and good luck with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1860.601">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1862.162">I</a>  don't know what the police will have to say about it, but you know, sometimes people, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1868.201">you</a>  know, they get very territorial, especially in that area.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1872.744">And</a>  I'm happy to hear that as far as if that feedback comes back to us and that way we know how to plan for the next one.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1880.189">All</a>  right, well, good luck with it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1882.93">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1883.791">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1885.512">I</a>  go down Grove Street quite a bit, so I might have to stop in front of the Paul Beale House and walk over and check it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1894.098">Check</a>  it out, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1896.672">some</a>  prizes up last time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1898.393">So</a>  there might be some things you can enter in to win some artwork. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1903.056">So</a>  please do.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1904.837">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1905.318">Wonderful.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1905.818">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1906.058">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1907.259">Super.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1907.599">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1908.78">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1914.384">Any</a>  other surprises over there, young man?</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1920.835">There</a>  is no the last minute permits the USTA right now the city solicitor is looking at the draft of the contract between USTA and the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1930.907">There</a>  are some legal concerns that he has first before we even really discuss the smart access and everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1938.016">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1940.237">I've</a>  already reached out to USTA with some of our city solicitor's concerns and just bringing it back from USTA's legal team. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1948.219">I</a>  reached out to USTA after talking to the city solicitor about his concerns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1951.52">He</a>  didn't ask the questions you did? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1962.359">I</a>  did, and we thought it would be easier to not have the two head lawyers all over the world, that I should just reach out to them directly, talk about where the concerns are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1971.482">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1971.942">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1976.004">No,</a>  but I think the city solicitor has a good point, once you start bringing in lawyers, that it just gets overly complicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1981.646">So</a>  he brought his concerns, and the USCA, if their lawyers have more questions or more legal terms that I don't know about, then <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1991.108">then</a>  we'll have them reach out to our city solicitor to get the information.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=1995.509">So</a>  we'll take this till the next meeting or until such time as we receive an answer back from USTA.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2000.491">I</a>  have a list of questions that we'll move on to that.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2007.293">Oh,</a>  by the way, when you were out last month, we distributed the original letter to the commissioners.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2018.356">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2018.737">So</a>  I asked them, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2020.605">if</a>  they had any questions to write them down for this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2025.067">So</a>  that's why.</p>

    <p>[Kevin Bailey]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2029.09">Yeah,</a>  I think we need to first even see if we can get this past the legal term. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2035.093">We</a>  can talk about the logistics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2039.015">We</a>  also need to just approve meeting minutes of last month.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2044.978">I'll</a>  entertain a motion to entertain the meeting note from July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2052.73">I</a>  entertain a motion to accept the meeting notes from July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2058.793">Motion</a>  to accept the meeting notes from July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2062.435">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2065.537">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2066.197">Motion</a>  passed.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2070.519">Are</a>  there any other items to discuss? <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2079.732">I</a>  want to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2081.694">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2082.194">Imagine</a>  for that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2084.156">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2084.836">I'll</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2085.497">I'll</a>  see you later.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2087.578">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2087.999">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2088.499">We</a>  did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2088.839">Yeah,</a>  one second.</p>

    <p>[Reggie Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/parks-commission-08-19-25&start=2090.08">You</a>  know, I never see any of</p>
