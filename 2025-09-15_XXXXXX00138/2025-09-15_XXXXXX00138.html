    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=9.7">Hey</a>  listeners, this is Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=11.46">And</a>  Shelley. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=12.701">Shelley</a>  is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=15.642">And</a>  Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=19.023">And</a>  this is the Medford Bites podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=22.003">Every</a>  two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=29.745">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=33.206">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=44.429">All</a>  right, thanks so much for being with me tonight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=46.431">If</a>  you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name pronouns and a bit about who you are.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=52.075">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=52.476">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=53.296">My</a>  name is Lisa Kingsley and I use the she series of pronouns and I am a candidate for Medford school committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=60.302">I'm</a>  excited to be running.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=62.873">So</a>  yeah, we'll get a lot more into that in a minute. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=66.235">But</a>  before we start to talk more about your campaign for school committee, I'm wondering if you could answer the question we ask everybody, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=77.823">So</a>  I spent a lot of time thinking about this in preparation, and it's hard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=81.986">So</a>  I'm going to give some caveats. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=83.507">For</a>  breakfast, it's Goldilocks bagels. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=85.888">And</a>  I really like to try different things, but most frequently, it's something that involves lox. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=92.787">Whether</a>  or not it's a sandwich or a bagel with it, that's often my jam. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=97.991">Semolina</a>  is my favorite fancy occasion, don't get there enough and very often. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=104.116">And</a>  I always get a special because everything they do for specials I get excited about, so I don't have a standby. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=111.221">And</a>  then I think day to day, it's definitely Bob's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=117.139">And</a>  their Alfredo pasta with broccolini and sausage is like a family go-to, and it has been for probably the whole 13 years we've lived in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=127.982">Oh,</a>  very comprehensive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=129.363">I</a>  do wonder on a weekday what you would get for breakfast, but we can talk about that the next time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=134.304">Okay,</a>  very fair.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=135.544">That's</a>  probably McMuffin, because it's closest to my house. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=137.945">So</a>  it's the easiest to swing by. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=139.546">And</a>  then I get the Biggie breakfast sandwich, but I sub jalapeno cream cheese for regular cheese.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=144.997">Well,</a>  you were prepared for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=146.959">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=147.179">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=147.94">I</a>  like food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=148.581">It's</a>  a good fit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=149.942">I</a>  like the question.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=150.823">A</a>  lot of good options in Medford too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=153.346">Thanks,</a>  Lisa. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=153.807">So</a>  I'm wondering if you could share a little bit with us about kind of how you arrived at this moment when you decided to run for school committee.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=164.291">All</a>  right, so it's been a journey, but a journey that's really centered around public education. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=171.116">So</a>  I started teaching in the South Bronx. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=174.017">I</a>  did the New York City Teaching Fellows. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=176.399">So</a>  it was an alternative certification program, which meant I was thrown into a classroom at age 23 with a theater major and was teaching self-contained special ed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=186.286">I</a>  simultaneously got my master's degree in special education at the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=190.474">and</a>  spent the next eight years teaching special ed in both New York and then the Boston area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=196.452">which</a>  I had moved to because I met my husband David while living in New York and the buses got really frustrating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=200.995">So</a>  eventually one of us had to give and I fell in love with the Boston area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=205.839">So</a>  after that time in the classroom, I moved into administrative roles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=211.002">I</a>  spent five years as a functional special ed director at Prospect Hill Academy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=216.066">Then</a>  I was principal of Curtis Tufts High School here in Medford, a role I was so excited to take on because it was a population of students that I loved working with and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=225.733">at</a>  that point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=226.215">I'd</a>  been living in Medford for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=229.013">five</a>  years and it was home and I wanted the experience of getting to give back and work within a community I cared so much about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=237.976">From</a>  there, I worked in Malden as the district's director of therapeutic services in which I ran all of our subseparate special education programs that worked with students with emotional impairment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=249.419">I</a>  ran our hospital reentry program for students that were coming back from mental health hospitalizations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=255.081">And</a>  I ran the high school alternative program <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=258.702">kind</a>  of a dropout prevention program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=261.165">So</a>  what I found in each of these roles, my individual efforts would have a limit of how effective they could be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=269.093">You</a>  know, I would be able to make progress on a specific program, or I'd be able to improve, you know, the efficacy of a certain teacher, you know, I could make <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=279.138">moves</a>  within the given system, but sometimes the system itself needed to be addressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=285.039">And</a>  it was that kind of desire to figure out how to be a systems-level leader and make more sustainable change that led me to go get my doctorate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=294.822">So</a>  I've spent the last three years at Harvard's Graduate School of Education earning this practitioner doctorate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=301.243">So</a>  I don't have a PhD. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=302.684">I</a>  have so much deep respect <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=304.564">of</a>  my colleagues that have spent the multiple years writing the dissertation and that are more researchers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=310.268">I</a>  am a practitioner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=311.289">So</a>  I spent this three-year program, I got to take classes at the business school and the Kennedy School of Government and the law school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=319.975">So</a>  really getting to put together some of these different threads to think through how they can be applied to a systems lens in education. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=328.13">I</a>  graduated in May. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=329.051">I</a>  still am looking to figure out where my permanent role will be after graduation, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=337.812">Realizing</a>  that this moment in Medford feels important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=341.836">And</a>  I have a certain set of skills and have been spending a lot of time thinking deeply how to improve schools in general. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=350.144">And</a>  like, I have three kids in Medford public schools and they're going to be there for a long time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=355.048">So</a>  all of those things together led me to feel like this is the moment to throw my hat in the ring. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=361.354">So</a>  here I am.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=362.883">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=363.503">There's</a>  a lot in that answer that I want to kind of like pick apart a little bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=366.765">But</a>  I want to just like reflect the phrase you said that like something about this moment, right, this moment in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=372.888">Can</a>  you say more about what you mean about that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=374.469">Like,</a>  how do you how do you kind of like picture what's happening in Medford right now?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=379.019">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=379.499">So,</a>  you know, there's a lot of things happening in the city in general. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=382.54">And,</a>  you know, there's a lot of candidates talking about that in, you know, the really largely the city council race. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=388.181">But</a>  for the school committee, it's a narrow job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=391.582">The</a>  role of the school committee is governance of the school district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=395.302">So</a>  setting and reviewing policy, setting priorities, approving the budget, you know, to ensure it's aligned with those priorities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=402.804">But</a>  the other big and I might argue the most important role of the school committee is the hiring and supervision of the superintendent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=411.271">Well,</a>  most of the time when a candidate is deciding if they're going to run or not, you don't know if you're going to have a superintendent search.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=419.837">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=420.197">It's</a>  very unusual to have an interim superintendent, so we absolutely know in this next term, a new permanent superintendent will be brought on board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=429.722">And</a>  because of that, I believe this is the moment that my unique skill set is going to benefit, could potentially benefit the city the most. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=441.233">I</a>  hold my superintendent's license. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=443.495">A</a>  lot of the training that I did in this last three years was to prepare us to be superintendents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=449.838">Many</a>  colleagues in my cohort are now serving as superintendents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=453.501">So</a>  having somebody who kind of understands the role, deeply involved in this selection process, I think is really important and I hope is something I will be able to do as a member of the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=467.576">Right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=467.816">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=468.716">So</a>  that's like a really interesting point, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=470.437">There's</a>  a lot of like, Medford is kind of primed for some big changes right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=474.378">One</a>  of them being the search for a new superintendent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=478.339">Another</a>  one being like, that comes to mind is like the idea, like the idea of how we're going to build a new high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=484.922">And</a>  lots of, and you know, we've recently passed like our first ever override, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=488.943">And</a>  like, so different amounts of revenue are going into the schools and different things, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=493.584">And</a>  so it does seem like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=496.526">a</a>  time that we're kind of like primed for some big moves, hopefully. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=499.789">So,</a>  and I wonder, with like a background in special ed and that being something that I've heard a lot of critiques of in the city of Medford, like what, what other kind of goals you would have or ideas would you have around increasing equity and inclusivity in your, as part of your role in the school committee?</p>

    <p>[Lisa Kingsley]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=518.166">Yeah,</a>  so one of the things that I think you mentioned <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=521.538">And</a>  that question, you know, we passed the override. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=523.759">There</a>  will be different budget funding coming in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=528.042">And</a>  as we look at how to use our resources, we have to have some guiding kind of North Star, some plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=535.807">So</a>  two of the things that I would want to prioritize before we even think about the how, is setting what our goals are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=543.812">So</a>  right now, the district has begun working on a vision for effective instruction. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=550.512">You</a>  know, Dr. Galussi shared it at the beginning of the year in her family email, and it's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=555.693">It's</a>  exactly the work that we need to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=558.534">We</a>  can go further with that and make sure that that vision is pretty clear and specific and is something that we've shared with families and something that hasn't accompanied, like, look for what does this mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=569.816">You</a>  know, there's a lot of really good priorities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=573.537">And</a>  then what does that mean in practice for us in Medford? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=577.02">Like</a>  some districts go all in on personalized learning, and that's how they seek to create more equitable environments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=584.505">Some</a>  districts go all in on project-based that allow students, you know, these different hooks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=589.949">Whichever</a>  way we decide to go about it, we need as a city and as a district to set that vision. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=598.305">But</a>  that vision is just like a poster on the wall if we don't also have a strategic plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=603.627">And</a>  right now, that's an area that we don't yet have as a district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=608.148">And</a>  I don't know how we can effectively make consistent and equitable choices regarding how we're spending our money, how we're allocating our money, what are we funding if we haven't set our priorities and if we haven't created a plan for how we move from A to B. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=627.27">So</a>  that's kind of the underpinnings that I think are necessary in order for us to ensure we are moving towards more equitable outcomes for all students.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7eN34X8RyOvIPdIWU3aT3Z?t=638.396">And</a>  maybe like in your role at Curtis Tufts or as a parent in Medford, do you have any sort of observations or hopes for how maybe Medford could do better in terms of equity for students?</p>
