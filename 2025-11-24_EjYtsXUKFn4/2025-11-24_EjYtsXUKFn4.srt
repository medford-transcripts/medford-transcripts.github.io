88
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:41,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

90
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:42,522
Okay.

91
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:46,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we did in the last meeting, we have to approve.

92
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:03,393
[SPEAKER_03]: invoices for payment for left field.

93
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:10,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the current invoice that is up for approval.

94
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So far just the left field invoice.

95
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to approve?

96
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:22,508

00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is like awkward and weird.

101
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:29,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

102
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll all get used to it.

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:32,961

00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:49,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Emily Lazzaro.

121
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:49,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

122
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:51,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole Morell.

123
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:51,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

124
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:52,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Anna Lopate.

125
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

126
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:54,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke Prisner.

127
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:54,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

128
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:55,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Joan Bowen.

129
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:55,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

130
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:56,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Lord.

131
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

132
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,160
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

133
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: great absent, the invoice is approved.

134
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:08,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this was just a very quick, very quick budget update.

135
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:17,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a ton of changes per se, since currently, at least up until tonight, it's just been the OPM's contract.

136
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:23,676
[SPEAKER_12]: But after we talk about the designer contract, we'll have a bit more

137
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:29,809
[SPEAKER_12]: costs committed to the budget, so we'll provide another update at the next meeting.

138
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,810
[SPEAKER_12]: But as of right now, pretty straightforward with just the OEM fees so far.

139
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,250
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

140
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:54,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next item on our agenda is to formally approve the contract with SMMA for the feasibility study services based on the designer selection process that we are at the end of.

141
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:58,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you all should have received a copy of the contract.

142
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:09,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as I mentioned in that email, the, the MS, the base MSBA contract, um, is not able to be modified by the city in any way.

143
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:14,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the task order is able to be modified by the city.

144
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:22,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went through several rounds of revision with SMMA to tune the scope of the project and the timing and the deliverable and all of that good stuff.

145
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:29,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and SMMA has graciously been working full steam ahead, um, in anticipation of this vote.

146
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:40,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the city has the city and the mayor have not signed off on the contract just yet because they are looking for obviously the mayor's here, but looking for the support of this committee before executing the contract.

147
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:44,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that will go to, uh, to MSBA and they will do their end.

148
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:49,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this, um, picking the team phase will be officially leaked.

149
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:50,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

150
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:56,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, you'll hear a lot in the coming slides and time about the feasibility study and all the work that we're doing there.

151
00:08:56,753 --> 00:09:02,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but first we have to take a vote to approve SMA's contract.

152
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions before we do that?

153
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:16,086
[SPEAKER_15]: So this amount is not inclusive of the options to perform.

154
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,528
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll say over and above,

155
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:27,705
[SPEAKER_15]: perhaps that's the long-term melody, geothermal assessments and test wells and things like that.

156
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:30,246
[SPEAKER_15]: The amount we see does not include that.

157
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:30,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

158
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:31,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

159
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:42,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are optional services that we can employ during this process with a change order that would be voted on here.

160
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:47,113
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it was not included is because based on the

161
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:59,062
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation that we had as we negotiated the deal, our need to do CM at risk and bring on a construction manager at some point during schematic design.

162
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,991
[SPEAKER_03]: they also have the capability to do those things and they may be the best people to do it.

163
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:13,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So we held off that work, not to say we're not doing the work, but to say, when we get to the point where we're ready to do the work, we need to figure out who the right person is to do the work.

164
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:22,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a timing and sequencing thing, but it is able to be exercised via contract amendment with SMMA if that's what we choose.

165
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?

166
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:32,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

167
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:35,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to approve SMMA's contract?

168
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,081
[SPEAKER_14]: So moved.

169
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,622
[SPEAKER_03]: By Ken Lord.

170
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:39,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by?

171
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:40,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

[SPEAKER_03]: Tracy Keene.

190
00:10:59,458 --> 00:10:59,879

[SPEAKER_03]: The contract is approved.

205
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:20,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are all connected with you tomorrow and we'll move the ball forward.

206
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:21,170
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

207
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for your patience and for

208
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,599
[SPEAKER_03]: continuing to work really hard.

209
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been here since like seven o'clock this morning.

210
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you really appreciate it and look forward to the update.

211
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:42,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So onto the fun part of the meeting, we can talk a little bit about the progress that the team has been making, which is enormous.

212
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:48,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to turn it over to left field and SMMA and you all can take it away.

213
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe just like stop in a couple of places.

214
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people have questions along the way, we can do that.

215
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:59,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think first we'll touch on the placemats that we discussed at the last meeting.

216
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:14,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'll talk a bit more about everything that we've been doing so far with the school and kind of next steps and highlighting some of the key milestones as we get ready for the PDP submission at the end of February.

217
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:16,542
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah.

218
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:23,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so for those of you who were in person last week, we did have around the table what we were calling placemats.

219
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, there was no food on the place.

220
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:32,234
[SPEAKER_05]: They were a means of engaging in writing and not necessarily verbally.

221
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:37,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we wanted to kind of report back on what we heard, you heard in writing say.

222
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're starting with the hearts first.

223
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:50,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So the four prompts were hearts, you know, what do you love about the site or project, heart burns, self-explanatory.

224
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:54,057
[SPEAKER_05]: The other two were about why you volunteered and what your superpower is.

225
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:59,540
[SPEAKER_05]: But staying on hearts for a minute, and AI can only do so much via a word cloud.

226
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It did need to dig into the data itself a little bit.

227
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:09,445
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, building is featured prominently, not only as a noun, but as a verb.

228
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:19,370
[SPEAKER_05]: There was real interest in the task of this group in building community support, as you will understand that this will take up a vote

229
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,579
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of support from your community.

230
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:28,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the building itself and the excitement around that and what it can be and what it will be in a few years, a few short years.

231
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:33,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And then building sustainable, safe, comprehensive high school.

232
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:40,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Equity came up a lot of times with respect to space and people engage the space.

233
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:42,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Bells is obviously a big one here.

234
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:49,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It's positive, positive in terms of this incredible site that you have, your location,

235
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: prospects to connect with the Fells through whatever happens at the building, whether it's all new, renovation, addition, et cetera.

236
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:13,575
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of mentions of retaining the swimming pool, the gym, and some of the CTE spaces, and helping to advise on the development of this critical project for unique and diverse communities, so diversity came a lot as well.

237
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:16,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go to the next slide.

238
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:25,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So heartburns, repeated concern about making sure the community is kept tied into the process.

239
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Several mentions of traffic and access to the site came up.

240
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:36,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Fears about disrupting school operations while instruction happens.

241
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:42,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, that'll be dependent on where we land with the direction, design direction.

242
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:45,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Concerns about cost and budget.

243
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:53,086
[SPEAKER_05]: potential for having to value engineer things, like having to subtract out of a project that we built up.

244
00:14:54,726 --> 00:15:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the fact that the MSBA spaces that they will participate in, should they be new spaces, will likely be smaller.

245
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:05,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So that also was mentioned a number of times, hence the space.

246
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And why did you volunteer?

247
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:15,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of love for MedBird, a lot of love for this community.

248
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them, what's best for your students and the community.

249
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Recognition that this building will be the flagship for the district.

250
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a community hub.

251
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a community building.

252
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:30,894
[SPEAKER_05]: One quote was the jewel in Medford's crown.

253
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:36,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Interest in contributing to making it happen and that it's so long overdue.

254
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:44,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of you giving your time to this effort is really being driven by predominantly those words and these notes.

255
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, talking about your superpowers.

256
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:54,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, what you feel you're bringing to the table and able to best contribute.

257
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, a lot of knowledge of the building, knowledge of building and design.

258
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:05,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the number of architects and engineers on this committee, knowledge of the community.

259
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:12,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that's critically important experience with building coalitions to achieve the desired results.

260
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:16,895
[SPEAKER_05]: expertise in teaching and learning to be translated into new spaces.

261
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:22,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, educators, administrators, well familiar with how you teach here.

262
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:33,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, this concern about universal design and ensuring spaces work for all students, bringing that concern and making sure it stays top of mind.

263
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:39,570
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with that, I think, you want to go to the next slide?

264
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:42,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're breaking.

265
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:43,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

266
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:47,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to recruit you to some advisory teams.

267
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So hold that thought.

268
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Matt.

269
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:53,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

270
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:54,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

271
00:16:55,648 --> 00:17:04,730
[SPEAKER_12]: We did just want to touch base quickly on schedule before in timeline, just to kind of bring everybody back to kind of where we are currently.

272
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:11,372
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this, but really just highlighting step one, which is what we're currently in the preliminary design program.

273
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:12,857
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, or PDP.

274
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:16,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the submission date for that is February 25th, 2026.

275
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:33,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we do anticipate having, you know, information, uh, sent to the committee members to review kind of periodically over the next couple of months, just to prepare everybody for the final vote, uh, to get the PDP submitted, which will be on our February 23rd meeting.

276
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:39,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the PDP review is, is by staff, uh, members only there's no board of directors meeting.

277
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:50,887
[SPEAKER_12]: They're really just kind of making sure that we have done our due diligence and making sure we've looked at all of the potential sites, you know, different options, base repair, ad reno, new build.

278
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:58,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously a big part of everything we're doing right now is the educational envisioning and programming, which we'll obviously touch base on.

279
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:03,594
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of, you know, where we are right now for PDP.

280
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:09,637
[SPEAKER_12]: As we get into, you know, the preferred schematic report later on, it's kind of refining.

281
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:13,085
[SPEAKER_12]: everything that we did in the PDP and narrowing down our options.

282
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:18,426
[SPEAKER_12]: We do anticipate submitting that June 25th of 2026.

283
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:25,248
[SPEAKER_12]: There would be a board of directors meeting there to essentially prove that preferred option.

284
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,449
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we would proceed into systematic design.

285
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:36,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So Matt, can you, the February deliverable is specific to the educational plan.

286
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:44,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not a place where we're seeing the visuals of a building coming together and pushing something like that forward, right?

287
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:48,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is the background of what is going to happen inside the building.

288
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

289
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:59,830
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have very high level blocks on a page to kind of understand what the footprint could potentially be for different options.

290
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:04,174
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be like sectioned out into like classrooms and stuff like that quite yet.

291
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,636
[SPEAKER_12]: It's largely understanding what the square footage is

292
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, to support that, that educational program.

293
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, that is really kind of the cornerstone of what.

294
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,184
[SPEAKER_12]: The project is based off of, um, and, and where we focus on it heaviest, um, is during this PDP and PSR phase.

295
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:22,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

296
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:23,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

297
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really helpful.

298
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:29,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to acknowledge that we actually have like members of the community in the room tonight, which is exciting.

299
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for coming.

300
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:36,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I just want to make sure that we're bringing everybody along the lingo, um, as we.

301
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,791
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're going to be talking about.

302
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:47,932
[SPEAKER_07]: As we chat, So, um, on that alternative options evaluation that mean they're looking at the options for like new construction renovation like that, So there'll be some.

303
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:54,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes important content and they're about design because it's going to talk about what it would look like great for these could look like, right?

304
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:55,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine that's.

305
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,875
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're gonna be seeing in that bullet point.

306
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:01,156
[SPEAKER_13]: It's two dimensional in terms of what we're doing.

307
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:17,032
[SPEAKER_12]: The, the, yeah, the different options will be like, like Matt said, very two dimensional looking at, you know, general footprint, you know, if we, yeah, bubble diagrams.

308
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to say like full design, but like big things.

309
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:20,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

310
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:20,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

311
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

312
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:28,581
[SPEAKER_12]: It will, you know, the options that we create during PDP, you know, will narrow down and the PSR phase.

313
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:34,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but yes, we do, we will be looking at quite a few different options, um, at this phase, very high level.

314
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any ground rules for the options that we'll see?

315
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:48,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Because what we've learned in past meetings is that by statute, we have to see an option for code compliance, current building standards.

316
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:58,007
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to see an option for a renovation, which is not the same thing as code compliance, because you may be changing how many spaces you use.

317
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:01,047
[SPEAKER_15]: And then finally, a new build.

318
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,188
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe those three are required.

319
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:14,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, an addition renovation fits into that reno category, but typically an addition renovation is also included in the option.

320
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:15,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

321
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:20,326
[SPEAKER_15]: So as a fourth option, I was going to bring up kind of a hybrid between renovation and rebuild.

322
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:26,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think we have that to kind of anticipate.

323
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:30,993
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of ground rules for presentation, you heard two-dimensional layouts.

324
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:39,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Could we expect estimates for cost per square foot as part of that presentation?

325
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:40,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

326
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:51,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And so perfect segue into this next slide, which is the deliverables, one of which is a cost estimate, which is based off of a cost per square foot.

327
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's very high level, and it's largely meant for comparative reasons between all the different options.

328
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,689
[SPEAKER_12]: to understand where we are generally between each of the options.

329
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:07,191
[SPEAKER_12]: And we start to narrow down and understand costs on a square foot basis.

330
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:12,833
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, a part of this PDP phase is an estimate portion as well.

331
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:17,836
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other key decision making criteria would be schedule.

332
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:23,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Would there be some schedule forecast associated with each of the options?

333
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:26,809
[SPEAKER_15]: or would they all be expected to just follow the same timeline?

334
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:31,412
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to price it, there needs to be a narrative for phasing.

335
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:51,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's a situation where, you know, you're going to have to, please, we're not necessarily doing this, but displace people and put them in portables, you know, that needs to be sort of played out a bit so that we get some good numbers to use to compare these options against them.

336
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,242
[SPEAKER_15]: So in February, we expect,

337
00:22:54,469 --> 00:23:07,312
[SPEAKER_15]: three or four options, actually four, presented along parameters of both technical, high level layouts, and possibly, you know, sort of discussion of how space is used.

338
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:15,553
[SPEAKER_15]: We expect to see a schedule forecast along with any, I'll say big rock factors.

339
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:19,394
[SPEAKER_15]: You mentioned the one about mobile classrooms, but I'm sure there's probably others.

340
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:24,235
[SPEAKER_15]: And then finally cost on a per square foot basis for comparing,

341
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:29,465
[SPEAKER_15]: between the four, and then also potentially comparative analysis against the historical data.

342
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:36,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and all the estimates that we get will be from two independent cost estimators.

343
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:43,571
[SPEAKER_12]: AM, 4GD, MPM, and C are probably the two most knowledgeable school building estimators.

344
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:52,675
[SPEAKER_12]: So working with two independent estimators will also kind of help us gauge where the market's at at this time.

345
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:57,118
[SPEAKER_11]: When will this be the phase?

346
00:23:57,158 --> 00:24:04,060
[SPEAKER_11]: We also discussed costs and things that MSBAs like not interested in administration.

347
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretend we want to build a whole new pool somewhere.

348
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Will this be, well, we're going to skip that.

349
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:22,563
[SPEAKER_11]: But will the end of the PDP phase include that where if we decide we're going to build an administrative way, will that already be part of that or will we be tacking that on at a later date?

350
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:26,919
[SPEAKER_11]: When do we do it so we don't miss it?

351
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:34,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I don't want us to be like, we've decided it's going to cost this much, and then we have all these things that we suddenly are displacing with no place to go.

352
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:36,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We will start.

353
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:39,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things will be identified by the end of this phase.

354
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: But moving into the PSR phase, we're narrowing it down to a single option.

355
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,850
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when we're really going to dig into that.

356
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't miss it.

357
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:48,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.

358
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions before we move on?

359
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:57,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one more, but maybe I'll save it for later.

360
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:03,097
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to do with looking at alternatives for different infrastructure systems.

361
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:04,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold that thought.

362
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:05,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of ways to spin a cat.

363
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:07,199
[SPEAKER_15]: We can talk about it later.

364
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:08,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hold that thought.

365
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:09,480
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something coming for you.

366
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you've got something about student enrollment.

367
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:18,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that this week there was a post about, there's ongoing, there's new discussions about

368
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:26,917
[SPEAKER_04]: the elementary schools being overcrowded and that considering the middle schools.

369
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:36,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wondering if the, are we confident in the number of students for the new building that you're sort of projecting?

370
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question.

371
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So the information that you're referring to about the elementary schools and the middle schools started with the elementary schools in a few cases being at current capacity.

372
00:25:51,812 --> 00:26:04,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a space study and we are sort of moving toward a shift that would move the fifth grade essentially out of the elementary schools and would reconfigure our middle schools to a five, six, seven, eight.

373
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:13,999
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things that space study revealed was that the buildings themselves in all cases, they are not actually at capacity.

374
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:17,160
[SPEAKER_03]: They just are at capacity as we currently are using them.

375
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,580
[SPEAKER_03]: There was actually like,

376
00:26:19,097 --> 00:26:24,699
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity for like seven or 800 more students across the elementary and middle schools.

377
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the result of the study.

378
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is it really seven or 800?

379
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it's, there's capacity there if we think differently about how the building space is used.

380
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that effort.

381
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,443
[SPEAKER_03]: This effort actually happened before, right?

382
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:48,385
[SPEAKER_03]: When we certified our enrollment with MSBA, we had to do a whole study that looked at, we did a whole enrollment study that looked at

383
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:55,960
[SPEAKER_03]: our historical enrollment, and it looked at planned and projected growth.

384
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:10,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked at factors about like where growth has sort of also typical impacts on school enrollment, and in particular places where there might be a different than normal impact.

385
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that was done like last summer, 24, and out of that came

386
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:30,722
[SPEAKER_03]: a certification of our enrollment number at 1395 for the high school, which is about 200 students more than we typically see here.

387
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:40,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is because in that enrollment study, we did a lot of back and forth with MSBA, particularly around some of the planned growth in the city.

388
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:45,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have capacity, and that number is locked in.

389
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:46,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's

390
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes the wrong number at some point in time, kind of no opportunity to change that.

391
00:27:52,479 --> 00:28:03,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But also that getting to that like capacity number was like 10 or 15 years, like down the road at our best estimates right now.

392
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:10,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So the enrollment study at least made me feel pretty good that we're not building a building that's immediately going to be at capacity.

393
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:13,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were able to like make that case with MSBA.

394
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:20,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And they agreed and we certified and agreed with them on 1395 for the 9-12 students.

395
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:21,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

396
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

397
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, there was a lot of back and forth.

398
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:32,237
[SPEAKER_03]: The city's planning department was involved and they looked carefully and it's part of why it took so long.

399
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:34,758
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked really carefully at the information we provided them.

400
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:39,561
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to change their typical models to account for some of those anomalies.

401
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:40,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's how the 1395 came to be.

402
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:57,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I could add the school, once we, once it is finally built, it is built for a slight, you know, in case there's more over that design involvement.

403
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:05,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't remember which percentage over, but it's not a ton, but it does give you some little wiggle room above that 1395, if you do.

404
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:12,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Jen, the number is, we designed 85% utilization of the spaces.

405
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:18,937
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can schedule and operate a high school at a little bit higher than that, up to like 90%.

406
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,238
[SPEAKER_13]: At a certain point, you're over-constrained in terms of schedule and spaces.

407
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:29,701
[SPEAKER_13]: So you don't want to go too much higher than 90, but that 5% range, that gets you a little bit of the additional flexibility there.

408
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:31,802
[SPEAKER_10]: So it won't feel terribly tight if you are at 1395, exactly.

409
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:31,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

410
00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:32,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

411
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:50,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to touch quickly on the other deliverables up at the top, educational visioning and educational programming, that's a lot of the ongoing efforts, the programming meetings.

412
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:55,695
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been here at the high school meeting with all of the different departments and teachers.

413
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:05,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Today was our last day of those programming meetings, so now we'll gather that information and start to put together the space summary.

414
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:11,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, that also goes hand in hand with the educational visioning that will be taking place throughout, uh, December.

415
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:15,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, and those two documents really feed into the space summary.

416
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:22,018
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's when we start to understand how many classrooms, you know, you have CT spaces, uh, overall building size.

417
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:33,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then the existing conditions report, uh, is, is exactly that it's just, um, studying the existing site and the existing building, uh, as a part of, uh, this PDP phase.

418
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:36,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we touched on the cost estimate.

419
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:46,554
[SPEAKER_12]: For the upcoming meetings, from an approval standpoint, tonight we'll just kind of be talking about updates on December 22nd.

420
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:51,977
[SPEAKER_12]: At our next meeting, we'll have drafts of the space summary and the existing conditions report.

421
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:57,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be the first time that we'll start looking at the actual space summary for the school.

422
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,482
[SPEAKER_12]: And then February 9th, we will have the majority of the PDP contents to review

423
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:13,033
[SPEAKER_12]: and with hopes of receiving an approval from this committee on February 23rd for our submission to the MSBA on the 25th.

424
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:22,077
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, I'll kick it back over to SMMA so they can dig into some of the details on everything that's been going on over the last month or so.

425
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:27,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And Matt, just to make sure I'm clear, the February 9th meeting is a school committee meeting.

426
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

427
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you saying that there needs to be a building committee meeting then?

428
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,236
[SPEAKER_14]: something?

429
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:53,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if we have a conflict with the school committee, we should find another date for that, but I do think we'll need another meeting in February.

430
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We need one in January, too.

431
00:31:57,006 --> 00:32:01,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so FYI, there's two more meetings coming your way.

432
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:02,329
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll

433
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,081
[SPEAKER_03]: huddle after this and get those dates out to people.

434
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:08,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

435
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:16,743
[SPEAKER_10]: We will need to go to the school committee for the educational plan.

436
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:21,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we are planning for that already, so we're good there.

437
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:31,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did show this slide at the last meeting, but now we have real dates and

438
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: actually several of the meetings listed below have been completed as of today, as you've heard.

439
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:40,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, just a real quick recap, and we do have Mike Perolo online.

440
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:48,423
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll speak to the educational visioning piece as a bit different than the educational programming.

441
00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:57,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So Rosemary Park, who actually didn't meet last time, she's an educational programmer with SMA, and Matt have been here how many days?

442
00:32:58,257 --> 00:33:01,398
[SPEAKER_05]: The number of dots is going to change every day.

443
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:03,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll tell you how many meetings.

444
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:17,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So those investigations are more about space, your space, what those requirements are, as different from the visioning piece, which is the really big picture thinking.

445
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:28,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of those activities are going to stretch, as you'll see, into December and sort of culminating in early January with putting the pieces together and

446
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,013
[SPEAKER_05]: really talking about adjacencies.

447
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:41,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I interjected, we will be meeting with you in January because you need to see how some of these parts and pieces are gonna start coming together.

448
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:49,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, Mike, if you're on, if you can provide an update on the visioning part.

449
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:50,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

450
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:50,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.

451
00:33:50,915 --> 00:34:02,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm not there in person, but yeah, I'll go through just some of the things that we've completed so far and what the next few weeks and months will look like to piggyback on all the things that have been said so far.

452
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:10,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So we in phase one, if you recall, I went through similar sites the last time we chatted.

453
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase one is really about kind of immersing ourselves in your world.

454
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:21,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And then taking school folks out to be inspired by precedent schools that have recently been built in the Commonwealth.

455
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:27,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really use that to help kind of springboard the conversation about the future of teaching and learning and space.

456
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:33,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a goal and priority mapping session where we

457
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:37,960
[SPEAKER_00]: started to identify overarching goals for the project.

458
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,881
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still in progress.

459
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:42,842
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it a bit asynchronously this time around.

460
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:46,764
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few of us met with the smaller educational leadership team.

461
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:54,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And then folks that couldn't join have been using an online platform to share their thoughts.

462
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:57,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that will be synthesized over the next week or two.

463
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:01,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll be brought back to that smaller educational leadership group.

464
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:08,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a great day last week on the 20th for the student shadowing session.

465
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:21,764
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what happened was a large group of us, about 20 folks from the district and the design team and I, we shadowed a handful of students to really see firsthand

466
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:36,958
[SPEAKER_00]: get a look at how learners really move through their day, where they experience support, where their experiences feel a bit fragmented, and even when, where the environment and the teaching and learning itself really helps or gets in the way.

467
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:48,909
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at classes, we looked at transition times, we spent time at lunch, and we were able to really see, you know, real conditions in real time, shaping learning, belonging, student access, and things like that.

468
00:35:49,880 --> 00:36:00,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had a great debrief session after and so that work will also help lead and shape the visioning sessions that are upcoming in phase 2.

469
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:05,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 1 on the 9th of December and then 1 on the 17th of December.

470
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:06,943
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 2 full day sessions.

471
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:11,446
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one will really focus on the learner experience.

472
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:21,335
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have students sharing their firsthand experiences about pinch points in the building, moments of joy, and just their day-to-day life.

473
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:26,659
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also dig a bit into teaching and learning envisioning session one as well.

474
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:36,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Then envisioning session two is where we start to really translate what that ideal space and learning environment want to be to support the teaching and learning we talk about envisioning one.

475
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will start to get way more granular and really land the plane in phase three.

476
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:46,928
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Helen just said, we will be back again in January.

477
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:58,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So on January 9th, we'll hold almost a full day of program and adjacency mapping, essentially where we take all the outcomes from the visioning sessions and then really start to think about

478
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:06,720
[SPEAKER_00]: how that informs and shapes the overall day-to-day experience, ideally, and the locations of programs throughout the building.

479
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,742
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where CTE plays with core academic spaces, how admin fits in, how special education fits in.

480
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:19,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the end of that session, we really have a strong understanding of what the overall building really wants to be.

481
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,846
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that would be it.

482
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:29,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone have any questions about the different pieces?

483
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:31,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's in charge?

484
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:41,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say thank you, because when you say we had a lot of meetings, they mean like 60 or 70 meetings.

485
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:43,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've done them all in a handful of weeks.

486
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:48,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So you all have worked really hard and really fast.

487
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:49,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate it.

488
00:37:51,340 --> 00:38:01,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I also really appreciate Dr. Glusi and the team here who is making this all happen because it's its own Herculean effort to pull all of the right people to the right place at the right time.

489
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:12,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's lots and lots of good, solid educational work happening to position us for the rest of this project.

490
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:25,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that I've never had a district leadership spend so much time helping the coordination efforts for at least the sessions I've done so far.

491
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:28,666
[SPEAKER_00]: So I echo that and I'm honestly so grateful.

492
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:31,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm super excited about where we're gonna go envisioning.

493
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:35,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it says a lot about the district and the leadership in the community.

494
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:51,126
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide here just reiterates again those two different groups that we're going to pull from a call on during the full day visioning sessions in December and then that program and adjacency planning session.

495
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,648
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this educational leadership team.

496
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:59,551
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the smaller group of folks that really represent the major program areas in the school.

497
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:04,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also represents a lot of the administrative leadership in the school.

498
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:07,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the group that will go on school tours.

499
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:10,618
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the group that participated in the shadow day.

500
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:17,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that is the group that will bring all the visioning outcomes and do that programming and adjacency mapping day.

501
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:35,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the educational forum, that's the really large group of stakeholders from the school, from the community, students, parents, educators sitting side by side, really building that big, broad vision in those two full-day sessions coming up in the next couple of weeks.

502
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:53,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to stop here because initially I looked at that timeline schedule and it showed seven days of meetings for the programming.

503
00:39:53,803 --> 00:40:03,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it did not really tell you exactly who we met with and how many, just the breadth of the scope of meetings.

504
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:12,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had 49 educational programming meetings on top of the visioning meetings and the prep for all of that.

505
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:14,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And we met with

506
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:18,954
[SPEAKER_05]: every department within the school, every CTE program.

507
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:26,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also we met with every program that is anticipated to be in the school, to be in the building as well in the future.

508
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see a lot of familiar faces this evening.

509
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:37,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like Matt, you and I have kind of been living in the high school.

510
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:40,747
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it's been amazing.

511
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:42,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And during these programming meetings,

512
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:50,575
[SPEAKER_05]: As stated, we talk more about how the space is being used today.

513
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:53,138
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the big dream?

514
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:02,308
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the ideal and optimal space for delivering the best education, best program to the students?

515
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:04,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what are the

516
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:09,750
[SPEAKER_05]: obstacles that are getting in the way today physically.

517
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, we just finished up our 49th meeting today.

518
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have all, I don't have all of it downloaded just yet, but all of those meeting minutes, because now we have to do 49 minutes of meeting minutes.

519
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:28,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure everyone is very envious of that.

520
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:35,455
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do have to say, I do have to really thank Dr. Pelosi and

521
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:46,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Marta Grahl and Chad Fallon for helping us mobilize super quickly to get these meetings scheduled all before Thanksgiving break.

522
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a really massive undertaking.

523
00:41:50,512 --> 00:42:03,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you go to the next slide, we have actually a lot of takeaways, but, and I'm not gonna read every single one of these takeaways because you'll have access to the PowerPoint

524
00:42:03,851 --> 00:42:11,195
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wanted to highlight a few of these and you will get, you'll get a whole packet of meeting minutes to also review.

525
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:31,046
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, some things I wanted to touch on that we heard repeatedly from educators, administrators, and students were that, you know, students need spaces to just kind of be, you know, it helps them foster relationships with peers.

526
00:42:31,186 --> 00:42:32,327
[SPEAKER_05]: It allows them to,

527
00:42:33,275 --> 00:42:34,796
[SPEAKER_05]: collaborate with one another.

528
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:46,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And also just kind of for taking a moment to sort of reset and just, you know, not not have to sit on the floor of a hallway outside of their lockers.

529
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:52,268
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're really just giving them a purpose, purposeful space.

530
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:59,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've heard, I got to sit in on a co-teaching, a co-taught class

531
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: which was really great.

532
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:10,153
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard a lot about the co-teaching model and it seems to be working wonderfully actually for the inclusionary aspect of education.

533
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:20,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that the special education programs are expected to see an increase in students, especially with the conditions program moving up into the high school.

534
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:29,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And kind of as a result, you know, there are sensory and calming spaces are going to be needed at the school.

535
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:34,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just for special education students, but for anyone, for anyone who needs a moment.

536
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that there's a continued increasing need for mental health and emotional support for students.

537
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:47,496
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll take a look at what does that mean in terms of space implications?

538
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:55,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, for CTE, knowing that the program growth is being planned for, it's actively being planned for,

539
00:43:57,058 --> 00:44:10,682
[SPEAKER_05]: not just with the existing programs adding instructors, but with the planned four additional programs coming to the high school.

540
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:23,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also we heard a lot about the outdoors and the school is using the fells a lot because it's beautiful, valuable resource.

541
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, in one of my classes I saw a deer

542
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:29,579
[SPEAKER_05]: window.

543
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,021
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was also a desire.

544
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:40,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was kind of more desire to increase access to outdoor classrooms and high quality outdoor learning spaces.

545
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:42,767
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about sensory gardens as well.

546
00:44:43,908 --> 00:44:47,450
[SPEAKER_05]: But just a variety of spaces outdoors.

547
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:52,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk a lot about the with the CT programs, the different

548
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:03,587
[SPEAKER_05]: advantages to the different CTE schedules with the A, B schedules and then C schedules for some of the programs.

549
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:13,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's something that we'll have to understand how that may impact the way that the space is counted for.

550
00:45:13,874 --> 00:45:22,480
[SPEAKER_05]: We have heard about, you know, all these programs that are, all the programs that will need to have some kind of public presence

551
00:45:23,205 --> 00:45:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: or public facing identity.

552
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:32,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's going to be a challenge for us to understand, you know, what does that mean for the school?

553
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:50,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we've, the programs that are truly community facing and public facing, you don't want to have the public really, you know, coming into the high school portion during the school day, if they are meant to be visiting some of these other programs, like the Method Family Network and such.

554
00:45:52,185 --> 00:45:56,527
[SPEAKER_15]: So the question actually on Airpoint Somerville has a nice auditorium.

555
00:45:56,627 --> 00:46:00,910
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost like a peninsula off of the main building.

556
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:06,152
[SPEAKER_15]: For shows, you can access the auditorium and theater without having to go through the school.

557
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:11,255
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one aspect of that site that I like.

558
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:17,258
[SPEAKER_15]: So in terms of feedback, you touched on a lot of things generally positive.

559
00:46:18,295 --> 00:46:20,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Did any negative feedback come across?

560
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:27,740
[SPEAKER_15]: You canvassed a very broad swath of the student population and staff population.

561
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:44,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you come across any issues where people felt unsafe because of the condition of the infrastructure, the tyranny of the long hallways, possibly facilities like old locker rooms that have visibly broken features?

562
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you come across any

563
00:46:47,612 --> 00:47:00,277
[SPEAKER_15]: feedback that expressed where an individual or groups of individuals expressed insecurity, not feeling safe, not due to infrastructure, but due to isolation.

564
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:02,078
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very large building.

565
00:47:02,758 --> 00:47:10,602
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess, did you come across any other sort of negative topics that we should know about?

566
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:11,402
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I don't

567
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:26,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recall anyone saying that they felt safe due to feeling isolated or disconnected, I guess.

568
00:47:28,172 --> 00:47:31,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know that anyone had mentioned being unsafe.

569
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:40,862
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that's, I think, important to mention, those of you that were at the meetings will understand this piece of it, but we did start off each meeting with a series of givens.

570
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:51,938
[SPEAKER_13]: that are going to be addressed in a new building or an addition renovation project, regardless of any sort of programmatic decisions that we make.

571
00:47:52,238 --> 00:47:56,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we wanted to try to get people away from just focusing on those.

572
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,302
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think a lot of those are potentially negative areas of critique, right?

573
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:05,665
[SPEAKER_13]: The lack of natural daylight in many of the spaces, the Wi-Fi.

574
00:48:05,725 --> 00:48:10,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's a whole litany of things that we know are going to get addressed as part of a project.

575
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:20,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I think in general, we were trying to steer people away from sort of focusing on sort of the more granular areas of critique that we know really impact everybody.

576
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:26,067
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're certainly real in terms of adversity affecting people's experience within the building today.

577
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,169
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also know that those things are all going to be addressed.

578
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:36,815
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think generally we tried to steer more towards trying to find the positive and sort of the constructive

579
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:45,225
[SPEAKER_13]: that were more focused on sort of educational goals moving forward, as opposed to the pragmatics of the existing facility.

580
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:59,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think, I mean, I guess that would have been a good slide to show you this list of givens that we put up, because, you know, we already, we know what a lot of the shortcomings were, because we know that

581
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:08,735
[SPEAKER_05]: access to power outlets is always gonna be power outlets, the heating, the cooling, and windows.

582
00:49:09,215 --> 00:49:13,538
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always gonna be the biggest things that educators ask about.

583
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:21,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I think that educators, when it comes to a facility, they actually don't ask for much.

584
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:23,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the things that they ask for.

585
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:28,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we know that we could talk a lot about

586
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:34,868
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions of those, but we knew that those were going to be taken care of in the new building or renovated building.

587
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:39,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So as Matt was saying, we really wanted them to focus outside of that.

588
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:46,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, you know, I think that teachers just do so much with whatever they're given.

589
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:55,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're trying to get them to think really big, you know, what is what's the ideal type of space to be able to teach?

590
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:56,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

591
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,252
[SPEAKER_15]: And then just one more as a point of follow up.

592
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:12,599
[SPEAKER_15]: I, you know, I couldn't be a part of any of these visionary sessions, daily obligations, but if you could give us an overview of how they were executed.

593
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:22,625
[SPEAKER_15]: You met with many people, 60, 70 meetings, were these structured conversations that were exclusively verbally guided?

594
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:28,683
[SPEAKER_15]: or did you prepare questionnaires or printed materials that guide the discussion?

595
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:34,669
[SPEAKER_15]: What did each of these meetings roughly look like in terms of process execution?

596
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:43,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you answer that, Luke, just to clarify, the only people who have been involved in these sessions are educators who work in this building to date.

597
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:48,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything that has happened so far is about the employees that work in this building.

598
00:50:51,792 --> 00:51:13,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So really what we did was we prepared four slides to show the, just give an overview of the process, what the difference between educational visioning, the difference between educational programming is, because we realized that we really needed to explain that first so that they could see what the difference was, because they heard these two terms being thrown out there.

599
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:17,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we, uh, explained the purpose of the meeting.

600
00:51:18,793 --> 00:51:37,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and we gave, uh, we showed simple schedule that, um, actually you've already seen, um, and then just explains that this was the first of three educational program meetings that will occur throughout the, um, the project, uh, cycle.

601
00:51:38,257 --> 00:51:43,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we gave that list of givens, which also includes better site circulation and, um, you know,

602
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:48,811
[SPEAKER_05]: reliable Wi-Fi, and then back there.

603
00:51:52,014 --> 00:52:00,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that was really it for slides, because we had a list of questions just for our own reference to make sure that we could touch on certain things.

604
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:13,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really about, again, hearing about how they teach today, how students are demonstrating their learning, how the educators, what do they wish their learning could look like,

605
00:52:14,842 --> 00:52:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but they can't do it today because of physical.

606
00:52:19,443 --> 00:52:20,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Limitations of the building.

607
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:28,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so, I mean, that's, that's really kind of the, the framework around the, uh, the meetings.

608
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I would say kind of like happening parallel to all of this, which I will be informing all of the work of this team.

609
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these, these were individual by department by focus individual meetings.

610
00:52:44,822 --> 00:52:46,402
[SPEAKER_05]: then there was the shadow day.

611
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:59,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the teachers, some of the administrators, we shadowed six different students and follow them for three periods of the day, as well as engage in a tour of the school.

612
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:05,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to be going on a tour of preschool sites.

613
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:11,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think all of these experiences are also providing our educators and our administrators

614
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:22,433
[SPEAKER_05]: with a little bit more of like a toolbox to do the visioning and see, all right, this is how we're doing it now, but how can we do it?

615
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:25,034
[SPEAKER_05]: What can our dreams encompass?

616
00:53:25,654 --> 00:53:41,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And by engaging in these conversations, shadowing the students, seeing what's happening on a daily basis, trying with furniture or sitting in, as simple as that, and then going for tours to buildings that are new and have maybe a different way of organizing

617
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:46,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that looks like is all going to help inform the educational plan.

618
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:57,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had images kind of in our back pocket if we felt like somebody was getting a little stuck and was having a hard time trying to envision something.

619
00:53:57,873 --> 00:54:02,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could tell it was kind of on the tip of their tongue, but couldn't quite get it out.

620
00:54:02,274 --> 00:54:04,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had questions.

621
00:54:06,556 --> 00:54:09,417
[SPEAKER_05]: But we tried really hard to do the research first.

622
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:24,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I read through the program of studies, the master schedule, checked all of the different needs of the programs, what I could find prior to meeting with the different programs.

623
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:31,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we were able to, I think that we had some really great discussions on the needs.

624
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:35,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we talked about the space needs, it's not just

625
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:41,803
[SPEAKER_05]: the classroom needs, it's also any of the support needs that are included too.

626
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:47,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we'll talk a little bit more about it when we get into the space summary as well.

627
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:49,608
[SPEAKER_05]: But did I answer your question?

628
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:50,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

629
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:56,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I just wanted to say we met Kelsey, the assistance dog.

630
00:54:56,153 --> 00:54:58,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited, and she's doing a wonderful job.

631
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:58,795
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a first for me.

632
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:05,953
[SPEAKER_05]: to see a therapy dog at a school.

633
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:09,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it's really, it's truly great.

634
00:55:09,715 --> 00:55:11,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

635
00:55:17,419 --> 00:55:18,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you follow Kelsey.

636
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:30,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So along with learning about, remember I said, getting to know your face, learning about how teachers teach, how students are learning here.

637
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:47,870
[SPEAKER_05]: What we think this project can be through visioning, we have to do the physical stuff, the hard stuff of building, looking at the buildings, understanding the systems, and getting involved with site investigations.

638
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:59,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So to be clear, in December, we'll have a draft, certainly of what building and systems, what we see, what our engineers and architects see as possibilities and issues.

639
00:56:00,462 --> 00:56:05,606
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these site investigations will take longer and extend into the new year.

640
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:10,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So we won't have everything next month, but we're hoping to have everything underway.

641
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:17,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the one that takes the longest is the site survey.

642
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:25,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have Aaron Bustilio here, a civil engineer, and Lois Vaughn is also a civil engineer on the team.

643
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:35,931
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have online Wayne Kueffner from Brennan, our survey consultant, because site survey is underway.

644
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:37,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think many of you are aware.

645
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:50,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to give a better sense of what that entails, so that people know what they're seeing when they see the guys in the yellow vests and they're there in the street.

646
00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:55,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps, I don't know, if you want to cue up Wayne a little bit.

647
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:03,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of this phase is about visioning and educational program, but we have an awful lot to learn about your site.

648
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:06,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So survey is one piece.

649
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:16,046
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to complete a survey that will tell us information about where pavement and vegetation is.

650
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:18,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It will tell us slope of your site.

651
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:23,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It will tell us where the property line ends and where streets and residents' properties begin.

652
00:57:26,331 --> 00:57:30,332
[SPEAKER_05]: pick up the wetlands that are around will be flagged.

653
00:57:31,212 --> 00:57:36,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very, very critical piece that all projects start with a survey.

654
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:38,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes a long time, the site is large.

655
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So the field work is gonna take a while.

656
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:45,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So the critical part was to start that as soon as possible.

657
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:50,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started before we knew it was going to.

658
00:57:50,655 --> 00:57:53,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be clear,

659
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:56,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Helen introduced Wayne Keithner.

660
00:57:56,245 --> 00:58:06,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Wayne, I just want to introduce you, but then also if you could help this room understand what activities have taken place and why.

661
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:09,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear us?

662
00:58:10,548 --> 00:58:11,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, can you hear me?

663
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

664
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:15,909
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, can you see me now?

665
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:17,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

666
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:18,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

667
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:21,490
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the Zoom.

668
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:26,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Wayne.

669
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:32,739
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so survey is a process, and I don't want to bore you, but I'll try to walk through the basics of it.

670
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:37,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we start a survey, one of the very first things we do is some office research.

671
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:50,048
[SPEAKER_01]: We pull some deeds, some plans to see what we can expect the property line to look like, the boundaries of the site, as well as what we can expect to see in the field, whether it might be an iron pipe or

672
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:53,808
[SPEAKER_01]: steel plug or, or a granite bound.

673
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are, we call those minor mutations.

674
00:58:56,150 --> 00:59:03,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they do is they, they usually set on property corners, and we need those in order to tie the property line down.

675
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:16,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we do that office research, and we have an understanding of what we can expect to find in the field, the very first thing we do is go out into the site, and we lay out

676
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:18,892
[SPEAKER_01]: our control network.

677
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:20,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And that control network is called a traverse.

678
00:59:20,953 --> 00:59:28,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we set points, which our field guys will set up on with their total stations.

679
00:59:29,656 --> 00:59:32,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, they will do the survey for the site.

680
00:59:32,738 --> 00:59:35,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And the traverse has to be a closed loop.

681
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do a bunch of calcs in the office to

682
00:59:39,592 --> 00:59:45,818
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute whatever error that might be from turning the angles and things like that, and that's called a corrected traverse.

683
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:52,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we have that, then we go back to where those points that we previously set, and then we start the actual survey.

684
00:59:52,904 --> 01:00:00,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So on large projects or projects that have a large property, we don't just stay within the site itself.

685
01:00:01,092 --> 01:00:03,014
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get monumentation for

686
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:10,806
[SPEAKER_01]: the street right-of-ways, the property corners of the site we're surveying, as well as the adjacent sites.

687
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:14,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I say the adjacent properties to see if there's monumentation there.

688
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:22,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, a property that we're surveying won't have every single corner having a monument.

689
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:28,819
[SPEAKER_01]: We find whatever monumentation we can, then we usually have to tie in some monumentation that might be on adjacent parcels.

690
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,343
[SPEAKER_01]: That process is compiling the various

691
01:00:34,232 --> 01:00:35,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, deeds and plans.

692
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:40,316
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that, we make a determination of the boundary for the project that we're working on.

693
01:00:41,397 --> 01:00:45,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you might see some of our folks in the street, um, setting travelers points.

694
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually we'll be in the street.

695
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:54,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably opening manholes getting inverts because, uh, Aaron might need those for her design later and things like that.

696
01:00:54,545 --> 01:00:55,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the process.

697
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:02,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're not used to it, that may sound weird, but I'm trying to explain the best way I can.

698
01:01:03,104 --> 01:01:06,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So what survey means is that we're not taking down trees where you see them.

699
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:09,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not developing the land where you see them.

700
01:01:10,027 --> 01:01:11,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean anything.

701
01:01:11,507 --> 01:01:15,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means we're trying to find out more information about the site.

702
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:15,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

703
01:01:16,669 --> 01:01:23,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And the traverse usually always extends outside the boundary of our site.

704
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:27,871
[SPEAKER_01]: usually within the public right-of-way of the adjacent streets, because we use that right-of-way.

705
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:32,292
[SPEAKER_01]: So the street right-of-way is the same line as, say, your front property line.

706
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:33,852
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the exact same line.

707
01:01:34,373 --> 01:01:40,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times we need to use that right-of-way to define a front property line that then might define the front property line of our site.

708
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:51,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions for Wayne and Erin on the survey?

709
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:56,692
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones out of the gate first, and they will be very visible.

710
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:04,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it expected to continue through December, January, February?

711
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:10,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Fieldwork is going to go till the end of the year, and correct me if I'm wrong, Lane, but that's extensive.

712
01:02:13,758 --> 01:02:18,060
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the current schedule for the fieldwork, I think, wrapping up the first week of the new year.

713
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:21,440
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weather dependent, obviously, right?

714
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:26,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's probably one of the reasons why we kind of wanted to, you know, start as early as we could.

715
01:02:27,324 --> 01:02:29,666
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things you can survey when there's a lot of snow on the ground.

716
01:02:29,686 --> 01:02:30,626
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things you cannot.

717
01:02:31,307 --> 01:02:37,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, anything that's on the ground, flush with the ground when it's covered with snow is very difficult to access.

718
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:39,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times we want to get out as much as we can.

719
01:02:41,347 --> 01:02:42,528
[SPEAKER_01]: before the snow falls.

720
01:02:42,668 --> 01:02:49,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We also were doing some drone survey for this project, so it's perfect timing because we want to get out after the leaves are down.

721
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:58,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another thing to be aware of, and I believe your first drone flight is this coming Friday, correct, Payne?

722
01:02:58,894 --> 01:02:59,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, yeah.

723
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and so I know the district is working on making sure people are aware.

724
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:20,610
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be a simple question, but where you said there'll be a lot of people doing this work, are they all going to be wearing these vests so it's identifiable who they are and what the work they're doing?

725
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

726
01:03:23,473 --> 01:03:31,320
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our field crews have the vests, and all of our trucks are painted.

727
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:33,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Wayne, how big is the crew?

728
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:39,458
[SPEAKER_01]: The crew that will be on site is usually just a two-man crew, a two-person crew.

729
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:43,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's the same crew for most of the time.

730
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:48,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Our drone pilot is different than the normal field crew.

731
01:03:49,100 --> 01:04:02,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say from our survey crew, the most different people that you would see might be like four or five different folks during that one-month period, usually in pairs.

732
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they need to be quarry checks to be around the building?

733
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:09,403
[SPEAKER_01]: They are quarry checked.

734
01:04:11,904 --> 01:04:12,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there.

735
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:23,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think the other thing just worth mentioning, because of all this activity, we're actively working to create a list of abutters.

736
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:30,114
[SPEAKER_03]: There actually are not that many abutters to this project relative to what some school projects see.

737
01:04:31,074 --> 01:04:32,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have identified what we,

738
01:04:34,301 --> 01:04:38,522
[SPEAKER_03]: the administration have identified as like, these are the people that we're going to call abutters.

739
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:58,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are working on a letter that will go out to all of them and be flyer to people's houses in the coming days, thanks to some voluntolds, high school students, Lucas Graham, among them, and said friends.

740
01:04:59,448 --> 01:05:00,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll, we'll

741
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:02,311
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a two-fold thing.

742
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:10,714
[SPEAKER_03]: One is so that people understand, like on Friday, if there's a drone overhead, it's for the high school project and there's something nefarious going on.

743
01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:24,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But also to start to create a pathway of communication with the abutters so that when things happen, when we want to invite them to meetings, when they have questions, that there's just an open line of communication there.

744
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:30,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And this project is moving really fast, and we're a little bit out of sequence communication-wise, but we'll get where we need to be.

745
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,441
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jenny, I just wanted to ask specifically or explicitly, because I know there's concern about it.

746
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:39,522
[SPEAKER_16]: You mentioned a lot of being in the right of way or being out in the streets.

747
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:44,703
[SPEAKER_16]: And then obviously, because the property touches the fells, there are markings in the fells now.

748
01:05:44,783 --> 01:05:47,924
[SPEAKER_16]: So just making sure that's explicitly said why that's happening.

749
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:57,367
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you basically said it, but there are markings that are very close to wetlands and that feel deeper into the woods than I think people think the property goes to.

750
01:05:57,427 --> 01:06:00,288
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could just speak to that a little bit more specifically.

751
01:06:02,401 --> 01:06:02,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

752
01:06:02,721 --> 01:06:12,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So the traverse that we set, when we do survey, we want to be fairly close to those property corners.

753
01:06:12,926 --> 01:06:15,868
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we find minementation, we're not shooting like a mile away.

754
01:06:17,529 --> 01:06:22,171
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might see stakes out there with paint on them.

755
01:06:22,731 --> 01:06:24,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are usually marking one of our track points.

756
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:31,436
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the points over which either the equipment operator or the rodman will

757
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:33,083
[SPEAKER_01]: will be set on.

758
01:06:36,245 --> 01:06:45,152
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we know that we're on the right coordinate system, basically, so that all of our points that we shoot during this all come in in the correct position.

759
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:55,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very common that during our survey work, we'll put those stakes in just so our field crew knows how to easily find those.

760
01:06:55,721 --> 01:07:00,344
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a large property, and even though it'll be kind of the same people out there all the time, it's still very large.

761
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:01,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just having those

762
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:02,602
[SPEAKER_01]: painted stakes.

763
01:07:04,122 --> 01:07:12,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Those painted stakes are usually right adjacent to what might be a hub and a tack, like a spike in the ground with a tack on it.

764
01:07:13,504 --> 01:07:15,904
[SPEAKER_01]: That tack is the actual trap point that we would shoot.

765
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:17,785
[SPEAKER_01]: But the stake just lets them know where it is.

766
01:07:18,405 --> 01:07:22,365
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're done with the field work, they'll probably pull all the stakes for that.

767
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:31,367
[SPEAKER_01]: There will also be flags that the wetland folks might hang that we'll also need to locate at some point.

768
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,372
[SPEAKER_01]: But the stakes you're seeing are marking our trial points.

769
01:07:34,452 --> 01:07:40,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the fixed points that we set up on in order to do the various surveying tasks.

770
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The next activity will also include some staking, but we need to understand more about the soil on the site.

771
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:53,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So our consultant Haley and Aldridge will be performing boring series of soil borings and test pits.

772
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:58,768
[SPEAKER_05]: The stakes do not identify building corners of the future project.

773
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,549
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not identify driveways.

774
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,730
[SPEAKER_05]: They are just for our information.

775
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,170
[SPEAKER_05]: But you will start to see those around as well.

776
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:08,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And those will be contained within the balance of the site.

777
01:08:08,212 --> 01:08:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a different coordination effort, making sure you understand when they're coming.

778
01:08:12,893 --> 01:08:14,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to be noisy?

779
01:08:14,254 --> 01:08:15,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a day of testing?

780
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:16,615
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be noisy.

781
01:08:16,715 --> 01:08:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that.

782
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll reach out to us.

783
01:08:20,456 --> 01:08:20,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

784
01:08:22,857 --> 01:08:23,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Several days.

785
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions on Geotab?

786
01:08:32,415 --> 01:08:35,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be measuring the sound on the site.

787
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important because we are required to not increase sound levels by more than 10 decibels at property lines.

788
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:44,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can see the picture there.

789
01:08:44,398 --> 01:08:45,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks kind of like a little toolbox.

790
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to put those out on the property lines.

791
01:08:47,879 --> 01:08:49,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll be out there for a few days.

792
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll measure noise sound on the site.

793
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:53,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will establish the baseline

794
01:08:54,710 --> 01:09:04,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll use this with our acousticians to make sure that we have all of the right sound mitigation associated mechanical units and everything else that we have control over.

795
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:07,653
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may see those on the property line.

796
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:10,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Wayne did talk a little bit about wetlands flagging.

797
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:15,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there are wetlands in and around the site, you have to know where those are, the regulatory areas.

798
01:09:16,276 --> 01:09:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So really critical in planning where we can develop roadways and buildings and whatnot, where the wetlands are.

799
01:09:23,186 --> 01:09:31,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it'll be like a nylon tie onto a tree branch is what it'll look like to have a number on it.

800
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:36,490
[SPEAKER_05]: We are also going to perform a geophysical survey again through Gilead Altridge Geotech.

801
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:41,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So geophysical survey, we're essentially mapping the bedrock on the site.

802
01:09:41,392 --> 01:09:48,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what you're going to see if you're out here when they're doing it is there, this picture is from another project.

803
01:09:48,274 --> 01:09:51,995
[SPEAKER_05]: They drag metal plate on this little tractor and then they,

804
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:57,765
[SPEAKER_05]: hit the metal plate and they can measure how quickly the vibrations can bounce back.

805
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:06,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And essentially we'll get a mapped topography of the Fedrock on the site, which is really critical to understand costs associated with earthwork.

806
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:07,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, really critical.

807
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:10,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And they calibrate that information with the borings that they take.

808
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:16,273
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any historic borings, we're going to get in there, but that is that piece.

809
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:17,934
[SPEAKER_05]: This cannot happen when snow's on the ground.

810
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:20,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't, these folks are not, are from around here.

811
01:10:21,673 --> 01:10:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: that might need to be an activity that wait, but we'll look to mobilize as soon as we can on the geophysical.

812
01:10:28,118 --> 01:10:30,540
[SPEAKER_05]: And hydrofoil test is again, something pretty typical.

813
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll blow hydrant and measure another hydrant nearby.

814
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:38,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will really give us information on what the building needs for a fire pump.

815
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:40,608
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be a fully sprinkler building in the future.

816
01:10:40,688 --> 01:10:49,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And so your city may require it be performed at nighttime or on the weekend or some, we'll coordinate all that with through the water.

817
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:55,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had students, student groups, like record any of this work?

818
01:10:56,505 --> 01:10:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Like video it?

819
01:10:58,606 --> 01:11:00,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking like, I think it's really cool.

820
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:04,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kim and I were like nerding out on the geophysical survey.

821
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:14,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we talked before at a meeting about having our like, our film and TV media crew.

822
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:19,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just wondering is like, is that something that's okay to do or?

823
01:11:20,218 --> 01:11:22,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, yeah, I don't see why not.

824
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:25,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually get the request to give the data to your earth science, you know, yeah.

825
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't see why not, but we can check.

826
01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:34,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the only thing there is that there's going to be there fairly lengthy activities, I think, individually.

827
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:40,947
[SPEAKER_13]: So there may be some level of excitement in terms of filming some portion of them, but I think that that shine will quickly wear off.

828
01:11:42,795 --> 01:11:51,041
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, but it's probably good to have a good sampling of each one of them, right, just so that people know if they see a particular thing going on, it's this, right?

829
01:11:51,321 --> 01:11:56,224
[SPEAKER_13]: And they can correlate it back to one of the videos, potentially, that students have recorded.

830
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:57,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

831
01:11:57,645 --> 01:11:58,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

832
01:11:58,225 --> 01:12:00,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's one more slide.

833
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

834
01:12:02,087 --> 01:12:04,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do traffic and then I'm out of here.

835
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that many feel about the fight is traffic related.

836
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's this traffic is really two pieces for us.

837
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: First, it's understanding existing conditions.

838
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:20,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So SMA will be on site observing arrival and dismissal probably several times.

839
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:27,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our traffic consultant with Fort Hill will also be on site observing arrival and dismissal, but then also studying nearby intersections.

840
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can understand how things work today.

841
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once we go into the future, what are those implications on those intersections and what we can do to mitigate those.

842
01:12:37,647 --> 01:12:39,809
[SPEAKER_05]: there's increased delays if there are.

843
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:41,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the traffic.

844
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget to come Saturday.

845
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,837
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a lot to download.

846
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Saturday mornings are wild here.

847
01:12:54,081 --> 01:12:57,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not the first time we've been asked to observe traffic.

848
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:03,949
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually, as part of our programming, one of our colleagues who isn't here tonight,

849
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:07,780
[SPEAKER_05]: she's actually been taking the T, she's taking the bus.

850
01:13:08,441 --> 01:13:12,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So she can download all of that information to you as well.

851
01:13:12,202 --> 01:13:14,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's been riding with students.

852
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:19,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So we even have that firsthand experience as well.

853
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:24,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we always like to engage actually the students on traffic.

854
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:33,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Inevitably it comes down to student culture on how they arrive or if there's anything that a project can do to help impact multimodal transit.

855
01:13:34,955 --> 01:13:43,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually these things go off into the site, onto the streets, but what we can do, if anything, to help traffic needs, I think is something that we're going to be interested in.

856
01:13:43,839 --> 01:13:49,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So just pulling students to see how they get around and what could motivate them to get around differently.

857
01:13:52,023 --> 01:13:55,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So everything that Erin and Wayne have covered is all site-related.

858
01:13:56,605 --> 01:14:01,888
[SPEAKER_13]: We're also going to be studying the building, obviously, because that's the other big piece of site investigation that we need to do.

859
01:14:02,943 --> 01:14:05,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so we were, we're handling this in a couple of different ways.

860
01:14:06,145 --> 01:14:09,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, actually it was this past Friday, which was just.

861
01:14:11,709 --> 01:14:30,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we, we had about, I don't know, 18, 20 different folks, um, here from, um, a whole variety of our engineering goals, some of which are in-house to SMMA, some of which are consultants, but included everything, um, from mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and structural engineers.

862
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:41,880
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as our hazardous material consultant, our security consultant, our data folks, code accessibility.

863
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:52,424
[SPEAKER_13]: So a large group of folks and John and Ken were absolutely amazing to donate essentially a day of their time to lead us all around the building.

864
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:53,744
[SPEAKER_13]: We split up into two groups.

865
01:14:54,684 --> 01:14:58,366
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Ken's group primarily focused on occupied areas within the building.

866
01:14:58,406 --> 01:14:59,886
[SPEAKER_13]: So looking at things like accessibility,

867
01:15:00,493 --> 01:15:06,318
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think you guys also ended up visiting most of the data rooms and sort of the tour of the security features as well.

868
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:18,609
[SPEAKER_13]: And then John took us on the more glamorous tour of walking through all of the boiler rooms, all of the electric rooms, below the pool, which is a very entertaining space if you have not been down there yet.

869
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:22,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really got sort of a very

870
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:27,595
[SPEAKER_13]: close up view of all the mechanical systems within the existing building.

871
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:34,116
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a wealth of knowledge here as well in terms of the evolution of the building, things that have happened over time.

872
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:37,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And so part of it was recording that anecdotal evidence as well.

873
01:15:38,477 --> 01:15:51,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Our environmental consultant was also going around with us and looking at where every type of chemical was stored within the school, both in sort of maintenance areas, but also in educational areas to understand like in cosmetology, what types of

874
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,244
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, fluids are there that we need to worry about managing and whether they're moved, whether they're disposed of.

875
01:15:57,884 --> 01:16:01,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so we're looking at a whole bunch of different things as we're moving to the building.

876
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:11,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and it was a really sort of valuable tour, um, on both fronts in terms of looking at both occupied and sort of the support spaces, the system spaces up on the roof as well.

877
01:16:11,753 --> 01:16:14,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, sort of doing that very detailed level of analysis.

878
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:15,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

879
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:23,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Associated with that in terms of looking at the systems, we're also charged with developing drawings of the existing building.

880
01:16:23,297 --> 01:16:41,106
[SPEAKER_13]: There are various drawings that exist out there from different vintages, but we've been finding that the programming discussions where we actually work with every group that we've been meeting with all 49 meeting groups to sort of map where their spaces are within the building and make sure that we have an accurate understanding.

881
01:16:41,587 --> 01:16:43,948
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to match that mapping of

882
01:16:44,921 --> 01:16:48,805
[SPEAKER_13]: the usage of the space with the actual physical dimensions to make sure that those are accurate.

883
01:16:49,425 --> 01:16:51,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we're going to compare that in a second.

884
01:16:51,267 --> 01:16:54,990
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see the document that does that to what we're proposing as well.

885
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:58,713
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need to understand where we're coming from and where we're going as part of square footage.

886
01:16:59,754 --> 01:17:08,000
[SPEAKER_13]: And while Ken actually did have access to a really great set of the original drawings from 1967, they're not, A, they were hand-drawn.

887
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not to critique anything that is about hand-drawing, but sometimes when you hand-draw something,

888
01:17:12,748 --> 01:17:17,432
[SPEAKER_13]: you can dimension something and you can write a dimension and it doesn't meet the actual dimension that's there.

889
01:17:17,552 --> 01:17:23,978
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there was some of that that we noted as we were trying to build our drawings up, our digital drawings.

890
01:17:25,019 --> 01:17:33,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And so what we're gonna be doing to help supplement that after we've modeled everything from those existing drawings is doing a first person scan of the interior of the building.

891
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:39,672
[SPEAKER_13]: So what that involves is a crew of scanning folks that walk through with little body mounted scanners

892
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:46,196
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically they create a point cloud of everything that the human eye can see, the scanner is seeing as well, right?

893
01:17:46,216 --> 01:17:49,337
[SPEAKER_13]: So we get a sort of three-dimensional picture of what that is.

894
01:17:49,377 --> 01:17:59,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can use that three-dimensional picture to then calibrate all the walls to make sure that the original 1967 drawings that we have are accurate or they're not.

895
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,521
[SPEAKER_13]: And sort of, it's also going to pick up all the renovations that happened here over the course of time.

896
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:13,764
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have some of those drawings, the science lab renovations, the Medford community media renovations, but there's all sorts of different things that happen here over the course of time.

897
01:18:13,824 --> 01:18:14,624
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big building.

898
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,125
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of time that has passed since it was built.

899
01:18:17,845 --> 01:18:25,487
[SPEAKER_13]: So really what we're trying to do is get to a dimensionally accurate portrait of the building as quickly as possible using that scanning process.

900
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:29,148
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to be doing that on the exterior of the building.

901
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:31,148
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very non

902
01:18:31,672 --> 01:18:33,874
[SPEAKER_13]: invasive in terms of affecting teaching and learning.

903
01:18:33,934 --> 01:18:37,056
[SPEAKER_13]: They can walk around the outside of the building and they'll scan the elevations.

904
01:18:37,857 --> 01:18:41,820
[SPEAKER_13]: To do it interior, though, we're probably going to be coming through after school hours to do that.

905
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:48,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to work with the school building administration to make sure that they know when that's happening.

906
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:55,070
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's probably going to be in the course of maybe a week or two of scanning and walking around.

907
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:58,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for your patronage of Bistro 489.

908
01:18:58,838 --> 01:19:09,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was the best lunch that the entire engineering team has ever had after doing one of those site walks.

909
01:19:09,886 --> 01:19:10,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Very much appreciated.

910
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions on all of the investigative work?

911
01:19:17,972 --> 01:19:18,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

912
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:21,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So now back to trying to

913
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Hip hip horns people.

914
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:26,030
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

915
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:36,632
[SPEAKER_05]: The last meeting we introduced the topic of what SMA had called focus groups, but we have gotten some good input from the district.

916
01:19:37,392 --> 01:19:41,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And really the role of these groups is advisory to this body.

917
01:19:41,213 --> 01:19:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've had great success using the advisory team method, not only to get more deep information

918
01:19:52,706 --> 01:20:01,314
[SPEAKER_05]: about the project, about what the goals are sustainability-wise, education-wise, site-wise, et cetera.

919
01:20:01,614 --> 01:20:07,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also another way to engage more folks to the process and the project.

920
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you want to go to the next one, I can just kind of go through again and

921
01:20:16,466 --> 01:20:19,108
[SPEAKER_05]: The description is on each one of these sign-ups.

922
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:20,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sending them around.

923
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:29,154
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to tap into this incredible group of resourced people to contribute to these.

924
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:44,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you go into the details, just to be clear, what we're going to send around tonight are sign-ups if you are interested in being part of one of these advisory teams and have expertise to lend to that topic.

925
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:55,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we have a sense of the interest from this committee, we will put out a broader call to the community to participate as well.

926
01:20:55,175 --> 01:21:11,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the idea here is that these advisory teams start to wrap in our boards and commissions and some of this particular folks at city hall who may need to be involved or over for traffic, et cetera, et cetera.

927
01:21:11,824 --> 01:21:13,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are interested,

928
01:21:14,448 --> 01:21:20,089
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, but just know that we also will be asking others to participate in these meetings as well.

929
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:30,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of that's to come, but we wanted to talk through and understand how you all wanna plug into that first before we make that bigger, broader ask to the community.

930
01:21:32,032 --> 01:21:33,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

931
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:39,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so you'll see, we don't expect to populate these groups with just you all, so don't worry.

932
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so sustainability and MEP systems.

933
01:21:43,521 --> 01:21:52,583
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, uh, this is about really digging into some of the details about systems that we'll, we'll analyze for, um, for this project.

934
01:21:52,983 --> 01:22:07,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it also does, and because they are somewhat overlapping sustainability goals, not only from a system standpoint, but also material standpoint, um, definitely, you know, um, gets involved with, um, landscape, uh, as well.

935
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:08,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

936
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:16,785
[SPEAKER_05]: For all four of these advisory teams, we're looking for attendance at virtual meetings.

937
01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:19,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to get one in in December.

938
01:22:19,706 --> 01:22:23,327
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be more of a listening kind of feedback meeting.

939
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:29,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we pick back up in January and March and then September.

940
01:22:29,089 --> 01:22:37,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So March, we're into PSR, the next half of feasibility in September as we get into schematic design.

941
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:38,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're asking for

942
01:22:39,732 --> 01:22:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: four hours, maybe hour and a half here and there of your, or whomever's time.

943
01:22:47,538 --> 01:22:53,302
[SPEAKER_05]: These groups can be as big as we want, but you know, we want a robust set of folks.

944
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So say 15 people.

945
01:22:57,645 --> 01:22:58,746
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of the next.

946
01:22:59,526 --> 01:23:01,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Next is safety and security.

947
01:23:02,989 --> 01:23:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably should touch on.

948
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, definitely.

949
01:23:06,799 --> 01:23:13,384
[SPEAKER_05]: want to know who here thinks they can contribute to this topic, set of topics, really.

950
01:23:14,445 --> 01:23:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: But just rest assured, we absolutely do need to talk to first responders.

951
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:19,949
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll pull them in.

952
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is not just site safety and security.

953
01:23:24,373 --> 01:23:26,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also about the site and site design.

954
01:23:27,715 --> 01:23:30,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do actually all play well together.

955
01:23:32,099 --> 01:23:35,461
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be very involved in understanding

956
01:23:36,672 --> 01:23:53,766
[SPEAKER_05]: development of the site, site plan, site design, but also again, looking for information, expertise on what you want to see happen on the site, not just technically, but also athletic fields, we know are a huge issue, shortage of athletic fields.

957
01:23:54,447 --> 01:24:00,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So same makeup here in terms of number of people and meeting.

958
01:24:02,898 --> 01:24:04,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Next one is exterior and interior design.

959
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:09,362
[SPEAKER_05]: This may pique some of the architect's interest, but shouldn't all be architects?

960
01:24:10,322 --> 01:24:12,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is pretty self-explanatory.

961
01:24:13,044 --> 01:24:16,466
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about materials, material costs.

962
01:24:16,946 --> 01:24:21,148
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also overlaps, healthy materials, both exterior and interior.

963
01:24:21,869 --> 01:24:31,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, same meaning commitment and same number target, more or less, of people on this group.

964
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:34,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, educational planning and equity.

965
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:44,500
[SPEAKER_05]: This one we're looking, I think, for fewer folks because we already have an established education leadership team and many of whom are on this SBC.

966
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,783
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a pretty big group right now, right, Suzanne?

967
01:24:48,803 --> 01:24:50,124
[SPEAKER_05]: 112 or so folks.

968
01:24:51,005 --> 01:24:53,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't wanna shut other voices out.

969
01:24:53,947 --> 01:24:58,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have a few more people contributing to,

970
01:25:00,523 --> 01:25:13,047
[SPEAKER_05]: tying into how the plan is being developed, being close to all the work that Rosemary and Mike Rolo are doing, and then kind of keeping an eye on that as the designs develop.

971
01:25:13,147 --> 01:25:17,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna start to come together and play well together.

972
01:25:18,408 --> 01:25:22,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And students, yes, we do have, yeah, students.

973
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of these, yeah.

974
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:28,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Beth.

975
01:25:30,614 --> 01:25:32,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, one more, sorry.

976
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:38,396
[SPEAKER_11]: The definition of security here, this is outside the building.

977
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:40,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Predominantly outside the building.

978
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:50,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, it's really that- We're not going to get into the, we want to have safe games in every classroom so people can hide.

979
01:25:50,538 --> 01:25:50,998
No, no.

980
01:25:51,218 --> 01:25:59,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Our security consultants stuff will involve interior cameras, but it's really that juncture between where the site meets the building that most of those-

981
01:26:00,617 --> 01:26:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: security things seem to interact.

982
01:26:02,559 --> 01:26:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've certainly heard from a number of people concerned about the number of doors, exterior doors around the building.

983
01:26:09,104 --> 01:26:10,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So things like that.

984
01:26:10,785 --> 01:26:15,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's where the building meets the site, but also beyond the security and site development.

985
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:19,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am going to send these around.

986
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:20,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on one second.

987
01:26:20,172 --> 01:26:21,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron, did you have a question?

988
01:26:21,253 --> 01:26:22,614
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more of a question slash comment.

989
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:26,157
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a handful of people that have interacted who just have reached out to me about

990
01:26:33,535 --> 01:26:35,436
[SPEAKER_09]: the best interest in the community.

991
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:39,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So members of the community who live here, let's say, but maybe work outside the community or vice versa.

992
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:41,921
[SPEAKER_09]: They live somewhere else, but they work in Medford.

993
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:54,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I just want to clarify that any and all members that interact in the community or live here in the community, do they have the capacity to be part of these commissions as long as they have, I think, as you mentioned, that expertise or the experience they can have with the groups.

994
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:55,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

995
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:56,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

996
01:26:56,390 --> 01:27:02,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll put out an official communication about how to

997
01:27:02,822 --> 01:27:15,586
[SPEAKER_03]: engage how to tell us that you are interested and then we'll get that out shortly once I think if we want to like nail down the meeting date so people know what we're asking them to commit to and then we can go.

998
01:27:15,707 --> 01:27:24,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, um yeah and I left space at the bottom you know if you know people that you kind of want to let us know.

999
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:25,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to sit around.

1000
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:26,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I need the parents back.

1001
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:26,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just

1002
01:27:32,643 --> 01:27:33,864
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really ran out of quick words.

1003
01:27:33,884 --> 01:27:34,945
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the educational element.

1004
01:27:34,985 --> 01:27:36,907
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just going to put that in front of us.

1005
01:27:53,393 --> 01:28:00,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to say that, yes, put your name on something or you let us have another one.

1006
01:28:00,098 --> 01:28:00,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1007
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:01,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1008
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:03,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1009
01:28:04,081 --> 01:28:05,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you.

1010
01:28:06,023 --> 01:28:14,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, we wanted to ask you all what those interest points are, because I think in the last meeting, some of the feedback I got afterwards was

1011
01:28:15,564 --> 01:28:18,685
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know how we fit in just yet as a building committee.

1012
01:28:19,225 --> 01:28:22,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is obviously going to continue to evolve.

1013
01:28:22,406 --> 01:28:33,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is one of the ways that we can, in a tangible fashion, show you how to fit in right now in the early stages of the visioning.

1014
01:28:34,869 --> 01:28:40,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming you're going to stagger the meetings so that we are more familiar or want to sign up in a little bit.

1015
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:42,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.

1016
01:28:43,377 --> 01:28:46,519
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do the best we can.

1017
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to get one in before the end of the year.

1018
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's more broad, and we're expecting each other to get what we have to say.

1019
01:28:55,044 --> 01:28:56,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you saying back to back?

1020
01:28:57,205 --> 01:28:58,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not on top of each other.

1021
01:28:58,986 --> 01:29:00,187
[SPEAKER_05]: But they might be back to back.

1022
01:29:00,427 --> 01:29:04,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we might just find one guy on just bang on.

1023
01:29:04,309 --> 01:29:06,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're going to get a couple of areas.

1024
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,330
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already in that.

1025
01:29:12,396 --> 01:29:13,016
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 30 minutes.

1026
01:29:13,277 --> 01:29:17,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we're not going to spend 30 minutes on the space summary.

1027
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all agree.

1028
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:47,834
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is just one of those slides that's inherently challenging to read, regardless of what we do here.

1029
01:29:55,278 --> 01:29:58,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think this is our last section, actually, earlier.

1030
01:29:58,679 --> 01:29:59,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1031
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,221
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're close to the end here.

1032
01:30:01,721 --> 01:30:10,225
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to take a second and just introduce a critical piece of our deliverables to the state, to the Massachusetts School Building Authority,

1033
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:21,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and, um, this is really a critical document also that will evolve over time as we move forward, but we'll eventually map out all the spaces that are going to be included, um, within the new building.

1034
01:30:22,556 --> 01:30:23,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Regardless of whether it's school.

1035
01:30:24,097 --> 01:30:24,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1036
01:30:24,478 --> 01:30:24,938
[SPEAKER_13]: And so.

1037
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,521
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably actually better that we're not able to read it.

1038
01:30:28,701 --> 01:30:37,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I really want to get people familiar with, um, just the visual of what it is and I'll, I'll walk you through, um, sort of the constituent pieces of it, the anatomy of it.

1039
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:40,278
[SPEAKER_13]: just so you can understand what's going to be coming.

1040
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:45,562
[SPEAKER_13]: The numbers that are on here right now are completely irrelevant because it's not been filled out.

1041
01:30:46,883 --> 01:30:53,509
[SPEAKER_13]: But essentially, this is a document that is provided by the MSBA as a template that we need to fill out.

1042
01:30:53,609 --> 01:31:02,616
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a specific template, whether you're designing an elementary school, middle school, high school, a vocational school, or a comprehensive high school like we are.

1043
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:06,119
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are different formulas that drive this.

1044
01:31:06,985 --> 01:31:10,346
[SPEAKER_13]: But essentially the top bars, which are purple.

1045
01:31:10,926 --> 01:31:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: They're blue.

1046
01:31:11,727 --> 01:31:12,127
[SPEAKER_13]: They're blue.

1047
01:31:12,647 --> 01:31:13,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm colorblind.

1048
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:14,527
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're blue.

1049
01:31:15,368 --> 01:31:26,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Up at the top, there's a certain... So the blue bars up at the top are space categories.

1050
01:31:27,251 --> 01:31:34,373
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the entirety of the building is broken down into a series of typical categories that are for every single project.

1051
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:44,329
[SPEAKER_13]: It starts off with core academic spaces, which is essentially your general academic classrooms, your science labs, some teacher planning spaces.

1052
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:47,651
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of like the building blocks of the school.

1053
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:51,632
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is fairly formulaic in terms of how it's generated.

1054
01:31:54,554 --> 01:31:57,015
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one down is special education.

1055
01:31:57,955 --> 01:32:03,858
[SPEAKER_13]: So the interesting thing about special education is that there is no boilerplate for special education spaces in the school.

1056
01:32:04,913 --> 01:32:22,720
[SPEAKER_13]: What the MSBA, the Massachusetts School Building Authority does is they defer to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, DESE, to basically confirm that the spaces that we'll be asking for have been tailored to the special education services and programs that are here at Medford High School.

1057
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,621
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's going to include the Curtis Tufts Therapeutic Day Program.

1058
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:30,183
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to include all sort of the general special education support spaces.

1059
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:34,091
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as the specialized sub-separate programs that are included.

1060
01:32:34,951 --> 01:32:39,192
[SPEAKER_13]: So that section will be very Medford-specific as we run through it.

1061
01:32:39,212 --> 01:32:40,733
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be entirely Medford-specific.

1062
01:32:42,713 --> 01:32:48,835
[SPEAKER_13]: The public day education spaces is actually where the Curtis Tusk program spaces will plug in.

1063
01:32:49,295 --> 01:32:55,876
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one down is art and music, which is very self-explanatory in terms of visual arts, performing arts spaces.

1064
01:32:56,756 --> 01:32:58,137
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where they're going to fall.

1065
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,123
[SPEAKER_13]: The next one is going to be a big one for us, which is the vocations and technology space category.

1066
01:33:04,143 --> 01:33:08,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is where all the Chapter 74 programs are going to be located.

1067
01:33:08,966 --> 01:33:16,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, tailored specifically to the Medford current programs that are offered, as well as the four new ones that are going to be added in.

1068
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:24,334
[SPEAKER_13]: The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, in addition to special education, they also have purview over the Chapter 74 programs.

1069
01:33:24,735 --> 01:33:28,517
[SPEAKER_13]: So they give us some guidelines in terms of driving the sizing of those spaces.

1070
01:33:30,331 --> 01:33:32,973
[SPEAKER_13]: We have health and physical education down below that.

1071
01:33:33,393 --> 01:33:35,675
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is the gymnasium spaces.

1072
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:44,180
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the support spaces like the gymnastics room, multipurpose spaces that are plugged in there.

1073
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:48,103
[SPEAKER_13]: It will not be the pool, because that's not going to get plugged in through there.

1074
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:53,526
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to put that down into the other category, which is down below that we'll get to as we go through it.

1075
01:33:54,867 --> 01:33:59,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Locker rooms, health classrooms, sometimes a trainer's room.

1076
01:34:00,152 --> 01:34:03,473
[SPEAKER_13]: The AD's office, those things plug into health and PE.

1077
01:34:04,813 --> 01:34:11,934
[SPEAKER_13]: The media center is a very standalone category, which covers the space that we're in right now, as well as all the support spaces that are associated with it.

1078
01:34:11,954 --> 01:34:16,895
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where my, both my eyesight and my colorblindness, yep.

1079
01:34:17,175 --> 01:34:23,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Auditorium and drama, again, are very self-explanatory in terms of focusing on that particular resource.

1080
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:26,977
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where we will get into the sizing of it and the words.

1081
01:34:28,336 --> 01:34:34,438
[SPEAKER_13]: sort of documented both auditory and proper, as well as the stage, as well as any drama spaces that are supporting it.

1082
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:35,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Rosemary.

1083
01:34:35,678 --> 01:34:40,420
[SPEAKER_13]: The next category down is dining and food service.

1084
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:49,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So cafeteria, single cafeteria space, as well as the kitchen, the servery space is all tied into that particular category.

1085
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:57,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Medical is a nurse's office, the school nurse's office that will just cover that immediate suite of spaces.

1086
01:34:58,696 --> 01:35:06,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, administration and guidance is going to be, um, extensive, just given sort of the various administrative, um, structures that are here.

1087
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,261
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll cover things like house offices.

1088
01:35:08,321 --> 01:35:16,424
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll cover, um, Martha's office, um, Chad's office as well, and sort of surrounding suites, um, administrative support spaces as well.

1089
01:35:16,484 --> 01:35:21,747
[SPEAKER_13]: And in fact that the thing that it does not cover is the central administration office for the district.

1090
01:35:22,513 --> 01:35:29,478
[SPEAKER_13]: That will be down below in that other category as well, because it's not directly tied to the school, but we'll categorize it in a different area.

1091
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:44,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And then custodial and maintenance, again, just as it sounds, it'll cover receiving, it'll cover office space for facilities, staff that are associated with the school building.

1092
01:35:44,569 --> 01:35:51,974
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have to talk about sort of district facilities, offices, and sort of where those fall, and we'll just have to understand a little bit more

1093
01:35:52,748 --> 01:36:00,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Sort of about what what spaces and what roles are serving the school versus the district overall.

1094
01:36:00,076 --> 01:36:04,160
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just some sort of sorting that we'll need to do.

1095
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:13,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And then down below that is that other space category which is a sort of a catch all for things that are generally not reimbursable by MSBA.

1096
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:16,432
[SPEAKER_13]: They will try and push things down there.

1097
01:36:17,328 --> 01:36:23,569
[SPEAKER_13]: more possible because it means that they're limiting their reimbursable piece of the overall funding equation.

1098
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:28,971
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will push back and try to push things back up into the other space categories.

1099
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:37,113
[SPEAKER_13]: That's sort of the normal dialogue that happens as part of any school project, again, regardless of the level, sort of sorting out what is in that other space category.

1100
01:36:39,688 --> 01:36:44,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Down below that, there's a series of sort of figures that are coming into play.

1101
01:36:44,733 --> 01:36:49,558
[SPEAKER_13]: The total student enrollment is there, and that drives all the formulas that are up above.

1102
01:36:50,579 --> 01:36:52,641
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a piece that is set in stone.

1103
01:36:53,062 --> 01:36:56,866
[SPEAKER_13]: The 1395 target student enrollment is what's been agreed to.

1104
01:36:57,706 --> 01:37:01,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they do end up tracking the spaces that are not occupied spaces.

1105
01:37:01,628 --> 01:37:15,815
[SPEAKER_13]: So circulation spaces, stairs, mechanical spaces, um, as a formula based off of the program, um, space, typically it's 1.5 times, um, whatever the occupied spaces that tells us how big our building is going to be overall.

1106
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:20,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and that totals up down in the bottom and that gives us sort of the overall building size.

1107
01:37:21,098 --> 01:37:25,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then this, as we were talking about earlier from the cost estimating perspective,

1108
01:37:26,032 --> 01:37:28,673
[SPEAKER_13]: overall building size will drive the overall building cost.

1109
01:37:28,693 --> 01:37:37,494
[SPEAKER_13]: And so those two things are going to be intrinsically linked, especially at this early phase, we don't have detail into the specific nuances of the project.

1110
01:37:38,675 --> 01:37:42,675
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is something that we will be starting to populate moving forward.

1111
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:50,757
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look at the columns from left to right, there's going to be identification of every single space, the name of the space,

1112
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:55,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we do a first set of, uh, first pass through by looking at the existing conditions.

1113
01:37:56,026 --> 01:38:04,569
[SPEAKER_13]: So the scanning that I was talking about and the mapping of the usage of the building, that is all going to get plugged into the existing conditions column as we go through.

1114
01:38:04,589 --> 01:38:10,611
[SPEAKER_13]: And then as we move to the right hand side, um, we're actually going to be putting in proposed, um, square footages.

1115
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:18,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so there may actually be different versions of this space summary that we're going to generate based on different addition renovation options, right?

1116
01:38:18,313 --> 01:38:18,573
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're,

1117
01:38:19,085 --> 01:38:22,786
[SPEAKER_13]: renovating a set of CTE spaces, they might have a different square footage.

1118
01:38:23,406 --> 01:38:28,407
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we were building them new and we'll have to run out cost alternatives for each of those scenarios.

1119
01:38:29,227 --> 01:38:31,388
[SPEAKER_13]: So there'd be some variation as we go.

1120
01:38:31,448 --> 01:38:35,769
[SPEAKER_13]: There are separate columns for existing renovated square footage and new square footage.

1121
01:38:36,029 --> 01:38:38,329
[SPEAKER_13]: And those total up to give target square footage.

1122
01:38:39,769 --> 01:38:47,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Also within this document, there are sort of the baseline MSBA sizes for every space that's going to be in the building where there is one.

1123
01:38:48,277 --> 01:38:50,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and they're sort of telling you also how you're getting there.

1124
01:38:50,619 --> 01:38:59,946
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, it's a pretty, um, comprehensive document, um, in terms of covering all the aspects of sizing, um, the new building options as we move forward through the process.

1125
01:38:59,986 --> 01:39:02,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And it will be used as a tool, um, to inform.

1126
01:39:02,588 --> 01:39:15,858
[SPEAKER_13]: And then eventually this will be part of what, um, this committee is approving, uh, for submission, um, both, um, at the end of the PDP phase, um, where you're going to have a bunch of different options and then eventually at the end of the PSR,

1127
01:39:16,425 --> 01:39:21,176
[SPEAKER_13]: will be one chosen option for a space summary as well as sort of the designs that go along with it.

1128
01:39:22,779 --> 01:39:26,508
[SPEAKER_11]: So where are the non-covered MSBAs?

1129
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:31,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you briefly meant like in that other category.

1130
01:39:31,124 --> 01:39:33,626
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be in the other category, just down towards.

1131
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:35,907
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is not the full list of others.

1132
01:39:36,067 --> 01:39:36,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no, no, no.

1133
01:39:36,828 --> 01:39:38,469
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually no detail in here.

1134
01:39:38,529 --> 01:39:39,490
[SPEAKER_13]: We've condensed it.

1135
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:48,236
[SPEAKER_13]: It's four or five pages, actually, and it'll grow very detailed as we get into sort of looking at all the administrative offices and that type of thing.

1136
01:39:48,256 --> 01:39:49,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we tried to simplify it.

1137
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:52,199
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't do a great job here in terms of what it is visually.

1138
01:39:52,539 --> 01:39:55,902
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a very tough thing to distill down to a very

1139
01:39:56,702 --> 01:39:58,003
[SPEAKER_13]: manageable piece of information.

1140
01:39:58,023 --> 01:40:06,488
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll also see non-reimbursable throughout the sheet as we exceed their allotted space potentially.

1141
01:40:06,809 --> 01:40:19,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so when, this is the document that I will always be, that I'll be working in, and so this is the phase that I live in Excel, and

1142
01:40:20,562 --> 01:40:28,926
[SPEAKER_05]: the way that we'll try to track what is reimbursed space as part of the MSBA's template.

1143
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:32,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Those will be line items that will be in white.

1144
01:40:33,228 --> 01:40:44,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there will be line items in yellow to denote the spaces that are not typically part of the MSBA template.

1145
01:40:44,673 --> 01:40:48,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because it's not part of the template does not mean that it won't be reimbursed.

1146
01:40:48,603 --> 01:40:52,885
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a matter of, you know, discussion with the NSP.

1147
01:40:54,926 --> 01:41:01,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, again, the way that we populate this, and this is gonna be sheets and sheets of space.

1148
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:17,838
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that we populate this is, you know, after downloading all of what we've heard with the programming meetings, doing curriculum analysis on sections that you're running now, number of students that you have, and projecting that out to the,

1149
01:41:19,177 --> 01:41:31,644
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, proposed enrollment, um, and then looking at the educational plan, looking at the visioning, all of that, um, we, uh, are kind of still into space and numbers.

1150
01:41:31,664 --> 01:41:38,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there questions before we move on from the space?

1151
01:41:39,028 --> 01:41:48,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a clarification with, um, like some of the CTE programs, it's my understanding that they're larger now than they would be allowed and still

1152
01:41:49,727 --> 01:42:05,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Um do you clarify the difference between like if let's say auto tech is larger right now than um what would be allowed in the new build and it if there's renovations done and how does that affect the total square footage again like this?

1153
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:08,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't clear on that.

1154
01:42:08,732 --> 01:42:18,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Well first thing is that we don't actually know how big any of these spaces are because we just don't we don't have any square footage so it's hard for me to have a sense of really how

1155
01:42:19,219 --> 01:42:22,701
[SPEAKER_05]: are they actually bigger than what MSBA would allow?

1156
01:42:22,821 --> 01:42:25,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have no sense right now because we don't have the existing square footages.

1157
01:42:25,783 --> 01:42:29,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but let's hypothesize or say they're not.

1158
01:42:30,266 --> 01:42:34,709
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that play out in total square footage that is allowed by the MSBA?

1159
01:42:35,689 --> 01:42:44,875
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think if we're renovating existing space and sort of keeping it in place, generally that larger footprint, if we're not modifying it, is going to be acceptable.

1160
01:42:44,895 --> 01:42:47,437
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have to go through a conversation with the MSBA

1161
01:42:47,880 --> 01:43:00,168
[SPEAKER_13]: just to explain that, but there's a lot of logic that will say, yes, you can keep that existing footprint of space, even if you're improving it, renovating it on the interior, in terms of just maintaining that and moving it forward.

1162
01:43:00,889 --> 01:43:10,175
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're building new, then we're going to be tied back a little bit more to those DESI guidelines that are going to specify how big the program is going to be.

1163
01:43:10,235 --> 01:43:14,878
[SPEAKER_13]: But the size of the new program, if we're building it new, the new space if we're building it new,

1164
01:43:15,447 --> 01:43:25,415
[SPEAKER_13]: It's tied specifically to the projected enrollment and the number of students that would need to be accommodated within any of the Chapter 74 spaces at one time.

1165
01:43:25,435 --> 01:43:32,140
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's going to be true for both the related classrooms as well as sort of a primary shop space for any particular program.

1166
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:44,129
[SPEAKER_13]: And so what we need to do is also we've been doing as part of the programming meetings is understanding what is that maximum number of students that might be in a shop space and also thinking about that moving forward

1167
01:43:44,757 --> 01:43:52,100
[SPEAKER_13]: We also talked about the fact that a lot of the shops are considering bringing an additional staff member instructor, right?

1168
01:43:52,280 --> 01:44:10,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And so if you go from one to two, or if you're going from two to three, it's usually done so that there's additional students that can be accommodated in the program because the program is growing and it's popular and it has a lot of positive aspects to it, but we need to then make sure that the space can support sort of that anticipated growth as well.

1169
01:44:10,867 --> 01:44:11,847
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's when

1170
01:44:12,886 --> 01:44:18,110
[SPEAKER_13]: where you're saying that we really need to understand both what the existing square footage is by doing that measurement process.

1171
01:44:18,491 --> 01:44:22,834
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to couple that with understanding sort of the projection for that particular program.

1172
01:44:23,415 --> 01:44:26,337
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I guess we were having the discussions in our programming meeting, right?

1173
01:44:26,357 --> 01:44:29,159
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really why we were asking to get that understanding.

1174
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:37,406
[SPEAKER_13]: In the not too distant future, I would say like in the next week or so, we should start to get a sense of like what the space summary is starting to reflect.

1175
01:44:38,026 --> 01:44:41,049
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not gonna be right after the first pass.

1176
01:44:41,069 --> 01:44:42,470
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna have some back and forths

1177
01:44:43,157 --> 01:44:51,662
[SPEAKER_13]: to understand sort of what we come up with initially, and then sort of whether or not that meshes with sort of all the space programming discussions that we've been having as well.

1178
01:44:54,364 --> 01:44:55,424
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a long answer.

1179
01:44:55,444 --> 01:45:03,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if I completely got to your... Okay, and we can certainly talk about it a little bit more as we go.

1180
01:45:04,529 --> 01:45:11,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any opportunity for us to see that sort of living document, or is it sort of to be smeared out when we get to a certain point?

1181
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a highly complicated document with lots of things tied to every cell.

1182
01:45:19,299 --> 01:45:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do not like to give a live version.

1183
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:24,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's almost my concept, your question, you know, where things are.

1184
01:45:24,442 --> 01:45:28,985
[SPEAKER_14]: So I believe that we are scheduled at the next SBC meeting to go over the draft.

1185
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:44,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's perfect.

1186
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:45,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1187
01:45:45,432 --> 01:45:51,915
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll share the detailed version in advance, because again, like PowerPoint is not the correct sort of medium to be reviewing this in.

1188
01:45:52,295 --> 01:46:01,340
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll want to be able, I know there are a lot of people here that are probably interested in getting into the granular line items to understand them, whether CTE spaces or the rest of the building.

1189
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:07,382
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be have that distributed as a live Excel version, not Excel, but like a PDF version.

1190
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:23,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Even within our office, I pass for protected, not because I don't trust people, but, you know, accidentally.

1191
01:46:23,259 --> 01:46:28,882
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there is a great point about interfering with the process unintentionally.

1192
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:39,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So there will be protections in place, but like generally speaking for data rights, anything digital produced for this project,

1193
01:46:40,968 --> 01:46:43,731
[SPEAKER_15]: ultimately is the property of the district.

1194
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:44,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a true statement?

1195
01:46:47,374 --> 01:46:53,559
[SPEAKER_15]: So at some point we can have access to any documents produced, you know, for the benefit of the project.

1196
01:46:53,839 --> 01:47:00,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just want to make sure that I can't share the live file that I'm working on.

1197
01:47:00,865 --> 01:47:04,508
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't want to start an active process.

1198
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:07,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and all of these deliverables will

1199
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:23,391
[SPEAKER_03]: be loaded on the project website so that if people want to go in and dive deep and spend many, many hours reading contracts or whatever it is, all of that will be available as it's completed on the project website.

1200
01:47:24,652 --> 01:47:28,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And that website, you all got a link to that.

1201
01:47:28,434 --> 01:47:31,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And we asked if you had any immediate feedback.

1202
01:47:31,716 --> 01:47:33,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we will turn that.

1203
01:47:33,577 --> 01:47:34,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We will turn over the

1204
01:47:35,433 --> 01:47:38,795
[SPEAKER_03]: prior site to the new site shortly and make a broader announcement.

1205
01:47:38,815 --> 01:47:44,559
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone knows that they can go there to find the documents that we're looking for.

1206
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:45,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready?

1207
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if you said this, but I missed it.

1208
01:47:47,602 --> 01:47:53,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about sometimes programming like flexible spaces or collaboration, they are wider corridors.

1209
01:47:53,766 --> 01:47:59,030
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to get into a program because they're more like, they're not quite like core academic.

1210
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:03,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get to, but they also don't want them to like fall into circulation that's not efficient.

1211
01:48:04,675 --> 01:48:09,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get to add that as a programmed element in this or does MSB, how do they treat that?

1212
01:48:09,966 --> 01:48:11,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So it depends on what the space is.

1213
01:48:13,243 --> 01:48:21,346
[SPEAKER_05]: some purpose-built flexible space like a larger instructional space or some other rooms that are not assigned.

1214
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:23,327
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not meant to be assigned.

1215
01:48:23,367 --> 01:48:31,210
[SPEAKER_05]: They're meant for educators or people within the building to be able to use on like a sign-out basis.

1216
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:39,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like that we will put into, and actually the MSBA does allow for some of that, like breakout rooms, small group rooms,

1217
01:48:40,909 --> 01:48:42,411
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as the larger instructional space.

1218
01:48:43,492 --> 01:48:46,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So MSB does carry some of those things.

1219
01:48:46,415 --> 01:48:57,829
[SPEAKER_05]: If we want to add some more, like hold on to a couple more things, then we also need to make sure that the educational plan justifies a need for that.

1220
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we say that

1221
01:49:00,753 --> 01:49:14,003
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been saying this in all of our programming meetings that the educational plan really does explain the reasoning behind all of the space that we're including in the program.

1222
01:49:14,524 --> 01:49:22,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And then other things like the wider corners or kind of informal breakout spaces.

1223
01:49:22,269 --> 01:49:26,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so those informal breakout spaces, that 1.5 grossing factor

1224
01:49:27,523 --> 01:49:33,305
[SPEAKER_05]: actually is enough to be able to bring us, to allow for those types of spaces.

1225
01:49:33,485 --> 01:49:35,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But will that be in the, in the grossing factors?

1226
01:49:35,205 --> 01:49:35,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1227
01:49:35,686 --> 01:49:36,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1228
01:49:36,506 --> 01:49:46,209
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we do really feel like, well, you know, we'd really love like a, you know, like a visual arts or performing arts commons, like a small commons or something.

1229
01:49:47,069 --> 01:49:55,532
[SPEAKER_05]: If, you know, if we can justify it in the educational plan, then we can see if we can try to incorporate that into,

1230
01:49:56,889 --> 01:49:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: into the space summary.

1231
01:49:58,430 --> 01:50:08,377
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also going to be, you know, a discussion, negotiation kind of with the MSBA, you know, to tell them, yes, we do need this.

1232
01:50:09,058 --> 01:50:15,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of goes 50-50, like whether they'll say, okay, or no, put it back in the gross impact.

1233
01:50:15,522 --> 01:50:15,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1234
01:50:15,762 --> 01:50:16,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

1235
01:50:16,903 --> 01:50:17,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1236
01:50:17,824 --> 01:50:20,385
[SPEAKER_12]: It really emphasizes the importance of the end plan.

1237
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:20,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1238
01:50:23,812 --> 01:50:26,073
[SPEAKER_14]: is not letting me touch it.

1239
01:50:26,153 --> 01:50:29,194
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not letting Brian touch it.

1240
01:50:33,695 --> 01:50:34,775
[SPEAKER_12]: One last slide.

1241
01:50:35,596 --> 01:50:36,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Just quickly, next steps.

1242
01:50:38,196 --> 01:50:43,998
[SPEAKER_12]: So next month, the 22nd is our building committee meeting.

1243
01:50:45,118 --> 01:50:50,180
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have, well, between now and then, just some of the deliverables that we're working on.

1244
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,441
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about the programming and how the last day was

1245
01:50:54,086 --> 01:50:54,686
[SPEAKER_12]: today for that.

1246
01:50:54,706 --> 01:50:58,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We could be holding the educational envisioning programs as well.

1247
01:50:59,767 --> 01:51:01,388
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the existing conditions survey.

1248
01:51:01,448 --> 01:51:21,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're hoping to have a draft of that space summary that we kind of just walk through and then a draft of the existing conditions report as well, which again, will take some time to pull together, but we'll start getting some information over to the committee to start to review.

1249
01:51:23,215 --> 01:51:24,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will be our focus at the next meeting.

1250
01:51:24,976 --> 01:51:29,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I apparently missed the January meeting completely.

1251
01:51:29,098 --> 01:51:43,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, so we will be, uh, uh, that meeting on the ninth, uh, which is, I think why I highlighted this one was, uh, kind of, which again, we'd probably have to move, uh, that school committee.

1252
01:51:43,605 --> 01:51:45,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, but this will be kind of the first.

1253
01:51:46,527 --> 01:51:49,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Like kind of big draft of the, of the, of the PDP.

1254
01:51:49,993 --> 01:51:55,316
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, to, to kind of go through what we should have our, our comparative costs, um, at that point as well.

1255
01:51:56,136 --> 01:52:05,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so in early February is when we'll start to see, uh, the bigger document and hopefully, you know, we'll be walking you through it, uh, up to that point.

1256
01:52:05,841 --> 01:52:09,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's, um, you know, less daunting because it is a big document.

1257
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:17,567
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, so yeah, we'll, we'll clean up the SBC meeting dates, uh, make sure we have all those correct.

1258
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:19,871
[SPEAKER_12]: get those out to everybody.

1259
01:52:22,013 --> 01:52:30,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And just last on here, the end goal is approval of the PDP document on February 23rd.

1260
01:52:30,919 --> 01:52:34,702
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the kind of end goal for the PDP phase.

1261
01:52:37,244 --> 01:52:37,704
[SPEAKER_12]: That is it.

1262
01:52:37,724 --> 01:52:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, are there any last questions?

1263
01:52:43,128 --> 01:52:45,029
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've got a question.

1264
01:52:45,129 --> 01:52:47,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I was hoping it'd be addressed

1265
01:52:48,037 --> 01:52:55,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and I think it was in part when we talked about, uh, the, uh, the four focus groups and the boards going around.

1266
01:52:55,641 --> 01:53:03,066
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, one of the things I know that is the timeline for those, uh, um, groups, uh, is a series of four meetings that concluded in 27.

1267
01:53:03,326 --> 01:53:13,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and, and so due to that long timeline, I don't think that may be the forum for answering this question.

1268
01:53:13,972 --> 01:53:14,032
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

1269
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,141
[SPEAKER_15]: analyses of alternatives.

1270
01:53:16,201 --> 01:53:22,965
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some basic decisions that need to be made, and those decisions will drive costs.

1271
01:53:23,986 --> 01:53:32,392
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, there's undeniable trade-offs between capability and cost, and there's going to be a lot of small choices, but there's also going to be some pretty big ones.

1272
01:53:33,753 --> 01:53:41,738
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, the couple that kind of float around in my mind at this point in time, where we're still kind of developing concepts,

1273
01:53:42,597 --> 01:53:52,340
[SPEAKER_15]: is the choice between kind of a low sprawling structure versus a taller, more concentrated structure on a smaller footprint.

1274
01:53:53,701 --> 01:54:05,105
[SPEAKER_15]: There are trade-offs and, you know, the analysis of what's best, you know, that needs to be carried out in some form.

1275
01:54:06,125 --> 01:54:11,687
[SPEAKER_15]: And the question is, are the groups that we signed up for those forums or is it

1276
01:54:12,282 --> 01:54:16,244
[SPEAKER_15]: decision that's internal to SMMA and brief to us.

1277
01:54:17,485 --> 01:54:20,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Walk us through, if you can, briefly.

1278
01:54:20,307 --> 01:54:30,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we're running kind of over, and so there's not a lot of time, but I do want to get a sense of when those big decisions that will drive big costs are made.

1279
01:54:35,165 --> 01:54:38,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly this building committee is the one that is going to be making those decisions.

1280
01:54:39,047 --> 01:54:43,989
[SPEAKER_13]: So they will not be sort of making those decisions for anyone as part of the process.

1281
01:54:44,849 --> 01:54:52,053
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of when those decisions happen, the PDP phase really is not when anything is set.

1282
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:57,315
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can look at least out until June 25th, right?

1283
01:54:57,775 --> 01:55:03,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Of 2026 in terms of when the final decision needs to be made in terms of what direction to move forward with.

1284
01:55:03,816 --> 01:55:06,237
[SPEAKER_13]: and having sort of vetted all the pros and cons.

1285
01:55:06,257 --> 01:55:15,499
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a little bit more time that people are not necessarily focused on the February 23rd date of next year as a time where we have to make those decisions.

1286
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:30,524
[SPEAKER_13]: The advisory teams are really intended to look through their particular lens at some of these options that are put together and then make recommendations back to this committee in terms of what the preference is.

1287
01:55:30,764 --> 01:55:32,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that,

1288
01:55:32,743 --> 01:55:39,147
[SPEAKER_13]: That particular activity probably happens during the PSR phase, the second portion of the feasibility.

1289
01:55:40,147 --> 01:55:56,957
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of looking at the different options that are put on the table that we're going to carry through the PDP and include in the PDP, that will probably actually happen initially during that mysterious January meeting in terms of having an initial look at them to be able to provide some input

1290
01:55:57,417 --> 01:56:04,021
[SPEAKER_13]: and to provide the type of commentary that you're suggesting in terms of difference of height and width of the building.

1291
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:09,884
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll talk about different options for phasing, different extents of new construction versus additional renovation.

1292
01:56:10,685 --> 01:56:13,086
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll try to put as many of those on the table as possible.

1293
01:56:13,146 --> 01:56:23,292
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very typical for there not to just be three or four options in the PDP phase, but we've gone up to 18 options sometimes.

1294
01:56:23,859 --> 01:56:24,980
[SPEAKER_13]: when there's a lot of variables.

1295
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,301
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would say that there are a lot of variables here, right?

1296
01:56:27,321 --> 01:56:33,184
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of program pieces that there's going to be a lot of discussion on that we know are valued by the community.

1297
01:56:33,204 --> 01:56:36,445
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to talk about how are those going to be pulled forward?

1298
01:56:36,505 --> 01:56:37,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they renovation spaces?

1299
01:56:37,766 --> 01:56:39,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they new construction spaces?

1300
01:56:39,307 --> 01:56:40,027
[SPEAKER_13]: And what does that mean?

1301
01:56:41,168 --> 01:56:43,108
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to look at all those permutations.

1302
01:56:43,229 --> 01:56:52,273
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's going to be right at the beginning of the year where we're going to start putting all those on the table and just make some choices about which ones are going to get carried forward for study.

1303
01:56:53,015 --> 01:56:58,778
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the PSR phase, we really get into the detail of understanding, okay, what are the priorities?

1304
01:56:58,938 --> 01:57:03,360
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll start to vote as a committee here, which are the ones that move.

1305
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:14,705
[SPEAKER_13]: And usually it's, there's like a shortlisting process where we start with the, let's say it's 18 and we pull it down to three or five, whatever sort of manageable is, just because it's tough to go from 18 to one, right?

1306
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:19,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we want to talk through sort of where everyone's priorities are, because they're going to be a broad range, right?

1307
01:57:19,527 --> 01:57:21,928
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the day, it needs to be a consensus agreement

1308
01:57:22,326 --> 01:57:25,747
[SPEAKER_13]: by this committee in terms of what gets suggested and moved forward.

1309
01:57:25,787 --> 01:57:30,008
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a related question to that.

1310
01:57:30,128 --> 01:57:36,129
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know we have to have at least three options for MSBA being legal.

1311
01:57:36,629 --> 01:57:50,793
[SPEAKER_11]: But if bringing up the code and meeting minimum energy and heating standards was $300 million more than a new building, does MSBA get to say that is not one of your options anymore?

1312
01:57:51,506 --> 01:57:53,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we literally pick any of the options?

1313
01:57:54,248 --> 01:57:56,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can pick any of the options.

1314
01:57:57,050 --> 01:57:59,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Matt has a good way of describing it.

1315
01:57:59,412 --> 01:58:02,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to go ahead?

1316
01:58:02,614 --> 01:58:05,516
[SPEAKER_13]: You had a good answer to that question during the programming meetings.

1317
01:58:06,577 --> 01:58:08,098
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember what was going to happen.

1318
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:10,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I can sum it up.

1319
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:19,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, the code repair option, it's never going to be more expensive than a new construction option or addition renovation, just given the square footage that are there.

1320
01:58:19,506 --> 01:58:21,187
[SPEAKER_13]: But the other thing about the code repair option

1321
01:58:21,614 --> 01:58:28,036
[SPEAKER_13]: It's never been selected for any MSBA project that we're aware of, partly because it won't meet the goals of the educational plan.

1322
01:58:28,456 --> 01:58:30,037
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a key criteria.

1323
01:58:30,077 --> 01:58:34,879
[SPEAKER_13]: But the other reason is that MSBA won't participate in those costs.

1324
01:58:34,919 --> 01:58:37,800
[SPEAKER_13]: They won't contribute because it's not meeting the educational plan.

1325
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:47,383
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're basically would just be making a choice to not meet your educational goals and to take all of the payment on for the community, for the city, right?

1326
01:58:47,875 --> 01:58:55,719
[SPEAKER_13]: And which is just, it's not a good, it's really, that option is meant more as a baseline to understand, okay, what is it, what is the cost of not doing anything, right?

1327
01:58:55,779 --> 01:59:08,706
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're just going to fix what we have here, and usually that's very telling in terms of looking at order of magnitude of cost for an overall project, because it's, you're going to be spending a few hundred million dollars to not really achieve your goals.

1328
01:59:08,746 --> 01:59:10,707
[SPEAKER_13]: That doesn't, doesn't make a lot of sense usually.

1329
01:59:11,308 --> 01:59:17,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And one footnote, if you stay with VA is watching, they will participate in a cost if it meets the educational

1330
01:59:18,004 --> 01:59:19,645
[SPEAKER_10]: plan, which is highly unlikely.

1331
01:59:20,266 --> 01:59:20,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1332
01:59:20,606 --> 01:59:21,687
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the caveat.

1333
01:59:21,767 --> 01:59:24,469
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's very difficult to move the educational point.

1334
01:59:24,509 --> 01:59:27,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And the renovation phase, thank you, Jen, for clarifying.

1335
01:59:28,271 --> 01:59:28,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1336
01:59:28,832 --> 01:59:30,073
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very helpful.

1337
01:59:30,133 --> 01:59:41,121
[SPEAKER_11]: And knowing that we had these three options when I couldn't wrap my head around how we're just going to widen some doors and put in some elevators, like, oh, that's going to work.

1338
01:59:41,361 --> 01:59:42,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's information.

1339
01:59:43,462 --> 01:59:46,865
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had to live with this building until the end of time and you had to

1340
01:59:47,437 --> 01:59:51,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't even with escalation and took on projects bit by bit.

1341
01:59:51,739 --> 01:59:52,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a frame.

1342
01:59:52,619 --> 01:59:58,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?

1343
02:00:02,483 --> 02:00:03,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1344
02:00:04,644 --> 02:00:05,064
[SPEAKER_14]: So moved.

1345
02:00:05,925 --> 02:00:06,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

1346
02:00:06,565 --> 02:00:09,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Aaron.

1347
02:00:10,487 --> 02:00:10,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1348
02:00:11,027 --> 02:00:11,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll call the roll.

1349
02:00:11,867 --> 02:00:12,467

1350
02:00:12,507 --> 02:00:12,728

[SPEAKER_03]: Libby Brown?

1358
02:00:21,187 --> 02:00:21,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1363
02:00:27,441 --> 02:00:28,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Tracy Keene is absent.

1364
