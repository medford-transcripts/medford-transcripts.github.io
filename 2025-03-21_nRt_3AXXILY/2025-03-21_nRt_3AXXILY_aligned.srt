Here.

13
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:07,256
Present.

14
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:07,596
Ms.

16
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:08,717
Present.

18
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:09,777
Present.

19
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:10,958
Second the President's announcement.

20
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:12,539
All please rise and salute our flag.

21
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:25,228
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,253

Motion for approval.

Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

31
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,001

Motion for approval.

37
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,425
Motion for approval on the floor, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

38
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:54,206
All those in favor?

39
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:54,786

40
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:56,007
All those opposed?

41
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:57,668
Approval is granted.

42
00:00:58,588 --> 00:00:59,529
Report of secretaries.

43
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,350
There is none.

44
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:02,631
Report of committees.

45
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,572
None.

46
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:04,072
There are none.

47
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:06,834
Community participation.

48
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,356
No papers, Mr. Superintendent.

49
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:12,598
Report of the superintendent.

50
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,339
Please rise, Mr. Superintendent.

51
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:22,225
So Madam Mayor and members of the committee,

52
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,595
Distributed to you this evening a report on the call that was received at Ventric High School this morning at about 9 o'clock.

53
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,917
It was a robo call, an automated call.

54
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:38,220
About eight other school districts in the area received the same call.

55
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:43,123
Most of them stayed in place and didn't respond to it.

56
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:50,628
We have had extensive discussions with state police, fire, and others about the appropriate responses to these matters.

57
00:01:52,330 --> 00:02:00,151
have given you the Massachusetts State Police bomb threat, if you will, a short guide as to how we handle these things.

58
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:05,112
And on Thursday last, we actually had a workshop on it.

59
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,653
We will be continuing to talk about these things because they could become more frequent.

60
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:17,094
The one thing we can't let happen is we can't let people who are just mischievous just simply disrupt everyday school.

61
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:21,295
And this will happen throughout the Commonwealth if we just simply need to react.

62
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:31,161
On the other hand, it's critical that we evaluate every threat with great seriousness, and we do a thorough assessment.

63
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,002
After we got the threat, we did a sweep of the building.

64
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,243
We used other methodologies to book.

65
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:39,324
We used our cameras and other things to see if anything unusual was around.

66
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:43,346
And we determined that this was really not a high-level threat.

67
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:44,467
It was a very low-level threat.

68
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:48,508
And we put it out and moved on.

69
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,850
Since that time, the headmaster has notified the faculty and students.

70
00:02:53,016 --> 00:03:00,139
Headmaster is sending out a robocall to parents this evening, which will tell them how it was handled and what was going on.

71
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:06,581
So this seems to be the latest in the forms of school disruption that's taking place.

72
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,502
We won't take anything seriously.

73
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:13,704
If we think something is a little bit more involved, we will take it seriously and act appropriately.

74
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:19,846
I don't want to discuss too much right now because I don't want to let anybody know all the trigger points that we would have.

75
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:33,508
I have tentatively scheduled with your approval on February 10th a meeting with the police department and other school and community safety officials for the purposes of talking about school security and safety.

76
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,952
That was the first night that everyone could agree on, which was February 10th.

77
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:39,573
It's a Wednesday.

78
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,535
Now we'll schedule other meetings as we go forward.

79
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:50,321
It'll be a committee of the whole and topics like this will come up and we'll hear from the professionals as to why they feel one way or another when these things come in.

80
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,344
So I'm happy to take any questions you may have.

81
00:03:54,625 --> 00:04:02,549
Otherwise, we'll continue to follow our protocols and continue to consult with police, fire, and other public safety officials.

82
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,552
Mr. Benedetto, through you to the superintendent.

83
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:12,275
Mr. Superintendent, do we, it says here that every school should have a bomb threat response plan.

84
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:13,722
Do we have all this?

85
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,442
We have it.

86
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:17,643
When was the last time it was updated?

87
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:19,063
We went over it the other day.

88
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:27,905
As you remember, I told you we sent a group to a multi-hazard activity run by DESI maybe a couple weeks ago.

89
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:28,745
They went over it again.

90
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:29,906
So will you be updating that?

91
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:30,666
We're comfortable.

92
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:35,487
I mean, basically, these things are not rocket science, what you do, but we have all these things.

93
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:43,129
We'll show you some things, I need to be careful that are not up to the general public, because I don't want people gaming our protocols.

94
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,791
And did we do an auto call to a reverse call to our parents?

95
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,973
Headmaster sent an auto call out, and sent one out this afternoon to- Just so parents are aware that this is happening.

96
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,215
Yeah, I got a call, Erin, before I left the house, and my parents- Point of information, Ms.

97
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:56,355
Pritz?

98
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,329
Yes, point of information.

99
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,610
That's great, I'm glad to hear that.

100
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,651
Communication is key in these situations when safety of people's children are involved.

101
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:11,732
So I think that that should be one of our main things when we have this situation going on.

102
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:15,572
And then parents can make choices based on what they're comfortable with as well.

103
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:23,674
What we've said before, and I'll say it again, it's very important that we don't, like at 9 o'clock, get it over with and suck on our parents because we want people coming up.

104
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:26,554
And that creates more confusion and more chaos.

105
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:34,461
If we felt there was any kind of danger, we wouldn't wait to move parents into the place, we'd be moving the youngsters very quickly.

106
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:44,569
But there's a need to maintain calm, there's a need to maintain composure, and for everyone to act professionally when these things happen.

107
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:47,392
Otherwise, you create more problems than you solve.

108
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:51,534
And then everyone starts to, you know, think, well, gee, we can disrupt the place.

109
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:55,995
Years ago, pulling fire alarms was a sport in most high schools.

110
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:59,635
You know, people would pull the fire alarms, and everyone would have to do it.

111
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:03,476
Now, back then, they weren't the bomb threats, the shooter threats, and things that we have today.

112
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:06,657
But the same principle applies.

113
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:15,459
If we let people continuously disrupt our operations without good cause, without real understanding of what's taking place, then we just play into their hands.

114
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,620
Mr. Skerry.

115
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,262
I had one further question.

116
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:29,806
Maybe you could update the committee with that bomb threat response plan at our committee of the whole safety meeting.

117
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:30,866
We'll discuss it at that time.

118
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:31,447
Thank you.

119
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:36,969
I just don't want to put out major documents that other people can read into and perhaps even get published.

120
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:40,951
And now we don't have the benefit of knowing what we do when people can get it.

121
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,632
Go into executive session if necessary.

122
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:43,592
Thank you.

123
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:44,413
OK.

124
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:51,688
Update report on Bloomberg Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

125
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:56,549
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, Richard Trotter is here.

126
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:08,332
He's going to talk to you about the Center for Citizen and Social Responsibility, and funded by the Bloomberg Foundation, and some of the terrific stuff that's going on.

127
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,553
So he's here to talk to you with some of the students and some of the other people that are involved.

128
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:15,295
Good evening.

129
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:22,117
Richard Trotter, Director of Media, Technology, Finance, and now the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

130
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:26,258
So welcome to the new members, Ms.

131
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:27,018
Creston, Ms.

132
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:27,478
Bustone.

133
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:32,819
I haven't seen you personally, but welcome to the committee, and I look forward to working with you.

134
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,020
Thank you.

135
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,782
So the goal of the Center is, the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, is to develop global citizens.

136
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:51,585
Now, those are people to identify with being part of emerging world community and whose actions contribute to building of its values and principles.

137
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:57,707
That's kind of a narrow definition, but it gets more into other issues.

138
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:11,173
So we're talking about developing integrated social emotional learning, financial literacy, citizenship, career awareness, resiliency, and social intelligence as part of our initiative.

139
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:23,630
going to be hosting a symposium April 2nd on resiliency, but really on proactive steps for parents in terms of dealing with addiction.

140
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,671
And I'll let Michael Skroka talk about that.

141
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:29,552
Michael's here as an administrative intern to the project.

142
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:35,693
He's done a lot of work with the students, and he'll be coming up following my little presentation.

143
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:40,314
We also have an outreach coordinator, Tim Klein.

144
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,615
Couldn't be here, but he's going to be meeting with the community.

145
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:47,794
to spread the message of what we're doing with this center.

146
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:54,538
So I sent to you an outline of all the different activities that have taken place the last two years.

147
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:58,680
Now, the report says students will do certain things.

148
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,121
This is what was posted.

149
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,302
They actually took place.

150
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,703
These events have taken place and have been completed.

151
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,565
And some are being conducted right now.

152
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:18,458
Things, for instance, the center has worked with Tisch College to do a curriculum unit at the high school level on empathy.

153
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,480
Hopefully, students will learn to be more empathetic by doing this unit.

154
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:30,843
Down the road, we hope to get those kinds of activities at the elementary level where it would be most effective.

155
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:37,626
We also are doing some online learning on financial literacy and digital literacy.

156
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:38,927
That's going on right now.

157
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:47,235
There are, I gave a number to the superintendent, like over 500 students have participated on the online activities.

158
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:54,777
And I think there's around 280 or so students who are involved in clubs and activities for the past two years.

159
00:09:54,797 --> 00:10:00,259
Right now we have a financial ventures and entrepreneurship activity going on.

160
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,901
And the students are going to be competing right now in the stock market challenge through the University of New Hampshire.

161
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:09,102
And they're going to be doing an entrepreneurship challenge later in the year.

162
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:13,387
And they're going to the Boston Business Journal for a field trip.

163
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:27,973
We have students working on composition of music, creating music that supports the mission of the center, talking about sensitivity and tolerance and empathy.

164
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:31,114
Last year, we did a poetry club.

165
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:32,595
We're doing it again this year also.

166
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:38,217
Students are writing poetry that somehow deals with an issue that might affect their own lives.

167
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:50,453
We have an eyewitness challenge going on with students that are developing projects around being involved and what it means to be in a situation and empathizing with those people.

168
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:57,956
We have an Ethics Bowl team that we're supporting through the Social Studies Department that's going to be competing again in a competition later in the year.

169
00:10:57,996 --> 00:11:08,462
We have an immigration project that took place last year and a social awareness project, again, last year, which students completed projects about social awareness.

170
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:25,256
We have a Mustang report, which is the magazine, TV magazine that reports on student activities and highlighting positive contributions that students are making to society and to the school, and also the advisors who work with them.

171
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:36,900
We did profiles of Americans last year where we did videos of people in Medford who were somehow

172
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:42,359
important people in what happens in the district, in the city, I mean, in terms of veterans and things like that.

173
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:54,203
Learning Brain was about studying the effects of how we can improve learning by getting students to mirror what's going on in the world.

174
00:11:54,223 --> 00:12:06,967
For instance, there's a thing called a mirror neuron where students, actually not just students, but people, when you watch a movie and you start crying, that's the mirror neuron, and that's a good way of reaching students to try to have a positive impact on the way they think.

175
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,931
At the middle school, we had the Model UN going on.

176
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,472
It's going on this year.

177
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:14,373
Model UN is a competition.

178
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:19,035
And the students have developed their own presentations and going in the spring.

179
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:24,317
At the elementary school, we had a very strong plan to support our troops.

180
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:34,982
And if you look at the flyer that I sent to you, there were pictures of students who were people, veterans, and sending things to veterans who were out in the field.

181
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:47,781
The Buddy Benches Program, which was coordinated by Michael Skowalker and his students, helped create those benches at the elementary schools for students who have a need to talk to somebody.

182
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,922
And that's going on now, and Michael can talk about that.

183
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,545
So that's a quick overview of all the different activities.

184
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,806
There's more to them, but I don't want to take too much time.

185
00:12:56,826 --> 00:13:00,708
But I'll be glad to report any of those activities later on in the school year.

186
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,292
Going forward, on March 15, Deb Goldberg is going to do

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,247
the keynote speaker at the Symposium on Preparing for College, Finances, and Academics.

188
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:20,915
It's going to be at the Glynn Middle School, and I'll give you a reminder of the date, but it's March 15th, and Deb's going to be the keynote speaker.

189
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:24,920
On April 2nd, we have the Symposium on Addiction

190
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,178
which I think you have a flyer in your pamphlets.

191
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:34,680
And also, we have a keynote speaker, Dr. Robert Brooks, who's renowned in the field of psychology.

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:49,785
And his specialty is teaching students and people to be resilient, which was a key component in preventing students, and even adults, from getting involved in some kind of an addiction or bad habit.

193
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:54,687
OK, so I just want to give you a quick history, and I'll be done.

194
00:13:55,803 --> 00:14:00,827
Um, so the center was created two years ago, um, with the funding from the Bloomberg foundation.

195
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:09,234
And, um, uh, when we received the money, I went to the person I thought would be a good resource to determine what we should do with it.

196
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:16,480
So I went to see Roy Belson and we sat down and we've been colleagues for a long time, a really long time.

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,144
And we also share the same vision and that's the development of global citizens.

198
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:23,185
We both believe that,

199
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:30,060
Education is much more than academics and learning ABCs and mathematical formulas.

200
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:42,707
Our role is to develop global citizens, students, people who will be successful and be positive contributors to society.

201
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:50,671
So I just want to quote a couple of famous people who sort of mirror what was just said.

202
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:56,068
Abdul Kalam was an Indian philosopher.

203
00:14:56,108 --> 00:15:00,930
He said, the purpose of education is to make good human beings with skill and expertise.

204
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,071
Enlightened human beings can be created by teachers.

205
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:05,291
And that's what we are.

206
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:06,472
And that's what we hope to do.

207
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,873
Helen Keller said, the highest result of education is tolerance.

208
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,975
And that's also what we're trying to teach.

209
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:22,818
Einstein said, the world is a dangerous place to live, not because of people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.

210
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,987
And that's what we want.

211
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:30,109
We want active citizens who work to solve problems, not create them.

212
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,430
Our future is in the hands of our students.

213
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,172
We must do our best to prepare them to do the best for humanity.

214
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:48,377
The last quote is from Anne Frank, when she said, how wonderful is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.

215
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,038
And that's what we plan to do.

216
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,719
That's in closing.

217
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:55,308
Thank you for your time.

218
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:59,130
I want to pass the baton to Michael Sporker.

219
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,731
Michael has been an incredible worker.

220
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:03,172
The students have been incredible.

221
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:07,675
And we wouldn't be, I think, we wouldn't have gotten to this point without them.

222
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,697
So before Michael comes up, do you have any questions?

223
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,879
Madam President?

224
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,099
Yeah.

225
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,861
Rich, could you just tell us the date again in March?

226
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:17,761
15th.

227
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:19,642
And where is it going to be?

228
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:20,363
McGlynn.

229
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:21,524
What, the McGlynn?

230
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:22,304
And the time?

231
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:22,364
7th.

232
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,674
So March 15th at seven o'clock at the McGlynn.

233
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:27,834
Okay.

234
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:28,234
Thank you.

235
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:32,156
I just want to say, Mr. Trotted, this is terrific.

236
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,456
And I love all the little programs that are mentioned here.

237
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:35,477
It's terrific.

238
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:35,957
I love it.

239
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,898
Just wanted to tell you that it's, I just loved it all.

240
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:42,039
Thank you.

241
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:42,699
Thank you.

242
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:53,083
Um, first of all, this is, I love the programming and I love preparing our children to be citizens of the world and not just, um, in educating them in that manner as well.

243
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,340
I had a few questions.

244
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:04,106
Is this based in their curriculum throughout the school day, or is it certain classes that it's happening in, or is it a group after school that's taking the lead on this?

245
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:06,448
I'm not really clear on that.

246
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,910
Most of the things that I listed were after school activities.

247
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,253
Some were in school, the ethics part of that's in the curriculum.

248
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:21,478
We do have some social emotional curriculum at the K through eights that we're looking at, the Michigan model, and the second step.

249
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,178
Rachel Perry's part of a group that we're working with.

250
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:34,179
Ideally, down the road, it's really important that we get into the elementary schools as part of the curriculum, because that's the greatest effect that we can have.

251
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,465
And maybe have to prevent adolescents from going in the wrong direction.

252
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:47,832
So ultimately, I mean, we haven't done as much as the elementary that I would want, but we're still on baby steps.

253
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:51,676
So who's taken the empathy unit that's already been developed?

254
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,846
Miss Louv at the high school's classes we're doing that.

255
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,928
So the English, all the English classes?

256
00:17:58,988 --> 00:17:59,208
Yeah.

257
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:01,390
And they're doing it again this year.

258
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,051
So that's available to other teachers.

259
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:10,738
So we're going to say store and have a data clearinghouse for curriculum issues like that.

260
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:14,221
And so the more we have in the store, we're also buying some, uh,

261
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,529
materials, books, and materials for teachers.

262
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:21,131
And we also have a room for the high school.

263
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:26,834
It's called the Center for Social Responsibility, Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

264
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:32,558
It's really the Bloomberg Room, but we can't say that because he doesn't want a name after his family.

265
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,580
But that was funded by Michael Bloomberg, that room.

266
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,324
So to continue funding, I was talking to Mr. Skoker a little bit about this.

267
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:44,505
In order for this program to continue,

268
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:45,913
What are you hoping?

269
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:48,234
How are we going to fund this program?

270
00:18:49,175 --> 00:19:03,647
The goal is to have a resume of good things going on and having an impact and then seeking funding as any non-profit would so that it doesn't cost the school district any money.

271
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:05,909
We still have some money left.

272
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:13,635
We can get through the school year, maybe early next year, but probably in a few months we'll be going back to

273
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:17,607
Mr. Bloomberg of the foundation and seeing if we get some more funds.

274
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,414
Um, hopefully they'll see that the positive impact is worth the investment.

275
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:24,539
And I had one final, I'm sorry.

276
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:49,843
So your event that's being taken place on Saturday, April 2nd, I think it's a great event for this whole community to hear really loud and very clearly that this keynote speaker is here to help anyone who has parents and teachers and anybody working with anyone throughout the community that has ideas to be proactive steps.

277
00:19:50,582 --> 00:20:03,046
for people and resources for people who are dealing with anyone who is in addiction or, you know, possibility of ever becoming an addicted personality.

278
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:08,127
So I really want to emphasize Saturday, April 2nd, 1215 to 5 o'clock.

279
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,368
You have professional schedule to be there.

280
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,389
I know high school students are going to be speaking.

281
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:19,736
I have a suggestion to contact Cheryl Delaforo.

282
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:26,540
She works with parents, and I have her contact if you need it.

283
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,902
She runs a parents group on Tuesday nights.

284
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:40,188
So I really believe that they would love to come if they were invited, and that they could be a great resource, plus the program that's happening could be a great resource for them.

285
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:42,450
So I think it could really work well for both.

286
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,743
So I really encourage that piece and if I can help facilitate that in any way, please let me know.

287
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:50,184
And thank you for this.

288
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:54,726
I think this is a wonderful program for the students of MedFit and the community as a whole.

289
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:55,787
Thank you.

290
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:57,568
A couple of things.

291
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:05,432
The first thing is there's so many wonderful different activities here, but I was concerned because when I looked at these I thought of a certain

292
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:10,394
a group of very motivated students who would be interested in these.

293
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:14,677
How are we making sure that we're outreaching to other students and widening the circle?

294
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,519
Well, all the clubs and activities are open to all students.

295
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,801
So everything you see on that list was publicized by the advisors for the whole school.

296
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:27,383
Do we have any idea how many kids have participated?

297
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:32,946
Yeah, clubs and activities, I think between 280 to 300.

298
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:36,053
That's good.

299
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:43,639
And the other thing on this symposium, which is taking place, it says there's limited spots.

300
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,083
Is that limited by the number of people who could fit into the little theater?

301
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:48,984
OK.

302
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:50,625
Yeah, and we also have daycare.

303
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:52,567
But that's limited also.

304
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:56,270
Marie Cassidy, who's on the committee, I should let Michael talk about this.

305
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,532
But anyway, there's daycare.

306
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,475
So should I call Michael up now?

307
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:02,775
Yes.

308
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:04,737
Yes.

309
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:07,840
He's right there.

310
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,503
He's not that far.

311
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:16,356
I'll let Michael answer the questions on the event because he's done a lot of work coordinating it.

312
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:17,636
I'll stay here.

313
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:20,597
Hi, my name is Michael Sporka.

314
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:21,997
I teach Spanish at the high school.

315
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:29,660
I also am the advisor to the Gay-Straight Alliance and the administrative intern for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

316
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,023
Today I'm here to talk a little bit about the April 2nd event, the symposium, which we're entitling Proactive Steps and Resources for Parents and Teachers.

317
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:43,008
It's going to take place at Medford High School from 1245 to 5 o'clock.

318
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:45,910
It's April 2nd, that's a Saturday.

319
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:54,479
The event will, our target audience is for parents and teachers with children in grades K through 8.

320
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,481
The focus is to provide resources for parents to effectively raise resilient children and adolescents.

321
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:05,402
Our keynote speaker is Dr. Robert Brooks.

322
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:06,662
He's a clinical psychologist.

323
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,503
He will be speaking first.

324
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:19,405
After the keynote speaker, we are inviting the symposium participants to attend two of the five workshops that we're offering.

325
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:23,286
The workshops are approximately 40 minutes each.

326
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:37,057
And after the two workshops, we are going to be inviting those participants to attend a resource fair, which will be held in the Medford High School lobby in the foyer there.

327
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:40,800
There are five workshops available, like I mentioned.

328
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,662
Those five workshops are as follows.

329
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:47,546
What parents and teachers can do about substance abuse in the home and the classroom.

330
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,569
Preventative family strategies is the second.

331
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,165
Identifying substances is the third.

332
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:58,127
The fourth is identifying signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents.

333
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:02,550
And finally, anxiety and depression, how substance abuse impacts young children.

334
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:09,674
So the idea here is that the participants will hear the keynote speaker who will be speaking on resiliency, Dr. Robert Brooks.

335
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:13,015
And then afterward, they will attend two.

336
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:15,435
So our registration process is as follows.

337
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:22,096
After tonight, and hopefully soon, we'll be posting the registration form on the Medford Public website.

338
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:25,517
The registration form has already been completed, we're just waiting for approval.

339
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:36,779
And on the registration form, they have a choice of their top three workshops, and we will hopefully be able to give them their top two choices because they'll be attending two out of the five workshops.

340
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:43,885
So pretty much what we're trying to do here, like I said, is raise awareness for this cause.

341
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:48,226
It is something that is, I think, prevalent in the community.

342
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:54,368
And I think this is especially important just to bring awareness.

343
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,834
So I'd like to say thank you.

344
00:24:57,854 --> 00:24:59,635
We've had a committee going for this event.

345
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:03,717
There's a lot of planning, and we're still in the process of getting things going.

346
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,959
And I'd like to say thank you to the following committee members.

347
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:16,585
Rich Trotta, Jim Riccardi, Rachel Perry, Tony Vento, Jeff Lapin, Marie Cassidy, Brooke Hoyt, and Penny Foniole.

348
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:19,447
So we've been meeting frequently to plan this event.

349
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,889
We're still currently meeting to make sure that this event is a success.

350
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:27,133
A couple other things I wanted to mention too.

351
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:34,555
We also have 24 students that are very active with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

352
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:39,716
Three of them are sitting to my left here, and I just wanted to say thank you to them as well.

353
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:52,618
These are three of 24 amazing students, but these three, so Ramon here on my left, Ramon actually, Ramon Fernandez designed the logo for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

354
00:25:53,258 --> 00:26:00,081
He actually spent a lot of his December vacation working on it, and so I'm very thankful for his efforts.

355
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:02,821
This is Serena Doe.

356
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:15,426
We are currently in the works of creating a, it's almost done actually, a website for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, and Serena has single-handedly done that, so I'm very thankful to her as well.

357
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:18,148
And then here is Felipe Oliveira.

358
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:23,512
Felipe is the one who designed the flyer for this actual event.

359
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:28,676
So these are three of 24, but we're very thankful for them.

360
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,879
And like Rich said, we wouldn't be anywhere without the students.

361
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:35,682
The students are integral process to making the center such a success.

362
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:39,545
And it's such a pleasure for me to be able to work with them every single day.

363
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:42,467
I love my job so much.

364
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:50,533
One more thing that I'd like to mention before I'm done is we also have another event coming up this Wednesday, which the mayor is going to be speaking at.

365
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:53,435
I have a class called K-Straight Alliance.

366
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:56,157
It's a mini, and it's two out of the six days.

367
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,340
I have nine students in the class, and the students have actually

368
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,121
created substance abuse prevention projects.

369
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:08,823
There are four that they're going to be unveiling on this Wednesday at 6.30 in the chambers here.

370
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:09,763
It's from 6.30 to 8.

371
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:24,389
Also, after the mayor speaks and we hear the projects, we have two keynote speakers, Elena Jurleo and Delaney Tivenon, both who have lost family members to substance abuse and will be speaking on their struggles and also successes.

372
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,131
So we would really love for you to come.

373
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:30,854
I think you've already received an email from Brooke Hoyt on that topic.

374
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:34,057
It's again Wednesday, 6.30 in the chambers.

375
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,381
I want to also say it's been a pleasure to work with Rich.

376
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:42,566
He's wonderful and I'm so thankful to have this opportunity to be his administrative intern this year.

377
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,509
So at this point, I will welcome any questions you have.

378
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:50,788
First of all, Michael, I want to say thank you.

379
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:52,089
Thank you to you, to Rich.

380
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:59,053
This is amazing, because this is, I know, this was very critical.

381
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:02,715
It's been a critical topic for the last few years.

382
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:10,800
It unfortunately came to really fruition last year when we did lose a lot of our students.

383
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,642
I know that we lost students prior to that.

384
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:19,212
But last year it really hit home when we lost a lot of students, one right after the other.

385
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:25,621
You just mentioned a few families, that it was one week, one right after the other.

386
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:34,194
And you just mentioned three of our students out of 24 that are participating in this.

387
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:37,996
And this is when we talk about bringing the community together.

388
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:40,597
This is when we talk about really working together.

389
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:45,400
And not only in administration, but when we talk about all tiers.

390
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:53,543
And when we talk about all tiers and bringing everyone together and making it not only into the community, but making it really feel like it's family.

391
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:56,965
So I really, truly want to say thank you.

392
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:03,449
for that, because that in itself and the spirit of that brings it all to where it's supposed to be.

393
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:07,312
So I thank you for that.

394
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:26,525
And I really want to tell the kids, not only to the three of you, but just to bring it back to the school and say how much we do appreciate what you've done and how much it really does mean to all of us when you all stand up and really show what it means to you, because it is important that you all show

395
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:29,787
and express how important it is.

396
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:32,489
So I thank you for that.

397
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:33,550
I really, truly do.

398
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,535
So I just want to say our support is with you, and I'll definitely be there Wednesday night.

399
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:45,539
Mr. Scorger, thank you for all of your work.

400
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:54,346
One of the things which I know is that doing an event like this takes a lot of work, and turning out people is not always

401
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:59,171
the easiest thing because there's always so many different other commitments that people have.

402
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:05,416
Are you releasing this to the different Rotary and different groups in town?

403
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:11,121
And I'm just wondering what your outreach is.

404
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,492
Yeah, we are going to be doing a robocall.

405
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,713
That's the first thing we're going to do.

406
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:19,834
We're also going to be extending this.

407
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:23,396
Team Medford is working collaboratively with us.

408
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:27,859
Actually, on Wednesday's event as well, Team Medford is going to be collaborating.

409
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:31,501
We're collaborating with a bunch of local organizations.

410
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:42,648
So, for example, at the resource fair that I spoke of, after the two workshops that the participants will attend, we're going to be having many local organizations that we're contacting

411
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:52,351
come and be there and through our connections with those local organizations and through our connections to Team Medford, we plan to have a full event.

412
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:53,371
That's excellent.

413
00:30:54,411 --> 00:31:01,793
I also was wondering whether teachers who attend would be eligible for a PDP point or is there any way?

414
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:02,853
I can't do that.

415
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:03,574
It was a shot.

416
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:14,277
Mr. Benedetto?

417
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:21,481
My question was very similar to my colleagues, but I also wanted to know if we were sending this flyer home at least to our middle school students.

418
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:32,969
I know it's expensive to do that, but even if we backpack it through the mayor to the superintendent, can we approve that to happen for this to go to our middle school parents in backpacks?

419
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:33,589
It'll go up.

420
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:34,850
It'll go up.

421
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,010
Okay.

422
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:41,513
Also, we are speaking at the Rotary Club next week.

423
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:44,679
So that's another thing.

424
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:46,422
Terrific.

425
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:47,985
And we do have the paper present.

426
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:53,789
And I do think doing the robocalls really does let people know in the community.

427
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:57,892
So thank you very much for all your effort and that goes as well to the students.

428
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:02,936
They're actually sporting their new jackets that they got today for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

429
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,077
So I'm assuming they feel really cool.

430
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:14,061
I just want to ask, as far as, I know it includes the elementary and the middle schools, why not the high school?

431
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:19,263
Is that part of the criteria of the grant, or is that something that you just didn't want to focus on?

432
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:21,564
Because I know that the high school students are involved.

433
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:28,426
Our focus is K through 8, but we would never say no to a parent with a kid in the high school.

434
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,067
Absolutely not.

435
00:32:29,107 --> 00:32:31,888
So really anybody, focus K through 8, because

436
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,531
You know, prevention starts early.

437
00:32:35,811 --> 00:32:37,573
So we want to make sure that that's our focus.

438
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,815
But anybody in the high school can also attend.

439
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:40,076
OK.

440
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:40,816
Thank you.

441
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:43,960
Well, thank you both for being here this evening.

442
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,005
Thank you, Ramon, Serena, and Felicity for all your hard work and beautiful work with that.

443
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:51,588
And I'm assuming the billboard has something to do with it.

444
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:56,638
So you might have seen the billboard that we did on 93 with Medford High School.

445
00:32:56,698 --> 00:33:01,941
And that's one of the projects that's actually already unveiled on 93, but we want to show you.

446
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,742
And it has our mini.

447
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:11,846
We have two members in the mini who designed the billboard and went to Team Medford, collaborated with them, and were able to get the billboard onto 93.

448
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:15,748
And if you drive by heading toward Boston, you'll see it.

449
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,029
Excellent work.

450
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:18,049
Thank you very much.

451
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:19,050
One more thing.

452
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,831
Motion to accept and place on file.

453
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:21,471
One more comment.

454
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:22,912
I just want to note that

455
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,204
We have three global citizens right now.

456
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:25,786
That's right.

457
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:38,756
It is a motion to receive and place on file the update report on Bloomberg Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

458
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:39,637
All those in favor?

459
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:40,317
Aye.

460
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,197
All those opposed?

461
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,057
The paper is placed on file.

462
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,738
Report on district and schools accountability 2015.

463
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:47,618
Mr. Superintendent.

464
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:56,140
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, we're calling on our Deputy Superintendent to take you through the report on district and school 2015 accountability levels.

465
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:58,621
It's a very complex area.

466
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:02,582
A lot is changing and we want to make sure you're fully aware.

467
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,621
Yes, the word is complex.

468
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:26,069
If you had a chance to look through some of the data and the reports attached, we have been working with this, a team of us, trying to wrap our arms around the whole process and make some sense out of all of the data that we're given, because oftentimes it's contradictory, as I will be pointing out to you in some of the sheets that are attached.

469
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:28,610
We put together this report.

470
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,011
It has many purposes.

471
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:40,197
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has publicly released their 2015 accountability determination.

472
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,220
All schools are given a determination as well as all school districts.

473
00:34:46,781 --> 00:35:00,968
The purpose of this report is to explain to you what the accountability system is made up of and the various changes because even though this is a system that we were held to a target after four years,

474
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:09,167
Throughout the system, throughout the years, there have been changes and that really is very concerning as we move forward.

475
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:16,572
We also want to report to you on Medford's accountability status of all of the schools and the district.

476
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:24,357
And then we want to interpret, to the best of our ability, the findings based on the data we have received.

477
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:29,140
And so again, we've been working with many of our administrators on all of this.

478
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,900
First of all, the accountability system.

479
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:45,703
In 2011, Massachusetts applied for and was allowed a waiver of exemption from the provision of the federal law, No Child Left Behind.

480
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:52,624
This particular law required that all students reach proficiency levels by the school year 2013-2014.

481
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:55,024
Massachusetts determined the level of proficiency

482
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:01,405
as the proficiency level of MCAS.

483
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:11,011
Every year, since that accountability system started, the bar would go higher because, again, the goal was for everyone to be at least 240 by 2014.

484
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:25,080
And as that date came closer and closer and school districts throughout the country were not making this benchmark, that's why the waiver was put into effect as an offering.

485
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:27,462
So Massachusetts, again,

486
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:35,752
had to identify an alternative accountability system, and that had to be subject to the approval of the federal government.

487
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:53,817
So they did, we did, and the new accountability system, rather than having all students reach proficiency by a certain year, was to have all students, well, have all schools reduce what was called the proficiency gap among the different subgroups.

488
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:58,318
The gap was supposed to be, is supposed to be reduced by half

489
00:36:58,847 --> 00:36:59,928
by the year 2017.

490
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:08,973
So again, as we move closer and closer to 2017, the expectation bar is higher and higher in closing that gap.

491
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:20,461
We are now on an annual basis held to this new system, which rates schools and districts from levels one to five.

492
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:25,384
One being the best, five is not where you want to be because that's when the state comes in and intervenes.

493
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:39,524
Although we get individual accountability ratings for each of our schools, the rating of the school district can be no higher than the rating of the lowest performing school.

494
00:37:40,244 --> 00:37:46,809
Okay, again, this is rather punitive in nature and something that we're held to.

495
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:55,335
Accountability ratings are based on a statistic called the PPI, the Progress and Performance Index.

496
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:59,981
which is a complex formula which is very hard to decipher.

497
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:14,990
And DESE simply has said to us it's based on seven indicators that include performance on MCAS over a four-year period, student growth percentiles, science performance, and then other indicators.

498
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,592
Now, what those other indicators are, we have not been able to get clarity around that.

499
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:24,735
Each year, the target number for closing the gap among the subgroups

500
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:30,515
increases since the goal of closing the gap by half is 2017.

501
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:36,239
This year, the target number, and I'm not sure how they arrived at that, was the number 75.

502
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:43,784
OK, so if you're going to meet your target, you had to hit that with all of your subgroups and, again, as an aggregate in the school.

503
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:54,551
This year, for the first time, school districts this past year in the Commonwealth were allowed to have students take either MCAS or PAR.

504
00:38:55,743 --> 00:39:00,405
Those districts that opted for PARCC were held harmless in accountability ratings.

505
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:07,268
Despite being held harmless, they were designated ratings along with the districts that took MCAS.

506
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:16,231
Logically, there were questions related to using the same rating system for two very different assessment instruments.

507
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:23,474
DESE's answer to this is that they have developed a formula, a special formula,

508
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:26,374
called the equi-percentile linking.

509
00:39:30,194 --> 00:39:35,136
To date, we do not have the magical ingredients for this formula.

510
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:45,138
And we remain very skeptical, since according to psychometrics, if you do a valid longitudinal comparison, all the variables have to stay constant.

511
00:39:45,478 --> 00:39:47,579
You can't keep changing things from year to year.

512
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:49,519
And that's what they've been doing with this.

513
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:53,260
So again, it doesn't make sense from a perspective of assessment.

514
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:54,730
logic.

515
00:39:56,751 --> 00:40:08,774
Again, how school districts can be rated on the same scale using two very different testing systems remains to us perplexing and we don't have a good answer as to how they are equating the two.

516
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:21,837
While the final goal for performance is based upon growth over four years, DESE has made several changes related to this year's reports and plans for additional changes for 2016.

517
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:25,905
These changes include the following.

518
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:32,087
They have created a brand new subgroup called the Economically Disadvantaged.

519
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:44,249
This subgroup replaces the former low-income subgroup, which was reported through 2014 and was determined based on student eligibility for free and reduced lunch.

520
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:52,671
The new Economically Disadvantaged group only includes students who participate in one or more of the state

521
00:40:53,176 --> 00:41:05,668
administered programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program, Transitional Assistance for Families and Dependent Children, DCF Foster Care Program, and MassHealth.

522
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,590
So those youngsters are in that subgroup.

523
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,532
And I will add that a youngster can be in multiple subgroups.

524
00:41:11,393 --> 00:41:17,579
They could be in the economically disadvantaged, they could be in the special education, they could be in the ELL.

525
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,931
Again, one student can be counted.

526
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:23,692
The score can be counted multiple times.

527
00:41:24,212 --> 00:41:25,093
So that was one change.

528
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:26,013
They changed the subgroup.

529
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:30,235
So now we get reported out in a subgroup that didn't exist in a previous year.

530
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:39,839
Secondly, and this is very troubling to me, they're changing the number of students required in a subgroup to report out.

531
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,480
It used to be 40.

532
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,601
You would not get a report.

533
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,622
Let's say you had a subgroup ELL students.

534
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:47,583
Unless you had 40 ELL students in that school,

535
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,881
you would not have a report on how those students did.

536
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:56,585
And that's logical, too, because the smaller the sample, the more skewed the results are going to be.

537
00:41:56,665 --> 00:42:01,927
If you have a sample of 40 kids, you have a pretty broad scope of students that are tested.

538
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:13,534
So what we learned over our discussions with DESE the past few weeks is that the minimum group for accountability determination in 2014 was moved to 30.

539
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:24,041
Even more troubling, 2015, it was 25, and lo and behold, they told us next year it's going to be 20.

540
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:33,827
This causes some real problems when you're really analyzing data, because the groups that we have 20 in now, we have no reporting out this year.

541
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:39,751
Unless we go back individual student by student, we don't know what that group is doing.

542
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,553
But next year, that might be reported out to us.

543
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:45,675
So again, changing these numbers is

544
00:42:46,337 --> 00:42:51,720
very difficult to justify, and it's very problematic to analyze.

545
00:42:53,982 --> 00:43:04,688
The other interesting thing was this year, the accountability system, the PPI, was awarding bonus points.

546
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:07,390
So we asked, how do you get bonus points?

547
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,672
Because bonus points are really very valuable and very important to us.

548
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:14,014
And we were told that bonus points are only given

549
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:24,625
when you move 10% of your students from warning slash failing to needs improvement or 10% of your students from proficient to advanced.

550
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:32,431
And as we sat in that meeting with our representative from DSAC, we were just aghast because we said, you mean we get nothing?

551
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:40,754
from moving students from Needs Improvement to Proficient, which is the whole goal of the system, as long as we have been doing this.

552
00:43:41,515 --> 00:43:48,061
We have moved a lot of students out of Need Improvement to Proficient, and we get nothing in terms of bonus points.

553
00:43:48,581 --> 00:43:50,703
And if you look at it numerically, think about it.

554
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:59,411
If you have 10 students in the winning category, and you have to move 10% out, and that's one kid, you get bonus points for moving one student up.

555
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:04,737
If you have a hundred students that needs improvement and you get them all to proficient, you get nothing.

556
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:06,458
Really fair.

557
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:07,978
It makes a lot of sense.

558
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:09,679
Makes no sense.

559
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:10,439
I'm sorry.

560
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:16,141
I've been in this business so long that it gets, I guess, more and more perplexing to me.

561
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:26,684
Okay, in terms of Medfit's accountability rating, we have some success stories and we have one problematic area that we're still working through.

562
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:32,260
The Bedford High School, Bedford Vocational School are both level one, that's the best you can be.

563
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,821
That's a good place to be.

564
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:40,365
Level two, all of our other schools, our middle schools, our elementary schools are level two.

565
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:46,549
The Roberts is level three, and I'll go into some of the reasons we can glean for that happening.

566
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,892
Unfortunately, as the system is designed,

567
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:56,466
Your rating is only good as a district as your lowest performing school.

568
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:58,627
So you're rated, we're rated level three.

569
00:44:59,368 --> 00:45:06,190
And again, that gives you publicly no credit for all the good things that are happening at all of the schools, including the Roberts.

570
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:10,192
Because again, we are looking at the Roberts data and we're questioning some of that too.

571
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:13,673
They were basically one point away from making level two.

572
00:45:14,274 --> 00:45:21,457
And my question, because I always cut right to the heart of things is, what did we have to do to get that one point to get to the 21 from 20?

573
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:24,202
And no one can give me an answer.

574
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,683
They just give me more charts and more numbers and more statistics.

575
00:45:27,763 --> 00:45:32,745
So again, we're not getting great answers as we go through this, and we're trying to do our best.

576
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:34,825
We don't want that school to be level three.

577
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:36,305
We don't want the district to be level three.

578
00:45:36,706 --> 00:45:40,947
But you need to tell me why I'm there in order to tell me what I need to do to get out of that.

579
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:43,367
And that's where we're kind of stuck at this point.

580
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:46,208
We're getting glimmers of information here.

581
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:50,229
So the interpretation of the data.

582
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:58,171
We've had our administrative team over the past two weeks looking at this, asking questions, having DSAC people in.

583
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:09,680
And if you look at the district data and the Roberts data too, you can see that we have made gains in both ELA and mathematics.

584
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:17,867
Extra credit has been in high growth, has been given for our ELL performance on the access test.

585
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:29,210
This to me, again, is another perplexing piece, because we're told that one of the reasons why the Roberts did not make their goal is because of the subgroup ELL.

586
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,792
Yet, we're getting bonus points for their performance on access.

587
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:35,232
Okay?

588
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:37,854
I'm a very logical person, and that's illogical to me.

589
00:46:37,974 --> 00:46:40,975
So, again, these are some of the things we're struggling with.

590
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:55,493
Our analysis of our overall student growth percentiles show that we are in the moderate to high range for all groups across all schools, and that's a 40 to 60 numerical figure, and we're well within that and even above it.

591
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:02,215
As a level three district now, we are required to work with the District School Assistance Center, DSAC.

592
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:09,718
The leadership team met with our DSAC coordinator, Mary Ann Jackman, and the regional data specialist, Hillary

593
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:19,603
Bresnahan on Friday, January 22nd, and we posed several questions about the data that, again, to date, remain unanswered to a certain extent.

594
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:24,046
They've been coming back with some answers, but not all of the answers that we asked for.

595
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:36,414
We are really concerned, I'm concerned, about a system that is intended to measure progress over time whose tools for that exact measurement vary from year to year.

596
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:41,150
We liken the process to that of trying to hit a moving target.

597
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:58,962
We have brought our concerns to the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, who has responded to the superintendent that MedFit, with its diligence in examining the data, has brought to light aspects of the system unknown to most districts.

598
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:06,508
We will continue to challenge what we feel is a system that works against the best interests of schools and our students.

599
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:17,227
One of our goals as a school district, with or without an accountability system, has always been focused on improving student academic achievement.

600
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:23,772
We feel that we have made significant progress in moving our students to higher levels of performance.

601
00:48:24,673 --> 00:48:34,320
Our student growth percentiles, as I mentioned before, are strong, and we continue to move students in large numbers into the proficiency category.

602
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:44,086
While we recognize that there are still areas of improvement, we are focused on making sure that the data we use to make these improvements is sound.

603
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:54,253
At this time, we have unanswered questions on how the state has interpreted results, not only for Medford, but also for all districts in the Commonwealth.

604
00:48:54,753 --> 00:49:01,317
We will continue to remain vigilant about the rating process and advocate for all of our students.

605
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,319
I attach to the report

606
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:12,944
just an understanding of the accountability system, just so you can get to see how they started in 2011.

607
00:49:15,906 --> 00:49:17,967
This is actually from the DESE website.

608
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:29,114
I've included a glossary of terms and also how they report out the different items.

609
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:33,977
All right, you can see that the PPI is still not that clear.

610
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:48,180
And then I've attached the actual visual of the accountability system which shows school districts in different levels and what we're obliged to do when you're in different levels.

611
00:49:50,702 --> 00:49:54,064
And then I've also attached to a couple of sheets of data.

612
00:49:55,145 --> 00:49:56,986
Again, I have a folder.

613
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,347
I have it with me if you want me to go through it.

614
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,689
I have packets of materials like this.

615
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,152
just more and more, you can just dig all this stuff out.

616
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:09,934
But I wanted to share with you some of the things that I saw and, you know, Bernadette and the other members of our team saw.

617
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:25,919
If you go to the sheet on the accountability data from Medford, you can see for yourself that the numbers, so for example, if we look at English Language Arts and we look at that first category, narrowing the proficiency gap, we actually got more points than in past years.

618
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,880
So if you go down there, you'll see some very solid gains.

619
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:32,401
elaborating on each one.

620
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:43,265
Again, I point out the ELL, the bonus points, the 25 points, the progress that's being made in both English and mathematics, all right?

621
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:54,468
And again, it doesn't look, if you look at the data that we've really regressed, but remember the problem is the bar keeps getting higher and higher.

622
00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:57,989
And if they change things like what subgroups are being reported out,

623
00:50:58,718 --> 00:51:00,920
That adds another problem to the mix.

624
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:11,828
And even if you look at the data for the Roberts, again, it's in some categories consistent, in some categories higher than it was in previous years.

625
00:51:12,629 --> 00:51:14,830
And yet their rating was a level three.

626
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:23,197
Again, their subgroup, the ELL students, were one of the subgroups that didn't make the target, but bonus points for access.

627
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:27,643
So you figure, I can't, you know, I've been in this business 46 years.

628
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:28,683
I'm having trouble with this one.

629
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:29,743
I really am.

630
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:36,805
So the other thing is that I mentioned before that students can be in multiple categories.

631
00:51:37,445 --> 00:51:42,066
So we could have an ELL student who score is involved in other categories.

632
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:48,868
And the other thing too is remember that subgroups are based on self-identification.

633
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,522
So how do we get students into a subgroup?

634
00:51:52,782 --> 00:52:01,264
When a student enrolls in the school district, and they enroll at the Parent Information Center, the parent selects the subgroups.

635
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:04,985
So again, that's how the process is.

636
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:07,886
It's not that the state monitors who's in what subgroup.

637
00:52:07,946 --> 00:52:09,846
It's a self-selecting process.

638
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:13,107
So with that, I will answer any questions that I can.

639
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:17,738
I'm still waiting for answers myself, but we'll keep you informed.

640
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,341
And we just really want to know, what do we have to do to move up?

641
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:24,102
Because we've been very solid.

642
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:25,063
We've seen gains.

643
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:27,645
This is very frustrating for all of our people.

644
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:28,905
They've worked very, very hard.

645
00:52:29,286 --> 00:52:37,731
And the directors of humanities and math, when they sat there initially with the DESE people and they said, we got no credit for moving kids from needs improvement to proficient.

646
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,699
That's what we were supposed to be doing, and we've been working hard doing that.

647
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,681
That's what the MCAS Academy money, grant money is for, to do that.

648
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:47,903
And yet, hello, nothing there.

649
00:52:47,923 --> 00:52:50,024
So anyway, so if I can take any questions.

650
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:50,845
Mr. Skerry.

651
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:56,388
Mayor, I read through this report three times Friday night, and it seems to be everything's going into a circle.

652
00:52:56,408 --> 00:53:03,653
You know, we have a dedicated cadre of teachers and administrators that year in, year out go through this.

653
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:06,695
And I'm just hard to see that whenever

654
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:10,173
The State Department of Education waxes, it's always the same school.

655
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:14,135
And I know that we've made great strides there.

656
00:53:15,155 --> 00:53:21,338
I would suggest through you to the superintendent, Mrs. Nelson, that perhaps Mrs. Jackman and Ms.

657
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:28,100
Bresnahan would like to come to a meeting and explain this to us and break it down and see just exactly why we're at where we're at.

658
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:32,602
And there are a lot of things in here that are misnomers and I'd like them cleared up.

659
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,823
I think we owe that to our kids.

660
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:37,936
And we owe it to the citizens of Medford, they're our taxpayers.

661
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:42,117
I just don't think the way that they're doing things is the correct way to do things.

662
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:48,099
And I'm tired of Medford being misaligned when I know that our kids are working hard to improve themselves.

663
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,481
And our teachers and again, administrators are working to put everybody on the same playing field.

664
00:53:53,541 --> 00:54:00,744
And this report and what they're doing to Medford is not what we expected, it's not what we deserve, and it's not what our kids deserve.

665
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:13,374
They're doing it to everybody, and I think one of the things that's very telling about our school district is that there are many school districts and many schools, high schools, and affluent communities that are not level one.

666
00:54:13,874 --> 00:54:20,242
I know Bernadette, you may have some of that data to share, but some of the communities that we tout as the, you know,

667
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:26,586
better economically situated communities and kids do better than they do not at the high school level.

668
00:54:27,026 --> 00:54:28,508
So Bernadette, do you want to share some of that?

669
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:30,189
Just one last comment, Billie.

670
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:35,052
If they're the district school assistance center, I think they should be here talking to us directly.

671
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,854
And if we do have questions, let them answer.

672
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,416
If they can't answer it, let them get back to us in a week.

673
00:54:40,554 --> 00:54:42,935
let this go on forever and ever in infinity.

674
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:52,259
I had one question that was, what do we need, what one point where do we need that one point, because they were one point away from making level two.

675
00:54:52,379 --> 00:54:56,842
And if it's one point away, in all courses of life, you have recourse.

676
00:54:57,582 --> 00:55:03,925
And, you know, perhaps they better check their figures again and look at some of the answers and really try to get into what's happening here.

677
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:06,426
Because I don't, you know, year after year they misalign.

678
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,521
you know, a certain school, and it's not fair to the kids or the teachers in that school.

679
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:18,763
We, we do, excuse me, but we do question the numbers because one of the things we did is there were, I think, 26 ELL students reported out.

680
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:27,205
And when Leslie Trotta went back and she examined the kids who were actually tested, because we had the names and the numbers, it didn't come out to that.

681
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:32,747
One of the things that we thought was really very perplexing that we did discover, and that is that

682
00:55:33,379 --> 00:55:37,542
ELL students have to take mathematics, even if they arrive the day before the test.

683
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:43,567
Okay, English, they get a year kind of off to learn the language, although you need a lot more than a year.

684
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:52,994
But we found out that they had those math, they had those kids take that math test, and they didn't count them in the school's results, they counted them in the district results.

685
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:54,155
Go figure.

686
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:56,749
It's like I said, it's not an even playing field.

687
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:57,890
And I think Ms.

688
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:58,691
Jackman and Ms.

689
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:05,575
Bresnahan should be here in this forum to explain to us their reasoning and how they come about with what they have to do.

690
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,676
I mean, they have to be held accountable.

691
00:56:08,077 --> 00:56:09,538
We should hold their feet to the fire.

692
00:56:11,976 --> 00:56:14,057
So just to add to that, good evening.

693
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:22,379
To add to what Beverly was just saying, also what we found missing was rating on two of our subgroups.

694
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:25,900
The Hispanic Latino subgroup for the Roberts Elementary was missing.

695
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,941
There was a population there, but it did not get configured into the accountability result.

696
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:36,183
And the other subgroup was the African, it wasn't the African American, I think it was Asian, that's right.

697
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:39,245
So two subgroups, we had missing data.

698
00:56:39,325 --> 00:56:41,466
So we did pose that question to Ms.

699
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:42,126
Bresnahan.

700
00:56:42,627 --> 00:56:44,148
She did not have an answer for us.

701
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,889
So that's one of the things that we're waiting on.

702
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:50,832
It'd be great to say that they just left the data out and that that would help us.

703
00:56:50,852 --> 00:56:54,454
Um, but we, we are waiting to get an answer on that.

704
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:57,276
I think two weeks is a long time to wait.

705
00:56:57,316 --> 00:56:57,696
Mr. Cadelli.

706
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,317
I mean, kids' futures are at stake here.

707
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:03,138
We don't know how to make them better.

708
00:57:03,538 --> 00:57:06,580
And if they're not going to help us, why go through this rigmarole?

709
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:14,286
So we have a tentative meeting scheduled for next Monday, February 8th, to talk to Ms.

710
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:15,186
Jackman and Ms.

711
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:15,747
Bresnahan.

712
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:28,328
there is the possibility they may be working with us in our professional development day, so we will be meeting with them tentatively next Monday, hoping to get some answers on that day, if not before.

713
00:57:28,348 --> 00:57:32,910
I'd like them to come in and explain their reasoning to this August body, our next school committee meeting.

714
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,612
I mean, I take this very seriously.

715
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:50,671
If we were going to do that, I'd much prefer it to be at a committee of the whole and a different, this environment is not conducive to the sort of data analysis that we would need to do.

716
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:53,673
So I would suggest a committee of the whole if we were to go that path.

717
00:57:55,214 --> 00:57:56,435
So let me, let me just say this.

718
00:57:57,596 --> 00:57:59,717
This system is very, very involved.

719
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:02,559
It was created as a compromise.

720
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,230
to deal with the federal government that was trying to change its positions.

721
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:21,938
And you notice a new act came through this past year, E-S-S-A, which changed the basis for the waiver system that the then Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, put in place, and the state got a waiver on it.

722
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:31,644
And in order for the state to get the waiver the second time around, they had to make the system more rigorous and move away from what E-S-S-A says it's trying to do.

723
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:33,765
So that begs a question to begin with.

724
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,780
I would just suggest the following.

725
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,782
First of all, let's not define ourselves by this particular system.

726
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,542
We know there are good things happening.

727
00:58:41,703 --> 00:58:43,403
We know there are some things that need to be worked on.

728
00:58:44,624 --> 00:58:46,344
Most of our schools are doing just fine.

729
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:56,188
If you look at some, as Beverly and Bernadette pointed out, some of the allegedly best high schools in the state, they're level two and our high school's level one.

730
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:57,448
You know why?

731
00:58:58,288 --> 00:58:59,649
Because they haven't got less room to grow.

732
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:03,909
their progress and their performance can only grow so high.

733
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:05,349
So their progress is muted.

734
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:14,050
Now, certain communities, which are way below us in terms of actual performance, became level two.

735
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:15,131
Why?

736
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:19,991
Because they can show progress from the depths up a little bit more, so they get more points.

737
00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:22,792
The system fights each other.

738
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:24,392
There are two basic issues.

739
00:59:24,832 --> 00:59:28,633
The CPI, the cumulative performance index,

740
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:33,286
which is based on so many points per scoring at each level.

741
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:43,393
Advanced and Proficient getting 100, Needs Improvement getting either 75 or 50, depending on what level of Needs Improvement you are, and then less down below.

742
00:59:44,594 --> 00:59:48,217
Now, we do just fine on the CPI.

743
00:59:49,658 --> 00:59:53,821
And in fact, we're ahead of some communities that in fact got a better accountability rating.

744
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:58,705
But they've got more room to grow in terms of progress from down here.

745
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:04,738
The performance index deals primarily with growth.

746
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:17,042
Now, if they're going to change the numbers of people in a group and try to compare them year to year, you would fail a statistics course at any local university.

747
01:00:17,062 --> 01:00:19,222
You just don't do that.

748
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:22,983
So I brought it to the attention of the association.

749
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:25,304
I'll continue to bring it to the attention.

750
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:27,504
There'll be a robust discussion on the thing.

751
01:00:27,864 --> 01:00:29,585
The people who are representing the department,

752
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:32,276
quite frankly, are really just messengers.

753
01:00:33,077 --> 01:00:34,338
They can only tell you so much.

754
01:00:35,019 --> 01:00:46,929
We really need to get into the people to design these things, and that's best done initially at the association level where we can get them there and really grill it and really talk about more than one district at a time.

755
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:49,491
If you're talking about one district, some of you think you're whining.

756
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:54,115
If you're talking about multiple districts, it looks like, what do you call it, you're saying, this is a problem.

757
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:58,899
So if you take a look at a place like Waltham, a lot of characteristics of that, same thing, drop down.

758
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:01,220
Reading, same thing, dropped down.

759
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,981
A lot of places have similar kind of experiences.

760
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:10,542
So I'm not going to define this school district by this particular rating.

761
01:01:11,183 --> 01:01:13,503
I'm pleased that the high school and the vocational are level one.

762
01:01:13,523 --> 01:01:17,484
I'm pleased that the other schools are holding their own for the purposes of explaining it.

763
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:28,988
But we're not going to accept the fact that the system applied measures that don't ring true to any kind of statistical analysis that we're aware of.

764
01:01:29,675 --> 01:01:35,578
or they change the formula without giving proper notice to the districts of how the formula was going to change.

765
01:01:36,498 --> 01:01:38,979
So we'll get back into it.

766
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:41,721
Just don't beat yourself up on it.

767
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,862
Understand that it's a complex area.

768
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,243
Understand that we're committed to doing well by all our students.

769
01:01:47,924 --> 01:01:53,466
Understand there's complexity in taking tests, complexity in all the changes that are going on.

770
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:57,268
And we're going to work our way through it, just like we work our way through everything.

771
01:01:58,138 --> 01:02:00,239
And in a real short time, we'll be back to you.

772
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:06,041
I'm sure we're going to have some very interesting findings, along with some other districts that have similar experience.

773
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,082
But we want to tell you the truth.

774
01:02:08,122 --> 01:02:14,585
We're out here tonight talking, giving you the information, because I wouldn't want you to read it in some other place and say, why didn't you tell us?

775
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:22,928
But I'm relatively confident that this stuff is going to get a real scrutinization before it's over.

776
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:27,190
And you should be generally pleased that

777
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:34,362
high school and vocational school score higher than Andover and some other places.

778
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,123
Arlington, okay, some other places.

779
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:42,786
Maybe not Arlington, I may mix up one, but you know, score higher than some of these places.

780
01:02:43,146 --> 01:02:45,267
Bernadette has the list.

781
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:49,509
All right, that's okay because, all right, so I have a few more communities.

782
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:56,032
So we know that Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School are level one schools.

783
01:02:57,253 --> 01:03:00,154
The following high schools are level two.

784
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:06,397
Lexington High School, Andover High School, North Redding High School, Redding High School, and Wakefield High School.

785
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:10,299
So they're level two, where Medford High School is level one.

786
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:14,721
What I thought was surprising is I looked at district levels also.

787
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:18,043
Redding actually is a level three district.

788
01:03:18,763 --> 01:03:20,804
So they're comparable to us in that rating.

789
01:03:20,984 --> 01:03:22,244
And Waltham's a level three.

790
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:23,065
It's a high school, too.

791
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:24,606
I'm sorry?

792
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:25,426
It's Waltham, too.

793
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,881
Waltham is also.

794
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:38,369
The system may work mechanically, but it begs a question as to what it really tells you about actualities.

795
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,851
And so, you know, we're giving you the information.

796
01:03:42,872 --> 01:03:45,134
We'll continue to research what we're doing.

797
01:03:45,174 --> 01:03:52,139
We'll continue to talk to our colleagues and we'll continue to pursue the department as to how they do this, because it's not just for this year, it's going forward.

798
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:54,020
If you're going to rate schools,

799
01:03:54,732 --> 01:04:13,126
If you're going to rate programs, you've got to have something that's transparent and understandable, and something that enables each district to work on whatever might be considered a deficit in a meaningful and progressive way, not to be surprised at how you came up.

800
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:21,052
You know, sometimes when you watch certain figure skating things or you wonder how the judges came up with something, well,

801
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:28,350
I think we're saying things, if you watch a basketball game or a hockey game, you know the sport at the end of the game.

802
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,251
Enough of the sports analysis.

803
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,591
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

804
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:30,651
Ms.

805
01:04:30,952 --> 01:04:33,193
Cunha, did you have a question?

806
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:33,593
Yes.

807
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:39,596
The whole report, I know the superintendent is saying not to get frustrated, but I'm frustrated.

808
01:04:41,697 --> 01:04:49,702
As he said, the commissioner of education has constantly said that he was definitely going to look at the formula of growth.

809
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:53,773
And this has changed everything.

810
01:04:54,293 --> 01:05:01,697
How do you look at the formula of growth and not look at needs improvement to proficient and not scaleless with any extra points?

811
01:05:02,537 --> 01:05:04,678
Totally don't understand that at all.

812
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:10,280
It's like he's changed the formula upside down without informing anyone at all.

813
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:14,282
You can't change the formula in the middle of this at all.

814
01:05:14,922 --> 01:05:16,023
It does not make sense.

815
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:20,946
And changing everything in the middle of students taking tests is just not fair.

816
01:05:21,086 --> 01:05:22,346
It's just not fair.

817
01:05:22,846 --> 01:05:40,910
So what I do suggest and advise maybe is just as much as you've reached out to the superintendents association is also to reach out to MASC and hopefully between the two associations try to get more support.

818
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:46,033
And to try to look into the process of appeals, because this is definitely something that cannot.

819
01:05:46,053 --> 01:05:48,035
I mean, we can't sit back on this.

820
01:05:48,535 --> 01:05:57,602
And as you said, Superintendent, I'm sure we're not the only ones that have gone through this, and I'm sure we're not the only ones that are upset over something like this, because

821
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,464
You can't change the playing field like this.

822
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:08,076
You have students, administration, everyone investing into this and doing what is being asked of us.

823
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:11,562
And then in the middle of it, you just change it all?

824
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:14,135
It's just not right.

825
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:15,956
It's just absolutely not right.

826
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:25,317
And it's very frustrating, especially when you see the commissioner and he stands there and he tells you that this is how we're all going to work together and this is how we're all going to do it.

827
01:06:25,877 --> 01:06:27,858
And then it seems like it's a slap in the face.

828
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,058
Very frustrating.

829
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:33,579
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

830
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,699
I'm too troubled by this.

831
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:42,300
Partly my biggest concern is how does it, how is it going to be interpreted by the parents of the Roberts?

832
01:06:42,888 --> 01:06:49,614
because as a parent of the Roberts, I would assume that, you know, it would be, it's very complex information.

833
01:06:49,694 --> 01:07:04,105
We sound as if, you know, we're trying to make excuses because after all, this is the, you know, report we're getting, but we understand all the technicalities involved, but that's hard to translate.

834
01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:12,252
And so I would, I know that a letter needs to go out to the parents of the Roberts, and I just hope that that is well crafted and that,

835
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:18,450
If there needs to be subsequent meetings with the parents to reassure them, that you will obviously do that.

836
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,830
I have no doubt that you will.

837
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:27,692
So what I suggested to you was, is that in the near future, very near future, I'm actually going down to the school and run a little open forum with them.

838
01:07:28,432 --> 01:07:34,874
And we answer their questions, come down and talk about the good things going on at the Roberts and talk about the anomalies of the system.

839
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,081
Will you let us know when that's going to take place?

840
01:07:37,462 --> 01:07:39,263
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

841
01:07:40,584 --> 01:07:42,686
Again, totally concerned about this.

842
01:07:43,147 --> 01:07:45,529
Does this rating now stand for two years?

843
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:48,992
Is there still a two-year cycle that there used to be?

844
01:07:50,881 --> 01:07:59,707
Ratings have gone year to year, but now where we're going to be taking the park, we're held harmless, which means we can't go down, not that we would.

845
01:08:00,528 --> 01:08:02,649
If we do better, we can go up.

846
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,810
So it's a year to year.

847
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,931
It's an annual rating.

848
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:12,436
And the other concern, of course, is the one you mentioned about the cohorts of the number of kids changing and that a child can be in multiple cohorts.

849
01:08:12,883 --> 01:08:19,445
If you have a child who's truly struggling, that means, you know, if there's only 20 kids, that's a significant change.

850
01:08:19,525 --> 01:08:23,285
And, you know, if you have one or two kids, that is going to change your numbers significantly.

851
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:27,066
It should be noted that the state never meets its own targets.

852
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:29,647
It sets targets.

853
01:08:29,827 --> 01:08:32,848
It's yet to meet its own targets in some of these special populations.

854
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:38,669
So that's also troubling, too, to set targets that, as a state, we can't meet.

855
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:43,806
and then to hold individual districts accountable for not meeting the same targets the state can't meet.

856
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:45,628
There's a lot here.

857
01:08:45,848 --> 01:08:46,368
There's a lot here.

858
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,971
But I mean, again, as I just want to emphasize, don't beat yourself up about it.

859
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:51,472
This is informational.

860
01:08:52,192 --> 01:08:53,173
We'll need to talk about it.

861
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:54,554
We need to get in behind it.

862
01:08:54,895 --> 01:09:07,384
We're going to be working with the state and others to try and make the system of accountability one that is truly transparent and truly rates a school system and a school on how it performs, not on

863
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:12,483
some sort of magical statistical formula, which when you throw it all together, you come up with goulash.

864
01:09:15,425 --> 01:09:32,776
I think what Paulette was saying about parents being concerned, as a parent with five at the Roberts, I can say we have wonderful teachers, a dedicated principal, vice principal, and that I hope that you coming to the school will reassure parents that their education is still top notch in this test, however the equation

865
01:09:33,973 --> 01:09:40,215
it doesn't reflect what the kids are getting in the classroom, because they've all had a great education with superb teachers.

866
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:45,097
So I want to reassure the people that this test is not what the Roberts is about.

867
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:48,178
Wonderful.

868
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:49,298
Is there a motion on the floor?

869
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:50,159
I have a question.

870
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:50,659
Mr. Benedetto?

871
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:51,619
OK.

872
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:54,680
So I have a few comments.

873
01:09:54,820 --> 01:10:03,303
First of all, on the page which says, Title I students who are rated level III must inform parents of this rating.

874
01:10:03,724 --> 01:10:11,813
So I'm assuming that the district is sending out letters to all Title I students at the Roberts only, or does that mean the whole district?

875
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,316
Because now the district is a level three school.

876
01:10:16,847 --> 01:10:19,649
Diane Caldwell was getting the letters prepared.

877
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,211
She's not here this evening, but I will check with her.

878
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:24,573
I'm not sure how she left it.

879
01:10:24,733 --> 01:10:26,695
I don't know, Rory, if you had a conversation.

880
01:10:26,715 --> 01:10:29,958
I know it was definitely to Roberts because she had to do that, but I'm not sure.

881
01:10:29,978 --> 01:10:30,118
Right.

882
01:10:30,218 --> 01:10:35,922
I didn't know of all districts in the school because now the whole district is a level three district.

883
01:10:36,683 --> 01:10:36,883
Correct?

884
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:37,904
I'll have to double check.

885
01:10:37,924 --> 01:10:39,866
Well, not all of our schools are Title I schools.

886
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:40,726
Right.

887
01:10:40,746 --> 01:10:41,887
So we only have three out of four.

888
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:44,970
So any Title I school could possibly need a letter.

889
01:10:45,365 --> 01:10:50,850
But my guess and interpretation that it's just the Roberts because of their school.

890
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,791
That's initially what I believe she said.

891
01:10:53,452 --> 01:11:09,025
So, well, we have explained away a lot of what this test and the changes, but what we haven't talked about really is that this test is given and these ratings are for everybody in the Commonwealth.

892
01:11:09,205 --> 01:11:12,148
So we are only one school district dealing with this.

893
01:11:12,919 --> 01:11:15,784
But we are compared to those other school districts.

894
01:11:15,845 --> 01:11:21,475
And the level three, according to this paper, it says you're in the lowest performing 20% of schools.

895
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,675
That's concerning to me in a lot of ways.

896
01:11:25,836 --> 01:11:35,727
Number one, I want to be, I want to take corrective action if we need to and get more help to the Roberts so we aren't a level three school district wide.

897
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:36,387
Okay.

898
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:44,997
Whether or not we like the way they, they put the formulas together and how they change it is, is one issue.

899
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,002
But the other issue, we own it.

900
01:11:47,282 --> 01:11:48,564
We're a level three school.

901
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:55,673
That means when someone moves into our community, they research schools, this is what they're going to see.

902
01:11:56,554 --> 01:11:56,855
All right?

903
01:11:57,155 --> 01:11:59,238
Also, we are way better than this.

904
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:05,924
We owe it to these children to look at what we're doing correctly and where we need to improve.

905
01:12:06,665 --> 01:12:10,848
Not make reasons why this doesn't count.

906
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:12,309
Well, it does count.

907
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,472
And we can't decide that it doesn't, because it does.

908
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:18,634
And this is our tool that we're being evaluated on.

909
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:20,656
We need to do better.

910
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:22,738
And that's our responsibility.

911
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:31,543
So I own what it says and I want to work together with our administrators, our teachers, and our staff as a whole to make it better.

912
01:12:31,823 --> 01:12:34,545
So that way next year we're not having this conversation again.

913
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:48,273
I don't know if that means that we need to have an academic committee meeting and just really go through some of these data and really look at our middle and elementary schools about where they are and how we can help them

914
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:58,956
perform better on any test that the state decides to give us, in any way they mean to jumble how we need to prove that our children are doing well.

915
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,856
I want to make sure we're doing that next step.

916
01:13:02,596 --> 01:13:03,777
OK, we have the data.

917
01:13:04,277 --> 01:13:05,217
Let's move forward.

918
01:13:05,257 --> 01:13:06,757
Let's fix it for next year.

919
01:13:06,837 --> 01:13:07,558
Let's do that.

920
01:13:07,918 --> 01:13:12,719
So through you to the superintendent, I'd like to schedule an academic affairs meeting.

921
01:13:13,299 --> 01:13:17,280
As of right now, I was the committee chairperson until new committee

922
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:18,532
Thanks.

923
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:19,913
So I would like to call that.

924
01:13:20,013 --> 01:13:22,414
I'd like to make a motion for that committee to, to me.

925
01:13:22,654 --> 01:13:23,374
Yeah.

926
01:13:24,514 --> 01:13:25,575
Yeah.

927
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:28,276
Thank you.

928
01:13:30,257 --> 01:13:36,559
So again, I'm going to say this so that I'm very clear as to how I feel about it.

929
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:44,962
We're doing an awful lot of good things at that school system that is questionable label to school.

930
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:46,663
It doesn't mean,

931
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:53,221
that teachers aren't teaching, and good things aren't happening, and that we won't work on doing better.

932
01:13:54,882 --> 01:13:56,363
But we don't need to flagellate ourselves.

933
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,046
There's a lot here that needs to be looked into.

934
01:14:00,846 --> 01:14:07,891
The school has got a lot of ELL students who have to take a test with less than a year in the school.

935
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:15,115
The school's got a lot of other challenges that maybe some of the other schools maybe don't have, and maybe we have to look at the shifts in population.

936
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:20,716
The equity percentile eliminated almost 54% of the schools from being rated.

937
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,919
And just simply moved them over to the side.

938
01:14:25,339 --> 01:14:30,143
Schools that did less well on the cumulative performance index than the Roberts.

939
01:14:31,544 --> 01:14:33,465
There's a lot here that needs to be looked into.

940
01:14:34,946 --> 01:14:37,928
We are certainly committed to doing a better job and working at it.

941
01:14:39,369 --> 01:14:45,073
But I want to say it clearly and unequivocably, you know, because I'm not afraid to say it.

942
01:14:45,676 --> 01:14:49,398
At this stage of my life, if I can't say it, I don't know when I will be able to say it.

943
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,079
The school's a good school.

944
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:51,780
It works hard.

945
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
The teachers are good people.

946
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:58,103
We'll continue to make progress at that school, but let's not beat ourselves up.

947
01:14:59,004 --> 01:14:59,744
We'll work at it.

948
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:00,645
We'll do well.

949
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:05,988
We'll find the issues we can do better on, but let's not beat ourselves up.

950
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:12,532
This is a very unusual scoring system that the state can't even explain, never mind the people in the field.

951
01:15:18,582 --> 01:15:23,407
By the way, I just want to mention that last week I did have the opportunity to go visit two of the kindergarten classes.

952
01:15:23,827 --> 01:15:25,189
It was a wonderful experience.

953
01:15:25,249 --> 01:15:29,073
I walked through the building as well and talked and stopped and talked to a couple of teachers.

954
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:32,150
I saw the students working hard.

955
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:34,253
I was at the kindergarten classes.

956
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:46,307
I think the most interesting thing, again, they were very much similar to classes that I was used to when my children attended at the Hervey, except that there was a higher caliber

957
01:15:46,947 --> 01:15:48,868
of learning going on.

958
01:15:48,988 --> 01:15:52,909
When we hear kindergarten is more like first grade, I saw that.

959
01:15:53,029 --> 01:15:55,030
I saw the material that they were doing.

960
01:15:55,890 --> 01:16:01,131
And it was just both teachers who I visited who had been here one night, Ms.

961
01:16:01,171 --> 01:16:01,692
Goss and Ms.

962
01:16:01,712 --> 01:16:05,593
Skiffington, and the whole experience was so wonderful.

963
01:16:05,653 --> 01:16:06,573
I do hope that the other

964
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:09,545
ones of you who can take advantage.

965
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:16,070
And you don't want to be disruptive in the classroom, but if you get a chance to go in, it's great.

966
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:23,176
And by chance, I was at the Roberts, and I went into an ELL classroom where it was just fantastic.

967
01:16:23,316 --> 01:16:31,082
So it's funny that the words of the superintendent saying, there's an awful lot of good things going.

968
01:16:31,122 --> 01:16:33,624
And when I was there personally, I saw those good things going on.

969
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:36,109
Thank you.

970
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:39,572
There is a motion on the floor for a subcommittee meeting on curriculum.

971
01:16:39,713 --> 01:16:40,693
All those in favor?

972
01:16:40,774 --> 01:16:41,814
Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

973
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:42,535
All those in favor?

974
01:16:42,555 --> 01:16:43,216
Aye.

975
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:47,379
All those opposed?

976
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:54,025
Motion to receive and place on file this report by Mr. Skerry.

977
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:55,006
All those in favor?

978
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:56,807
All those opposed?

979
01:16:57,288 --> 01:16:58,469
Paper is placed on file.

980
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,732
Report on distracted driving program.

981
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:03,053
Mr. Superintendent.

982
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:13,128
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, last Thursday, or Tuesday rather, January 26th, we had a terrific program on distracted driving.

983
01:17:13,168 --> 01:17:14,649
It's the fourth time we've had the program.

984
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:32,155
The mayor was present, as was Catherine Fretz, and a whole pile of other people, and it was a terrific program because basically it's dealing with our young people's need to pay attention to the skills of staying alive, and the skills of

985
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:39,986
being concerned for each other and not just simply taking care of their routine business while they're driving or doing other things.

986
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:43,009
And it drives home a really critical point.

987
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:53,978
I won't take the time to read the whole program, but just simply to say even a few moments of distraction can alter your life and the lives of others, people you care about in a permanent way.

988
01:17:54,579 --> 01:17:55,520
It's a terrific program.

989
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,061
We're going to do more with it.

990
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:58,662
We're going to put some things on the

991
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:21,509
on our cable and on our web page, and we're going to keep driving it on to our kids, because there are too many examples out there of young people and older people, parents and others, who we always say, don't let your kid drive drunk, but don't let your kid drive distracted either, because either way, you can hurt somebody, including yourself.

992
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,090
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

993
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,151
If I could, from the chair, just I had the opportunity to attend with Ms.

994
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:29,012
Kretz, and it was such a moving

995
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:30,747
Deliver it.

996
01:18:32,734 --> 01:18:43,700
actions that we saw that day, from plays to people speaking, people that had left, including Emily Stein of Medford and her little four-year-old daughter, Evie, who were part of a PSA that they put on.

997
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:50,284
It was very, very moving, and it could have been shown to a group of any age bracket in our community.

998
01:18:50,424 --> 01:18:53,165
It's not just a children, a young adult issue.

999
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:56,767
It certainly is a mature adult issue, as well as middle.

1000
01:18:57,308 --> 01:19:01,190
So it really could have been put on in any forum, and people would have walked away

1001
01:19:01,848 --> 01:19:03,269
looking at things a lot differently.

1002
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:09,354
Distracted isn't just your cell phone, it's your navigation, it's the radio, it's makeup, and coffee.

1003
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:11,195
It's a host of different things.

1004
01:19:11,295 --> 01:19:15,298
So just a shout out to the community that, you know, our kids are getting it.

1005
01:19:15,338 --> 01:19:19,561
They're in the lower bracket of distraction when you do rate them.

1006
01:19:20,182 --> 01:19:23,004
But it goes out to everybody that we all need to be conscious.

1007
01:19:23,084 --> 01:19:25,446
And as I told us that day, we shouldn't be selfish.

1008
01:19:25,526 --> 01:19:26,927
We should be putting others first.

1009
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:34,381
On our time, pull over if we need to make a call, but don't be selfish and make the call while you're driving or texting while you're driving.

1010
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:36,726
So, Ms.

1011
01:19:36,766 --> 01:19:37,267
Krebs, if you would.

1012
01:19:38,179 --> 01:19:40,602
Mr. Feldman, he was terrific.

1013
01:19:40,702 --> 01:19:42,884
And I really feel for his loss.

1014
01:19:42,984 --> 01:19:45,626
And he's been around the United States.

1015
01:19:46,007 --> 01:20:00,420
And he wears wristbands on both sides of all the families and their favorite colors of the wristband from all the children that have lost and that he's met and encountered.

1016
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,841
It really was heartbreaking.

1017
01:20:03,101 --> 01:20:04,441
You know, he's so brave.

1018
01:20:04,481 --> 01:20:08,643
He can go around the country and share his story and try to help others.

1019
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:09,743
It's incredible.

1020
01:20:09,883 --> 01:20:12,944
And Emily, who's from Medford, was there.

1021
01:20:13,004 --> 01:20:16,185
She's terrific also, and her little daughter.

1022
01:20:17,326 --> 01:20:18,566
It was really incredible.

1023
01:20:18,686 --> 01:20:21,047
It brought tears to my eyes.

1024
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:29,230
I realized that I drive distracted just with the navigation system and changing the channel or driving with the coffee.

1025
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:38,719
It just really set in and it makes you think that you don't realize what distractions are until it was brought to our attention.

1026
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:43,424
I thought it was only texting until I went to the presentation.

1027
01:20:43,564 --> 01:20:44,865
It was really powerful.

1028
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:47,108
And just a note on our students.

1029
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:48,925
how respectful they were.

1030
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:56,235
And everything that I have seen over the last several, several years, but especially of late, they're just very respectful young adults.

1031
01:20:56,275 --> 01:20:59,539
I'm very proud of how they act in public forums.

1032
01:20:59,799 --> 01:20:59,960
Ms.

1033
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:00,480
Van de Kloof.

1034
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:04,045
I just want to mention, I didn't get to it this year because I had gone two years ago.

1035
01:21:04,065 --> 01:21:05,227
Um, and

1036
01:21:05,788 --> 01:21:10,712
You know, it's funny, sometimes I catch myself being distracted, and I visualize that pink wristband.

1037
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:16,476
So even two years after, that program has an impact on me, an adult.

1038
01:21:16,596 --> 01:21:18,197
So it's really excellent.

1039
01:21:18,217 --> 01:21:19,778
It's on my dashboard.

1040
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:21,119
Can you keep it on yours?

1041
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,480
Absolutely.

1042
01:21:23,781 --> 01:21:24,442
One more comment.

1043
01:21:25,182 --> 01:21:31,567
Just going back to Bloomberg report tonight, this report tonight, and our most recent discussion about accountability.

1044
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:39,848
good school, a good school system, a good educational program is better known by more than test scores.

1045
01:21:40,668 --> 01:21:42,529
There's a lot of good things these kids do.

1046
01:21:42,849 --> 01:21:45,089
You saw last week the vocational stuff coming out.

1047
01:21:45,129 --> 01:21:46,309
You'll see more coming out.

1048
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:52,311
Let's not just simply classify ourselves on a test score.

1049
01:21:53,151 --> 01:22:00,452
Let's understand the comprehensive nature of what we do, and let's lead that charge into the Commonwealth rather than simply be defined

1050
01:22:01,358 --> 01:22:03,280
by some very narrow parameter.

1051
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:07,343
Motion to receive this report and place it on file.

1052
01:22:07,383 --> 01:22:08,103
All those in favor?

1053
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:08,644
Aye.

1054
01:22:08,784 --> 01:22:09,425
All those opposed?

1055
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:11,866
Report passes.

1056
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:14,409
Report on state budget proposed by Governor H2.

1057
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:24,837
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, Governor Charles Baker issued his proposed budget on January 27.

1058
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:28,360
Proposed budget is a $39.1 billion document.

1059
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:38,734
that make some new investments in targeted areas such as unrestricted local aid, child welfare, and substance abuse prevention.

1060
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:45,337
Major areas of the government see limited increases, and many accounts are level funded.

1061
01:22:46,197 --> 01:22:50,538
There are no new taxes, but there is a plan for corporate tax relief over four years.

1062
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:59,982
The proposed budget holds new spending through a 3.5% increase, although revenue is projected to increase 4.3% next year.

1063
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:09,471
The administration hopes to close the $635 million gap that they say currently exists and to rein in the costs of mass health.

1064
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:15,336
It should be remembered that this is only the beginning of the state budget process.

1065
01:23:16,236 --> 01:23:18,718
The House and the Senate will weigh in with their own versions.

1066
01:23:19,759 --> 01:23:24,403
Oftentimes, the word is that the governor's budget is dead on arrival.

1067
01:23:25,103 --> 01:23:30,548
But to be a little bit more respectful, I think the House and the Senate will obviously have their own versions.

1068
01:23:31,822 --> 01:23:35,906
that will then go to conference committee when they finish that, to iron out their differences.

1069
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:40,169
It will then go back to the governor, who could then veto some of the legislative actions.

1070
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:48,717
It will then go back to the legislature for a veto review, which could often lead to overrides of the governor's vetoes.

1071
01:23:49,397 --> 01:23:52,240
The whole process usually doesn't complete until late June.

1072
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:59,126
However, we should get a pretty good idea on how it will play out after the Senate and the House do their initial work.

1073
01:24:00,732 --> 01:24:06,554
The following is a preliminary view of the proposed budget and how the governor's budget might impact Medford.

1074
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:16,898
And the reason I talk about the governor's budget impacting Medford, because now we'll begin the lobbying process with our own legislators to improve things we don't see in this governor's budget.

1075
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:21,240
The cherry sheets are attached to this report for your review.

1076
01:24:22,197 --> 01:24:25,739
They're called cherry sheets because at one time they were printed on cherry colored paper.

1077
01:24:26,339 --> 01:24:28,941
It's not because- And it stuck.

1078
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:29,621
And it stuck.

1079
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:31,042
And it stuck, okay?

1080
01:24:31,882 --> 01:24:35,825
Number one, unrestricted local aid is increased to measure by $480,827.

1081
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:39,847
This is municipal aid money.

1082
01:24:40,287 --> 01:24:42,829
It's more than usual in recent times.

1083
01:24:42,909 --> 01:24:43,729
It's a good hit.

1084
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:45,310
The city can use it.

1085
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:49,404
At one time, there were two categories of general aid and additional aid.

1086
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:55,287
That was collapsed several years ago into general unrestricted aid, and now there's one category for that.

1087
01:24:56,228 --> 01:25:06,934
Number two, Chapter 70 general education aid is up $96,340, higher than last year, and is equivalent to approximately $20 per pupil.

1088
01:25:06,974 --> 01:25:08,294
Last year, we got $25.

1089
01:25:10,236 --> 01:25:14,378
The distribution is lower than last year based upon the change in state weighted calculations

1090
01:25:14,968 --> 01:25:19,532
and a $5 per people lower than the minimum aid of FY 2016.

1091
01:25:20,292 --> 01:25:22,434
Medford is a hold harmless district.

1092
01:25:23,615 --> 01:25:29,179
Hold harmless means that we won't get lowered and we won't get raised, except for the minimum aid hit.

1093
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:40,228
Because of the numbers and because of the economics of the Chapter 70 formula, which places Medford between the wealthy communities and the less wealthy communities.

1094
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:42,209
At one time, we received as much as 37%

1095
01:25:43,817 --> 01:25:45,978
of our school budget from the state.

1096
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:53,221
Today, we're lucky to see 19% from the state, at least in the general distribution, maybe even less.

1097
01:25:53,961 --> 01:25:57,442
And it won't move until these things actually take place.

1098
01:25:58,022 --> 01:25:59,343
So that's what hold harmless means.

1099
01:25:59,963 --> 01:26:04,365
No new provisions are made to address the recommendations of the recent Foundation Review Committee.

1100
01:26:04,645 --> 01:26:07,266
You may remember that some of you were involved with that.

1101
01:26:08,326 --> 01:26:08,946
And there was an $800 million

1102
01:26:11,815 --> 01:26:16,219
initial recommendation to add, but that money's nowhere to be found.

1103
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,685
It's certainly not in the governor's budget, and there's no reference to that at this time.

1104
01:26:22,366 --> 01:26:23,907
That would have raised the foundation level.

1105
01:26:24,007 --> 01:26:28,271
However, I'm concerned that it may have raised the foundation level and given Medford no new money.

1106
01:26:28,912 --> 01:26:34,778
I think we talked about 151 communities might not benefit from it at all, even if the 800 million were there.

1107
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:43,796
The quality kindergarten budget, one which you have an interest in, and I provided you that report in the back of your folder tonight if you go to it, was level funding.

1108
01:26:44,497 --> 01:26:46,258
But the distribution rules are changing.

1109
01:26:46,278 --> 01:26:52,021
It's likely the governor's plan, if the governor's plan is sustained, that we will get approximately $109,580 in FY17, rather than $143,362 in FY16.

1110
01:27:02,029 --> 01:27:04,591
Now, the House last year eliminated it.

1111
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:06,272
The Senate put it back in.

1112
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:10,675
The Governor apparently decided that it was worth something.

1113
01:27:12,077 --> 01:27:13,357
I don't know how that's going to play out.

1114
01:27:13,498 --> 01:27:21,223
We'll have to see where that goes, but you'll have an analysis in the back of your folders tonight about how it plays out on the kindergarten side.

1115
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:24,826
Non-resident transportation is another fund.

1116
01:27:24,846 --> 01:27:27,108
That's the money that we get for buses that go to Minneapolis.

1117
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:32,282
That will offset Minuteman's bus as it has this year at about 50% of the cost.

1118
01:27:32,362 --> 01:27:33,783
Bus costs about $65,000, okay?

1119
01:27:35,943 --> 01:27:40,304
Homeless transportation is level funded when we pay a portion of the anticipated liability.

1120
01:27:40,744 --> 01:27:44,345
And it always depends on how many are homeless across the state and for men.

1121
01:27:45,486 --> 01:27:47,746
The more homeless, the bigger the bill.

1122
01:27:47,786 --> 01:27:50,187
The more transportation, the bigger the bill.

1123
01:27:51,987 --> 01:27:58,212
The more across the state, the less distribution, because there's only a limited amount of money, so the percentage distributed comes down.

1124
01:27:58,872 --> 01:28:02,615
But it's only projected about half of the anticipated liability.

1125
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:07,219
Charter school funding is a real sleight of hand proposal.

1126
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:12,964
This year, the line item was $54 million below the formula for reimbursement.

1127
01:28:12,984 --> 01:28:14,925
$54 million below the formula for reimbursement.

1128
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:20,710
The governor proposed increasing that line item by $20.5 million, which doesn't close the gap.

1129
01:28:21,693 --> 01:28:23,914
makes it sound as if it's, you know, it's a real good ad.

1130
01:28:24,855 --> 01:28:37,741
He also wants to change the distribution formula from the current six-year plan to a modified three-year plan, with some communities only getting the first year of the three-year plan, and 100% for the first year.

1131
01:28:38,222 --> 01:28:38,962
That would be Medford.

1132
01:28:40,103 --> 01:28:41,463
We would lose substantial money.

1133
01:28:44,145 --> 01:28:50,288
Depending on your communities, charter enrollment, and economic disadvantage, which we're not economically disadvantaged in terms of the state.

1134
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:57,354
This proposed method would cost Medford reimbursement funding over the next few years, and obviously we should strongly oppose it.

1135
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:04,920
We're having discussions in the Senate where the opposition seems to be stronger.

1136
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:11,885
The House seems to be in favor of some form of charter lift, but I need to find out what specifically they're going to go for.

1137
01:29:11,965 --> 01:29:17,849
As you know, there's a petition out there that will be in the election next year if this legislation doesn't pass.

1138
01:29:19,996 --> 01:29:24,618
In the current tense, the projected net charter cost increase over last year could be as much as $547,611.

1139
01:29:24,678 --> 01:29:37,362
Furthermore, DESE may allow Mystic Valley to grow its enrollment by 400 students, probably not all in one year, and this could obviously affect us.

1140
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:48,186
Now, the reason for that is DESE restricted Mystic Valley because it wasn't taking in ELL students or a sufficiently diverse population

1141
01:29:48,562 --> 01:29:51,683
and its governance structure was considered to be less than favorable.

1142
01:29:53,144 --> 01:29:55,545
For some reason, the commissioner is saying, well, they've made progress.

1143
01:29:56,285 --> 01:29:58,746
My read of their version of progress isn't very high.

1144
01:30:00,506 --> 01:30:04,368
But if they're allowed to take more students, that could impact us.

1145
01:30:05,788 --> 01:30:07,229
And that means the numbers go up.

1146
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:10,170
And that means there's less reimbursement.

1147
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:12,811
And that means it takes dollars away from the locality.

1148
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:16,112
This is a major fight that has to happen on the Hill.

1149
01:30:17,883 --> 01:30:20,424
Special education circuit breaker funding is level funding.

1150
01:30:21,245 --> 01:30:24,446
These cost factors for extraordinary placement and spend inevitably go up.

1151
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:33,490
It's probably $11 to $12 million lower than what the Circuit Breaker Coalition, of which I serve on, anticipates the next year.

1152
01:30:34,431 --> 01:30:37,712
These are the costs of private day placements and residential placements.

1153
01:30:38,673 --> 01:30:40,373
Now, it's a mixed bag.

1154
01:30:41,254 --> 01:30:45,716
Obviously, we want the money for this, but I'm also very concerned that

1155
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:52,304
In some of these places, the private schools are just simply trying to raise their tuition costs or adding to it.

1156
01:30:52,344 --> 01:30:54,805
So we need to have a bigger discussion about that.

1157
01:30:54,865 --> 01:30:57,046
Plus the fact transportation in schools is not funded.

1158
01:30:58,266 --> 01:31:02,168
And we think that sometimes can be as expensive as the other.

1159
01:31:03,108 --> 01:31:06,850
The Department of Public Health School Health Services grant is also level funding.

1160
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:11,552
And we can expect a small reduction in that distribution if the governor's budget were sustained.

1161
01:31:13,018 --> 01:31:16,380
That pays for school nurse and a few other school related activities.

1162
01:31:18,321 --> 01:31:25,706
School choice costs in FY17 are projected at 62,000 versus 16,712 in FY16.

1163
01:31:26,046 --> 01:31:27,487
That number could change three or four times.

1164
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:29,908
So I'm not so sure how that's going to play out.

1165
01:31:29,928 --> 01:31:32,710
Those are just estimates based on what they think might move.

1166
01:31:33,551 --> 01:31:40,675
So it's not something to be ignored, but I don't think it may hold because every year it's a little different.

1167
01:31:42,023 --> 01:31:47,444
The early education and care department funds some of our early childhood operations.

1168
01:31:47,504 --> 01:31:48,924
There are several programs involved.

1169
01:31:48,985 --> 01:31:56,286
The governors consolidate some of the funding streams, so it's unclear which programs will benefit and which ones will be cut.

1170
01:31:56,966 --> 01:31:59,787
This needs to be fleshed out over the next deliberative period.

1171
01:32:00,347 --> 01:32:06,608
The Children's Trust Fund, which funds a good part of the family network, a major contributor to our family, is level funding.

1172
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,249
They're trying to do more, and hopefully

1173
01:32:10,089 --> 01:32:18,956
They get more because they're a very good program, but if they get level funding and more and more programs come in, then they cut back what they can give to any one program.

1174
01:32:20,137 --> 01:32:29,684
Overall, the cherry sheet proposed by the governor assigns 814,088 in new receipts to Medford and 869,051 in new charges.

1175
01:32:30,024 --> 01:32:31,205
It's a negative of 54,963.

1176
01:32:31,465 --> 01:32:38,130
So you can see that state aid to Medford is very flat, very flat.

1177
01:32:40,343 --> 01:32:45,584
The above is a very preliminary snapshot, which we'll continue to analyze and refine.

1178
01:32:46,224 --> 01:32:52,246
We'll also strongly lobby the state house delegation for adjustments that are more supportive of our needs and objectives.

1179
01:32:53,186 --> 01:32:54,246
Cherry sheets are attached.

1180
01:32:54,266 --> 01:33:01,368
I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.

1181
01:33:01,388 --> 01:33:05,989
I just, I don't know what number nine school choice costs refer to.

1182
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:09,510
There is a program called school choice.

1183
01:33:10,637 --> 01:33:24,920
that enables a youngster to go from Medford or from, well, we don't participate in it, go from Medford to another community for a fixed amount of money if they wanna go there, if that school system, let's say, wants to participate.

1184
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:36,382
There are some schools out there that take youngsters in on school choice because it fills empty seats and they get five, $6,000, depending on whether special needs or not, and it gives them a certain amount of money.

1185
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:38,322
It's a very low amount of money.

1186
01:33:38,902 --> 01:33:43,966
And if a youngster has certain needs and the like, it could very well be losing financial proposition.

1187
01:33:44,146 --> 01:33:53,233
However, they're projecting that there's probably 10 to 12 youngsters from Medford who might fit into that category going elsewhere next year.

1188
01:33:53,273 --> 01:33:53,413
Okay?

1189
01:33:53,453 --> 01:33:53,613
Thanks.

1190
01:33:53,633 --> 01:33:59,598
There's a motion to receive and place on file this report.

1191
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:00,438
So moved.

1192
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:01,599
All those in favor?

1193
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:02,360
Aye.

1194
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,180
All those opposed?

1195
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,962
Paper's placed on file.

1196
01:34:06,162 --> 01:34:09,263
Report on Minuteman Regional Technical High School, Mr. Superintendent.

1197
01:34:09,283 --> 01:34:17,486
Madam Mayor, Minuteman's another example of something that we've worked with for a number of years.

1198
01:34:17,506 --> 01:34:21,907
And we've put a lot of money into Minuteman.

1199
01:34:22,608 --> 01:34:27,609
And to some degree, part of it was because our vocational school wasn't everything it needed to be.

1200
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:30,951
But our vocational school is rising and done very, very well.

1201
01:34:33,274 --> 01:34:45,259
We've got a lot of other options in our collaborations with Cambridge and Somerville and Waltham that enable us to do some things that will help us keep our students home and keep our dollars home.

1202
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:52,082
Minuteman Regional Technical High School currently serves 673 students from many different communities.

1203
01:34:52,522 --> 01:34:57,864
There are 16 member towns who enroll 396 students, and 277 students come from non-member towns, like Medford.

1204
01:35:03,058 --> 01:35:09,102
When Minuteman was originally built in Lexington in 1975, it projected serving almost 1,000 students.

1205
01:35:09,762 --> 01:35:13,265
The history of Minuteman enrollments tells us it was a very unrealistic projection.

1206
01:35:13,845 --> 01:35:26,453
Ron Fitzgerald, who at one time was the superintendent of Minuteman, told Commissioner Dave Driscoll at the time that he would always need at least 100 students from outside the district each year, each freshman class, to reach that goal.

1207
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:28,414
And even with that, he didn't reach the goal.

1208
01:35:31,036 --> 01:35:32,597
The following is the current enrollment

1209
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:35,860
from member towns.

1210
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:43,102
You can see that, I'm not going to read it for you, but you can see some of the towns are very small, like Wayland 2 and West End 5 and so on and so forth.

1211
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:51,685
And the big ones are Arlington, Lexington, Lancaster, Belmont to some degree, okay, Acton.

1212
01:35:52,885 --> 01:35:57,587
But they're made up of 16 towns and not many of them, you know, send a lot of Doversons to.

1213
01:35:58,887 --> 01:36:00,228
Seven of the member towns

1214
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:05,758
are actively considering withdrawal from the regional district under a one-time option.

1215
01:36:06,819 --> 01:36:09,801
Normally, withdrawal would require a unanimous vote of all members.

1216
01:36:10,582 --> 01:36:13,684
The seven communities would decrease current enrollment by 57 students.

1217
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:18,167
They include Boxboro, Carlisle, Dover, Lincoln, Sudbury, Wayland, and Weston.

1218
01:36:18,187 --> 01:36:20,569
Those are the ones who are actively voting.

1219
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:26,713
Minuteman realized that it couldn't get 16 communities to vote for a revised regional agreement and for a new school.

1220
01:36:28,352 --> 01:36:35,396
So as a result, the school committee came up with a plan to allow communities to leave on a one-time option if they would approve the revised regional agreement.

1221
01:36:36,317 --> 01:36:37,297
This is what you've got here.

1222
01:36:38,318 --> 01:36:44,221
Seven communities can only leave if they approve the new regional agreement, which would diminish their voting capacity if they were to stay.

1223
01:36:45,002 --> 01:36:53,206
So if they stay, communities that send fewer kids would have almost proportionate voting, less power.

1224
01:36:53,226 --> 01:36:55,308
So instead of having a 1-0 vote, they might have a 0.5 vote.

1225
01:36:56,897 --> 01:36:58,658
OK, compared to communities that send a lot more.

1226
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:08,665
The Minuteman School Committee devised this one, too, because with seven communities in opposition, there would be no constructive way to gain sufficient town meeting support across the region.

1227
01:37:09,446 --> 01:37:15,831
Seven projected leaving districts recognized they stay there for a pupil cost would be extraordinary for a limited number of students.

1228
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:17,812
And the new building was constructive.

1229
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:20,694
And the projected capital debt was apportioned.

1230
01:37:21,154 --> 01:37:23,396
For example, Weston would pay approximately $49,000 per student.

1231
01:37:23,436 --> 01:37:24,317
Good Harvard for that.

1232
01:37:27,157 --> 01:37:30,878
Plus a special needs cost assessment.

1233
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:38,120
Minuteman is the most expensive vocational school in the state, with the exception of the agricultural schools.

1234
01:37:38,921 --> 01:37:40,021
And that's an under the instance.

1235
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:41,561
Some of the agricultural schools are pretty good.

1236
01:37:42,422 --> 01:37:47,383
As previously stated, non-member cities and towns currently provide 277 students as follows.

1237
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:52,445
Boston since 25, Medford since 34, Waltham 44, Watertown 66, and others about 109.

1238
01:37:58,612 --> 01:38:06,617
Next year, Medford will have 17 seniors graduating this year, and we'll have 17 students remaining there, and they can't take ninth graders.

1239
01:38:07,737 --> 01:38:14,461
The current base tuition for our district students is $17,005, plus $4,500 in special needs services required.

1240
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:18,063
The rate is set by the commissioner, and that rate's coming down based on agreement.

1241
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:25,889
Minute Man has the MSBA tentative go-ahead to build a new school in Lincoln for 628 students.

1242
01:38:25,949 --> 01:38:29,151
I have no idea how they're going to get 628 students there.

1243
01:38:30,032 --> 01:38:34,054
The towns that remain in the district must approve bonding for $144.9 million plus interest on a 30-year period, meaning $300 million.

1244
01:38:34,094 --> 01:38:36,676
State funding is projected to be $45,206,061 for the proposed 257,745 square foot school.

1245
01:38:51,835 --> 01:38:54,656
Okay?

1246
01:38:54,696 --> 01:39:09,323
Now, that 45,000 belies the reimbursement rate that's being advertised at 42, 43, 44%, because it's really only 32% of the actual cost, because not all costs that Minuteman is proposing are eligible for reimbursement.

1247
01:39:10,964 --> 01:39:12,124
It'll come out in the town meetings.

1248
01:39:13,045 --> 01:39:16,686
If the project goes forward, the school is expected to be open for the fall of 2019.

1249
01:39:16,726 --> 01:39:17,267
Most estimates are 2020.

1250
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:21,715
take a little bit longer.

1251
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:27,278
There are many non-financial contingencies to be worked out before construction can take place on the Lincoln site.

1252
01:39:27,698 --> 01:39:29,979
For example, wetlands, EPA.

1253
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:40,684
Secondly, Lincoln is asking for mitigation for the use of their land, police and fire and other considerations yet to be decided by the Minuteman School Committee and others.

1254
01:39:41,145 --> 01:39:46,507
So we're not clear as to how that's going to play out and how that might delay or not delay what's going on.

1255
01:39:47,007 --> 01:39:48,308
So let's look at the Medford impact.

1256
01:39:50,328 --> 01:39:52,130
Currently, we have 34 students at Minutemen.

1257
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:57,594
This year, 17 seniors will graduate, and no ninth graders can go there under the new state regulations.

1258
01:39:58,295 --> 01:40:01,978
Also, the expansion and development of our vocational program will keep future students home.

1259
01:40:02,839 --> 01:40:04,760
Three years ago, we had 50 students at Minutemen.

1260
01:40:05,381 --> 01:40:11,166
We also had cooperative agreements with neighboring districts in Cambridge, Somerville, Waltham, and Boston through our Solve Collaborative.

1261
01:40:11,906 --> 01:40:18,332
The reduction of our enrollment at Minutemen will enable us to save significant funding, which can be reinvested in our own school system.

1262
01:40:18,652 --> 01:40:23,473
in our own vocational school or other concerns that you would find to be priority.

1263
01:40:24,013 --> 01:40:36,077
The collaboration between the high school and the vocational school is also a major achievement, since it will enhance college prospects for our vocational students and provide occupational skill training options for high school students at a reasonable cost.

1264
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:38,917
So this is what's going on right now.

1265
01:40:39,438 --> 01:40:42,458
Town meeting should take place somewhere before March 1st.

1266
01:40:43,179 --> 01:40:47,960
We'll begin to see what takes place and what moves forward, but it's clear

1267
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:51,760
that we are moving away from Minuteman.

1268
01:40:52,821 --> 01:40:54,722
Minuteman has to solve its own issues.

1269
01:40:55,783 --> 01:41:01,087
Right now, financial, building, all those kinds of things, and there's a lot of disagreement among the towns.

1270
01:41:02,408 --> 01:41:03,829
That doesn't mean they won't build a school.

1271
01:41:04,929 --> 01:41:17,939
It just simply means I don't know how they're going to get 628 students when the Metro Vocational School and Waltham and other places are building and expanding their own programs so that, Somerville, so that

1272
01:41:18,747 --> 01:41:19,547
The kids are going to stay home.

1273
01:41:21,488 --> 01:41:22,409
Happy to take any questions.

1274
01:41:23,449 --> 01:41:25,630
Could I ask just one question from the chair?

1275
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:25,730
Sure.

1276
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:31,833
Lincoln is willing to host a new Minuteman Regional High School and they want to withdraw from the region?

1277
01:41:31,913 --> 01:41:32,553
Yes.

1278
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:34,974
That's accurate.

1279
01:41:35,174 --> 01:41:38,436
It's tricky because obviously there are different factions in Lincoln.

1280
01:41:39,336 --> 01:41:41,337
But Minuteman owns land in Lincoln.

1281
01:41:42,058 --> 01:41:45,939
So even if it doesn't participate, Minuteman owns the land.

1282
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,300
But to build on it,

1283
01:41:47,890 --> 01:42:01,922
would require permits from the town, obviously, and that would require mitigation as they're talking about sewage, they're talking about all the kinds of things that water, all the kinds of things that would be fire, police, it would be typical.

1284
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:10,770
What's the program that most of the kids from Medford go to Minuteman for currently?

1285
01:42:11,575 --> 01:42:12,716
It's varied over the years.

1286
01:42:12,996 --> 01:42:13,296
Okay.

1287
01:42:13,476 --> 01:42:17,639
At this particular point in time, the only programs they think they can still go there for is horticulture.

1288
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:18,480
Okay.

1289
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:25,905
And then, so if we chose not, the kids chose not to go to Midland, but they want to go to horticulture, that would be Essex agricultural.

1290
01:42:25,925 --> 01:42:40,595
They could go to Essex agricultural, but we would like to hope that, you know, since horticulture isn't really a field in which there's a growing market demand, we'd like to argue that why would you put a kid in a field that the market demand is actually coming the other way?

1291
01:42:41,043 --> 01:42:46,631
There may be other areas that a student can go into that would suffice or at least meet their interest.

1292
01:42:47,432 --> 01:42:50,716
But why would you go into horticulture in a world that is not funding that?

1293
01:42:51,778 --> 01:42:53,680
Maybe environmental science would be a better choice.

1294
01:42:56,976 --> 01:42:57,116
Ms.

1295
01:42:57,136 --> 01:42:57,576
Vandekly.

1296
01:42:59,017 --> 01:43:08,121
Mr. Superintendent, you indicated, and as we know, Medford is not a member district to Minuteman, just the way Arlington is, for example.

1297
01:43:08,461 --> 01:43:19,286
But at one point along the line, I remember that they were arguing that we should pay a bigger share when they built a new school because, after all, if we had kids attending.

1298
01:43:20,046 --> 01:43:23,728
At this point, that discussion is totally off the table, correct?

1299
01:43:23,888 --> 01:43:26,149
At this point, that discussion is something that

1300
01:43:27,012 --> 01:43:30,314
isn't in play because the school hasn't been built.

1301
01:43:31,115 --> 01:43:41,983
And the state has indicated that if we were, in their opinion, if we did have to pay a capital assessment, it certainly wouldn't be at the level that they're asking their member towns to pay.

1302
01:43:42,343 --> 01:43:45,145
It'd be only for those facilities which are actually impacting the kid.

1303
01:43:45,842 --> 01:43:54,012
Now, we have argued, and we simply have some pretty good legal backing for this with attorneys that we've discussed this with, that this is an unfunded mandate.

1304
01:43:54,372 --> 01:43:57,716
The commissioner exceeded his authority in putting that in regulation.

1305
01:43:58,276 --> 01:44:05,365
The board exceeded their authority with sending it off to the state auditor and then off to the legislature, the courts rather if necessary.

1306
01:44:06,362 --> 01:44:07,222
So that would be something.

1307
01:44:07,643 --> 01:44:13,845
The other question I have is within, obviously, we have some great programs and expansion of our vocational school.

1308
01:44:14,145 --> 01:44:19,947
You've just indicated that Waltham is doing the same with themselves.

1309
01:44:22,148 --> 01:44:31,574
Is there, yet somehow Minuteman has managed to say, yes, there is a need for our school, a continuous need.

1310
01:44:32,014 --> 01:44:42,921
Is there, within Massachusetts and the other vocational schools, more capacity so that students could be absorbed in a different way?

1311
01:44:42,941 --> 01:44:44,522
Most of the vocational schools are pretty full.

1312
01:44:45,533 --> 01:44:49,997
There is a movement on the part of the governor to expand vocational education across the commonwealth.

1313
01:44:50,537 --> 01:44:56,322
There is a $75 million bond that he's putting out there for vocational school development.

1314
01:44:56,943 --> 01:44:59,665
We will be applying for some of that money.

1315
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:01,567
In fact, the proposal is in.

1316
01:45:01,627 --> 01:45:03,189
We'll talk about that at another time.

1317
01:45:03,889 --> 01:45:06,872
It's in the area of culinary and hospitality.

1318
01:45:07,512 --> 01:45:10,235
And it's a very substantial thing in conjunction with WIN.

1319
01:45:11,213 --> 01:45:13,195
Okay, but we'll go into that at another point.

1320
01:45:13,255 --> 01:45:18,979
We also have our new media world that's being built and developed and again to be talked about at another time.

1321
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:29,127
But the reality is is that we are very well positioned to block any programs that Minuteman would have put up and say we'll take Medford kids with.

1322
01:45:31,773 --> 01:45:46,722
Not that, you know, at one time, I'm going to say this very honestly, at one time, it probably was a case for some kids to go to Minuteman because if you wanted to go to college and you wanted to take some of the more advanced courses, maybe you couldn't get them through the traditional vote that we were running, okay?

1323
01:45:46,762 --> 01:45:48,022
And some people took advantage of that.

1324
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:58,068
So let's accept the fact that, you know, we weren't doing everything we could do to perfect that, although we did do some things that, you know, that would improve our program and attract kids to keep them home.

1325
01:45:59,169 --> 01:45:59,829
But that's gone.

1326
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:01,370
That's gone.

1327
01:46:02,294 --> 01:46:13,280
And for us to pay the extraordinary cost that's Minuteman, and to travel our kids to Lexington or Lincoln, whenever it's going to be, doesn't make any sense.

1328
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:18,623
We need to build up our own programs, do what we have to do.

1329
01:46:19,444 --> 01:46:21,065
Minuteman's a level two school, by the way.

1330
01:46:21,665 --> 01:46:23,406
Medford Vocational is a level one school.

1331
01:46:24,106 --> 01:46:25,767
Not that, again, I'll go back to the issue.

1332
01:46:25,787 --> 01:46:27,168
Don't hang too much on those issues.

1333
01:46:27,228 --> 01:46:31,050
But, but, but, when it works to our advantage,

1334
01:46:33,202 --> 01:46:38,424
But I mean, but the reality is, is that we've made significant movement.

1335
01:46:39,885 --> 01:47:00,112
And let's make that movement work for us so that we can invest in our own kids, in our own place at a better amount, fund other programs that you're interested in, and make sure that we develop our school system, our community, with the neighbors around us who want to work with us and collaborate with us, rather than somebody who just simply needs us as a cash cow.

1336
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:02,671
Thank you.

1337
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:12,996
I just wanted to say that another significant change was when we don't have to send our freshmen there for their freshman year.

1338
01:47:13,076 --> 01:47:19,259
We get to keep them in Medfit and that's a new change within this whole process.

1339
01:47:21,693 --> 01:47:31,397
And once children are in our, you know, stay within their districts and make friends, they're less likely to leave them to go somewhere else unless they have a vision in their life.

1340
01:47:31,497 --> 01:47:35,739
And then of course, if we don't offer it, we're going to find them the right program.

1341
01:47:36,279 --> 01:47:39,880
But that's really a significant change coming forward.

1342
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:44,842
One of the things you need to remember is, is that it was never supposed to be that ninth graders would go.

1343
01:47:44,882 --> 01:47:47,603
Commissioner Driscoll at the time,

1344
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:53,909
was lobbied by certain members of the state board to make an exception because Minuteman was struggling.

1345
01:47:53,969 --> 01:47:55,809
And the idea was, well, you send a few kids over there.

1346
01:47:56,830 --> 01:47:58,050
Send a few kids over there.

1347
01:47:58,490 --> 01:47:59,870
The few kids became a lot of kids.

1348
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:02,491
And they went out of whack.

1349
01:48:03,051 --> 01:48:07,292
So the argument was put it back.

1350
01:48:07,332 --> 01:48:08,592
We had testified at the board.

1351
01:48:08,632 --> 01:48:13,773
We were there with others, Austin and others, and made our points, and we carried the day on that.

1352
01:48:14,153 --> 01:48:17,014
I believe, if I remember correctly, you led the charge in that?

1353
01:48:17,034 --> 01:48:17,754
I certainly did.

1354
01:48:18,454 --> 01:48:21,356
I was certainly part of it, certainly part of it.

1355
01:48:21,396 --> 01:48:22,497
I've been selling bureaus lately.

1356
01:48:23,838 --> 01:48:25,579
Motion to accept and place on file.

1357
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,121
On the motion to accept the paper, place on file.

1358
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:28,882
All those in favor?

1359
01:48:28,902 --> 01:48:28,962
Aye.

1360
01:48:29,282 --> 01:48:29,903
Opposed?

1361
01:48:29,923 --> 01:48:32,044
Paper is placed on file.

1362
01:48:32,725 --> 01:48:33,525
Negotiations?

1363
01:48:33,545 --> 01:48:33,966
None.

1364
01:48:34,446 --> 01:48:34,966
Old business?

1365
01:48:35,006 --> 01:48:35,207
None.

1366
01:48:35,267 --> 01:48:35,927
Communications?

1367
01:48:35,967 --> 01:48:36,167
None.

1368
01:48:36,227 --> 01:48:36,748
New business?

1369
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:38,329
School committee resolution?

1370
01:48:38,897 --> 01:48:43,682
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of John Donahue.

1371
01:48:44,162 --> 01:48:48,167
Mr. Donahue was the brother of retired Supervisor of Health, Eileen DeBattista.

1372
01:48:49,088 --> 01:48:55,234
School Committee resolution, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Catherine Silver.

1373
01:48:55,794 --> 01:48:58,738
Mrs. Silver was the mother-in-law of Fire Chief Frank Gilberti.

1374
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:13,296
Also under suspension, offered by school committee member Mr. Skerry, he had resolved that the school committee express a sincere condolences to the McLaughlin family on the passing of Robert McLaughlin, Army veteran and former Medford police officer.

1375
01:49:13,696 --> 01:49:18,302
He was the uncle of John McLaughlin, director of school maintenance for the Medford public schools.

1376
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,948
And also under suspension, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of William Hamkin.

1377
01:49:26,328 --> 01:49:29,192
Mr. Hamkin, who died suddenly, was a graduate of Medford High School.

1378
01:49:29,652 --> 01:49:33,678
Mr. Hamkin was the brother of Sheila McGlynn and brother-in-law of Mayor Michael J. McGlynn.

1379
01:49:33,698 --> 01:49:37,583
Will everyone please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these Medford residents.

1380
01:49:53,668 --> 01:50:00,732
Just in regards to the whole business, I know it's not on here, but can we request an update on the crossing guard at the Fells?

1381
01:50:01,153 --> 01:50:02,173
Where we are with that?

1382
01:50:02,514 --> 01:50:03,414
We were- On the Fells?

1383
01:50:03,734 --> 01:50:05,756
Yes, we were- Was it DCR?

1384
01:50:06,196 --> 01:50:11,459
Yes, it was in the superintendent's office who was looking into

1385
01:50:12,593 --> 01:50:15,976
reinstating a crossing guard that had been removed from there.

1386
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:20,361
And I'm just requesting that an update, and maybe at our next meeting.

1387
01:50:20,641 --> 01:50:26,226
On the motion that an update be provided on the crossing guard position on the fells that are in the 2CR roadway.

1388
01:50:26,447 --> 01:50:27,287
All those in favor?

1389
01:50:27,488 --> 01:50:27,808
Aye.

1390
01:50:27,928 --> 01:50:28,469
All those opposed?

1391
01:50:28,489 --> 01:50:29,369
The motion passes.

1392
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:32,573
We also have a paper and a suspension for the van.

1393
01:50:33,498 --> 01:50:33,758
Yes.

1394
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:42,402
Is there anyone that could... Actually, the superintendent was supposed to speak about it, but since he... They would like to go to Hershey Park, Township, Pennsylvania.

1395
01:50:43,542 --> 01:50:47,363
It is Friday, May 20th, 2016, to Sunday, May 22nd, 2016.

1396
01:50:48,024 --> 01:50:55,407
There's a lot of educational values, including Zoo America, music in the parks, etc.

1397
01:50:55,587 --> 01:50:57,548
The cost for a student in a quad is $385.

1398
01:50:58,948 --> 01:51:01,010
Triple 410, double 465.

1399
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:03,612
They also will be having adult chaperones.

1400
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:07,636
As on past trips, the BN Director will serve as the official chaperone.

1401
01:51:07,676 --> 01:51:09,377
Additional chaperones will be added if needed.

1402
01:51:09,397 --> 01:51:13,521
Typically, we like to have one chaperone for every eight to ten students.

1403
01:51:13,801 --> 01:51:15,102
They were looking for our approval.

1404
01:51:15,122 --> 01:51:15,242
Ms.

1405
01:51:15,302 --> 01:51:15,722
Cuno.

1406
01:51:15,883 --> 01:51:17,464
Yeah, if I may, I'm sorry.

1407
01:51:18,084 --> 01:51:19,686
The BN Director was here.

1408
01:51:20,886 --> 01:51:23,608
She was going to actually put this on the agenda.

1409
01:51:24,128 --> 01:51:26,289
They just found out about it at the last minute.

1410
01:51:26,549 --> 01:51:30,652
She was going to put it on the agenda, but she didn't realize that we were going to meet on the 29th.

1411
01:51:31,092 --> 01:51:37,515
And the agency that has been contracted had told her that they needed to have the approval by the 19th.

1412
01:51:38,135 --> 01:51:43,518
And if she didn't give them an answer, then she would lose the spot because there are other invitations.

1413
01:51:43,538 --> 01:51:44,579
So that's the reason.

1414
01:51:45,139 --> 01:51:51,629
Madam Mayor, I've reviewed the paper, find it in order, and recommend that we approve this trip to Hershey, Pennsylvania on behalf of the mayor.

1415
01:51:52,711 --> 01:51:56,517
Madam Mayor, we do not have the costs associated with the...

1416
01:51:58,727 --> 01:51:59,888
We do, okay.

1417
01:51:59,928 --> 01:52:02,409
Great, thank you.

1418
01:52:02,769 --> 01:52:05,950
On the motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1419
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:06,670
All those in favor?

1420
01:52:07,031 --> 01:52:07,151
Aye.

1421
01:52:07,231 --> 01:52:08,531
Roll call, Mr. Superintendent?

1422
01:52:08,551 --> 01:52:08,691

1423
01:52:09,112 --> 01:52:09,932

1424
01:52:10,152 --> 01:52:10,452

1425
01:52:10,572 --> 01:52:11,733

1426
01:52:11,813 --> 01:52:13,493
Motion passes.

1427
01:52:13,573 --> 01:52:14,594
Roll call.

1428
01:52:14,734 --> 01:52:17,855
Roll call vote.

1429
01:52:17,935 --> 01:52:19,016
Okay, Mrs. Cuneo.

1430
01:52:19,216 --> 01:52:19,456
Yes.

1431
01:52:19,836 --> 01:52:20,636
Mr. Benedetto.

1432
01:52:20,676 --> 01:52:20,917
Yes.

1433
01:52:20,957 --> 01:52:21,217
Ms.

1434
01:52:21,257 --> 01:52:21,557
Kratz.

1435
01:52:21,637 --> 01:52:21,797
Yes.

1436
01:52:22,393 --> 01:52:23,674
Mr. Stone, Mr. Skerry, yes.

1437
01:52:23,714 --> 01:52:24,834
Mrs. Vanderbilt, yes.

1438
01:52:24,914 --> 01:52:26,055
Mayor Burke, yes.

1439
01:52:26,075 --> 01:52:27,196
7 in the affirmative.

1440
01:52:27,476 --> 01:52:34,560
I should have probably disclosed that both of my children are on it.

1441
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:36,221
You can, I don't think it's a problem.

1442
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:36,821
Marked Ms.

1443
01:52:36,861 --> 01:52:40,123
Cuno as abstaining due to a conflict of interest.

1444
01:52:43,064 --> 01:52:44,925
On the motion to adjourn, opted by Ms.

1445
01:52:44,965 --> 01:52:45,305
Cuno.

1446
01:52:45,346 --> 01:52:46,146
All those in favor?

1447
01:52:46,186 --> 01:52:47,166
Aye.
