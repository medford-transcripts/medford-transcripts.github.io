[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello.

16
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:43,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

17
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:00:48,052 --> 00:01:03,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:13,599
[SPEAKER_10]: 17296, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Medford Fire Station, engine three, on Salem Street be discussed.

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox.

21
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:30,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the opportunity last week to take a tour of Engine 3, Ladder 2, which is the fire station on Salem Street, 276 Salem Street.

23
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:44,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And if members recall, back some three years ago, this council voted for phase one of a refurbishing of many of our fire stations throughout the community.

24
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:51,235
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way, which did not include Engine 1, which was the headquarters.

25
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:59,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And many of the stations got some major and minor upgrades to the station.

26
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:09,302
[SPEAKER_09]: The one in particular that I viewed, Mr. President, at Engine 3 on Salem Street was work that was performed back in April of 2014.

27
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a little under three years ago.

28
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, the station had a list of priorities.

29
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:30,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there were five separate sections of priorities, of which each section contained 10 or 11 items that needed to be done as a punch list.

30
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:39,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the major items at engine three was the floor where the engine truck sits.

31
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And that particular floor, the cement was splitting.

32
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And the slab was deteriorating because of the splitting of the cement floor.

33
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:58,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, it was discussed by the chief of the fire department as well as the captain of Salem

34
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:08,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Street Fire Station, that that was going to be one of the major recommendations for renovation.

35
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:16,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anyone's familiar, there's actually two bays at Salem Street, and they were only going to work on the bay to the right.

36
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:26,311
[SPEAKER_09]: And the work involved repairing the slab, which is the top cement floor, and also

37
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:33,846
[SPEAKER_09]: laying down a new epoxy coating on the floor and that's uh

38
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:40,656
[SPEAKER_09]: like a rubberized, similar to a rubberized flooring, which expands and contracts.

39
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:46,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So that work was done at a cost of $91,000 three years ago.

40
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:55,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And many of the holes that were on the slab floor were patched.

41
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,709
[SPEAKER_09]: The epoxy was placed on the

42
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:08,235
[SPEAKER_09]: floor itself, and three years later, Mr. President, and I have a picture here for my colleagues if they'd like to see it.

43
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:14,259
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually the bottom of the cement floor that you can see from the basement.

44
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:21,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a couple of real good pictures that show the cement peeling off from the bottom of the floor.

45
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:25,039
[SPEAKER_09]: that we just paid $91,000 for.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know about you, but I'm outraged to see this type of shoddy craftsmanship and lack of concern by the city after just paying $91,000 to have this work done.

47
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:52,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if the work is still under warranty, Mr. President, but someone from this city needs to get a hold of the contractor or the subcontractor immediately

48
00:04:52,552 --> 00:05:02,204
[SPEAKER_09]: and have them go down to that site because we're in the same situation we were roughly three and a half years ago when we commissioned this work to be done.

49
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:07,410
[SPEAKER_09]: We commissioned it because the cement was splitting like we're seeing in this picture.

50
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're already seeing cracks on the epoxy floor.

51
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is made to expand and contract.

52
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,934
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not supposed to see cracks on epoxy floors.

53
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:20,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're already starting to see cracks on the floor, Mr. President.

54
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:40,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So my first motion would be that that floor, the bay to the right-hand side, be reviewed immediately by our building department, be reviewed by Paul Moki, our building commissioner, and the appropriate channels be reached

55
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,137
[SPEAKER_09]: to get a hold of this contractor or subcontractor that did the work, Mr. President.

56
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:51,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Secondly, if we're not aware, if you could pass that around, that'd be great.

57
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:56,292
[SPEAKER_09]: They also replaced the overhead doors

58
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,611
[SPEAKER_09]: in both bays.

59
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:02,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were two overhead doors put in at a cost of $40,000.

60
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:12,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And when they put the doors in, they have to meet new requirement now, new state code.

61
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:14,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And the code calls for

62
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,991
[SPEAKER_09]: What they refer to as safety lights.

63
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:20,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have them in a lot of our stations because they haven't been upgraded.

64
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:23,960
[SPEAKER_09]: But Engine 1 has the safety lights.

65
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,643
[SPEAKER_09]: They look like traffic lights.

66
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:29,268
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a green light, big green light, and a red light.

67
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll have two of them.

68
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,109
[SPEAKER_09]: at the entrance to each door.

69
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And this alerts the driver of the truck when it's safe to pull out.

70
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,234
[SPEAKER_09]: When the doors go up, the light turns green.

71
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,236
[SPEAKER_09]: If the door's not up, the light's red.

72
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,598
[SPEAKER_09]: The driver, it's another safety precaution.

73
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,581
[SPEAKER_09]: They know not to exit the building, because that means the door's down.

74
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:52,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the new overhead lights were put in.

75
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,105
[SPEAKER_09]: They look terrific.

76
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,946
[SPEAKER_09]: both bays at engine three.

77
00:06:56,486 --> 00:07:04,590
[SPEAKER_09]: However, there was never enough money and the specs of the project did not call to wire these particular lights.

78
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've been up there for three years and they're not wired.

79
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:17,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're not serving any type of safety concern for the fire station and they're not fully operating.

80
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:25,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a major concern, Mr. President, that such a basic

81
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:34,489
[SPEAKER_09]: improvement with safety lights, there was no thought about wiring the lights, and that wasn't part of the spec.

82
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:42,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. President, I would ask that that be the second motion that we get a response back from the city administration.

83
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:56,380
[SPEAKER_09]: We find out who the clerk of the works was on this particular project, find out why the safety lights were not included, the wiring of the safety lights were not included in the bid specs,

84
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,265
[SPEAKER_09]: and why just the lights were put up in this particular station, Mr. President, without being wired.

85
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:13,333
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a number of other concerns that I won't address here tonight, Mr. President, but I did want to call to the Council's attention

86
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:18,158
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of discussion about a new fire headquarters.

87
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:27,460
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of discussion, and don't forget, the fire headquarters, I believe, is out of the six fire stations, it's the third newest.

88
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:43,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're talking about replacing the third newest, and we have these other stations, like Engine 4, Engine 3, what I just spoke about, Engine 5, that are far older than our headquarters, and in my opinion,

89
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,743
[SPEAKER_09]: need the same amount of work, if not more, than the headquarters, Mr. President.

90
00:08:52,385 --> 00:09:08,257
[SPEAKER_09]: What I wanted to call to my colleagues' attention, and I know it's been raised here before in the council, is that the fact that we just got a second set of turnout here, and the firefighters are ecstatic now they finally got a second set of turnout here,

91
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:32,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And the issue remains, Mr. President, that we still don't have the basic necessity, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn found out when we did the tour at the headquarters, we have what they refer to as an extractor, which is basically it's a giant washing machine that's like on steroids that cleans this heavy-duty turnout gear.

92
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:33,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And bless you.

93
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:36,495
[SPEAKER_09]: This heavy-duty turnout gear

94
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:44,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have one extractor, one giant washing machine for over 120 firefighters.

95
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes roughly 45 minutes.

96
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do the math, you'll figure out we're in dire need of these extractors.

97
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:59,308
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes about 45 minutes to wash one uniform, and it takes about two hours to dry.

98
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's on an average.

99
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:21,759
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have one extractor, so this means that after a fire goff a bit, the firefighters have to take their uniform from North Method, from West Method, from Haines Square, down to the headquarters, and wait in line to use the extractors.

100
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,415
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I've been told, the extractors, the drying washing machines, about $7,000.

101
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,797
[SPEAKER_09]: The dryer that they use is about $6,000.

102
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:40,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can equip a fire station with an extractor and a dryer at a cost of about $13,000 and then another maybe $1,200 to $1,500 to properly wire it.

103
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:55,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're talking anywhere from maybe $14,000 to $15,000 to make sure, Mr. President, that this is not you or I washing our suit coat after we're done with a council meeting.

104
00:10:55,782 --> 00:11:02,329
[SPEAKER_09]: This is washing off the contaminants that leach into the firefighters' skin when they're on these uniforms.

105
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:06,413
[SPEAKER_09]: And I recently read an article

106
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:16,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anyone's interested in looking at it, it's an article on high cancer rate and risk hazards for firefighters.

107
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:21,491
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a November 20, 2016 article, and it's out of San Francisco.

108
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:28,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And it states that prevention in San Francisco sounds like a washing machine.

109
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,922
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how they address cancer prevention.

110
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:36,066
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no secret to this, Mr. President.

111
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done all over the country, and it's very successful in washing the turnout gear in a timely fashion and not sitting it back into the fire station, which is happening now, and cross-contaminating the new uniforms with the old uniforms.

112
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a major concern.

113
00:11:54,291 --> 00:12:02,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And according to the International Association of Firefighters, it says 63 percent of firefighters will get cancer at some point.

114
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,974
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a staggering number.

115
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:08,996
[SPEAKER_09]: When I read that, I said, you've got to be kidding me.

116
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:25,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can anticipate, Mr. President, and it's awful to say that 63 percent of our firefighters, we have 120 of them, at some point may contract some type of cancer.

117
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,429
[SPEAKER_09]: And anything we can do, Mr. President, there are things that are probably out of our control.

118
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:34,031
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to provide the latest and greatest equipment.

119
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:40,837
[SPEAKER_09]: But anything we can do as a city to help mitigate that, we are obligated to do that, Mr. President.

120
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:42,578
[SPEAKER_09]: We are obligated to do it.

121
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:49,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And to have one extractor to wash these turnout gears is a complete disgrace.

122
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:56,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And the administration, and I'll even say this council, should be ashamed of ourselves, Mr. President.

123
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:05,014
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be ashamed of ourselves to let this linger on, especially with the facts and figures that we have on cancer rates, Mr. President.

124
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:11,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I read an article recently, I believe it was in the Boston Globe, and they did a study statewide.

125
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And Method was at near the top for cancer rates among active and retired firefighters.

126
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:22,285
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alarming, Mr. President.

127
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:23,646
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alarming.

128
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,087
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not a giant city.

129
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:32,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be near the top of the rate for cancer rates among the state is very concerning for me.

130
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:44,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the mayor here a couple of weeks ago and she stood up and she turned around to the firefighters and she said, whatever we can do to help and protect the people that protect us, I'm on board.

131
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was a great line, Mr. President.

132
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,880
[SPEAKER_09]: But actions speak louder than words.

133
00:13:52,410 --> 00:14:05,448
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the mayor's on board, Mr. President, I would expect, and I talked to the union president, I would expect, Mr. President, tomorrow that the mayor will have a purchase order.

134
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:11,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow morning, a purchase order for two new extractors and two new dryers.

135
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:17,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the one at the headquarters and put two new ones, extractors and dryers, in the other stations.

136
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:25,652
[SPEAKER_09]: This way we'll have three stations that are equipped to accommodate the firefighters throughout this community.

137
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:28,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not a giant expense.

138
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:35,237
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking $35,000 to $40,000 to ensure an additional safeguard for our firefighters.

139
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:47,632
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the article goes on, Mr. President, to say, it's easy to look at the plumes of billowing black smoke from a massive fire and know they aren't healthy.

140
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:53,578
[SPEAKER_09]: While firefighters are putting out flames, priority one is protection from the heat in those flames.

141
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,258
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what their turnout gear is for.

142
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,482
[SPEAKER_09]: The gear is doing its job, keeping firefighters from getting overheated and burned.

143
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:18,536
[SPEAKER_09]: But while in a fire environment, they're soaking up the toxins that are in the smoke and heated gases, and it's believed the toxins from years of putting out flames are soaking into the turnout fireproof fabric and slowly leaching in to the firefighter's skin.

144
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:23,520
[SPEAKER_09]: This is alarming, Mr. President, knowing the current condition

145
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,518
[SPEAKER_09]: and currently how we're treating our turnout gear in our stations.

146
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:28,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alarming.

147
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's alarming when you walk into a station and you smell a burnt smell.

148
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:39,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost like you're in a fire somewhere.

149
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,305
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the burnt smell of their gear, Mr. President.

150
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:44,826
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what it is.

151
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:50,508
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're putting these uniforms on and these particular pieces of gear

152
00:15:51,770 --> 00:16:01,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I just read, slowly but surely, Mr. President, if these aren't properly washed, the toxins are leaching into this skin.

153
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:02,235
[SPEAKER_09]: You are correct.

154
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:13,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that my first motion is that two additional extractors and two additional dryers

155
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:32,820
[SPEAKER_09]: be purchased immediately by this administration, purchase orders, and that they be located wherever the fire chief or the brave men and women of the fire department believe they're needed, Mr. President, and also that each fire station have a separate area.

156
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lungo, Kern, and I, when we toured

157
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,370
[SPEAKER_09]: of the headquarters, that was one of the major concerns.

158
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,512
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a second storage area for their gear.

159
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:55,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So you might have a pristine set of turnout gear you just got, and it's housed next to the gear that's waiting to be washed that was just in a house fire, or just in a car fire that released toxins.

160
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,561
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unacceptable, Mr. President.

161
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So in addition, my motion would be the two

162
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:17,522
[SPEAKER_09]: extractors, the two dryers, that each station that they find some space, Mr. President, where they can locate another set of turnout gear so there's not cross-contamination among the turnout gear.

163
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:27,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that this be taken in a roll call vote because of the importance of this matter.

164
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:34,256
[SPEAKER_09]: And that we receive a response immediately from the administration regarding this resolution, Mr. President.

165
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:34,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

166
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:38,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I think each machine does three uniforms, I think you told me.

167
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I correct?

168
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And it takes about 45 minutes per cycle.

169
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:46,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

170
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

171
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:51,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank Council Marks for bringing this forward tonight.

172
00:17:52,913 --> 00:18:02,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be doing everything we can to keep our firefighters safe, especially buying the extractors to wash the turnout gear.

173
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,081
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be a no-brainer.

174
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:04,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be done.

175
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And we should make sure that we take care of that right away.

176
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:15,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But just getting back to one of the council's other points with regard to Engine 3, I did have the opportunity

177
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,874
[SPEAKER_07]: a little while back to go down to Edge and Three as well.

178
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And they took me into the basement.

179
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:23,395
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave me a tour of the facility.

180
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:25,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're right.

181
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:32,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely scary to see when you go underneath that bay and you see crumbling cement.

182
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:38,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just scary to actually see that firsthand.

183
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's crumbling all over the place.

184
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And something needs to be done.

185
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:48,989
[SPEAKER_07]: But as I walk through the fire station, it's that, but there's other issues as well.

186
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:53,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've gone to a couple other fire stations as well.

187
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are a lot of issues.

188
00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:01,640
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of issues throughout our city in our fire stations that need to be addressed.

189
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,101
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to be addressed sooner than later.

190
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:10,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things, just if I could go back a little bit, prior to being on the city council, I was on the school committee.

191
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:19,275
[SPEAKER_07]: during the budget time, which is one of the most important times of the year, is you're going through the budget and what you allocate to building maintenance.

192
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:28,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I remember was my first time through the budget, I asked the director of buildings and grounds, what are we doing for preventive maintenance?

193
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And he looked at me, he said, Mr. Falco, we're doing nothing.

194
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was Mr. Edwards.

195
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:33,821
[SPEAKER_07]: That was back in 2010.

196
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:39,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I did then is I offered a motion, a resolution, that

197
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:52,243
[SPEAKER_07]: the school committee go out and tour each of the buildings throughout our community to actually see what's broken, what's fixed, and to have committee of the whole meetings to actually see firsthand as a group what needs to be addressed.

198
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:54,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did that.

199
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:56,084
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was very effective.

200
00:19:56,644 --> 00:20:00,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all went all at the same time to each of the facilities.

201
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:08,109
[SPEAKER_07]: So how the buildings were being taken care of, what was broken, what was fixed, what needed to be addressed, what needed to be addressed right away so we could appropriate money in the budget.

202
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:18,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in the draft capital plan that we got a glimpse at back a little while ago, there's some money there in the upcoming years.

203
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:21,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about $2.5 million for firehouse improvements.

204
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:36,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution that we schedule Committee of the Whole to go to each firehouse in the city as a group so we can take a look at the issues

205
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:39,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there are issues out there that need to be addressed.

206
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:44,896
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can go from building to building and see what needs to be done, what's broken, what needs to be repaired.

207
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:46,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and he's right.

208
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I went to the fire station in West Bedford.

209
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the gear is right behind the truck.

210
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 15 feet from the truck is all the fire gear.

211
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's dangerous.

212
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And cancer's a major concern, and we need to

213
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:03,133
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that we're addressing these situations, but just general situations.

214
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:08,055
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was down in the West Medford fire station, I think the shower had no door on it.

215
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, you know, that, that's, that's to me that that should be a simple fix.

216
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:17,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, you know, it shouldn't, they shouldn't have to wait forever to get a door fixed in the shower.

217
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,422
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take a look at some of our buildings, I mean, when I went down to South Medford and went to West, you take a look at the, uh,

218
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:26,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I'm trying to think of Salem Street.

219
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Salem Street did have the same issue.

220
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,958
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take a look at the heating, it's terribly inefficient.

221
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 1,000 degrees in one room.

222
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:38,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to open up the windows to cool it down in the middle of the winter.

223
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,244
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are things that need to be addressed.

224
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:50,389
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have our environmental Alicia Hunt go down and take a look to see if there's anything that we could be doing to make these buildings more cost effective, more efficient.

225
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,690
[SPEAKER_07]: They are older buildings.

226
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So these need to be a top priority.

227
00:21:54,707 --> 00:22:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could amend the resolution that, Mr. President, if you could schedule a committee, the whole meetings, so we could go out and take a look at each facility as a group and take a look at what needs to be addressed, because the budget's coming up.

228
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:15,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that we have maintenance in there to do these things, but we also need to make sure that we can prioritize these items when it comes to when we look at our capital budget.

229
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like the chief to accompany us?

230
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:17,756
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine with me.

231
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:24,811
[SPEAKER_10]: if we could also put that Chief Gilbert, he could accompany us also.

232
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:31,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just to follow up on Mr. Falco's suggestion, and I think it's a worthy suggestion.

233
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:43,086
[SPEAKER_09]: At the time when we did phase one, the chief put together a punch list, which I have a copy of, Latitude Engine 3, and it's,

234
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:47,801
[SPEAKER_09]: a two page punch list of items that he wanted to see done.

235
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:53,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And out of the just say 50 items on here, I think the city addressed maybe six of them.

236
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:58,292
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it would be helpful because I'm sure this punch list still exists for each station.

237
00:22:58,612 --> 00:22:59,513
[SPEAKER_09]: You went through each station.

238
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:00,995
[SPEAKER_09]: So prior to us meeting,

239
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:06,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be helpful to have a listing of what they feel the improvements as necessary.

240
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:13,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And also regarding the $2.5 million, that's the mayor's draft proposal.

241
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:17,492
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no money to back anything in the mayor's draft proposal.

242
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:20,675
[SPEAKER_09]: These are just recommendations that the mayor put out there.

243
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:31,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And we asked, as a council, on two occasions, just within the last two weeks, where will the $2.5 million be spent and what stations?

244
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:35,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have not received a response yet from the administration, Mr. President.

245
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:43,434
[SPEAKER_09]: So the mayor could put down anything she wants in her draft capital plan, making it look like things are being done in the community.

246
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,996
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no money, first of all, that backs any of those items.

247
00:23:47,776 --> 00:24:00,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, Mr. President, she doesn't even know when we ask the questions, when her department heads are here, if they can explain what 2.5 million of the mayor's line item is gonna go towards, they can't answer it.

248
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:04,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So what kind of proposal is that, Mr. President?

249
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:10,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Any monkey can write something down, but if there's nothing behind it, Mr. President, to back it up, it's meaningless.

250
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:17,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you have the department head sitting here, and you have the mayor's chief of staff, and she can't answer a question,

251
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:20,030
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the two point, what is it, a secret?

252
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

253
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:26,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Just lip service again.

254
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:27,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

255
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:30,935
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank my colleague, Councilor Falco, for bringing that up.

256
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:31,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

257
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:34,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco, do you have anything further?

258
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:35,196
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be all.

259
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:40,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we could do it on a Saturday, when maybe we'll have more time.

260
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:41,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine with me.

261
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:43,440
[SPEAKER_10]: For everybody else, I'll talk to the Chief.

262
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good, thank you.

263
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:45,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scott Belli.

264
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:47,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

265
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:50,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I thank my fellow colleagues for bringing this issue up.

266
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:55,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that back in budget time, when we discussed, we talked to each individual department.

267
00:24:56,967 --> 00:25:05,131
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that we talked about was the implementation of the wash machine and having that implemented.

268
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:12,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the biggest concerns they had was that most of our stations don't have the capability

269
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:18,290
[SPEAKER_08]: from the electrical standpoint, the plumbing standpoint, to do what's needed to have that machine.

270
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:35,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can ask, I'd like to see if you wouldn't mind that we can amend it to ask the building department to find out, Mr. Moki, if they can look into, to see which departments, which fire stations can, that have the capability to make sure that

271
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:40,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if it's that simple, it should be that simple.

272
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:44,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, these are dire issues that are very concerning.

273
00:25:44,148 --> 00:26:03,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that that was one of the concerns that was brought up when I talked to the rank and file and what the reasoning was why they couldn't put in the washing machine for the turnout gear was because the stations weren't compatible for the electricity and the water that was needed there.

274
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:10,444
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if we can reach out to the chief too and have another amendment put on that.

275
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:21,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was discussion that there was a grant that was supposedly coming out for two more of these wash machines and dryers.

276
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:22,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It never did.

277
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:23,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

278
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:28,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, if we can get an update on that and what happened with that too, or that'd be important.

279
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:34,498
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, and again, I follow up with what else, what council Falco said, that was one of the biggest pieces.

280
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, that with the school committee looking at the schools now,

281
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we couldn't do everything.

282
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:41,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It was impossible to do.

283
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,571
[SPEAKER_08]: But what it did was we finally had, and that wasn't it.

284
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:52,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe my answer to that was with the schools was it's a rolling plan.

285
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're always doing capital improvement.

286
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that if we can get

287
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:26,492
[SPEAKER_08]: a list, not just in the fire departments, but in all of our municipal buildings, and what we see as more dire actions that need to be taken, and then categorize them so we know what needs to be done and what's really at its last legs that are going to cost us when it's too late.

288
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's important.

289
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:40,675
[SPEAKER_08]: that's one of the concerns I got back with when we talk about new buildings, new, new police station, new schools, what are the plans in place to make sure that we are, we have a plan in place for upkeep.

290
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:54,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important that we, we, uh, ask the city administration that if we can have a, um, a plan in place and what, uh, a working plan in place with the city administration on all of our municipal buildings.

291
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:56,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

292
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:56,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

293
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

294
00:27:58,481 --> 00:27:59,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

295
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:04,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank Council Member Rox for bringing up the issue with regards to the extractors.

296
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:06,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it a little differently.

297
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:09,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I know when we took the tour, we had a lot of information coming in our head.

298
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have sworn the men and women of the fire department said, the machine that's there now is actually not an extractor.

299
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:20,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a washing machine, and it does one at a time, like you had mentioned.

300
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:22,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were in hopes, they were

301
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:26,013
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting and in need of extractors.

302
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:30,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And the new extractors, if they got one, does three uniforms at a time.

303
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:37,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's, either way, especially, that's something that shocked me, the fact that we didn't have an extractor.

304
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could stand corrected, but we didn't have an extractor.

305
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:49,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think something to point out with regard to that is not only they're going into fires and they have the soot on their uniforms,

306
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're being stored, especially at engine one.

307
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:58,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I hear, it sounds like all the stations, they're being stored right next to the diesel trucks.

308
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:01,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So the trucks are coming in and out, probably on a daily basis.

309
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you go in there, Council Member Knox was right, you smell something.

310
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:11,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know if it was from the uniforms being in the fire so often and not being extracted.

311
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,058
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also smell fuel.

312
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could see a layer of soot on the lockers where the uniforms are stored.

313
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:24,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And you look up on the fan, and there's another, you could see the layer of, it was just black.

314
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:33,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine what's going into our men and women's lungs after, number one, after a fire, and after re-wearing the uniform over and over again.

315
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:41,717
[SPEAKER_05]: But also just, after I was told that story, and then I went and checked out the kitchen, which is a huge door open right next to the trucks.

316
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:46,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what they're taking in, just sitting there 24 hours on their 24-hour shift,

317
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,751
[SPEAKER_05]: It's extremely concerning.

318
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why I brought it up the last few weeks when we've been discussing these issues.

319
00:29:56,134 --> 00:30:17,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think as many extractors as we can get, whether that be, I think it's a good resolve to start with two, two washers, two dryers, two extractors, and we figure out a way to put them in one or two of our stations because these men and women said that sometimes they're coming on their off hours because it only does one uniform at a time and they are,

320
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:27,010
[SPEAKER_05]: not in queue during their 24-hour shift, so they either have to ask somebody to help them or they have to come back on their time off to be able to wash and dry their uniform.

321
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think that's absolutely ridiculous, especially with the rates that we're hearing with regards to cancer.

322
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:39,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something, if that is $10,000 or $100,000, we need to spend some money to clean their uniforms.

323
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,634
[SPEAKER_05]: They're breathing in every day.

324
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's extremely important to bring up on a separate night, I know it's been a

325
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,125
[SPEAKER_05]: couple heated debates and discussions over the last few weeks, but I definitely think this was in need of being brought up.

326
00:30:52,705 --> 00:30:59,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I too was told a couple weeks ago that they, fire department themselves wrote a grant for a washer, for an extractor and a dryer.

327
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:04,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounded like they were getting it at the time, but it may have changed within the last two weeks.

328
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:08,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they said the chief had wrote in the grant, but it never came through.

329
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why a grant writer that I brought up a couple weeks ago, I mean, we need a grant writer, part-time, full-time.

330
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:30,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We need somebody to help the fire department, the police department, every department in the city get the equipment and funding that is out there to use for, so we don't have to use City of Medford taxpayers' money.

331
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:39,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a grant writer will go a heck of a long way, and I'm sure there's other opportunities for extractors and things like that that we could be going after, and we just aren't.

332
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:40,977
[SPEAKER_05]: As a community, our department heads are doing

333
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,382
[SPEAKER_05]: the union heads the best they can, but it's just not, I think there's more out there that we can be grasping.

334
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:47,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one point I wanted to make.

335
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:58,888
[SPEAKER_05]: The second point with engine three, I think the council voted like three or four times because I know when Louise Miller was our finance director, we hounded her.

336
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:10,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember specifically hounding her with regards to the fact that when we put the million to 2 million and a half into the updates and the fire stations, there was a one year warranty.

337
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:18,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if anybody else recalls it, but I remember grilling her on multiple occasions within the first six to nine months saying, where's the punch list?

338
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our OPM?

339
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:24,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the OPM go through it three months after, six months after?

340
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:31,659
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to capitalize on that warranty and make sure everything is done, was done correctly, and it hasn't faded, ripped, or teared.

341
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:38,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I, you know, obviously, we upset her, we asked her so much, but the job obviously wasn't done.

342
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:56,044
[SPEAKER_05]: how it should have been done, because I'm sure that those pictures, which say a thousand words, occurred within that time frame, one year, and we could have capitalized and made those contractors do the work right if it wasn't done correctly.

343
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:57,345
[SPEAKER_05]: This council tried.

344
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:07,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we took three or four votes to ask about that one-year warranty and what needed to be done and if the OPM took a walkthrough more than once or a couple times to see what

345
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,161
[SPEAKER_05]: what was failing and what needed to be, you know, brought up to the contractor.

346
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really didn't get anywhere with regards to our votes.

347
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:18,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think Councilor Markson, I second the resolve.

348
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:19,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

349
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:21,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Neistat.

350
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:22,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. President.

351
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:29,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I do recall leadership from 1032 here a couple of weeks ago indicating that they were pursuing a charitable donation for the extractors.

352
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:33,565
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also think that we can't have too many.

353
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:35,758
[SPEAKER_12]: We only have one now, 10 of them more heart.

354
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:41,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we have enough stations to place them as long as we have the space needs and the infrastructure needs to, um, to meet the capabilities.

355
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we should, we should have more than two, three, four, five, as many as we can get.

356
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:46,621
[SPEAKER_12]: We should get our hands on.

357
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:56,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, I'd like to amend the paper to request an update, um, from the administration relative to the status of the charitable donations of the extract is similar to the grant that, um, Councilor Scarpelli added.

358
00:33:56,944 --> 00:34:01,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Councilor Falco and I had the opportunity to tour the West Medford fire station

359
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,254
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that was most alarming to me was the fact that the actual smoke detectors in the fire station don't work.

360
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:15,742
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd also like to further amend the resolution asking that an inspection be conducted to ensure that all of the fire alarms in our fire stations are operational, Mr. President.

361
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,104
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a fire in the fire station, and the firefighters don't know about it.

362
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:20,006
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have a serious problem here.

363
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:22,588
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really think that's vital, especially

364
00:34:23,883 --> 00:34:35,890
[SPEAKER_12]: when Councilor Marks brought this resolution forward in the interest of public safety and with a concern of public safety, um, you know, with the lights, um, same thing goes for having an operational smoke alarm in the building that they live in for their 24 hour shift, Mr. President.

365
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:42,814
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd ask that, um, an inspection be conducted to ensure that all fire alarms in each station are operational and up to code.

366
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:43,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

367
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:45,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Also marks.

368
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:47,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

369
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:59,448
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and I've been saying this for a number of years now, our municipal buildings, and I'm not sure if it works the same way on the school side, our municipal buildings are not reviewed on an annual basis.

370
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:07,557
[SPEAKER_09]: You would think, Mr. President, that the building commissioner would have an annual review of all our municipal buildings.

371
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,942
[SPEAKER_09]: and make a list of what's needed, and then move forward on repairs.

372
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:15,404
[SPEAKER_09]: That does not happen on the municipal side.

373
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure about the school side, but I can tell you right now it's not happening on the city side.

374
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:31,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And the city relies on the firefighters or the police department to bring forward initiatives and work on building maintenance.

375
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:34,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just not going to happen that way, Mr. President.

376
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:37,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're seeing the results of it.

377
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:43,742
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you go on Salem Street, and, you know, there's signs on almost all the windows, do not open the window.

378
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:48,004
[SPEAKER_09]: And I asked the captain, I said, why would you put a sign, do not open the window?

379
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:49,204
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, open the window.

380
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:56,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I opened it, Mr. President, and the spring-loaded mechanism was shot, and literally you could take your fingers off.

381
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,888
[SPEAKER_09]: It came down like a hatchet.

382
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:04,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was every single window in the building, every single window.

383
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:07,292
[SPEAKER_09]: These are things, Mr. President,

384
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:16,044
[SPEAKER_09]: that the building commissioner should be going throughout all our buildings and writing a thorough report on the condition and the status of each building.

385
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, Mr. President, it's like a gag order.

386
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,367
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw it happen with the DPW yard.

387
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:35,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a building that should have been condemned for at least 10 years, and we went to the Board of Health, we went to the building commissioner as a council, and we said, please, will you go down and take a look at the DPW yard?

388
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:39,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time they came back and they said they don't see any problem with it.

389
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,581
[SPEAKER_09]: The building should have been condemned, Mr. President.

390
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:44,782
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a gag order.

391
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:54,028
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an unwritten gag order in this city that doesn't allow the administrative staff and the department heads to do their job.

392
00:36:56,069 --> 00:37:04,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Because all you need is a set of eyes, Mr. President, to walk into any of these municipal buildings and you can see the lack of maintenance and what's going on.

393
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't fault the building commissioner, because he's on that gag order.

394
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:11,363
[SPEAKER_09]: He's on that gag order.

395
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:17,047
[SPEAKER_09]: He's worried that he'll lose his job if he brings up issues, Mr. President.

396
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:18,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a concern.

397
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:20,989
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a concern, Mr. President.

398
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:22,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And that needs to stop.

399
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to stop.

400
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And we, as a council, have to send that message out.

401
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:29,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unacceptable, Mr. President.

402
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:33,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd ask anyone to take a look.

403
00:37:34,114 --> 00:37:36,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone in the public is welcome to go into any of these city buildings.

404
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:38,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a walk in.

405
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:40,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me know what you see in the building.

406
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:48,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me know if you think the condition is where you'd like to lay down for 24 hours a shift, Mr. President.

407
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:50,270
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unacceptable.

408
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:54,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we as a council

409
00:37:55,097 --> 00:38:03,401
[SPEAKER_09]: request that the building commissioner do an annual review on all our municipal buildings and that it start effective tomorrow.

410
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,162
[SPEAKER_09]: An annual review, Mr. President.

411
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:08,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to make that a separate motion?

412
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, yeah, if you want to make a separate motion.

413
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:16,086
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be receiving annual reports on the condition of our buildings, Mr. President.

414
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:26,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So then when the mayor comes forward and says, I'd like to expend $22 million for a new police station, we don't have to say, why do you need that, Madam President?

415
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:32,540
[SPEAKER_09]: We know, we're already armed with the information year after year on the needs of our facilities.

416
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't happen now.

417
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:44,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It should have happened with the library, it should have happened with the DPW, it should have happened with the police station, and it should have happened with all these fire stations, Mr. President.

418
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:50,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that that be part of the vote tonight, too, in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

419
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:51,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

420
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:55,185
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, Councilor Falco.

421
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:56,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:58,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say I second that last motion.

423
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:01,269
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we take a look at our buildings in our city.

424
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, buildings are one of our most, you know, important assets on the books.

425
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:05,692
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when, you know, when,

426
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:13,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Myself and Councilor Scarpelli went out and, you know, we looked at the, we were on the school committee, we looked out at the school buildings.

427
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:24,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's to ensure that, you know, those buildings are going to be, you know, uh, kept up so that, you know, it ensures that those buildings are around for future generations of Method students.

428
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:35,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really need to make sure that we're doing the same thing with all city buildings and make sure that, um, you know, uh, all the routine maintenance has taken place and the preventive maintenance has taken place because that's, you know,

429
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Buildings are expensive to replace.

430
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,023
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing that now at the police station.

431
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:43,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really need to make sure we stay on top of this issue.

432
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:48,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a good resolution that we do get a report back from the building commissioner.

433
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:52,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that we need to keep an eye on.

434
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:58,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said before, it's probably one of the most important assets that we have on the books is our buildings.

435
00:39:58,822 --> 00:39:59,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

436
00:39:59,243 --> 00:39:59,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

437
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:07,045
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Falco, Councilor Scarpelli, and Councilor Knight.

438
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:09,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote has been requested.

439
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:10,948

[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Locren.

441

442
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:27,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna go backwards.

444

00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, let me see here.

[SPEAKER_11]: Status of the grant for two more additional washers.

449

[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see here.

[SPEAKER_11]: on power and plumbing for, uh, for the extractors and, uh, dryers.

452
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:37,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see.

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman Marks, uh, listing of all, uh, uh, needed improvements, uh, to be completed by the chief for each fire station, which is the punch list.

454
00:41:49,563 --> 00:41:52,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, let me see, uh, Councilor Falco, uh,

455
00:41:54,038 --> 00:41:57,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Committee of the whole meeting to be scheduled for each fire station accompanied by the chief.

456
00:42:03,026 --> 00:42:08,550
[SPEAKER_11]: The immediate purchase of two additional extractors and two dryers.

457
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:19,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And to include in each fire station to have a separate storage area for each of these.

458
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:36,672
[SPEAKER_11]: The city administration put back who the clerk of the works was for the project and why safety lights were not included into the specs.

459
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:39,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see.

460
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:41,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see the floor here.

461
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:56,409
[SPEAKER_11]: The floor will be, I guess the floor will be reviewed by the building commissioner and to, and who is the contractor?

462
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Reach out to the contractor who did the floor.

463
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:07,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to see if it's still under warranty.

464
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,977
[SPEAKER_09]: It may not be.

465
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:10,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

466
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:11,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

467
00:43:11,938 --> 00:43:13,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll.

468
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo.

469
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:17,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco?

470
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:17,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

471
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:19,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

472
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:19,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

473
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:20,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

474
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

475
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:22,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Marks?

476
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:22,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

477
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:23,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

478
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:23,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

479
00:43:24,324 --> 00:43:25,084
[SPEAKER_11]: President Caraviello?

480
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:25,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

481
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:32,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, a motion passes.

482
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:43,470
[SPEAKER_10]: 17297 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas new commercial and residential development is occurring throughout our city, whereas the exterior lighting

483
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:48,868
[SPEAKER_10]: from these developments is having a negative impact on our existing neighborhoods.

484
00:43:49,529 --> 00:44:04,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the zoning and ordinance subcommittee develop an ordinance with regard to exterior lighting to provide clear guidelines for its installation and regulations that will limit the wattages and luminance of the outdoor lights.

485
00:44:04,817 --> 00:44:05,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

486
00:44:06,137 --> 00:44:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

487
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:07,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh,

488
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:15,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I've received a number of phone calls in a number of different neighborhoods over the past couple of months regarding lighting from various buildings throughout our city.

489
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:24,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And I received a call from a resident down on Emerson Street, actually, specifically, with regard to they built a new building.

490
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:31,673
[SPEAKER_07]: They put lighting on the outside, but the lighting literally shines into this person's house.

491
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:37,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really has a negative impact on his quality of life at night.

492
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:45,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he wants to go spend time in his yard, the yard is lit up all the time, and it's a problem.

493
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:49,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a problem in other corners of our city as well.

494
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:57,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I looked into it and I talked to the code enforcement officer, he had mentioned to me that we actually do not have an ordinance with regard to exterior lighting.

495
00:44:57,391 --> 00:44:59,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So I bring this resolution forward tonight.

496
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:06,715
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think this is something that we should look into, especially since we're hearing about more and more development in our city.

497
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:14,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that we have regulations and ordinances in place to help guide development and developers to make sure that

498
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:21,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Our existing neighborhoods are not negatively impacted by lighting that's too bright.

499
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:25,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So I agree we need to have lighting.

500
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I think lighting is a great crime deterrent.

501
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:30,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also believe that it needs to be not too bright.

502
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:32,714
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be regulated to some degree.

503
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to bring this forward tonight.

504
00:45:35,675 --> 00:45:44,217
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could move it to the subcommittee on zoning to work on a resolution, I would

505
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a good idea and I'd like to move approval.

506
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

507
00:45:48,821 --> 00:45:49,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

508
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:55,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I think that this is a great initiative and it's something that the subcommittee should certainly look into.

509
00:45:56,124 --> 00:46:09,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to amend the paper to request recommendations from the building department and the electrical division as well as the chief of police as to what recommendations they may have in terms of outdoor lights, wattages, lumens, so on and so forth.

510
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that when we're talking about wattage and lumens, that's a little bit outside the

511
00:46:14,662 --> 00:46:16,643
[SPEAKER_12]: level of expertise of everybody behind this rail.

512
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:18,465
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that would be very helpful, Mr. President.

513
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:22,347
[SPEAKER_12]: But one concern I do have is obviously the ability to ensure the public safety.

514
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:29,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And Chief Sackles appeared before this council on a number of times in the past, indicating that one of the number one deterrents to crime is well-lit streets.

515
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:35,036
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we're going to have to walk a fine line here, and there's going to have to be some balancing, Mr. President.

516
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:38,979
[SPEAKER_12]: But I certainly think it's a worthwhile endeavor that deserves exploration, research, and study.

517
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And I move for approval, as amended.

518
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:43,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Dello Russo.

519
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:46,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I think this is a very thoughtful measure.

520
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank my colleague for this and I eagerly look forward to addressing this issue in subcommittee.

521
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:58,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Councilor Dello Russo.

522
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:07,826
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion as, as amended by Councilor Knight, name and address for the record, please.

523
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:14,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

524
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm speaking about the subject of the new growth.

525
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:23,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We are not talking about new growth.

526
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about lighting?

527
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:25,536
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about lighting.

528
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:32,301
[SPEAKER_06]: It says here, I believe, whereas new commercial and residential development is occurring throughout the city.

529
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:34,422
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how the paragraph started.

530
00:47:35,158 --> 00:47:36,198
[SPEAKER_06]: and it talks about lighting.

531
00:47:36,738 --> 00:47:42,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna talk about lighting and the new growth that's all in the same paragraph of the resolution, I believe it's called.

532
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

533
00:47:47,161 --> 00:47:51,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a nice idea to keep the blinding lights out of our eyes.

534
00:47:51,762 --> 00:47:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Felicko, appreciate that.

535
00:47:55,784 --> 00:48:04,646
[SPEAKER_06]: But more importantly, I feel it would be better to amend this and add to the resolution to make sure that any and all new

536
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:13,050
[SPEAKER_06]: real estate tax growth be first used to offset any and all prop two and a half real estate tax increases.

537
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:20,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I don't believe there is any law that mandates that the city must increase the real estate taxes at all.

538
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:35,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, but if you still insist on raising our real estate taxes, again, a la the last 50 years plus standing, at least use our new growth tax monies to offset any prop two and a half

539
00:48:36,223 --> 00:48:42,428
[SPEAKER_06]: proposed increases and for once give the middle class a break.

540
00:48:43,829 --> 00:49:05,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Simply put, I'm wondering out loud if you or anyone in political power here in 02155 can finally get this extra new growth, real estate taxes, to help lower the middle class real estate tax bill instead of this so-called new real estate tax growth

541
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:13,714
[SPEAKER_06]: as stated in the paragraph, is working against us, as in we need more schools, police, fire.

542
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:27,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And it adds to our total of last year's real estate tax bill, not to mention the infrastructure costs.

543
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:33,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So it adds more money to the inflated bill of the real estate tax, which is over $100 million to that levy,

544
00:49:34,478 --> 00:49:40,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So then, meaning next year, they're gonna take two and a half percent of an over-inflated bill.

545
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:50,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody have any ideas to help the middle class, especially the lower middle class while it still exists, to help the middle class?

546
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:51,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

547
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:53,283
[SPEAKER_06]: On this new growth business?

548
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:57,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

549
00:49:57,724 --> 00:49:58,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your silence.

550
00:49:58,785 --> 00:49:59,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor McLaughlin.

551
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:04,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we're talking about, oh, okay, thank you.

552
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:24,562
[SPEAKER_05]: With regards to the new development, I know that's part of it, and the lighting, there was a meeting last week that Council Marks and President Caraviello and I attended with regards to the potential redevelopment of Salem Street and Canal Street, complex 21 potential units or less.

553
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:31,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing that did surprise me, which I thought was a great thing, was they had a lighting expert at that meeting.

554
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:39,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we could look into, I don't know if we could ask the question, if you don't mind me amending the paper, is that a requirement?

555
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Because maybe it would be something we could potentially ask developers to provide a lighting.

556
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:52,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was interesting, I mean, they had an expert on everything, so I'm really not sure with regards to which ones were required and which ones weren't.

557
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:55,291
[SPEAKER_05]: But we could maybe get an update and look into that.

558
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:57,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even if it's just on a small basis,

559
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:04,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Having somebody to at least identify what the lighting plan is is going to be beneficial for the neighbors in the neighborhood.

560
00:51:04,493 --> 00:51:08,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was an interesting portion of the three hour meeting we attended last week.

561
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:14,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could look into that further and ask the question, is a lighting specialist required?

562
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, when is it required?

563
00:51:16,459 --> 00:51:18,279
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't mind.

564
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:19,840
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can amend that motion, Mr. Clerk.

565
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:26,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is a goal to the zone.

566
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:27,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we can ask that in committee.

567
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:39,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

568
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:49,147
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Lungo-Koehn, do I have a second?

569
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

570
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:51,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Councilor Knight.

571
00:51:52,429 --> 00:51:54,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, roll call has been requested.

572
00:51:57,558 --> 00:52:00,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco made the motion, seconded by Councilor Knight.

573
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:06,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo?

574
00:52:06,906 --> 00:52:08,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Affirmative.

575
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:08,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco?

576
00:52:09,188 --> 00:52:09,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

577
00:52:09,748 --> 00:52:10,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

578
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:10,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

579
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:11,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Kerr?

580
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

581
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:13,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Marks?

582
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:13,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

583
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:15,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

584
00:52:15,113 --> 00:52:15,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

585
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:16,674
[SPEAKER_11]: President Caraviello?

586
00:52:17,394 --> 00:52:17,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

587
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

588
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:24,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules.

589
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:31,189
[SPEAKER_10]: take hands at the paper clip.

590
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:44,532
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-299 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DPW Commissioner direct the Engineering Department to provide the City Council with the construction schedule for resurfacing of Evans Street.

591
00:52:44,612 --> 00:52:45,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

592
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:52,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, this was a matter that came up before this Council a number of times, most recently before the cold months when the ground froze.

593
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:59,649
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been brought to my attention that they were going to be having some pre-construction meetings and a construction schedule was going to be established.

594
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:06,512
[SPEAKER_12]: So for that reason, Mr. President, I think that the residents on Evans Street have waited long enough and this roadway needs to be repaved.

595
00:53:06,572 --> 00:53:09,973
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm asking for a copy of the construction schedule from the engineering department, Mr. President.

596
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:21,479
[SPEAKER_12]: As I sit here and think about this resolution and the need for resurfacing on Evans street, um, I do also recall that we had a extended discussion relative to Paris street as well.

597
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:27,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, then these two projects were kind of working hand in hand as, as the council discussed them in the past, Mr. President, over the spring.

598
00:53:28,362 --> 00:53:35,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I'm asking that we amend the paper to also include, um, a breakdown for the construction schedule of Paris street and Evans street and, uh, move for approval.

599
00:53:35,686 --> 00:53:35,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

600
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:40,828
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by council at night, seconded by council, Logan Kern, all in favor.

601
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:44,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

602
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:48,481
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-300 offered by Councilor Knight.

603
00:53:49,221 --> 00:54:01,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the DPW Commissioner direct the Engineering Department to respond to the following items outlined in Council Resolution 16-404 adopted by the Council on 4-19-2016.

604
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:01,906
[SPEAKER_10]: One.

605
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:27,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Listing of all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed or are scheduled to perform any digging or excavation work from January 1st, 2014 to date, including the street addresses of where the work took place or was scheduled to take place.

606
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:39,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, a listing of all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed any digging or excavation work that have not been completed in accordance with the established

607
00:54:39,987 --> 00:54:46,332
[SPEAKER_10]: City of Medford standards from January 14th to date, including the street addresses of where the work took place.

608
00:54:46,993 --> 00:55:07,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, a complete schedule of repair work for all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed any digging or excavation work that have not been completed in accordance with established City of Medford standards from January 2014 to date, including the street address

609
00:55:08,148 --> 00:55:09,951
[SPEAKER_10]: of where the work is to take place.

610
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:10,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

611
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:12,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. President.

612
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:21,029
[SPEAKER_12]: This was issued last April relative to a response to some concerns about excavation work done up in the Lawrence Estates along Crocker.

613
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,344
[SPEAKER_12]: along Trancroft, along Lincoln Road.

614
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:28,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, it was a six-part resolution that was sent to the administration.

615
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:34,730
[SPEAKER_12]: A number of the items were addressed that were related to trees and utility wires.

616
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:40,773
[SPEAKER_12]: But we still have questions and concerns, Mr. President, about who's watching the shop when it comes to public utilities doing trench work.

617
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,681
[SPEAKER_12]: what type of trench management system they have in place.

618
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:48,802
[SPEAKER_12]: So ultimately this resolution asks what's been done and what's scheduled to be done and where.

619
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:54,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Has the utility met its obligation to the city of Medford to return the street into the condition that it was left in?

620
00:55:55,404 --> 00:56:00,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And if not, where are the street addresses where this work hasn't been returned to the pristine condition, Mr. President?

621
00:56:00,686 --> 00:56:04,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that this is an important issue in our community and I also think that it's something that

622
00:56:05,537 --> 00:56:13,100
[SPEAKER_12]: needs to be looked at a little bit closer because, quite frankly, I think that the public utilities are running roughshod over the public ways in our city.

623
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:28,205
[SPEAKER_12]: This coupled with the fact that the Everett to Winchester project has been approved, and the pipeline through the Winthrop Street Corridor has looked like it's going to happen within the next couple of years, Mr. President.

624
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:34,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very important that we hold our public utilities accountable for the work that they do in our community to ensure strong quality of life in the neighborhoods.

625
00:56:35,706 --> 00:56:36,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

626
00:56:37,787 --> 00:56:41,489
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can, I just, I thank my colleague for bringing this up.

627
00:56:41,529 --> 00:56:57,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this has been a bone of contentions with myself that making sure that we hold, um, um, these contractors, um, to what their intent intended to, uh, complete with the city's, um, roadworks.

628
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:04,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that if we can, I'd like to see if there's a way we can reach out to the community itself if they have, um,

629
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:06,831
[SPEAKER_08]: some construction work.

630
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:19,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we have a neighbor in the heights that contacted me that the contractor last year put down the hot top but didn't replace the cement on the sidewalk.

631
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:24,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if they could reach out to the city administration and the

632
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:36,541
[SPEAKER_08]: see click fix and if the if there are any other locations that the community can help us with some of those addresses to be could be helpful, but I appreciate Mr. Knight for bringing this up.

633
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:42,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It's uh, it's it's an issue that I hear way too often our community from neighbors.

634
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:43,145
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

635
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:44,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

636
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:45,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scott.

637
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:46,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Dello Russo.

638
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:51,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this up and speaking on it.

639
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:51,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,

640
00:57:53,486 --> 00:58:08,809
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm grateful for the thorough work and wording of this resolution, I'm disappointed, Mr. President, that so much of it we're hearing again, and we haven't gotten the answers in the past that we've asked for.

641
00:58:10,209 --> 00:58:11,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Rousseau.

642
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:20,572
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by, by Councilor Scarpelli, all those, all those, Councilor Monks?

643
00:58:21,592 --> 00:58:22,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Monks?

644
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:27,785
[SPEAKER_09]: response back from your resolution, I think regarding Winthrop street in front of the American legion.

645
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:30,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We have not, we have not got a response back.

646
00:58:32,169 --> 00:58:39,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if we, if the council wouldn't mind, because that, that was a road work that was done by an outside contract.

647
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:41,258
[SPEAKER_10]: The heads now as they go over the right.

648
00:58:41,538 --> 00:58:41,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

649
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:46,042
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can amend that, Mr. Clark, councilor knife.

650
00:58:46,602 --> 00:58:58,931
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly have no problem amending the paper, and I know that Councilor Marks talks a lot about thermoplastic sidewalks, and that bump right there is probably the most effective speed bump that I've seen in the community in a number of years.

651
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:04,435
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we have an alternative to thermoplastic speed bumps, Mr. President, going forward.

652
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:15,083
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by President Caraviello.

653
00:59:15,363 --> 00:59:16,024
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

654
00:59:17,017 --> 00:59:17,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

655
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,261
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two more.

656
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:36,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Phyllis Patton on the moment of occasion of her 90th birthday.

657
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

658
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:40,149
[SPEAKER_12]: 80th birthday, Mr. President.

659
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:42,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Mrs. Patton.

660
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,991
[SPEAKER_12]: She's been great to us down there, especially at St.

661
00:59:45,011 --> 00:59:48,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Joseph's School, but I don't want to give her another 10 years, Mr. President.

662
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:51,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, 9th?

663
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:51,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

664
00:59:51,834 --> 00:59:53,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Couldn't read your writing.

665
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:54,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, 9th.

666
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:54,535
[SPEAKER_10]: 80th.

667
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:55,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

668
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:56,716
[SPEAKER_10]: 80th birthday, Mr. President.

669
00:59:56,936 --> 00:59:58,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody involved with St.

670
00:59:58,377 --> 01:00:01,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Joseph's Parish has in one way or another come across Miss Phyllis Patton.

671
01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:07,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I first met her, I think, when I was in first grade going through CCD, and then I had the pleasure of

672
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:16,816
[SPEAKER_12]: playing some sports with her son, Ross, who was a great athlete growing up, and have been able to develop a relationship with her daughter, Robin, over the years, and her husband, Billy Raymond.

673
01:00:17,216 --> 01:00:20,679
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's with great pleasure that I bring this resolution forward, Mr. President.

674
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:25,162
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to wish Phyllis a happy 80th birthday, although I don't see her as much as I used to in the past.

675
01:00:25,182 --> 01:00:28,965
[SPEAKER_12]: She's in our thoughts, and I just want to hope that she had a wonderful day and wish her a happy birthday.

676
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:29,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

677
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:30,146
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

678
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:30,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

679
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:31,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

680
01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:34,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

681
01:00:35,919 --> 01:00:40,922
[SPEAKER_10]: and President Caraviello, Councilor Falco, and Councilor Marks.

682
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:53,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deepest, sincere condolences to the family of Jim Coughlin, a former teacher in the Medford Public Schools on his recent passing.

683
01:00:54,669 --> 01:00:55,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

684
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

685
01:00:58,111 --> 01:00:58,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Coughlin was

686
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:08,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody here, one way or another, knew Mr. Kaufman himself as a former phys ed teacher in the Medford Public Schools.

687
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:17,874
[SPEAKER_08]: He was also a coach at the high school level, and also he ran the pool for us for a little bit over on Main Street.

688
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:24,679
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know Jim, you know that he had a really

689
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:28,944
[SPEAKER_08]: look like a mean exterior, but it wasn't.

690
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:30,124
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a great person.

691
01:01:30,644 --> 01:01:38,847
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a man who graduated Norwich with a military background that his sons and family have followed.

692
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:46,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that he meant so much to our community and his wife, Paula, who also works in our system.

693
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:49,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to reach out to them and give them

694
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:53,368
[SPEAKER_08]: give them our thoughts and prayers.

695
01:01:53,788 --> 01:02:10,139
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that yesterday, two days ago, during their wake, I made a promise in that I'll be reaching out to the state delegation, something that they brought to my attention, that our cruisers do not have AEDs.

696
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that you just overlook and you don't know.

697
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:17,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And something that was alarming to me

698
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:28,958
[SPEAKER_08]: as I talked to the family, is that the cruiser that was there, if they were fitted with the AED, that Jim possibly could have survived.

699
01:02:29,058 --> 01:02:35,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will make it a promise to reach out to the state delegation to see if we could change this in the state.

700
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the wishes of the family.

701
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And I made sure that I'd bring that up.

702
01:02:39,786 --> 01:02:44,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a fight that I'll take on for Jim and the Coughlin family.

703
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we're going to miss him.

704
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:49,859
[SPEAKER_08]: and prayers to the family.

705
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:50,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you.

706
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

707
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:52,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

708
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:53,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

709
01:02:54,864 --> 01:03:04,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the privilege of having Jim Coughlin as a physical education teacher when I was in high school a number of times through my four years at Medford High School.

710
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:12,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Great guy, always very supportive, very encouraging, especially, you know, when I told him I was running for public office.

711
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:23,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hadn't seen him for a while, and then when my kids started taking swimming lessons down at Tufts Pool, I bumped into him there and got some, you know, kind of, you know, friendship continued from there.

712
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:26,825
[SPEAKER_07]: But just a really nice, all-around guy.

713
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:30,267
[SPEAKER_07]: He was no nonsense, he was great.

714
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: He always told it like it was, and he will be sorely missed, but just a fabulous person, so.

715
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:38,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

716
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,433
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could please stand for a moment

717
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:43,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Locks.

718
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

719
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, would like to echo my colleague's sentiments.

720
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:58,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known the Coughlin family for a number of years, and I, too, had Mr. Coughlin and Mr. English at gym at the high school.

721
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:06,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could tell you, if you did not pay attention while you were in gym class, there were ramifications.

722
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them being those big, round, red balls.

723
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:15,841
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were talking or out of line, you would quickly find one of those next to your head.

724
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:24,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Jimmy, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, he had a tough shell, but a heart of gold.

725
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:29,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was just a good family man, a great husband, a father, a grandfather.

726
01:04:30,504 --> 01:04:32,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

727
01:04:33,384 --> 01:04:34,605
[SPEAKER_10]: The President Thank you, Vice President Miles.

728
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,485
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could stand for a moment of silence, please.

729
01:04:45,718 --> 01:04:46,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll run the suspension.

730
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:47,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

731
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:59,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. President, this council put forward a number of resolutions requesting that the administration add to the names of the Veterans Memorial Park on Winthrop Street.

732
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:06,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And in our packets this week, we have received a letter announcing that the mayor will be commissioning an additional plaque.

733
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:08,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week, we discussed this at the meeting.

734
01:05:08,406 --> 01:05:09,347
[SPEAKER_12]: We made the announcement.

735
01:05:10,267 --> 01:05:13,849
[SPEAKER_12]: However, in our packets today, we also have the eligibility requirements, Mr. President.

736
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:15,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to be clear that

737
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:26,319
[SPEAKER_12]: For consideration to get your name put on the Veterans Memorial at Winthrop Street, you have to have an application postmarked by March 15th, which is just around the corner, Mr. President, next week.

738
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:38,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Eligibility requirements would include that you enlisted while a resident of Medford and being honorably discharged, but there are also exemptions if you enlisted from another city or town.

739
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:45,473
[SPEAKER_12]: resided in Medford for no less than 30 years and were a World War II or Korean War veteran, then you'd be eligible for placement on the monument.

740
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:53,898
[SPEAKER_12]: If you enlisted from another city or town but resided in Medford for no less than 20 years and were a Vietnam veteran, you would be eligible for placement on the monument.

741
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:06,284
[SPEAKER_12]: If you served in Operation Desert Storm or Desert Shield or Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and enlisted after 9-11-2001, you do not have an entry requirement.

742
01:06:06,324 --> 01:06:08,505
[SPEAKER_12]: However, you must be a current Medford resident.

743
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:16,231
[SPEAKER_12]: For any further information, Mr. President, you can contact, obviously, the members of the Veterans Service Subcommittee, the Director of Veterans Service, or the administration.

744
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:24,233
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did want to be sure that this was out there because a number of individuals in the community have contacted me relative to getting their loved ones or their own names placed on the plaque.

745
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:35,995
[SPEAKER_12]: And the list that we have here, Mr. President, is a list of date corrected on 2-21-17, which outlines Patrick Andriatola, John O'Brien, Richard Perella,

746
01:06:36,904 --> 01:06:47,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Robert Emma, Carl Hicks, George White, and Calvin Chin as veterans that are eligible for placement on the monument, but I would reckon that

747
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:51,316
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a number of other individuals in our community that are eligible for placement, Mr. President.

748
01:06:51,516 --> 01:06:56,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And the last time it was updated was in 2014, so that was three years ago.

749
01:06:56,377 --> 01:07:09,000
[SPEAKER_12]: And as World War II veterans and members of our greatest generation continue to age, the opportunities for them to wait two and three and four years to see their name put on this plaque aren't necessarily there anymore.

750
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,661
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's very important that we get this information out there.

751
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:14,041
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank my council colleagues for entertaining me.

752
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:17,302
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would ask that this matter be received and placed on file.

753
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:20,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Eden is here from, uh, uh, the transcript.

754
01:07:20,765 --> 01:07:24,426
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's something, if you can get that in the paper for this week, it'd be greatly appreciated.

755
01:07:24,446 --> 01:07:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, all right.

756
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:27,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

757
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:30,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

758
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:32,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I yield to Councilor Marks.

759
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:33,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

760
01:07:33,908 --> 01:07:40,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just thinking that regarding notification, it would be nice maybe if we can do a reverse 9-1-1 call to the entire city.

761
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:46,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I agree with, uh, with Councilor Knight that, uh, you know, especially for someone that was in World War II and,

762
01:07:47,633 --> 01:07:52,497
[SPEAKER_09]: The Korean War and so forth, they're not getting any younger and time is of the essence.

763
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:55,480
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the administration.

764
01:07:57,302 --> 01:08:04,128
[SPEAKER_10]: To have the mayor, we request the mayor to have a reverse 911 call to the veterans, to all the community.

765
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:10,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Requesting all veterans to get their name in before they take cutoff day.

766
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:11,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

767
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:16,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

768
01:08:16,944 --> 01:08:23,849
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're on the suspension, I just wanted to mention really quick that tomorrow night is our monthly community police meeting.

769
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:30,173
[SPEAKER_07]: The new location for this month is at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital School of Nursing.

770
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:31,894
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at 7 PM.

771
01:08:32,594 --> 01:08:37,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Sacco and members of the Medford Police Department will be there to answer any questions that you have.

772
01:08:37,882 --> 01:08:38,763
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 p.m.

773
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:40,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Lawrence Memorial School of Nursing.

774
01:08:41,124 --> 01:08:41,844
[SPEAKER_07]: All are welcome.

775
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:46,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter what neighborhood you live in throughout our city, everyone is welcome.

776
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:48,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Great job, Councilor Falco.

777
01:08:48,308 --> 01:08:49,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

778
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:50,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lococo.

779
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:52,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

780
01:08:52,270 --> 01:09:00,874
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're talking about meetings tomorrow night, there's also a Board of Appeals meeting at seven o'clock at the library in the Magoon Room that I know people are interested in.

781
01:09:00,914 --> 01:09:04,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to announce that publicly as it's not at City Hall like it usually is.

782
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at the library.

783
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:08,974
[SPEAKER_05]: to discuss the Salem Street and Canal Street project.

784
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:10,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

785
01:09:13,995 --> 01:09:14,315
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 p.m.

786
01:09:17,216 --> 01:09:21,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scarpelli.

787
01:09:21,717 --> 01:09:22,497
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

788
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:29,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Reports of committees.

789
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:29,979
[SPEAKER_10]: 17-099.

790
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:35,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of the committee of the whole meeting of February 27th,

791
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:42,697
[SPEAKER_10]: discussing the police station bond order and prior questions.

792
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:46,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to accept, Mr. President.

793
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to accept, seconded by Councilor Knight.

794
01:09:50,222 --> 01:09:51,062
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

795
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:51,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

796
01:09:52,143 --> 01:09:53,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

797
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:57,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Petitions, presentation, and similar matters.

798
01:09:57,487 --> 01:09:58,807
[SPEAKER_10]: 17298, Gene Martin.

799
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:07,360
[SPEAKER_10]: 10 Cumming Street Method Mass to address the council to offer a new proclamation.

800
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

801
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:10,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

802
01:10:10,462 --> 01:10:11,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

803
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:19,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I stated last week, when you point a finger at one person, you're pointing three back at yourself.

804
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:30,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody wiser than me said, when you make a complaint, when you criticize, you should have at least three solutions ready for that to solve the problem.

805
01:10:30,845 --> 01:10:34,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that spirit, I rewrote the Medford's proclamation.

806
01:10:36,249 --> 01:10:50,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas our nation was originally established for the purpose of expanding the British Empire and for the purpose of supplying England with its natural resources, it thereby established a few key colonies in Massachusetts and Virginia, Medford being among them.

807
01:10:51,356 --> 01:10:59,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the British colonists, in order to achieve their goal, had but one obstacle, the Pawtuckets, who were already living here.

808
01:10:59,782 --> 01:11:09,608
[SPEAKER_00]: So the British colonists began taking the land of the native peoples, and in some cases enslaving them, while others died of disease and famine, Medford being among them.

809
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:15,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the British Empire was a participant in both the practice of indentured servitude,

810
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:23,494
[SPEAKER_00]: and the institution of African slavery, Medford being among them, we therefore acknowledge that our nation did not start out as a perfect one.

811
01:11:24,515 --> 01:11:44,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the colonists eventually revolted against British rule, the grievances not settled, and on April 19th, 1775, 59 of Medford's men fought in the battles of Lexington and Concord, resulting in war between England and the burgeoning United States, having won their independence.

812
01:11:45,173 --> 01:11:50,294
[SPEAKER_00]: yet still carrying remnants of its old colonial institutions, slavery among them.

813
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:56,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, the colonists became visionaries, having just been released as subjects of a king.

814
01:11:57,076 --> 01:12:06,799
[SPEAKER_00]: They therefore enshrined certain individual protections from the government, knowing the potential abuses of government as they drew up our country's US Constitution.

815
01:12:07,817 --> 01:12:09,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, it was the U.S.

816
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:24,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution itself that allowed our own Medford abolitionists, Prince Hall and Lydia Maria Child, the ability to use this most powerful of all government instruments through the enshrined rights of speech, press, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

817
01:12:25,648 --> 01:12:37,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, Sergeant William Lawrence was the first of many volunteers to give his life for Medford and our nation in the Battle of Bull Run during the Civil War as a member of the Lawrence Light Guard.

818
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:50,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, our Medford citizens and soldiers were both instrumental in arguing in the greatest of all debates in this nation, the unresolved issue of human bondage.

819
01:12:51,091 --> 01:13:10,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Hall and Child led the consciousness of the majority in favor of the minority and giving rise to the Civil War, which freed our nation of its original design and liberated all peoples held against their will by adding the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S.

820
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:10,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution.

821
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:11,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost done.

822
01:13:12,544 --> 01:13:22,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we who are fortunate enough to live in this most blessed of cities, knowing and understanding our history, are especially dedicated to justice for all.

823
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:26,254
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Medford know the power of one voice and all that it can accomplish.

824
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:35,360
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Medford have lived among those who have laid down their lives in the pursuit of our nation's freedoms and cherish those rights unequivocally.

825
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:39,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Having shed blood in both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars,

826
01:13:39,988 --> 01:13:52,936
[SPEAKER_00]: to defeat tyranny externally and internally, we are dedicated to protecting the rights of individuals to live without fear of persecution, no matter their race or any other minority designation.

827
01:13:53,517 --> 01:14:02,963
[SPEAKER_00]: We value the individual as a whole person to be respected, freed from fear, and hold up the ability of the individual to live life to their fullest.

828
01:14:03,823 --> 01:14:09,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford values all thoughts and perspectives, regardless of how unpopular the person is who states them,

829
01:14:09,937 --> 01:14:11,798
[SPEAKER_00]: or how unpopular the concept may be.

830
01:14:12,338 --> 01:14:13,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe all voices are welcome.

831
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much, and I'll give this to the mayor tomorrow.

832
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:18,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

833
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:18,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Martin.

834
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:18,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

835
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:28,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Falwell.

836

837
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:36,151
[SPEAKER_10]: The records, the table records of the meeting of February 14th, 2017,

838
01:14:38,895 --> 01:14:40,536
[SPEAKER_10]: but pass to Councilor Dello Russo.

839
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:43,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Dello Russo, after your exhaustive investigation.

840
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:48,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, after a thorough and exhaustive investigation.

841
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:49,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you deem them in order?

842
01:14:49,983 --> 01:15:07,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that the following correction be made to the records of that meeting under paper number 17-079, meaning the whole committee report, in that Councilor Falco be marked as ineffective.

843
01:15:10,246 --> 01:15:11,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

844
01:15:13,212 --> 01:15:18,923
[SPEAKER_10]: The records of the meeting of February 28th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight.

845
01:15:19,444 --> 01:15:21,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

846
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:45,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I found the papers in order, with the exception of paper 17-088 and subsection A, amended by Councilor Knight, that Massachusetts Highway Department provide a maintenance schedule for the area.

847
01:15:45,593 --> 01:15:48,834
[SPEAKER_12]: This correction has been emailed to the city clerk.

848
01:15:49,314 --> 01:15:54,755
[SPEAKER_12]: And also under item B, amended by Councilor Caraviello, that State Representative Donato receive a copy on the resolution and amendment.

849
01:15:54,975 --> 01:15:56,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the two changes that needed to be made.

850
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,256
[SPEAKER_12]: I've emailed the copy of those to the city clerk.

851
01:15:58,276 --> 01:15:59,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I'd move for approval as amended.

852
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:02,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

853
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:03,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lococo.

854
01:16:04,343 --> 01:16:06,124
[SPEAKER_05]: After we take that vote, just a public announcement.

855
01:16:06,725 --> 01:16:07,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

856
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:11,349
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Naito to accept the records, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

857
01:16:11,589 --> 01:16:12,470
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor, aye.

858
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:21,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to announce that this Sunday is the fourth annual Running of the Leprechauns, 5K, benefiting the Boston Children's Hospital.

859
01:16:22,117 --> 01:16:25,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sunday morning, starts at 11 a.m.

860
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe registration begins at 9.30, 10.

861
01:16:27,061 --> 01:16:27,301
[SPEAKER_05]: That's at

862
01:16:30,593 --> 01:16:32,194
[SPEAKER_05]: 321 Winthrop Street in Medford.

863
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:35,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts in Medford, 5K, goes through Medford Square.

864
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:38,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Great cause, so I suggest anybody.

865
01:16:38,616 --> 01:16:39,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be cold, but it'll be fun.

866
01:16:40,337 --> 01:16:41,298
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get you green on.

867
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:47,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I will do my errands, and I am a beneficiary of the Children's Hospital, so I will be there.

868
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm running.

869
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:49,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm running, yep.

870
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:49,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be running.

871
01:16:50,701 --> 01:16:53,302
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli.

872
01:16:53,723 --> 01:16:56,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, did you want to speak?

873
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:02,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

874
01:17:02,643 --> 01:17:03,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

875
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:03,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

876
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:05,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

877
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:08,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Avenue, Medford.

878
01:17:09,328 --> 01:17:09,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

879
01:17:10,228 --> 01:17:10,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.

880
01:17:11,729 --> 01:17:27,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my friends and I were wondering what the report summation was for the committee on the whole meeting regarding the spending plan for the architect $2 million bill for the police station.

881
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Briefly, how does that stand?

882
01:17:29,821 --> 01:17:30,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And also,

883
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:38,345
[SPEAKER_01]: were wondering, is there any other way that's less affordable?

884
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:50,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that inflation sets in, but I believe a few weeks ago, Councilor Marks had presented a report that was presented by an engineer that was $350,000.

885
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:58,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I know things increase in three and a half years, but I'm certainly hoping, and we are, a whole bunch of us, that a $2 million bill

886
01:17:59,124 --> 01:18:10,554
[SPEAKER_01]: is not being put on the city, I would assume that there are many, many people who you know yourselves through doing work in the city that can do a more affordable appraisal on those buildings.

887
01:18:11,314 --> 01:18:26,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides that, why in the world would the mayor or anyone think of a $21 million project when the outside structure of that building, which has been looked at by contractor friends of my own who have had business there, called me and wanted to know,

888
01:18:27,595 --> 01:18:28,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sound.

889
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:36,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is the police force and the chief waiting all these years when you could have built up a floor?

890
01:18:37,507 --> 01:18:43,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandblasted or waterblasted the building and gutted the inside and cleaned it for those poor people all these years.

891
01:18:44,268 --> 01:18:48,329
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand why everything is way to the 11th hour for ruthless spending.

892
01:18:48,669 --> 01:18:50,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd like to know the status of that, please.

893
01:18:51,289 --> 01:19:00,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're peons, but we're trying to use our imaginations to accommodate those policemen in a long waiting of years and to help the taxpayers a little bit in the community.

894
01:19:01,391 --> 01:19:02,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

895
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:02,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

896
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:04,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

897
01:19:04,152 --> 01:19:05,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to answer a question through the chair,

898
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you saw last week's meeting, but we took a few votes.

899
01:19:11,423 --> 01:19:17,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It passed for its first reading, and then I was going to ask the clerk, when will it be up for its third reading before the council?

900
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:21,310
[SPEAKER_10]: When will it be up for its third reading?

901
01:19:23,131 --> 01:19:23,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks?

902
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:23,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Three weeks?

903
01:19:25,853 --> 01:19:28,495
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not on the agenda, so no.

904
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:30,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I made the paper this week.

905
01:19:34,472 --> 01:19:41,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be, it'll be in this Thursday's edition of the transcript because the transcript goes to press at I think eight o'clock on Tuesday.

906
01:19:42,258 --> 01:19:43,679
[SPEAKER_10]: So sometimes it doesn't make it in there.

907
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:47,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So be on on the nine and then 10 days after that.

908
01:19:47,242 --> 01:19:47,903
[SPEAKER_10]: So probably.

909
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:53,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So March 21st meeting will, it will take its third reading by vote of the city council.

910
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:59,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's when you maybe want to come speak in opposition or make your voice heard.

911
01:20:00,512 --> 01:20:06,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're hoping that you can come up with a devise another plan that's less costly than $2 million to have an architect.

912
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:11,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't anyone think of any other person or company?

913
01:20:12,537 --> 01:20:25,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how a mayor can just come in new and be part of the budget directing in the city and have a plan devised by some architect, who I'm sure was

914
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:34,195
[SPEAKER_01]: quite capable, how can it jump from a $350,000 company to $2 million?

915
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,136
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't even imagine how someone came out with that figure.

916
01:20:38,017 --> 01:20:38,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

917
01:20:38,857 --> 01:20:39,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

918
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:49,963
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor answered us through the chair on February 27th, said on the 14th, it is 10% of budget cost, and the actual loan order is for $2 million.

919
01:20:50,003 --> 01:20:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's believing that that's 10% of the actual budget cost.

920
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:53,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the actual loan was like $1.7 million.

921
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:55,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was the number.

922
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:56,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right.

923
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,340
[SPEAKER_05]: A million seven million seven.

924
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I think was the actual number in the budget there.

925
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:03,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight would like to speak.

926
01:21:03,043 --> 01:21:13,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Mr. President, um, Mr. Cito, Mr. Sisto raises a number of good questions and we've got a number of good answers from the administration, um, that are all public record that have been sent to this council.

927
01:21:13,608 --> 01:21:20,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, I don't think there'd be a problem if you gave your address to the city messenger, the city clerk could provide you with copies of what we received as well.

928
01:21:20,471 --> 01:21:23,272
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to see copies of the financials that the council received.

929
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:25,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

930
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:29,662
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Knight.

931
01:21:29,902 --> 01:21:30,544
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?
