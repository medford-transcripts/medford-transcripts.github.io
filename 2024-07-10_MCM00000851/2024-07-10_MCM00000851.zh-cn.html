    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=0.391s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 欢迎大家。
 我们在这里。
 我们做到了。
 这真的很令人兴奋。
 谢谢大家的到来。
 按照今晚的计划，我们八点出发。
 我们八点前就出发了。
 我要稍微改变一下议程，因为 KP Law 的 Janelle 在这里主持一个公开的法律培训会议。
 所以我们现在跳过介绍。
 因此 Janelle 可以在培训期间召开公开会议，因为她预约了本次会议的后半部分。
 所以我想确保她有足够的时间来做这件事。
 但在此之前，我要快速打个电话，以便记录在案，我们知道谁在这里。
 珍妮格雷厄姆在这里。
 伦戈-科恩市长？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=44.223s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 这里。</p>

 这里。
 利比·布朗？
 这里。
 玛丽莎·德斯蒙德、玛丽亚·多尔西、布莱恩·希利亚德。
 他缺席了。
 特雷西·基恩和艾米丽·拉扎罗缺席。
 他今晚要召开董事会会议。
 妮可·莫雷尔缺席。
 她之前有过一次冲突。
 嗯，亚伦在这里开派对。
 卢克·普里斯纳、拉里·布朗、鲍勃·迪金森。
 今晚他不在。
 菲奥娜·麦克斯韦。
 琼·鲍文、托马斯·道尔顿、查德·法伦会来，我想洛里·霍奇顿、唐·麦克劳克林、保罗·卢梭和菲利普·桑托斯今晚不会在场。
 他还开了一个会议。
 因此，我们有法定人数。
 只需几分钟，您就会了解为什么这很重要。
 但我马上就把它交给珍妮尔。
 但我想我首先要说的是，我们所有的会议都遵守公开会议法。
 凭借在公开会议行业四年的经验，这是完成工作的一种非常复杂的方法。
 所以我只想说这是我的个人经历。
 它的存在是有原因的。
 这是绝对必要的，但它要求你们所有人不仅要仔细思考自己在会议中所说和所做的事情，更重要的是，要仔细思考在会议之外的行为方式，因为
 在没有意识到的情况下，您可能会违反公开会议法。
 MSB 要求我们按照公开会议法召开所有会议。
 因此，我们认为对每个人来说，在所有这些方面都有一定的基础是很重要的。
 房间里的民选官员显然熟悉公开会议法，可以为任何有疑问的人提供指导。
 我刚刚为此注册了他们。
 我会告诉出席的教育工作者，他们通常一直与学校委员会互动。
 一般来说，你不受公开会议法的约束，但在这个房间里，在这个问题上，你就受到了约束。
 所以这只是以这种方式调整你的职责。
 所以我要把它交给珍妮尔。
 Janelle，如果您想在此过程中提出问题，或者希望我们保留问题直至您完成，请告诉我们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=186.9s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 我经历了教师、评估小组组长、协调员的各个职位，现在担任这个职位。
 我还有两个孩子毕业于梅德福公立学校。
 一个人走的是大学道路，另一个人走的是职业生涯。
 因此，我真的很高兴看到这所新高中的愿景以及它能为梅德福和我们的学生带来什么，而且也以劳里所说的为我们所有学生提供公平和可及性为基础。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 你好，我是苏珊·卡鲁西。
 今年是我的第27个年头。
 所以我也是在上学的第三个月出生和长大的。
 我不再住在这里，但我的整个职业生涯都在这里。
 我最初担任布鲁克斯学校的教师、助理校长、学校领导、小学助理校长，现在是学术事务和建筑部的助理校长。
 就像玛尔塔的文章一样，我很高兴能够与你们所有人在学校教学领域合作。
 我想曾经去过玛丽亚的人谈过这个问题。
 所以，你知道，我父亲是 K 号楼到 8 号楼的项目经理。
 所以我觉得我在这两个方面都经历过一些，但足够幸运
 作为 2001 年新麦格林学校的一名教师，作为一名教育者并成为新学校的一员，我很高兴看到整个过程的展开。
 因此，我认为我们所有人所发挥的关键作用，这些将影响我们的教育工作者、我们的学生、我们的家庭、我们的社区的重大决定对我来说非常重要。
 非常认真地对待这件事。
 我非常荣幸能够成为团队的一员并能够与大家一起工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4322.786s">[Unidentified]</a>: 谢谢。
 晚上好，玛丽莎·帕金森。
 我也出生在劳伦斯的同一条街上。
 我的家人和我的母亲还在这里，就在西梅德福的街道上。
 我开始在梅德福学习。
 我从哈维学校开始。
 我走了一条不同的路。
 我最终在S。
 雷和凯西。
 我是个虔诚的天主教徒，但你知道，我在西湖的约翰尼食品大师店工作过。
 杜格公园是我当地的公园。
 你知道，我喜欢学校。
 我爱孩子。
 我热爱教育。
 我从事教育工作已有30年了。
 这非常可怕，因为我当时大约29岁。
 这是我最喜欢的答案。
 所以我想我必须做出调整。
 但我对这意味着什么感到非常兴奋：为梅德福建立一所新高中。
 我知道这座建筑建造时，它就像，你知道，可能就像泰姬陵。
 那是一所美丽的学校。
 但是，你知道，50 多年后，我们需要一些新的东西。
 我觉得我们的学生应得的。
 我们有一个很棒的职业计划。
 我们有精彩的学术课程，但在一栋非常古老的建筑中。
 我们有一个精彩的柯蒂斯之家项目，该项目位于不同的设施中。
 我们为这里的员工提供精彩的幼儿教育和学前教育计划。
 我们很幸运在梅德福拥有这些东西。
 我觉得梅德福是一颗小宝石。
 拥有一所新的旗舰高中将为我们的学生、社区和我们社区的未来（整个社区）做很多事情。
 我希望成为这个过程的一部分，并与在场的每个人一起工作，并经历我的不同经历。
 将我的声音添加到已经在这里的所有声音中。
 对于市长和议员格雷厄姆来说，进入这个 25 人小组，有很多非常合格的候选人，就像另一位工程师，另一位工程师，另一位建筑师。
 但要接触到这群人，
 很棒的人，我非常非常感激。
 我想感谢卢克，他两年前与我们一起开始了这个过程，我想，而且，你知道，他坚持了下来，并且始终处于掌控之中。
 所以我很期待这个过程，我真的希望我们对即将发生的事情保持积极和乐观。
 Ramjani 成员，我不知道您是否愿意与他们分享有关过滤器的信息。
 你捕获了什么以及它有多令人兴奋。
 对于团队的其他成员来说，拥有类似的经历将会更加令人兴奋。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4528.482s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 当然。
 谢谢大家...
 情感的言语。
 我想从现在到晚上 8 点之间完成一些事情。
 我保证我们会在八点出发。
 但为了快速检查，有两件重要的事情。
 一是我想让你了解正在发生的事情。
 迄今为止以及我们目前的进展情况。
 所以我要谈一下这个问题。
 让我们做一个快速演示来做到这一点。
 然后在今晚离开之前，我们将组建一些小组委员会，以便我们能够快速开展一些我们需要做的短期工作。
 我们稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但是彼得，如果你能向我提及那次演讲，那就太好了。
 好的。
 您可以跳过某些页面。
 坚持下去，再来一张。
 开始了。
 我们从 2 月份开始，然后在 12 月份 MSBA 邀请我们参加资格期。
 我们将在几分钟内讨论资格期限的含义。
 但该邀请函上写着：邀请您参与这个从 5 月 1 日开始的流程。
 那么明天我们就开始吧。
 不过，委员会在二月份任命我为这个建设委员会的主席，到目前为止已经做了很多工作。
 我们必须做的事情之一就是把它们全部找到，对吗？
 因此，在试图说明我们作为学校委员会希望这个建筑委员会做什么的背景下，我们列出了一份目标清单。
 还会有很多很多的目标，但我想为此奠定基础，
 我们接下来要做的工作。
 五到七年。
 首先是全面规划目前梅德福高中校园内的所有项目，包括 9-12 职业和非职业教育、9-12 体育、梅德福家庭网络、梅德福社区学校项目、幼儿教育，包括但不限于梅德福早期教育项目（我们称之为 MEAP）和儿童角。
 因此，这座大楼里发生的事情比我们想象的高中要多得多。
 所以这是你们都需要开始思考的事情。
 第二，这是什么？
 我能拿到吗？
 谢谢。
 哦，是的，我可以分享幻灯片。
 不，不，我可以分享幻灯片。
 是的，我稍后可以与您分享所有幻灯片。
 第二是考虑将柯蒂斯塔夫茨高中设在梅德福校区是否将为柯蒂斯塔夫茨的学生提供更多的教育机会。
 第三，确保在整个项目的适当里程碑上提供强有力的公众意见和利益相关者反馈，并遵守 MSBA 指南和梅德福学校委员会的指导。
 聆听教育工作者和管理人员关于梅德福学生的最佳实践和教育计划的未来。
 这意味着我们非常关心功能。
 所以我们想知道这些空间是否适合大楼内的学生和教师。
 这真的非常重要。
 嗯，第五，为建筑制定计划，推进方法、气候目标并实现所有目标，并领导第五版的认证，以实现 2030 年和 2050 年巴黎气候协议的目标，并高效、有效地完成施工过程，确保学生能够尽快在新建筑中学习。
 那么
 这是一项艰巨的任务。
 最快的速度仍然以年而不是月来衡量。
 但在创建这个委员会的背景下，我一被任命为主席，我们就发起了申请征集，我们开始收集申请，它们都在这里。
 然而，在我们已经开始的资格阶段还有很多工作要做。
 我们稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但您可以转到下一张幻灯片。
 非常糟糕的图形，在网站上没有得到很好的探索。
 但是，当我们谈论整个过程时，我们还要再开箱六个小时。
 5 月 1 日，我们将在框中输入此资格期限。
 在该过程的每个阶段，
 MSBA 必须批准我们满足此阶段的所有要求。
 必须有一个董事会，他们可以投票邀请我们进入下一阶段。
 因此，在此过程中的任何时候，MSBA 都可以说它还没有准备好继续前进。
 他们还可以说：我们不喜欢你所做的事情。
 他们也可能会说，算了。
 所以我们的工作就是确保这些事情不会发生。
 我们的工作是公平竞争、全面发展，并尽快向前推进。
 好吧，让我们给 MSBA 一个机会，因为我们会为他们做好准备。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4847.483s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我们会看到。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4849.904s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但这个资格期限持续 270 天。
 因此，到一月份我们必须完成资格阶段。
 我将谈谈这个阶段发生的事情。
 简而言之，除了资格阶段之外，当我们谈论建立项目团队时，这意味着引入我们所有者的项目经理。
 然后我们继续进行可行性研究。
 当人们想到我们在这个委员会所做的事情时，他们认为我们现在正在进行可行性研究。
 你认为我们正在做决定，我们正在建设吗？
 我们要更新吗？
 我们在哪里建设？
 你在场上吗？
 你在停车场吗？
 这将如何运作？
 我们还没有达到那个程度。
 所以告诉你所有的朋友，我们将到达那里并与专业人士合作。
 帮助我们对这座大楼需要做的事情进行评估。
 然后我们将继续进行方案设计，为项目融资。
 这就是我们作为社区投票资助该项目的地方。
 我无法强调它的重要性，但在实现这一目标之前我们还有很多工作要做。
 当这种情况发生时，我们将进入详细设计。
 所以我们把铲子放在地上。
 然后，在未来的某个时候，我们将完成该项目。
 所以这有点像坚果汤。
 我的目标是让我们一步步前进。
 我们将采取一切必要措施来满足资格期限。
 然后我们将继续前进。
 当我们接近下一阶段时，我们将开始讨论如何加快工作速度。
 但目前，我们的重点是资格。
 如果您可以翻到下一页，
 资格流程有自己的图表，您无法查看。
 因此，请继续观看下一张幻灯片。
 出色地。
 所以这个阶段需要做五件事。
 一是初步合规认证。
 这是一项法律协议，要求该市遵守 MSBA 流程。
 该协议已签署并交付给 MSBA。
 我们提前一天，我会承认这一点。
 谢谢市长和警长。
 我们正在路上。
 第二，我们必须组建建筑委员会。
 你们都在这里。
 学校委员会原定于 5 月 1 日开会，但现在是 4 月 30 日。
 我们做到了。
 该表格将很快发送至 MSBA。
 所以我们正在努力，并将很快发货。
 显然这是最简单的部分。
 这是文书工作。
 整个资格阶段涉及大量文书工作，但这是最简单的，我们会做并完成它。
 MSBA 必须批准我们的委员会。
 我们满足所有要求，因此 MSBA 对我们委员会的成员提出了各种各样的要求。
 我们与大家一起满足所有这些要求。
 现在让我们深入实际工作。
 还有三件事需要发生。
 其中之一就是所谓的教育背景。
 这是一份示范文件，它要求我们说：今天这座建筑里发生了什么？
 有多少间教室？
 有多少间数学教室？
 有多少临时空间？
 你们的剧院有多大？
 所有这些，对吗？
 这就是为什么他要求你描述这座大楼里目前正在发生的事情。
 它还要求您描述您对这座建筑未来的设想。
 因此，这就是关于柯蒂斯·塔夫茨的这些对话，这些关于幼儿期的对话变得非常非常重要。
 因为在我们的利益申报和资格阶段之间，教育背景将为所有建筑专业人员如何实际完成工作定下基调。
 因此，这将确定实现此构建所需的工作范围。
 所以在这个过程中现在已经做了很多工作。
 自二月份以来，我一直在与管理团队会面。
 我们每周见几次面。
 他们已经厌倦了我。
 他会厌倦我的。
 但我们开始做的一件事是：我们可以消除什么？
 这就是为什么该文件在以下方面写得很好：
 我们在这座大楼里做什么？
 所有教室都被统计在内。
 所有计划均已概述。
 就今天发生的事情而言，政府还有更多工作要做，才能准确描述这一点。
 另一件显然要复杂得多的事情是谈论我们将来要在这座大楼里做什么。
 因此，在这次谈话中，我们再次进行了非常广泛的谈话。
 我们一直在利用大脑的战略规划部分来提出重大问题。
 我将借用柯蒂斯·塔夫茨一分钟。
 我们已经讨论过我们的教育工作者是否认为这是我们应该考虑的事情，答案是肯定的，他们说是的，我们应该考虑一下。
 然后我们开始说：“好吧，那会是什么样子？”
 要求是。
 所以我们开始了这次对话，但这次对话超出了该委员会可以分析的范围，因为它有点涉及学校委员会的职责。
 因此，昨晚我提出了一项决议，要求我们的特殊教育和行为健康小组委员会（实际上由卢梭成员担任主席）在非常紧张的时间内举行会议，以收集意见和评论。
 关于这个非常有限的话题。
 柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学位于该校区对就读于柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学的学生的教育成果是否有任何好处？
 昨晚还有另一位梅德福居民发表了讲话。
 他在萨默维尔开展了一个非常类似的项目。
 他谈到了萨默维尔刚刚发生的这一转变以及它如何导致人口爆炸。
 对于那些需要另类环境的学生来说，它改变了游戏规则，让他们可以参加运动队等活动，在我们的例子中，是职业项目。
 所以这是一个巨大的机会，但是
 我们希望确保社区和委员会有机会思考他们可以贡献的一切并向该委员会提供建议。
 昨晚，这一情况已正式传达给特殊教育小组委员会。
 他们会见面的。
 他们将邀请现任员工、现任学生、校友、
 社区成员等，以及来自萨默维尔的 Jack Hevery 进行讨论并解决这个问题，并提出建议，让他们步入正轨并在 6 月中旬回来，这样他们还有很多工作要做，但这将帮助我们了解情况。
 我们对这所学校的想象的那一部分的写作。
 因为我们可能需要的不仅仅是大楼某处的几间教室。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨大学的成功部分在于其环境与拥有 1,200 名学生的庞大校园有很大不同。
 因此，我们必须仔细考虑如何将其组合在一起，但我们希望小组委员会所做的工作能够回到我们身边并得到传达。
 玛塔和查德将参加未来几周即将举行的学校委员会会议，玛塔将谈论她对替代方案的一些想法，以及这一切可能会是什么样子，即使是在短期内。
 这是必须纳入的内容。
 琼、苏珊娜、保罗和我昨天谈论了幼儿教育。
 我们的小学已经人满为患。
 我们将不得不在某个时候处理这​​个问题。
 MEEP 曾经在这里举办。
 我们将探讨一个案例，该案例表明 MEAP 应该回到这里，这可能是也可能不是我们着陆的地方，但这是我们正在探索的事情，因为现在是时候了。
 我们还谈论了很多关于没有接受过学前教育的学生以及他们何时进入我们公立学校的问题。
 对于这些学生来说，入学是多么具有挑战性。
 我们还讨论诸如等待名单有多大之类的问题？
 有多少来到我们这里的学生从未接触过任何类型的学前环境？
 我们需要什么样的能力来从这座大楼提供更广泛、更全面的幼儿教育项目？
 因为所有这些都必须包含在本文档中。
 所以，我们正在努力解决这个问题。
 因此，在这些事情发生的同时，到目前为止，在这个教育概况上已经做了很多工作。
 我们尚未涉及的教育概况的重要部分是沟通策略。
 我稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但在教育方面，我们的教育工作者必须做很多工作才能准备这份文件。
 我只是想让每个人都知道一切都在进行中。
 当我们进入下一次会议时，我们将展示这些文件，以便我们可以开始更广泛地阅读这些文件，寻求建议，并确保我们真正从各个角度考虑我们需要描述的内容。
 这就是我认为你们都发挥着非常重要作用的地方：
 我认为有必要根据我所知道的或基于我们对艺术项目或职业项目等的愿景，稍微不同地描述我们在这里所做的事情。
 这就是我们在教育概况中所处的位置。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨 (Curtis Tufts) 担任小组委员会成员。
 另一个重大的、创新的、不断变化的主题是 MEAP。
 MSBA 描述的社区中经常发生延误的原因是，他们必须做出有助于施工过程的非常重要的决定。
 我们可以合并两所学校吗？
 这显然有它自己的能量和它自己的一套要求，这使得它很难实现
 快点行动吧。
 因此，我们试图从大处着眼，因为这是一个独特的机会，可以以非常全面的方式思考该学区的真正需求，同时也可以尽快向前推进。
 因此，所有这些工作都正在进行中，并尽快向前推进。
 彼得，你可以转到下一张幻灯片吗？
 在专业方面也非常类似，因为我们有一个非常活跃的专业学校，所以我们还有另一个文件需要完成，那就是生存能力的第74章。
 第七十四章是专业设置条例的一章吧？
 出色地。
 这篇文章正在进行中。
 我们必须告诉他们，这是我们的计划。
 这是这些程序的功能。
 这是我们当前的注册和信息，例如我们的等候名单。
 我们还有机会描述这些计划的扩展计划。
 查德和彼得将在学校委员会中讨论扩张的潜力。
 这是学校委员会的问题，因为扩大的项目需要的不仅仅是一座建筑。
 需要设备。
 需要工作人员。
 因此，学校委员会必须对此进行评估。
 因此，该报告将于 5 月 20 日提交给学校委员会，并将有助于第 70 章表格的最终确定。
 这个小组也会仔细阅读并做好准备。
 本周晚些时候，市长、总监和我将与 MSBA 讨论这一难题，这实际上是城市规划信息。
 然后我们可以开始将信息输入到他们所谓的登记研究中。
 这有助于确定建筑物的大小。
 您可能已经听说过很多关于这座大楼是如何为 4,000 名学生建造的，但现在只有 1,200 名学生。
 4000到底是不是这个数字我不知道，但确实数字不一样。
 因此，MSBA 在资格阶段要做的事情之一就是，让我们为这么多学生建造一座大楼。
 这通常与今天大楼里发生的事情类似。
 然而，如果该市计划在开发中的住房方面进行重大扩张，他们会想知道所有这些。
 所以他们可以调整建筑物的大小，因为他们不希望我们建造一座立即耗尽容量的建筑物。
 他们也不希望我们建造一座永远不会住满的建筑。
 好的。
 所以，这是那里正在进行的工作的一部分。
 第四件事，维修文件。
 我们必须填写一份调查问卷，概述我们在整个地区的所有维护实践。
 所以这就像：他被重新投入使用了吗？
 你们的团队是如何训练的？
 大约有20个变量。
 该文件也处于起草阶段，正在尽快推进。
 我们可能会稍后在六月份讨论这个问题。
 考虑到我们已完成资格，我们需要做的最后一件事是确定可行性研究的资金，该资金可能在二十五万到二百五十万美元之间。
 我们还没有准备好，但我们正在制定计划。
 市长和我正在从财务工作组的角度制定该计划，以便能够根据需要尽快核算和管理这笔资金。
 对流程有疑问吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5700.456s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 当然是第五，那么当它说地方授权时，是否意味着选民不投票？
 不。
 您想要大部分资金还是意味着市政府已经确定了全额资金？
 正确的。
 一部分会退还，但我认为授权必须是全额。
 正确的人会根据我们的情况告诉您退款的内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5724.632s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 关于可行性，这笔融资必须涵盖可行性研究的所有费用，而不是整个项目，只是可行性研究，相当于二到二百五十万美元。
 该市将提前支付整个可行性研究的费用。
 然后，一旦 MSBA 认证了我们的项目报销率，并且我们在整个过程中取得了成功，他们将报销可行性研究报告，该费用与他们向我们提供的分配百分比成正比。
 所以是的，他们将使用相同的公式并要求进行可行性研究并向市政府偿还费用。
 但这座城市必须面对这笔钱。
 所以这里必须发生的是，
 我们为此有一个融资计划。
 嗯，我们应该表现得很好。
 所以我们在这方面做得很好，这需要市议会投票来授权这些资金并将其放在我们可以使用的地方。
 但是
 正如我提到的，这一切应该在一月份之前完成。
 每个都有与其相关的特定截止日期。
 我会非常积极地告诉他们，我希望在明年开学之前完成所有这些事情。
 只要有可能，我希望这些事情能够在 6 月 30 日之前完成。
 这就是为什么我们一直走到一起、努力并推动。
 我认为拓展自己很重要。
 因此，让我们伸展身体并做好准备。
 MSBA 在预科学习认证和其他一切方面都有工作要做。
 但我希望我们能够为他们提供所需的一切，以便我们能够尽快进入下一阶段。
 对日程安排有疑问吗？
 出色地。
 所以我们只剩下20分钟了。
 为此，我们在议程末尾列出了即将举行的一系列小组委员会会议。
 我希望我们在第一阶段前进时考虑并优先考虑两件事。
 其中之一是沟通和社区参与委员会。
 我希望有某种小组委员会，不超过七名投票成员，但有一个感兴趣的团体，作为小组委员会聚集在一起，真正能够描述和概述我们的社区参与流程。
 我想你们都看到社区中的人们表达了这样的担忧：梅德福会搞砸这件事吗？
 这行得通吗？
 这会发生吗？
 因此，您需要在社区中进行大量外展活动。
 我们越早开始，最终就会越成功。
 但我认为这是一个更广泛的对话，因为在我看来，我们还有各种各样的董事会和委员会。
 他们中的许多人对这个项目感兴趣。
 因此，有必要进行一些外展活动，以了解何时以及如何让他们参与，以便我们可以将其纳入未来的总体规划中。
 今晚我想组建的第二个小组是规则和公司委员会。
 正如珍妮尔所说，我们需要制定一些关于如何运作的规则，特别是围绕公众参与，但只是一般性的。
 我希望这个委员会的时间有限。
 我希望你们能聚在一起一次，给这个小组带来一份草案，然后我们就可以采用这些规则并从那里进行管理。
 然后第三委员会不会那么快开会，但会开会，
 你知道，在六月底之前就会有财务小组委员会，所以这将是一个常务委员会，将在项目的整个生命周期中召开会议并持续下去。
 重要的是要记住，当时机成熟时，社区将不得不投票。
 该委员会不是完成这项工作的地方。
 因此，如果我们谈论的是债务排除为该项目提供资金的最终需要，那么不应该由该委员会批准债务排除。
 事实上，这不可能发生在这里。
 它必须发生在这个群体之外。
 所以这个财务委员会，我认为这是对诸如此类的事情的投入和洞察
 采购，从我们业主的项目经理、我们的建筑师那里采购，诸如此类的事情。
 而且还可以帮助我们了解我们需要什么来实现生存能力？
 我们还应该考虑其他成本吗？
 因此，还有一些财务工作要做，尽管我预计小组会议要到五月晚些时候才会召开。
 因此，我们将在下次会议上更多地讨论罗伯特议事规则以及其他所有内容。
 我知道每个人都在看着我，就像请别再说了。
 所以我想我感兴趣的是是否有人听说过这些话题并表示我真的想参与其中
 您能认出这些小组委员会之一吗？
 我还礼貌地建议学校管理人员密切关注，因为你有自己的工作要做，为我们刚才描述的其余内容做好准备。
 百分百欢迎您。
 参加，但我们需要您出席学校委员会。
 我们需要约翰和彼得帮助我们制定这些维护计划等。
 因此，如果有人对任何其他主题感兴趣，委员会的规模不能很大，但可以根据我们认为能够开展工作所需的规模而定。
 所以我把这些小组委员会列入了日历。
 这些晚上我们将完全通过 Zoom 进行会议，只是为了让事情变得更容易一些。
 每个人都将为 5 月 13 日的下一次会议提供非常具体的成果，即提交一份提案草案。
 有志愿者吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6100.412s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的。
 对于另外2个。
 指定多少个？
 有关系吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6105.859s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我认为可以是任意数量的人。
 有投票权的成员不得超过七名。
 但我认为，如果我们真的消除所有学校工作人员，我不太担心我们会遇到这种情况。
 但我更感兴趣的是人们做他们认为适合他们所做的工作、适合他们热爱的工作的事情。
 谢谢。
 玛丽亚.
 通讯。
 谢谢。
 特雷西。
 标准。
 出色地。
 通讯。
 魔理沙。
 极好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6146.461s">[Libby Brown]</a>: 我的意思是，我可以放两个进去，看看是否足够。
 我会专注于通信或金融。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6154.444s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 出色地。
 我会让你从事金融工作。
 听起来怎么样？
 看起来不错。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6162.107s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6165.55s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 菲奥娜呢？
 金融。
 我们也可以向Bob申请融资吗？
 出色的。
 是的，是的，绝对是的。
 还有其他人对这些委员会感兴趣吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6182.816s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 如果你无法获得足够的融资，我会打电话给你。
 一切都好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6186.4s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我会把你列入名单。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6188.182s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 把我当成金融家。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6192.886s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 规则和整合有两个人。
 这是正确的。
 我原本计划参加所有委员会，但这是正确的。
 也许我们可以请艾米丽·拉扎罗 (Emily Lazzaro) 担任规则和公司成立小组委员会的成员。
 那我就去咨询她。
 我还让妮可·莫雷尔 (Nicole Morel) 加入通讯小组委员会。
 那么我们就来跟他们交流一下吧。
 但还有其他人对此有强烈的感受吗？
 您想去哪里？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6227.321s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 我可以做通讯。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6230.024s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 好的，太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6232.21s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 嗯，我本来想说的是金融，但我在这方面确实没有太多经验。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6235.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我想我们很好。
 约翰？
 不，你还有工作要做。
 哦，绝对是。
 我认为对于团队中所有真正的教练来说
 在我们深入研究这个问题之前，将有一个工作组必须为业主的项目经理整理一份提案请求。
 这不是我的经历。
 这不是我来这里的原因。
 因此，随着时间的推移，我们将依赖每个人组成不同的小组委员会。
 从我个人的角度来看，这是我认为我们应该开始的。
 这有道理吗？
 对于需要尽快发生的事情，有人有任何其他建议吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 我有一个问题。
 当然。
 你提到柯蒂斯可以来这里以及该设施的所有这些不同用途。
 谁在探索这些选择？
 比如社区教育，也许在社区大学工作，夜间课程，就像我希望在提供成人教育的 AGC 总承包商协会那样。
 有没有人喜欢，
 提出许多您想要考虑的选项或您的想法是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的，或多或少，或多或少不是，但不完全是。
 我们还没有达到那个程度。
 所以我认为，一旦我们克服了第 74 章中最初的羞红感，我们添加这个可能是有意义的。
 因此，当我们开始阅读这些文件时，我认为现在是时候说：我们还应该关注谁？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 因为所有这些类型的事情都会产生影响
 交通便利性、邻近性、设施相对于其他设施的规模、存储空间、停车位，您知道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6343.879s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 出色地。
 是的，我认为这是个好主意。
 我会把它放在清单上。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6350.581s">[Unidentified]</a>: 事实上，我们受到城市的限制。
 他们是。
 如果房间里的每个人都说：贝德福德休闲中心应该在这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6365.68s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但社区学校是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6367.861s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6375.31s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 出色地。
 是的，我想问，谁将为这个委员会提供某种数字基础设施？
 所以我会参考SOI。
 有SOI。
 有研究关注 Fed.SOI。
 可能还有一整套其他公开文件实际上无法向公众公开，但应该公开。
 您知道，这个社区参与沟通小组委员会将负责：
 可能与许多人传达同样的事情，这是通过网站（也许通过共享存储库）最有效地完成的，并且肯定可以进行外部通信
 例如，在门户网站上，例如网站，就像每所拥有这些项目的学校一样，然后是一种后端存储库，Sheldon 可以在其中查看 SOI。
 访问列表上的成员可以随时使用它。
 当然。
 所需要的只是资源。
 我可以给你更新情况。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我们有这个。
 因此，我们从该委员会获得了一个唯一的 URL，它是buildingmhs.org。
 是这样吗？
 出色地。
 因此，该 URL 是存在的。
 该页面存在。
 事实上，托马斯正在研究这个社区资源的基本结构。
 我们要求每个人提供个人简介和照片的原因是它们都将发布在网站上，因此他正在以传播总监的身份致力于所有这些工作。
 汤姆已经同意，尽管他是即将卸任的传播总监，但他仍会继续专注于这个项目，直到我们聘请他的继任者。
 所以托马斯和我们的一些专业教育学生正在建立这个网站，我认为是在丽莎·米勒的指导下。
 并且将会有一个文件组件，所有这些文件都可以向公众开放，这样当有人问，这是哪里？
 我们可以为您推荐一个地方。
 我们会议的所有记录都会放在那里。
 我们所有的会议议程都会在那里。
 所以我们已经有了一个完整的结构来尝试做到这一点。
 我们还没有准备好，但我希望下次会议时我们可以带您参观一下。
 网站。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 好的，下一步就是将门户朝外。
 我们的后背怎么样？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 所以这是一个复杂的问题，因为根据公开会议法，这对我们来说真的没有结束。
 一旦发布时间表，其所有文件都将成为公共记录的一部分。
 如果我们这样做，棘手的事情是，如果我们在幕后工作，我们很有可能违反公开会议法。
 因此，管理员拥有他们正在处理的文档的工作副本，并且不代表法定人数，并且可以继续这样做。
 这些文档到达此处后，将被放置在公开可用的驱动器上。
 当我们谈论文档编辑时，该委员会没有离线编辑。
 公开会议法律是不允许的。
 不幸的是，我们要坐在这里一起编辑文档。
 这确实是管理这个过程中最痛苦的部分之一你们都报名了，抱歉。
 但是，是的，这是非常痛苦的，但是离线，那种在世界其他任何地方都非常有效的离线编辑，在这里不是一个选择。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 好的，所以没有 Google 云端硬盘或共享文档。
 事情将会被释放。
 当它们发布时，它们会出现在网站上。
 当它们出现在网站上时，它们本质上是配置控件，不能更改，除非在此处反向进行这些更改。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 嗯，是的，太可怕了。
 是的。
 这绝对是可怕的。
 我们找到了方法来做到这一点。
 不那么可怕，但是，你知道，不幸的是，它的可怕程度已经不那么可怕了。
 就文档的编辑方式而言，这肯定会让社区陷入麻烦。
 然后就会有，当我们这样做时，我会发现这些会议在 Zoom 上更有效。
 你可以坐在任何你需要的地方，每个人都可以看到文档是如何编辑的，并且不能有任何形式的
 在不公开发生这种情况的情况下编辑文档的想法。
 因此，我们在这方面必须非常谨慎。
 但是，是的，这是一个过程。
 奇怪的是这如何适用于 GraphDoc。
 我可以看到这适用于发布文档。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: 不。这不是 GraphDoc。
 我们了解到我们中有很多人在工作。
 我们正在商议。
 我们是一个共同的、年轻的、共享的集体。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 这就是深思熟虑。
 是的，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: 去年秋天，我在办公室与他们每个人进行了交谈。
 就是那个时期。
 所以我们打了一个很长的电话。
 共有 40 名成员。
 一位成员说：西蒙刚刚在文件中提到了这一点，并在那里阅读了我们的评论。
 事实上，我们把它们放在一起。
 答案是否定的。
 然后你就可以写下你的评论了。
 我回答说你七岁了。
 他们说，好吧，认了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我们只是感觉到而已。
 就好像我们都同意这可能会很危险。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的。
 再次感谢您来到这里。
 我对沟通部分也很感兴趣，虽然那些晚上不工作，但我总是很乐意接听一些电话。
 他们会回到这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 所有这些更新都会回到这里。
 您还可以回答有关小组委员会或议程上的其他任何问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: 我有一个关于投票的问题。
 是的，当我们进行投票时，是的，我们并不处于我从未理解的状态：权力是被允许的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 不。
 不，不是。
 会议中是否允许权力？
 不，您不能将您的选票分配给其他人。
 当我们结束时，让我们练习投票，因为我们必须投票才能结束。
 一般来说，这会通过他们所谓的语音投票来实现，每个人都说“是”，然后我们就走开。
 让我们练习滚动吧，因为它是
 再次，奇怪又奇怪，所以我们将这样做来结束它。
 但在结束之前还有其他问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我正在注意。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但我认为另一件事值得描述的是，这个委员会中有相当多的无投票权的成员。
 这样做的原因并不是因为我们不想收到您的来信。
 您来到这里是因为我们希望收到您的来信。
 投票时，我们不会点名您的名字，您也不会投票。
 但除此之外，你还是这个委员会的正式成员。
 他们警告我说
 当有很多投票成员时，开展业务就变得非常困难，因为需要达到委员会的法定人数才能开会和开展业务。
 这一切都变得非常非常复杂。
 因此，我们试图表达的是：我们希望成立一个大型委员会，但我们也需要能够高效、有效地向前推进等等。
 这就是背后的原因。
 我们在那里做了什么。
 我认为该委员会的规模在其一生中肯定会发生变化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: 那么25岁？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的，委员会中有 15 名投票成员，这仍然是一个相当不错的投票成员数量。
 我们很快就会练习投票。
 但下次会议还有其他问题吗？
 规则、规则并于5月7日合并。
 5 月 8 日社区参与，并将于 5 月 13 日向该小组带来他们的发现。
 因此，在我们 5 月 13 日的会议上，绝大多数人将研究这些建议并就这些计划达成一致。
 我们再次处于启动模式。
 之后，我们将深入了解政府一直在处理的一些文件的实质内容，并开始阅读它们，讨论其中的内容。
 诸如此类的事情，但让我们赶快行动吧。
 我们制定会议日程。
 只是为了合理起见，我们将尽可能在展会上亲自见面，价格为 89 元。
 即日起至六月底。
 我保证我们会在下一学年开始时回到周一晚上，但从现在到六月底，在学校委员会会议和假期之间，要维持这样的时间表是完全不可能的。
 我们只会在夏天通过 Zoom 开会，实际上我们会将会议移至周三。
 考虑到夏季的周一和周五，要达到法定人数来做某事确实很困难。
 希望我们能够完成这项工作，但我尽量保持会议日程轻松。
 我认为到八月底将会有更多的小组委员会，但这只是人们试图组织忙碌生活的开始。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。
 所以，有两件事。
 然而，这是一个间接的问题。
 如果你做不到这一点，
 好的，也请将您的想法和意见通过电子邮件发送给我们，以分享您的声音。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 其实这是一个技术问题。
 一位无法参加会议的绅士会向您发送一封电子邮件，概述他的想法和建议，甚至可能是一个决定。
 此前，我们听说除了议程设置之外，电子邮件对于几乎所有事情都是一个坏主意。
 这听起来像是一个灰色地带。
 我想知道您是否错过了一次公开会议，而这两件事是冲突的。
 它是如何运作的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 所以我可以告诉你，我认为任何律师都会告诉你永远不要以书面形式写下任何内容。
 这就是我们开始的地方。
 切勿以书面形式记录任何内容。
 话虽这么说，如果你要写一些东西，
 就像在这种情况下，是的，这是一个灰色地带。
 你应该做的是联系某人并说，嘿，我可以向你发送我的想法吗？
 您是否与其他人谈论过这些事情或者您打算这样做吗？
 您可以合理地确定您有一个闭环，对吧？
 这就是你告诉我的，我可以向你发送我的意见吗？
 我说是的。
 我说，我不会与其他任何人谈论这些问题，所以我们会没事的。
 只有当您与代表委员会多数票的一些人联系时，这才会成为问题。
 例如，如果您说：我想告诉两个人，因为我不确定谁会参加会议，那没关系，因为您还不到八岁。
 在与自己交谈之后，包括八个人，你就有麻烦了。
 那时你就违反了公开会议法。
 棘手的部分是，每个参与其中的人都必须与参与该对话的人具有相同的理解。
 我错过了什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我在盒子上的帖子中错过了这一点。
 你可以非常有意。
 我只是告诉你，你就走吧，哈哈。
 如果你做同样的事情，我们都将违法，无论我们采取什么措施来避免违法。
 所以我认为这对所有守法公民来说都是如此。
 系列审议不关心任何事情，不关心内容，不关心计划，不关心保险。
 只有我们两个人，对吧？
 你去违反它。
 我违反了很多法律。
 即使我不知道，
 好，好。
 嗯，是的，这就是我的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我们将为每个人提供梅德福公立学校的电子邮件地址，我强烈建议您在任何情况下都不要将您的个人电子邮件用于任何与 MSBA 相关的业务。
 设置这些电子邮件后，我们将转换所有内容。
 但我强烈建议您不要将您的个人电子邮件用于任何用途。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: 这使得遵守公共记录变得更加容易。
 我是学区的记录查阅官员。
 除了您的个人笔记之外，学校的任何官方文件都是公共记录，应该能够自动提供或至少在有人要求时进行审查。
 因此，在梅德福公立学校电子邮件地址、梅德福公立学校 Google 包中执行所有这些操作，您可以在其中做笔记和类似的事情，这对于包含该空间中的所有内容确实很有帮助。
 不要与他人分享。
 不要通过电子邮件发送您的草稿。
 这不是写私人笔记的地方。
 好的。
 我们不会把任何人置于这个意义上。
 确实如此。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7198.191s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 最后还有什么问题吗？
 现在是 8.03。
 让我们按照罗伯特的规则推迟这次会议吧。
 有休会动议吗？
 奥拉帕德成员提出了结束动议，鲁索成员附议。
 谢谢。
 哦，你不能。
 得到爱德华-文森特博士的支持。
 好的，我正在打电话。
 市长伦戈-科恩缺席。
