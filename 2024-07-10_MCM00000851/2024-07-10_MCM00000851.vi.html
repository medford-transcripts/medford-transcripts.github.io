 Chúng tôi đây.
 Chúng tôi đã làm được điều đó.
 Nó thực sự thú vị.
 Cảm ơn tất cả những người đã đến.
 Theo kế hoạch tối nay, chúng tôi khởi hành lúc 8 giờ.
 Chúng tôi rời đi trước tám giờ.
 Tôi sẽ thay đổi chương trình một chút vì Janelle từ KP Law đang tổ chức một buổi đào tạo pháp lý mở ở đây.
 Vì vậy bây giờ chúng ta bỏ qua phần giới thiệu.
 Vì vậy, Janelle có thể có một cuộc họp mở trong quá trình đào tạo vì cô ấy đã đặt chỗ cho nửa sau của cuộc họp đó.
 Vì vậy tôi muốn chắc chắn rằng anh ấy có đủ thời gian để làm việc đó.
 Nhưng trước đó, tôi sẽ gọi nhanh để ghi lại, chúng tôi biết ai ở đây.
 Jenny Graham đang ở đây.
 Thị trưởng Lungo-Cohen?</p>

 đây.
 Libby Brown?
 đây.
 Marissa Desmond, Maria Dorsey, Brian Hilliard.
 Anh ấy vắng mặt.
 Tracy Keane và Emily Lazzaro vắng mặt.
 Tối nay anh ấy có cuộc họp hội đồng.
 Nicole Morrell vắng mặt.
 Trước đây anh ấy đã có mâu thuẫn.
 À, Aaron đang tổ chức tiệc ở đây.
 Luke Plissner, Larry Brown, Bob Dickinson.
 Anh ấy không có ở đây tối nay.
 Fiona Maxwell.
 Joan Bowen, Thomas Dalton, Chad Fallon sẽ ở đó và tôi không nghĩ Lori Hodgton, Don McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau và Felipe Santos sẽ ở đó tối nay.
 Ông cũng đã tổ chức một cuộc họp.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi có một đại biểu.
 Chỉ trong vài phút, bạn sẽ hiểu tại sao điều này lại quan trọng.
 Nhưng tôi sẽ đưa nó cho Janelle ngay.
 Nhưng tôi đoán điều đầu tiên tôi sẽ nói là tất cả các cuộc họp của chúng ta đều phải tuân theo Đạo luật về các cuộc họp mở.
 Với bốn năm kinh nghiệm trong lĩnh vực hội họp công cộng, đây là một cách rất phức tạp để hoàn thành công việc.
 Vì vậy tôi chỉ muốn nói đây là kinh nghiệm cá nhân của tôi.
 Nó tồn tại là có lý do.
 Điều này là hoàn toàn cần thiết nhưng nó đòi hỏi tất cả chúng ta phải suy nghĩ cẩn thận không chỉ về những gì mình nói và làm trong các cuộc họp mà quan trọng hơn là cách chúng ta ứng xử bên ngoài cuộc họp, bởi vì
 Bạn có thể đang vi phạm luật họp mở mà không nhận ra.
 MSB yêu cầu chúng tôi tổ chức tất cả các cuộc họp theo Đạo luật về các cuộc họp mở.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi nghĩ rằng điều quan trọng là mọi người phải có nền tảng nào đó trong tất cả các khía cạnh này.
 Các quan chức được bầu trong phòng rõ ràng đã quen thuộc với luật họp công khai và có thể đưa ra lời khuyên cho bất kỳ ai có thắc mắc.
 Tôi vừa đăng ký cho họ việc đó.
 Tôi muốn nói với các nhà giáo dục có mặt rằng họ thường xuyên tương tác với các ủy ban của trường.
 Nói chung, bạn không bị ràng buộc bởi luật họp mở, nhưng trong căn phòng này, về vấn đề này, bạn bị ràng buộc.
 Vì vậy, vấn đề chỉ là sắp xếp trách nhiệm của bạn theo cách này.
 Vậy nên tôi sẽ chuyển nó cho Janelle.
 Janelle, nếu bạn muốn đặt câu hỏi trong quá trình này hoặc muốn chúng tôi giữ chúng cho đến khi bạn hoàn thành, vui lòng cho chúng tôi biết.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=186.9s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 Nhưng khi chúng tôi xây dựng những ngôi trường khác, tôi không có mặt trong ủy ban nhưng tôi đã thực hiện một số chuyến tham quan có hướng dẫn đến các tòa nhà khác.
 Tôi đã xem sự kiện hàng tuần của Jack Buckley đúng giờ và phù hợp với ngân sách.
 Điều này thật không thể tin được.
 Tôi thực sự bị cuốn hút bởi toàn bộ quá trình.

 chào ngài
 Tôi là Libby Brown.
 Tôi là một kiến ​​trúc sư.
 Tôi đã sống ở Medford được gần 10 năm.
 Bây giờ các con tôi đã đi học, tôi thực sự vui mừng vì đây là một dự án sắp thành hiện thực và tôi rất vui được trở thành một phần của nó.
 Tôi làm việc chủ yếu trong lĩnh vực giáo dục, chủ yếu là giáo dục đại học, nhưng cũng làm việc trong lĩnh vực giáo dục tiểu học và trung học tư thục.
 Tôi không có kinh nghiệm về MSBA, nhưng chúng tôi đã làm việc tại MSCBA, vì vậy chúng tôi có một số kinh nghiệm về giáo dục đại học.
 Tôi chỉ nghĩ đây là cơ hội tuyệt vời cho Medford.
 Tôi làm việc rất nhiều với các nhà giáo dục, thủ thư và những người thuộc chương trình thiết kế và xây dựng ý tưởng, đặc biệt là thực hiện nhiều giai đoạn cải tạo và đánh giá cơ sở vật chất hiện có, cho dù đó là bảo trì và cải tạo, phá dỡ, cả hai, thực hiện tất cả cùng một lúc hoặc bất cứ điều gì ở giữa.

 Bạn biết đấy, cách đây vài năm tôi đã tốt nghiệp trường Trung học Medford khóa 2018 và tôi vừa tốt nghiệp trường Cao đẳng BC vào tháng 5 vừa qua.
 Phần lớn công việc tôi đã làm trong vài năm qua là sự tham gia của cộng đồng, đặc biệt là sự tham gia của giới trẻ.
 Tôi nghỉ một năm để làm việc cho Năm Thành phố Boston và sau đó làm giáo viên trong hệ thống trường học Charleston.
 Tôi cũng đã làm rất nhiều công việc cộng đồng trong thời gian học đại học.
 Kể từ đó, gần đây tôi đã được bổ nhiệm làm Giám đốc Chương trình Việc làm Thanh niên mới của Thành phố Malden.
 Vì vậy, tôi làm việc ở văn phòng thị trưởng, cố gắng đảm bảo rằng trẻ em có cơ hội tìm được việc làm.
 Vậy bạn nào có bé nào quan tâm thì báo mình nhé.

 Nhưng tôi có rất nhiều cam kết ở nhà, nên chúng ta phải ở đây.
 Nhưng tôi thực sự mong đợi nó.
 Trong công việc của tôi, tôi sở hữu một công ty tư vấn quản lý.
 Tôi đã làm việc nhiều trong lĩnh vực cải tiến quy trình, thiết kế và cung cấp chương trình giáo dục dành cho người lớn cũng như quản lý dự án.
 Vì vậy, tôi là người quản lý dự án được chứng nhận, không làm trong ngành xây dựng.
 Nhưng tôi biết cách dẫn dắt một nhóm lớn người đạt được mục tiêu.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi ở đây.
 Vì vậy, phần lớn những gì Janelle đang nói đến là vai trò mà tôi phải đảm nhận trong vài phút nữa.
 Chúng tôi sẽ thảo luận về tất cả những điều này trong thời gian thích hợp.
 Nhưng tôi rất vui vì tất cả các bạn đều ở đây.

 Tôi có ba đứa con, hai đứa đang học trường công và một đứa có thể được học một, hai hoặc ba năm.
 Nhưng dù sao đi nữa, tôi thực sự rất hào hứng khi bắt đầu quá trình này.
 Xin chào, tôi là Marissa Desmond.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3995.553s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Tôi là một kiến ​​trúc sư.
 Tôi làm việc chủ yếu trong môi trường đại học, chủ yếu là ở giáo dục đại học, nhưng cũng có một ít ở giáo dục tiểu học và trung học.
 Tôi chủ yếu tập trung vào lập trình và phần đầu tiên của thiết kế ý tưởng của dự án, nhưng tôi cũng theo dõi rất nhiều từ ý tưởng đến quá trình xây dựng.
 Tôi có hai con nhỏ, ba và năm tuổi nên tôi hạnh phúc
 Sẽ có một trường học mới cho họ trong tương lai.
 Hãy là một phần của quá trình.
 Ngoài ra, tôi còn dạy toán một thời gian ngắn trước khi bắt đầu học và theo đuổi sự nghiệp kiến ​​trúc.
 Vì vậy, hãy mang theo một ít.
 Tôi rất vui mừng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4042.008s">[Marta Cabral]</a>: Marta Cabral, Hiệu trưởng Trường Trung học MedStar Chi.
 Tôi từng là giáo viên.
 Tôi cũng là một AP.
 Đây cũng là vai chính đầu tiên của tôi.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi cảm thấy may mắn khi có thể giúp xây dựng một ngôi trường mới cho học sinh của chúng ta trong năm đầu tiên ở đây, bởi vì các em thực sự xứng đáng với điều đó.
 Mình chưa có kinh nghiệm về xây dựng hay công trình xây dựng như các bạn.
 Nhưng điều tôi có thể làm là tưởng tượng xem học sinh, giáo viên và nhân viên của chúng ta sẽ cần loại không gian nào tại Trường Trung học Medford.
 Tôi thực sự vui mừng khi làm điều này vì tôi nghĩ chúng ta thực sự có thể
 Nâng cao việc dạy và học bằng cách tạo ra không gian hợp tác và đổi mới.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4089.096s">[MCM00000883_SPEAKER_09]</a>: Tôi hạnh phúc ở đó, cảm ơn bạn.
 Tôi là Lori Hodgdon.
 Tôi là hiệu trưởng của Trường Curtis Stubbs, có lẽ là tòa nhà cổ nhất.
 chắc chắn.
 Tôi yêu kiến ​​trúc cổ, tôi yêu Curtis Stubbs, nhưng tôi biết nó không dành cho sinh viên thế kỷ 21.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi rất hào hứng khi trở thành một giáo viên trung học, hiệu trưởng ở Vermont, hiệu trưởng ở Tây Massachusetts, North Shore, và sau đó là một trường bán công.
 Khi còn là sinh viên ở Middlebury, Vermont, tôi vẫn đang trong giai đoạn cuối của một dự án xây dựng và chứng kiến ​​điều này xảy ra.
 Cả hai chúng tôi đều đi ủng và anh trai tôi có thể tận hưởng những lợi ích của tòa nhà.
 Tôi cảm thấy như mình vẫn còn ở trạng thái ban đầu.
 hoặc sự kết thúc của một cái gì đó.
 Tôi nghĩ điều đó thực sự thú vị.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng không phải thành phố nào cũng có khả năng xây dựng các tòa nhà trường học mới và nghĩ về tương lai, đặc biệt là những học sinh mà tôi đang làm việc cùng, để giúp học sinh của chúng tôi tiếp cận với các nguồn lực vốn, vốn và văn hóa, điều mà tôi nghĩ sẽ thực sự quan trọng.
 Tôi thích những gì Jenny đã nói, một số người cùng địa phương hoặc bất kỳ ai nghĩ ra nó, tôi thích điều đó, nghĩ rằng các sinh viên hiện tại của chúng tôi thực sự sẽ trở thành một phần kết cấu của tòa nhà này trong tương lai.
 Họ xứng đáng với điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4186.071s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: Xin chào, tên tôi là Jill Bowen.
 Tôi là Giám đốc Dịch vụ Học sinh của Trường Công lập Bedford.
 Tôi là một cư dân và nhân viên suốt đời.
 Đây là năm thứ 31 của tôi tại Bedford.
 Tôi đã từng đảm nhiệm nhiều vị trí khác nhau như giáo viên, trưởng nhóm đánh giá, điều phối viên và bây giờ là vị trí này.
 Tôi có cả hai đứa con đã tốt nghiệp Trường Công lập Medford.
 Một người chọn con đường đại học, người kia chọn con đường sự nghiệp.
 Vì vậy, tôi thực sự vui mừng khi thấy tầm nhìn của trường trung học mới này và những gì nó có thể mang lại cho Medford và học sinh của chúng ta, đồng thời dựa trên những gì Laurie đã nói về việc mang lại sự công bằng và khả năng tiếp cận cho tất cả học sinh của chúng ta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Xin chào, tên tôi là Susan Carucci.
 Đây là năm thứ 27 của tôi.
 Thế là tôi cũng sinh ra và lớn lên vào tháng thứ ba đi học.
 Tôi không còn sống ở đây nữa nhưng tôi đã ở đây suốt sự nghiệp của mình.
 Tôi bắt đầu làm giáo viên, phó hiệu trưởng, lãnh đạo nhà trường, trợ lý hiệu trưởng trường tiểu học và bây giờ là phó hiệu trưởng tại Khoa Học thuật và Xây dựng tại Trường Brooks.
 Giống như bài viết của Marta, tôi rất vui được làm việc với tất cả các bạn trong lĩnh vực giảng dạy ở trường.
 Tôi nghĩ những người đến gặp Maria đều nói về điều đó.
 Bạn biết đấy, bố tôi là giám đốc dự án từ Tòa nhà K đến Tòa nhà 8.
 Vì vậy, tôi cảm thấy như mình đã trải nghiệm được một chút cả hai điều đó, nhưng tôi đã đủ may mắn rồi.
 Là một giáo viên tại trường McGlynn mới vào năm 2001, tôi rất thích xem quá trình này diễn ra với tư cách là một nhà giáo dục và là một phần của ngôi trường mới.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng vai trò quan trọng của tất cả chúng ta trong những quyết định lớn này sẽ ảnh hưởng đến các nhà giáo dục, học sinh, gia đình và cộng đồng của chúng ta là rất quan trọng đối với tôi.
 Hãy thực hiện điều này rất nghiêm túc.
 Tôi cảm thấy vinh dự khi được trở thành thành viên của nhóm và có thể làm việc với mọi người.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4322.786s">[Unidentified]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Chào buổi tối, Marissa Parkinson.
 Tôi cũng sinh ra trên cùng con phố ở Lawrence.
 Gia đình tôi và mẹ tôi vẫn còn ở đây, trên đường phố Tây Medford.
 Tôi bắt đầu học ở Medford.
 Tôi bắt đầu học ở trường Harvey.
 Tôi đã đi một con đường khác.
 Tôi đã kết thúc ở S.
 Ray và Kathy.
 Tôi là một người sùng đạo Công giáo, nhưng bạn biết đấy, tôi đã làm việc tại Johnny's Food Master ở Westlake.
 Công viên Duggar là công viên địa phương của tôi.
 Bạn biết đấy, tôi yêu trường học.
 Tôi yêu trẻ con.
 Tôi yêu giáo dục.
 Tôi đã làm việc trong ngành giáo dục được 30 năm.
 Điều đó thật đáng sợ vì lúc đó tôi khoảng 29 tuổi.
 Đây là câu trả lời yêu thích của tôi.
 Vì vậy, tôi đoán tôi phải điều chỉnh.
 Nhưng tôi rất hào hứng với ý nghĩa của nó: xây dựng một trường trung học mới cho Medford.
 Tôi biết khi tòa nhà này được xây dựng, nó giống như, bạn biết đấy, có lẽ giống như Taj Mahal.
 Đó là một ngôi trường đẹp.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, hơn 50 năm sau, chúng ta cần một cái gì đó mới mẻ.
 Tôi nghĩ học sinh của chúng tôi xứng đáng với điều đó.
 Chúng tôi có một chương trình nghề nghiệp tuyệt vời.
 Chúng tôi có những chương trình học tập tuyệt vời nhưng trong một tòa nhà rất cũ.
 Chúng tôi có một dự án Curtis House xinh đẹp nằm ở một cơ sở khác.
 Chúng tôi cung cấp các chương trình giáo dục mầm non và chương trình mầm non tuyệt vời cho nhân viên của chúng tôi tại đây.
 Chúng tôi thật may mắn khi có được những thứ này ở Medford.
 Tôi nghĩ Medford là một viên ngọc nhỏ.
 Việc có một trường trung học tiểu học mới sẽ giúp ích rất nhiều cho học sinh, cộng đồng và tương lai của cộng đồng chúng ta (cộng đồng nói chung).
 Tôi muốn trở thành một phần của quá trình và làm việc với mọi người ở đó cũng như trải qua những trải nghiệm khác nhau của mình.
 Thêm giọng nói của tôi vào tất cả các giọng nói đã có ở đây.
 Đối với Thị trưởng và Nghị viên Graham, đi vào hội đồng gồm 25 người này, có rất nhiều ứng cử viên rất có trình độ, chẳng hạn như một kỹ sư khác, một kỹ sư khác, một kiến ​​trúc sư khác.
 Nhưng để tiếp cận được nhóm người này,
 Những người tuyệt vời và tôi rất biết ơn.
 Tôi muốn cảm ơn Luke, người đã bắt đầu quá trình này với chúng tôi hai năm trước và tôi nghĩ, bạn biết đấy, đã tiếp tục và kiểm soát nó.
 Vì vậy, tôi mong chờ quá trình này và tôi thực sự hy vọng rằng chúng ta vẫn tích cực và lạc quan về những gì sẽ xảy ra.
 Thành viên Ramjani, tôi không biết liệu bạn có sẵn lòng chia sẻ thông tin về các bộ lọc với họ không.
 Bạn đã bắt được gì và nó thú vị như thế nào.
 Sẽ còn thú vị hơn nữa khi những người còn lại trong nhóm có được trải nghiệm tương tự.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4528.482s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: chắc chắn.
 Cảm ơn mọi người...
 Những lời nói đầy cảm xúc.
 Tôi muốn làm gì đó từ bây giờ đến 8 giờ tối.
 Tôi hứa chúng ta sẽ đi lúc 8 giờ.
 Nhưng để kiểm tra nhanh, có hai điều quan trọng.
 Một là tôi muốn bạn hiểu chuyện gì đang xảy ra.
 Cho đến nay và chúng ta đang ở đâu.
 Vì vậy tôi sẽ nói về điều này một chút.
 Chúng ta hãy trình diễn nhanh cách thực hiện việc này.
 Và trước khi ra ngoài tối nay, chúng ta sẽ thành lập một số tiểu ban nhất định để có thể nhanh chóng thực hiện công việc cần làm.
 Chúng ta sẽ thảo luận vấn đề này sau.
 Nhưng, Peter, sẽ tốt hơn nếu bạn có thể nói chuyện với tôi về bài phát biểu này.
 được rồi
 Bạn có thể bỏ qua một số trang nhất định.
 Chờ ở đó cho cái khác.
 chúng ta bắt đầu thôi.
 Chúng tôi bắt đầu vào tháng 2 và sau đó vào tháng 12, MSBA đã mời chúng tôi tham gia vòng loại.
 Chúng ta sẽ thảo luận về ý nghĩa của khoảng thời gian đủ điều kiện trong vài phút nữa.
 Đây là lời mời: Chúng tôi mời bạn tham gia vào quá trình này bắt đầu vào ngày 1 tháng 5.
 Vậy hãy bắt đầu vào ngày mai nhé.
 Tuy nhiên, ủy ban đã bổ nhiệm tôi làm chủ tịch ủy ban xây dựng vào tháng 2 và cho đến nay, nhiều việc đã được thực hiện.
 Một điều chúng ta phải làm là tìm tất cả, phải không?
 Vì vậy, trong bối cảnh cố gắng trình bày rõ ràng những gì chúng tôi với tư cách là một ủy ban nhà trường muốn ủy ban xây dựng này thực hiện, chúng tôi đã đưa ra một danh sách các mục tiêu.
 Còn rất nhiều mục tiêu khác, nhưng tôi muốn đặt nền móng cho việc này,
 Chúng ta phải làm gì tiếp theo.
 Năm đến bảy năm.
 Đầu tiên là kế hoạch toàn diện cho tất cả các chương trình hiện có trong khuôn viên Trường Trung học Medford, bao gồm giáo dục dạy nghề và phi dạy nghề từ lớp 9-12, thể thao từ lớp 9-12, Mạng lưới Gia đình Medford, các chương trình Trường Cộng đồng Medford, giáo dục mầm non, bao gồm nhưng không giới hạn ở Chương trình Giáo dục Sớm Medford (mà chúng tôi gọi là MEAP) và Góc Trẻ em.
 Vì vậy, có rất nhiều điều đang diễn ra trong tòa nhà này hơn những gì chúng ta tưởng tượng ở trường trung học.
 Vì vậy, đây là điều mà tất cả các bạn cần phải bắt đầu suy nghĩ.
 Thứ hai, nó là gì?
 Tôi có thể tìm thấy nó không?
 cảm ơn bạn
 Ồ vâng, tôi có thể chia sẻ các slide.
 Không, không, tôi có thể chia sẻ các slide.
 Có, tôi có thể chia sẻ tất cả các slide với bạn sau.
 Thứ hai là xem xét liệu việc đặt Trường Trung học Curtis-Tafts trong khuôn viên Medford có mang lại cơ hội giáo dục lớn hơn cho học sinh Curtis-Tafts hay không.
 Thứ ba, đảm bảo ý kiến ​​đóng góp mạnh mẽ của công chúng và phản hồi của các bên liên quan ở các mốc quan trọng thích hợp trong suốt dự án và tuân thủ các hướng dẫn của MSBA và hướng dẫn của Hội đồng Trường Medford.
 Lắng nghe ý kiến ​​của các nhà giáo dục và quản trị viên về những phương pháp thực hành tốt nhất dành cho sinh viên Medford và tương lai của các chương trình giáo dục.
 Điều này có nghĩa là chúng tôi quan tâm sâu sắc đến chức năng.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi muốn biết liệu những không gian này có phù hợp với học sinh và giáo viên trong tòa nhà hay không.
 Điều này thực sự quan trọng.
 Vâng, thứ năm, xây dựng kế hoạch xây dựng, nâng cao cách tiếp cận, các mục tiêu về khí hậu và đạt được tất cả các mục tiêu, đồng thời chỉ đạo chứng nhận phiên bản thứ năm để đạt được các mục tiêu của thỏa thuận khí hậu Paris vào năm 2030 và 2050, đồng thời hoàn thành quá trình xây dựng một cách hiệu quả và hiệu quả, đảm bảo học sinh có thể học tập trong tòa nhà mới càng sớm càng tốt.
 Lúc đó
 Đây là một nhiệm vụ khó khăn.
 Tốc độ nhanh nhất luôn được đo bằng năm chứ không phải tháng.
 Nhưng trong bối cảnh thành lập ủy ban này, ngay khi tôi được bổ nhiệm làm chủ tịch, chúng tôi đã phát động lời kêu gọi ứng tuyển, chúng tôi bắt đầu thu thập đơn đăng ký, và tất cả đều ở đó.
 Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn rất nhiều việc phải làm trong giai đoạn vòng loại mà chúng tôi đang bắt đầu.
 Chúng ta sẽ thảo luận vấn đề này sau.
 Nhưng bạn có thể chuyển sang slide tiếp theo.
 Đồ họa rất kém và chưa được khám phá kỹ trên trang web.
 Nhưng khi nói về toàn bộ quá trình, chúng ta vẫn còn sáu giờ mở hộp nữa.
 Vào ngày 1 tháng 5, chúng tôi sẽ nhập giai đoạn đủ điều kiện này vào hộp.
 Ở mỗi giai đoạn của quá trình,
 Chúng tôi phải được MSBA chấp thuận để đáp ứng tất cả các yêu cầu cho giai đoạn này.
 Phải có một ban giám đốc có thể bỏ phiếu để mời chúng tôi thực hiện bước tiếp theo.
 Vì vậy, tại bất kỳ thời điểm nào trong quá trình này, MSBA có thể nói rằng họ chưa sẵn sàng để tiếp tục.
 Họ cũng có thể nói: Chúng tôi không thích việc bạn đang làm.
 Họ cũng có thể nói, hãy quên nó đi.
 Vì vậy, công việc của chúng tôi là đảm bảo những điều này không xảy ra.
 Công việc của chúng tôi là tạo ra một sân chơi bình đẳng, phát triển toàn diện và tiến về phía trước càng nhanh càng tốt.
 Chà, hãy cho MSBA một cơ hội vì chúng tôi sẽ sẵn sàng đối đầu với họ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4847.483s">[Unidentified]</a>: chúng ta sẽ thấy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4849.904s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但这个资格期限持续 270 天。
 因此，到一月份我们必须完成资格阶段。
 我将谈谈这个阶段发生的事情。
 简而言之，除了资格阶段之外，当我们谈论建立项目团队时，这意味着引入我们所有者的项目经理。
 然后我们继续进行可行性研究。
 当人们想到我们在这个委员会所做的事情时，他们认为我们现在正在进行可行性研究。
 你认为我们正在做决定，我们正在建设吗？
 我们要更新吗？
 我们在哪里建设？
 你在场上吗？
 你在停车场吗？
 这将如何运作？
 我们还没有达到那个程度。
 所以告诉你所有的朋友，我们将到达那里并与专业人士合作。
 帮助我们对这座大楼需要做的事情进行评估。
 然后我们将继续进行方案设计，为项目融资。
 这就是我们作为社区投票资助该项目的地方。
 我无法强调它的重要性，但在实现这一目标之前我们还有很多工作要做。
 当这种情况发生时，我们将进入详细设计。
 所以我们把铲子放在地上。
 然后，在未来的某个时候，我们将完成该项目。
 所以这有点像坚果汤。
 我的目标是让我们一步步前进。
 我们将采取一切必要措施来满足资格期限。
 然后我们将继续前进。
 当我们接近下一阶段时，我们将开始讨论如何加快工作速度。
 但目前，我们的重点是资格。
 如果您可以翻到下一页，
 资格流程有自己的图表，您无法查看。
 因此，请继续观看下一张幻灯片。
 出色地。
 所以这个阶段需要做五件事。
 一是初步合规认证。
 这是一项法律协议，要求该市遵守 MSBA 流程。
 该协议已签署并交付给 MSBA。
 我们提前一天，我会承认这一点。
 谢谢市长和警长。
 我们正在路上。
 第二，我们必须组建建筑委员会。
 你们都在这里。
 学校委员会原定于 5 月 1 日开会，但现在是 4 月 30 日。
 我们做到了。
 该表格将很快发送至 MSBA。
 所以我们正在努力，并将很快发货。
 显然这是最简单的部分。
 这是文书工作。
 整个资格阶段涉及大量文书工作，但这是最简单的，我们会做并完成它。
 MSBA 必须批准我们的委员会。
 我们满足所有要求，因此 MSBA 对我们委员会的成员提出了各种各样的要求。
 我们与大家一起满足所有这些要求。
 现在让我们深入实际工作。
 还有三件事需要发生。
 其中之一就是所谓的教育背景。
 这是一份示范文件，它要求我们说：今天这座建筑里发生了什么？
 有多少间教室？
 有多少间数学教室？
 有多少临时空间？
 你们的剧院有多大？
 所有这些，对吗？
 这就是为什么他要求你描述这座大楼里目前正在发生的事情。
 它还要求您描述您对这座建筑未来的设想。
 因此，这就是关于柯蒂斯·塔夫茨的这些对话，这些关于幼儿期的对话变得非常非常重要。
 因为在我们的利益申报和资格阶段之间，教育背景将为所有建筑专业人员如何实际完成工作定下基调。
 因此，这将确定实现此构建所需的工作范围。
 所以在这个过程中现在已经做了很多工作。
 自二月份以来，我一直在与管理团队会面。
 我们每周见几次面。
 他们已经厌倦了我。
 他会厌倦我的。
 但我们开始做的一件事是：我们可以消除什么？
 这就是为什么该文件在以下方面写得很好：
 我们在这座大楼里做什么？
 所有教室都被统计在内。
 所有计划均已概述。
 就今天发生的事情而言，政府还有更多工作要做，才能准确描述这一点。
 另一件显然要复杂得多的事情是谈论我们将来要在这座大楼里做什么。
 因此，在这次谈话中，我们再次进行了非常广泛的谈话。
 我们一直在利用大脑的战略规划部分来提出重大问题。
 我将借用柯蒂斯·塔夫茨一分钟。
 我们已经讨论过我们的教育工作者是否认为这是我们应该考虑的事情，答案是肯定的，他们说是的，我们应该考虑一下。
 然后我们开始说：“好吧，那会是什么样子？”
 要求是。
 所以我们开始了这次对话，但这次对话超出了该委员会可以分析的范围，因为它有点涉及学校委员会的职责。
 因此，昨晚我提出了一项决议，要求我们的特殊教育和行为健康小组委员会（实际上由卢梭成员担任主席）在非常紧张的时间内举行会议，以收集意见和评论。
 关于这个非常有限的话题。
 柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学位于该校区对就读于柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学的学生的教育成果是否有任何好处？
 昨晚还有另一位梅德福居民发表了讲话。
 他在萨默维尔开展了一个非常类似的项目。
 他谈到了萨默维尔刚刚发生的这一转变以及它如何导致人口爆炸。
 对于那些需要另类环境的学生来说，它改变了游戏规则，让他们可以参加运动队等活动，在我们的例子中，是职业项目。
 所以这是一个巨大的机会，但是
 我们希望确保社区和委员会有机会思考他们可以贡献的一切并向该委员会提供建议。
 昨晚，这一情况已正式传达给特殊教育小组委员会。
 他们会见面的。
 他们将邀请现任员工、现任学生、校友、
 社区成员等，以及来自萨默维尔的 Jack Hevery 进行讨论并解决这个问题，并提出建议，让他们步入正轨并在 6 月中旬回来，这样他们还有很多工作要做，但这将帮助我们了解情况。
 我们对这所学校的想象的那一部分的写作。
 因为我们可能需要的不仅仅是大楼某处的几间教室。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨大学的成功部分在于其环境与拥有 1,200 名学生的庞大校园有很大不同。
 因此，我们必须仔细考虑如何将其组合在一起，但我们希望小组委员会所做的工作能够回到我们身边并得到传达。
 玛塔和查德将参加未来几周即将举行的学校委员会会议，玛塔将谈论她对替代方案的一些想法，以及这一切可能会是什么样子，即使是在短期内。
 这是必须纳入的内容。
 琼、苏珊娜、保罗和我昨天谈论了幼儿教育。
 我们的小学已经人满为患。
 我们将不得不在某个时候处理这​​个问题。
 MEEP 曾经在这里举办。
 我们将探讨一个案例，该案例表明 MEAP 应该回到这里，这可能是也可能不是我们着陆的地方，但这是我们正在探索的事情，因为现在是时候了。
 我们还谈论了很多关于没有接受过学前教育的学生以及他们何时进入我们公立学校的问题。
 对于这些学生来说，入学是多么具有挑战性。
 我们还讨论诸如等待名单有多大之类的问题？
 有多少来到我们这里的学生从未接触过任何类型的学前环境？
 我们需要什么样的能力来从这座大楼提供更广泛、更全面的幼儿教育项目？
 因为所有这些都必须包含在本文档中。
 所以，我们正在努力解决这个问题。
 因此，在这些事情发生的同时，到目前为止，在这个教育概况上已经做了很多工作。
 我们尚未涉及的教育概况的重要部分是沟通策略。
 我稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但在教育方面，我们的教育工作者必须做很多工作才能准备这份文件。
 我只是想让每个人都知道一切都在进行中。
 当我们进入下一次会议时，我们将展示这些文件，以便我们可以开始更广泛地阅读这些文件，寻求建议，并确保我们真正从各个角度考虑我们需要描述的内容。
 这就是我认为你们都发挥着非常重要作用的地方：
 我认为有必要根据我所知道的或基于我们对艺术项目或职业项目等的愿景，稍微不同地描述我们在这里所做的事情。
 这就是我们在教育概况中所处的位置。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨 (Curtis Tufts) 担任小组委员会成员。
 另一个重大的、创新的、不断变化的主题是 MEAP。
 MSBA 描述的社区中经常发生延误的原因是，他们必须做出有助于施工过程的非常重要的决定。
 我们可以合并两所学校吗？
 这显然有它自己的能量和它自己的一套要求，这使得它很难实现
 快点行动吧。
 因此，我们试图从大处着眼，因为这是一个独特的机会，可以以非常全面的方式思考该学区的真正需求，同时也可以尽快向前推进。
 因此，所有这些工作都正在进行中，并尽快向前推进。
 彼得，你可以转到下一张幻灯片吗？
 在专业方面也非常类似，因为我们有一个非常活跃的专业学校，所以我们还有另一个文件需要完成，那就是生存能力的第74章。
 第七十四章是专业设置条例的一章吧？
 出色地。
 这篇文章正在进行中。
 我们必须告诉他们，这是我们的计划。
 这是这些程序的功能。
 这是我们当前的注册和信息，例如我们的等候名单。
 我们还有机会描述这些计划的扩展计划。
 查德和彼得将在学校委员会中讨论扩张的潜力。
 这是学校委员会的问题，因为扩大的项目需要的不仅仅是一座建筑。
 需要设备。
 需要工作人员。
 因此，学校委员会必须对此进行评估。
 因此，该报告将于 5 月 20 日提交给学校委员会，并将有助于第 70 章表格的最终确定。
 这个小组也会仔细阅读并做好准备。
 本周晚些时候，市长、总监和我将与 MSBA 讨论这一难题，这实际上是城市规划信息。
 然后我们可以开始将信息输入到他们所谓的登记研究中。
 这有助于确定建筑物的大小。
 您可能已经听说过很多关于这座大楼是如何为 4,000 名学生建造的，但现在只有 1,200 名学生。
 4000到底是不是这个数字我不知道，但确实数字不一样。
 因此，MSBA 在资格阶段要做的事情之一就是，让我们为这么多学生建造一座大楼。
 这通常与今天大楼里发生的事情类似。
 然而，如果该市计划在开发中的住房方面进行重大扩张，他们会想知道所有这些。
 所以他们可以调整建筑物的大小，因为他们不希望我们建造一座立即耗尽容量的建筑物。
 他们也不希望我们建造一座永远不会住满的建筑。
 好的。
 所以，这是那里正在进行的工作的一部分。
 第四件事，维修文件。
 我们必须填写一份调查问卷，概述我们在整个地区的所有维护实践。
 所以这就像：他被重新投入使用了吗？
 你们的团队是如何训练的？
 大约有20个变量。
 该文件也处于起草阶段，正在尽快推进。
 我们可能会稍后在六月份讨论这个问题。
 考虑到我们已完成资格，我们需要做的最后一件事是确定可行性研究的资金，该资金可能在二十五万到二百五十万美元之间。
 我们还没有准备好，但我们正在制定计划。
 市长和我正在从财务工作组的角度制定该计划，以便能够根据需要尽快核算和管理这笔资金。
 对流程有疑问吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5700.456s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Tất nhiên là số năm, vậy khi nói ủy quyền địa phương, điều đó có nghĩa là cử tri không bỏ phiếu?
 Không.
 Bạn muốn nhận phần lớn nguồn tài trợ hay điều đó có nghĩa là thành phố đã xác định được toàn bộ nguồn tài trợ?
 Chính xác.
 Họ sẽ hoàn lại một phần, nhưng tôi nghĩ việc ủy ​​quyền phải là toàn bộ số tiền.
 Người phù hợp sẽ cho bạn biết số tiền hoàn lại của bạn sẽ dựa trên tình hình của chúng tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5724.632s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Chính xác.
 Về tính khả thi, nguồn tài trợ này phải chi trả toàn bộ chi phí nghiên cứu khả thi chứ không phải toàn bộ dự án mà chỉ nghiên cứu khả thi, tương đương với hai đến hai triệu rưỡi đô la.
 Thành phố sẽ trả trước toàn bộ chi phí nghiên cứu khả thi.
 Sau đó, khi MSBA chứng nhận tỷ lệ hoàn trả dự án của chúng tôi và chúng tôi thành công trong suốt quá trình, báo cáo nghiên cứu khả thi sẽ được hoàn trả theo tỷ lệ phần trăm được phân bổ cho chúng tôi.
 Vì vậy, họ sẽ sử dụng cùng một công thức và yêu cầu nghiên cứu khả thi và hoàn trả cho thành phố.
 Nhưng thành phố phải giải quyết vấn đề tiền bạc.
 Vậy điều phải xảy ra ở đây là,
 Chúng tôi có kế hoạch tài trợ cho việc đó.
 Vâng, chúng ta nên tử tế.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đang làm rất tốt việc đó và phải có một cuộc bỏ phiếu của Hội đồng Thành phố để cấp phép cho những khoản tiền đó và đặt chúng ở nơi nào đó mà chúng tôi có thể sử dụng.
 Nhưng
 Như tôi đã đề cập, tất cả việc này sẽ được hoàn thành vào tháng Giêng.
 Mỗi cái đều có một thời hạn cụ thể gắn liền với nó.
 Tôi sẽ nói với họ một cách rất tích cực rằng tôi muốn làm tất cả những điều này trước khi năm học bắt đầu vào năm tới.
 Nếu có thể, tôi muốn mọi việc được hoàn thành trước ngày 30 tháng 6.
 Đó là lý do tại sao chúng tôi luôn sát cánh cùng nhau, làm việc chăm chỉ và nỗ lực.
 Tôi nghĩ điều quan trọng là phải căng mình.
 Vì vậy, hãy căng thẳng và chuẩn bị.
 MSBA còn nhiều việc phải làm liên quan đến việc công nhận các chương trình học dự bị đại học và mọi thứ khác.
 Nhưng tôi hy vọng chúng ta có thể cung cấp cho họ mọi thứ họ cần để chúng ta có thể chuyển sang giai đoạn tiếp theo càng sớm càng tốt.
 Bạn có thắc mắc về việc lập kế hoạch?
 Xuất sắc.
 Vậy là chúng ta chỉ còn 20 phút.
 Để đạt được mục tiêu đó, chúng tôi đưa một loạt cuộc họp sắp tới của các tiểu ban vào cuối chương trình nghị sự.
 Có hai điều tôi hy vọng chúng ta cân nhắc và ưu tiên khi tiến tới giai đoạn đầu tiên này.
 Một trong số đó là Ủy ban Truyền thông và Gắn kết Cộng đồng.
 Tôi muốn có một loại tiểu ban nào đó, không quá bảy thành viên bỏ phiếu, nhưng là một nhóm quan tâm họp với tư cách là một tiểu ban để thực sự có thể phác thảo và mô tả quá trình gắn kết cộng đồng của chúng tôi.
 Tôi nghĩ tất cả chúng ta đều nhìn thấy mối lo ngại của mọi người trong cộng đồng: Liệu Medford có phá hỏng chuyện này không?
 Điều này sẽ làm việc?
 Liệu điều này có xảy ra không?
 Vì vậy bạn cần phải tạo dựng nhiều mối liên hệ trong cộng đồng.
 Chúng ta bắt đầu càng sớm thì về cuối chúng ta sẽ càng thành công hơn.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ đó là một cuộc trò chuyện rộng rãi hơn vì theo tôi, chúng tôi cũng có một số hội đồng và ủy ban.
 Nhiều người trong số họ quan tâm đến dự án này.
 Vì vậy, cần phải thực hiện một số liên hệ để hiểu thời điểm và cách thức họ tham gia để chúng ta có thể đưa nó vào quy hoạch tổng thể trong tương lai.
 Nhóm thứ hai tôi muốn thành lập tối nay là Ủy ban Nội quy và Công ty.
 Như Janelle đã nói, chúng ta cần có một số quy tắc về cách thức hoạt động của điều này, đặc biệt là trong sự tham gia của công chúng, nhưng chỉ nói chung thôi.
 Tôi hy vọng rằng ủy ban này sẽ được giới hạn về mặt thời gian.
 Tôi mong rằng các bạn có thể họp lại một lần và đưa bản thảo lên nhóm này để chúng ta có thể áp dụng các quy định và quản lý từ đó.
 Và Ủy ban thứ ba sẽ không họp sớm, nhưng sẽ họp,
 Bạn biết đấy, sẽ có một tiểu ban tài chính vào cuối tháng 6, vì vậy đây sẽ là một ủy ban thường trực sẽ họp trong suốt vòng đời của dự án và tiếp tục.
 Điều quan trọng cần nhớ là khi đến thời điểm, cộng đồng sẽ phải bỏ phiếu.
 Ủy ban này không phải là nơi để làm công việc này.
 Vì vậy, nếu chúng ta đang nói về việc loại trừ nợ mà cuối cùng là cần thiết để tài trợ cho dự án, thì ủy ban này không nên phê duyệt việc loại trừ nợ.
 Trên thực tế, điều đó không thể xảy ra ở đây.
 Nó phải xảy ra bên ngoài nhóm này.
 Vì vậy, ủy ban tài chính này, tôi nghĩ đó là quan điểm và cái nhìn sâu sắc về những thứ như
 Mua sắm, mua sắm từ người quản lý dự án của chủ sở hữu, kiến ​​trúc sư của chúng tôi, những thứ tương tự.
 Và cũng giúp chúng ta hiểu được chúng ta cần những gì để đạt được khả năng tồn tại?
 Có những chi phí nào khác mà chúng tôi nên xem xét không?
 Vì vậy, có một số công việc tài chính phải được thực hiện, mặc dù tôi không mong đợi cuộc họp nhóm sẽ diễn ra vào cuối tháng 5.
 Vì vậy, chúng ta sẽ nói nhiều hơn về Quy tắc trật tự của Robert và mọi thứ khác trong cuộc họp tiếp theo.
 Tôi biết mọi người đang nhìn tôi như thể làm ơn đừng nói vậy nữa.
 Vì vậy tôi đoán điều tôi quan tâm là liệu có ai đó nghe về những chủ đề này và nói rằng tôi thực sự muốn tham gia hay không.
 Bạn có thể nhận ra một trong những tiểu ban này không?
 Tôi cũng lịch sự khuyên ban giám hiệu nhà trường hãy hết sức chú ý vì bạn có việc phải làm để chuẩn bị cho phần còn lại của những gì chúng tôi vừa mô tả.
 Bạn được chào đón 100%.
 Hãy tham gia, nhưng chúng tôi sẽ cần bạn đến gặp ủy ban nhà trường.
 Chúng tôi cần John và Peter giúp chúng tôi thực hiện các kế hoạch bảo trì này, v.v.
 Vì vậy, nếu ai đó quan tâm đến bất kỳ chủ đề nào khác, ủy ban không thể lớn như mức cần thiết nhưng có thể lớn như chúng tôi nghĩ để có thể thực hiện được công việc.
 Vì thế tôi đặt các tiểu ban này vào lịch của mình.
 Những buổi tối này chúng ta sẽ gặp nhau hoàn toàn qua Zoom, chỉ để giúp mọi việc dễ dàng hơn một chút.
 Mỗi bên sẽ có một kết quả rất cụ thể được đưa ra tại cuộc họp tiếp theo vào ngày 13/5, đó là đưa ra dự thảo đề xuất.
 Có tình nguyện viên không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6100.412s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Đúng.
 cho 2 người còn lại.
 Có bao nhiêu được chỉ định?
 Nó có quan trọng không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6105.859s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tôi nghĩ có thể là bao nhiêu người cũng được.
 Số lượng thành viên biểu quyết không quá bảy.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ nếu chúng ta loại bỏ toàn bộ nhân viên của trường thì tôi cũng không quá lo lắng rằng chúng ta sẽ rơi vào tình trạng như vậy.
 Nhưng tôi quan tâm nhiều hơn đến những người làm những việc mà họ cảm thấy phù hợp với công việc họ làm, công việc họ yêu thích.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Maria.
 Giao tiếp.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Tracy.

 Xuất sắc.

 Marisa.
 Xuất sắc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6146.461s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Ý tôi là, tôi có thể đặt hai cái vào đó và xem liệu thế có đủ không.
 Tôi sẽ tập trung vào giao tiếp hoặc tài chính.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6154.444s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Tôi sẽ đưa bạn vào lĩnh vực tài chính.
 Nó nghe như thế nào?
 Có vẻ tốt.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6162.107s">[Unidentified]</a>: ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6165.55s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Fiona ở đâu?
 tài chính.
 Chúng tôi cũng có thể xin tài trợ từ Bob không?
 Xuất sắc.
 Vâng, vâng, hoàn toàn có.
 Có ai quan tâm đến các ủy ban này không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6182.816s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Nếu bạn không thể có đủ kinh phí, tôi sẽ gọi cho bạn.
 Tất cả đều ổn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6186.4s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tôi sẽ đưa bạn vào danh sách.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6188.182s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Hãy nghĩ về tôi như một nhà tài chính.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6192.886s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Quy tắc và hội nhập có hai người.
 đó là sự thật
 Tôi đã định tham gia tất cả các ủy ban, nhưng đây là điều đúng đắn nên làm.
 Có lẽ chúng ta có thể mời Emily Lazzaro ngồi vào Tiểu ban Quy tắc và Hợp nhất.
 Sau đó tôi sẽ hỏi ý kiến ​​anh ấy.
 Tôi cũng mời Nicole Morel tham gia Tiểu ban Truyền thông.
 Vậy hãy nói chuyện với họ.
 Nhưng có ai khác cảm thấy mạnh mẽ về điều này?
 Bạn muốn đi đâu?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6227.321s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Tôi có thể giao tiếp.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6230.024s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Lớn, lớn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6232.21s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: À, tôi định nói là tài chính, nhưng tôi thực sự không có nhiều kinh nghiệm trong lĩnh vực đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6235.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi ổn.
 John?
 Không, bạn vẫn còn việc phải làm.
 Ồ, chắc chắn rồi.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng đối với tất cả các huấn luyện viên thực sự trong đội
 Trước khi chúng ta đi sâu vào vấn đề này, sẽ có một tổ chuyên trách đưa ra yêu cầu đề xuất cho chủ dự án.
 Đây không phải là kinh nghiệm của tôi.
 Đó không phải lý do tôi ở đây.
 Vì vậy, theo thời gian, chúng tôi sẽ dựa vào mọi người để thành lập các tiểu ban khác nhau.
 Từ góc độ cá nhân, tôi nghĩ chúng ta nên bắt đầu từ đây.
 Điều đó có ý nghĩa không?
 Có ai có đề xuất nào khác về điều gì đó cần phải xảy ra càng sớm càng tốt không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Tôi có một câu hỏi.
 chắc chắn.
 Bạn đã đề cập rằng Curtis có thể đến đây với tất cả các mục đích sử dụng khác nhau cho cơ sở này.
 Ai đang khám phá những lựa chọn này?
 Giống như giáo dục cộng đồng, có thể làm việc tại một trường cao đẳng cộng đồng, các lớp học buổi tối, như tôi hy vọng được làm tại Hiệp hội các nhà thầu tổng hợp AGC, nơi cung cấp giáo dục cho người lớn.
 Có ai thích nó không?
 Đưa ra rất nhiều phương án mà bạn muốn cân nhắc hoặc ý tưởng của bạn là gì?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Có, ít nhiều, ít nhiều không, nhưng không hoàn toàn.
 Chúng tôi vẫn chưa ở đó.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ sẽ hợp lý nếu thêm điều này sau khi chúng ta vượt qua được cảm giác đỏ mặt ban đầu ở Chương 74.
 Vì vậy, khi chúng ta bắt đầu đọc những tài liệu này, tôi nghĩ đã đến lúc phải nói: Chúng ta nên đề phòng ai nữa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Bởi vì tất cả những điều này đều có tác động
 Bạn biết đấy, khả năng tiếp cận, khoảng cách, quy mô cơ sở so với các cơ sở khác, không gian lưu trữ, bãi đậu xe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6343.879s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Vâng, tôi nghĩ đó là một ý tưởng tốt.
 Tôi sẽ đưa nó vào danh sách.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6350.581s">[Unidentified]</a>: Trên thực tế, chúng tôi bị giới hạn bởi thành phố.
 Họ là
 Nếu mọi người trong phòng đều nói: Trung tâm Giải trí Bedford nên ở đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6365.68s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Nhưng trường học cộng đồng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6367.861s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6375.31s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Xuất sắc.
 Vâng, tôi muốn hỏi, ai sẽ cung cấp một số loại cơ sở hạ tầng kỹ thuật số cho ủy ban này?
 Vì vậy tôi sẽ đề cập đến SOI.
 Có SOI.
 Có những nghiên cứu đang xem xét Fed.SOI.
 Có thể có một loạt các tài liệu công khác thực sự không được công bố rộng rãi nhưng đáng ra phải có.
 Bạn biết đấy, Tiểu ban Truyền thông Gắn kết Cộng đồng này sẽ chịu trách nhiệm:
 Có thể giao tiếp điều tương tự với nhiều người, điều này được thực hiện hiệu quả nhất thông qua một trang web (có thể thông qua một kho lưu trữ chung) và chắc chắn là có thể thực hiện được giao tiếp bên ngoài.
 Ví dụ: trên một cổng thông tin, như một trang web, giống như mọi trường học có các dự án này và sau đó là một loại kho lưu trữ phụ trợ nơi Sheldon có thể xem SOI.
 Các thành viên trong danh sách truy cập có thể sử dụng nó bất cứ lúc nào.
 chắc chắn.
 Tất cả những gì cần là tài nguyên.
 Tôi có thể cung cấp cho bạn một bản cập nhật.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Chúng tôi có điều đó.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đã nhận được một URL duy nhất từ ​​hội đồng, đó là buildmhs.org.
 Vì thế?
 Xuất sắc.
 Do đó, URL tồn tại.
 Trang này tồn tại.
 Trên thực tế, Thomas đang nghiên cứu cấu trúc tài nguyên cơ bản của cộng đồng này.
 Lý do chúng tôi yêu cầu mọi người cung cấp tiểu sử và ảnh là vì tất cả chúng sẽ được xuất bản trên trang web, vì vậy anh ấy đang xử lý tất cả những điều đó với tư cách là giám đốc truyền thông.
 Tom đã đồng ý rằng, mặc dù anh ấy là Giám đốc Truyền thông sắp mãn nhiệm nhưng anh ấy sẽ tiếp tục tập trung vào dự án này cho đến khi chúng tôi thuê được người kế nhiệm.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ Thomas và một số sinh viên giáo dục nghề nghiệp của chúng tôi đang xây dựng trang web này dưới sự hướng dẫn của Lisa Miller.
 Và liệu có thành phần tài liệu nào mà tất cả những tài liệu này sẽ được cung cấp cho công chúng khi có ai đó hỏi, ở đâu không?
 Chúng tôi có thể giới thiệu một địa điểm cho bạn.
 Tất cả biên bản cuộc họp của chúng tôi sẽ ở đó.
 Tất cả chương trình họp của chúng ta sẽ ở đó.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đã có sẵn cả một cơ cấu để cố gắng thực hiện điều đó.
 Chúng tôi vẫn chưa sẵn sàng, nhưng tôi hy vọng chúng tôi có thể ghé thăm bạn trong cuộc họp tiếp theo.
 trang web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Được rồi, bước tiếp theo là đưa cánh cửa ra bên ngoài.
 Lưng của bạn thế nào rồi?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Vì vậy, đây là một vấn đề phức tạp vì nó thực sự chưa kết thúc đối với chúng tôi theo luật hội họp mở.
 Sau khi lịch trình được công bố, tất cả tài liệu của lịch trình đó sẽ trở thành một phần của hồ sơ công khai.
 Nếu chúng ta làm vậy, điều khó khăn là, nếu chúng ta làm việc lén lút, rất có thể chúng ta đang vi phạm luật họp công khai.
 Do đó, quản trị viên có bản sao làm việc của tài liệu họ đang làm việc và không đại diện cho số đại biểu và có thể tiếp tục làm như vậy.
 Sau khi tài liệu đến đây, chúng sẽ được đặt trên một ổ đĩa công khai.
 Nói về chỉnh sửa tài liệu, không có chỉnh sửa ngoại tuyến trên diễn đàn này.
 Luật pháp không cho phép tụ tập công cộng.
 Thật không may, chúng ta đang ngồi đây để cùng nhau chỉnh sửa một tài liệu.
 Đây thực sự là một trong những phần đau đớn nhất khi quản lý quá trình này mà tất cả các bạn đã đăng ký, xin lỗi.
 Nhưng vâng, điều đó rất khó khăn, nhưng ngoại tuyến, kiểu chỉnh sửa ngoại tuyến hoạt động rất tốt ở bất kỳ nơi nào khác trên thế giới, không phải là một lựa chọn ở đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Được rồi, không có Google Drive hoặc chia sẻ tài liệu.
 Mọi thứ sẽ được phát hành.
 Chúng sẽ xuất hiện trên trang web khi chúng được xuất bản.
 Khi chúng xuất hiện trên trang web, về cơ bản chúng là các biện pháp kiểm soát cấu hình và không thể thay đổi nếu không đảo ngược những thay đổi đó tại đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Chính xác.
 Vâng, nó thật khủng khiếp.
 Đúng.
 Điều này thực sự khủng khiếp.
 Chúng tôi đã tìm ra cách để làm điều đó.
 Không đáng sợ bằng, nhưng bạn biết đấy, thật không may, nó không còn đáng sợ nữa.
 Điều này chắc chắn sẽ khiến cộng đồng gặp rắc rối về cách sửa đổi tài liệu.
 Và sẽ có, khi chúng ta làm điều đó, tôi sẽ thấy rằng những cuộc họp này trên Zoom sẽ hiệu quả hơn.
 Bạn có thể ngồi ở nơi bạn muốn và mọi người có thể xem tài liệu đã được sửa đổi như thế nào và không thể có biểu mẫu
 Ý tưởng chỉnh sửa tài liệu mà không tiết lộ những gì đang xảy ra.
 Vì vậy chúng ta phải hết sức cẩn thận trong vấn đề này.
 Nhưng vâng, đó là một quá trình.
 Thật lạ là cách này hoạt động đối với GraphDoc.
 Tôi có thể thấy tính năng này hoạt động để xuất bản tài liệu.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: Không. Đây không phải là GraphDoc.
 Chúng tôi hiểu rằng nhiều bạn đang làm việc.
 Chúng tôi đang tranh cãi.
 Chúng tôi là một tập thể chung, trẻ, được chia sẻ.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Đây là điều đáng suy nghĩ.
 Vâng, vâng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: Tôi đã nói chuyện với từng người trong văn phòng vào mùa thu năm ngoái.
 Đó là thời kỳ.
 Thế là chúng tôi đã có một cuộc điện thoại dài.
 Tổng cộng có 40 thành viên.
 Một thành viên cho biết: Simon chỉ đề cập đến điều này trong tài liệu và đọc bình luận của chúng tôi ở đó.
 Trên thực tế, chúng tôi đã ghép chúng lại với nhau.
 Câu trả lời là không.
 Sau đó bạn có thể viết đánh giá của bạn.
 Tôi trả lời rằng bạn bảy tuổi.
 Họ nói, được rồi, hãy thừa nhận điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: Chúng tôi chỉ cảm thấy nó.
 Có vẻ như tất cả chúng ta đều đồng ý rằng điều này có thể nguy hiểm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Đúng.
 Cảm ơn một lần nữa vì đã ở đây.
 Tôi cũng quan tâm đến khía cạnh liên lạc và mặc dù những buổi tối này tôi không làm việc nhưng tôi vẫn vui vẻ nhận một số cuộc gọi.
 Họ sẽ quay lại đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tất cả những cập nhật này sẽ quay trở lại đây.
 Bạn có thể trả lời bất kỳ câu hỏi nào khác về tiểu ban hoặc chương trình nghị sự không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Tôi có một câu hỏi về việc bỏ phiếu.
 Vâng, khi chúng tôi bỏ phiếu đồng ý, chúng tôi không ở trong tình trạng mà tôi chưa bao giờ hiểu: quyền lực có quyền.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Không.
 Không, không phải vậy.
 Chính quyền có được phép vào cuộc họp không?
 Không, bạn không thể đưa phiếu bầu của mình cho người khác.
 Làm xong chúng ta hãy tập vote vì phải vote mới xong.
 Thông thường, điều này xảy ra trong cái gọi là bỏ phiếu bằng giọng nói, trong đó mọi người nói "có" và sau đó chúng tôi bắt đầu.
 Hãy tập lăn vì nó
 Một lần nữa, kỳ lạ và kỳ lạ, vì vậy chúng ta sẽ kết thúc nó như thế này.
 Nhưng còn câu hỏi nào khác trước khi chúng ta kết thúc không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: Tôi cẩn thận.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Nhưng tôi nghĩ một điều đáng nói nữa là có rất nhiều thành viên không có quyền biểu quyết trong ủy ban này.
 Lý do cho điều này không phải vì chúng tôi không muốn nghe ý kiến ​​của bạn.
 Bạn ở đây vì chúng tôi muốn nghe ý kiến ​​của bạn.
 Khi chúng tôi bỏ phiếu, tên của bạn sẽ không được gọi và bạn sẽ không bỏ phiếu.
 Nhưng hơn thế nữa, bạn là thành viên chính thức của ủy ban này.
 họ đã cảnh báo tôi
 Khi có nhiều thành viên biểu quyết, việc kinh doanh trở nên rất khó khăn vì cần phải có đủ số đại biểu để họp và làm ăn.
 Mọi chuyện trở nên rất, rất phức tạp.
 Vì vậy, điều chúng tôi đang nói là: chúng tôi muốn có một ủy ban lớn, nhưng chúng tôi cũng cần có khả năng tiến lên một cách hiệu quả và hiệu quả, v.v.
 Đây là lý do đằng sau nó.
 Chúng ta đã làm gì ở đó?
 Tôi nghĩ rằng quy mô hoa hồng chắc chắn sẽ thay đổi trong suốt cuộc đời của anh ấy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Vậy là 25?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Đúng, có 15 thành viên có quyền biểu quyết trong ủy ban, đây vẫn là một số lượng thành viên có quyền biểu quyết tốt.
 Chúng tôi sẽ sớm thực hành bỏ phiếu.
 Nhưng còn câu hỏi nào khác cho cuộc họp tiếp theo không?
 Quy tắc, quy tắc và hợp nhất vào ngày 7 tháng 5.
 Cộng đồng tham gia vào ngày 8/5 và sẽ mang kết quả về cho nhóm vào ngày 13/5.
 Vì vậy, tại cuộc họp của chúng tôi vào ngày 13 tháng 5, đa số sẽ xem xét những khuyến nghị này và đồng ý về những kế hoạch này.
 Chúng tôi đang ở chế độ khởi động lại.
 Sau đó, chúng ta sẽ đi sâu vào phần cốt lõi của một số tài liệu mà chính phủ đã nghiên cứu và bắt đầu đọc cũng như thảo luận về nội dung của chúng.
 Đại loại là vậy, nhưng hãy tiếp tục với nó.
 Chúng tôi tạo ra chương trình họp.
 Vì những lý do hợp lý chúng ta sẽ gặp nhau trực tiếp tại triển lãm nếu có thể, giá là 89 RMB.
 Từ nay đến hết tháng 6.
 Tôi hứa chúng ta sẽ quay lại vào các tối thứ Hai đầu năm học sau, nhưng từ nay đến cuối tháng 6, giữa các buổi họp hội đồng nhà trường và những ngày nghỉ lễ, hoàn toàn không thể giữ đúng lịch trình đó được.
 Chúng tôi sẽ chỉ gặp nhau qua Zoom trong mùa hè và trên thực tế, chúng tôi sẽ chuyển các cuộc họp sang thứ Tư.
 Vì đang là Thứ Hai và Thứ Sáu trong mùa hè nên thật khó để có đủ số đại biểu để làm điều gì đó.
 Hy vọng chúng tôi có thể làm được điều đó, nhưng tôi cố gắng giữ lịch họp nhẹ nhàng.
 Tôi nghĩ cuối tháng 8 sẽ có thêm các tiểu ban, nhưng đây mới chỉ là khởi đầu cho việc mọi người cố gắng sắp xếp lại cuộc sống bận rộn của mình.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: Đúng.
 Vì vậy, có hai điều.
 Tuy nhiên, đây là một câu hỏi gián tiếp.
 Nếu bạn không thể làm điều đó,
 Được rồi, vui lòng chia sẻ quan điểm của bạn bằng cách gửi email cho chúng tôi suy nghĩ và nhận xét của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Thực ra đây là một vấn đề kỹ thuật.
 Một người đàn ông không thể tham dự cuộc họp sẽ gửi email cho bạn với những suy nghĩ và đề xuất của anh ấy, thậm chí có thể là một quyết định.
 Trước đây, chúng tôi nghe nói rằng email là một ý tưởng tồi đối với hầu hết mọi thứ ngoại trừ cài đặt chương trình làm việc.
 Điều này nghe có vẻ giống như một vùng màu xám.
 Tôi tự hỏi liệu bạn có bỏ lỡ một cuộc họp công khai nơi hai điều này xung đột hay không.
 Nó hoạt động như thế nào?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Vì vậy, tôi có thể nói với bạn rằng, tôi nghĩ bất kỳ luật sư nào cũng sẽ nói với bạn rằng đừng bao giờ viết bất cứ điều gì.
 Đây là nơi chúng ta bắt đầu.
 Không bao giờ viết bất cứ điều gì bằng văn bản.
 Điều đó nói lên rằng, nếu bạn định viết điều gì đó,
 Giống như trong trường hợp này, vâng, đó là một vùng màu xám.
 Điều bạn nên làm là liên hệ với ai đó và nói, này, tôi có thể gửi cho bạn ý tưởng của mình không?
 Bạn đã nói về những điều này với ai khác hay bạn có dự định làm điều đó chưa?
 Bạn có thể chắc chắn một cách hợp lý rằng bạn có một vòng lặp khép kín, phải không?
 Đó là những gì bạn đã nói với tôi, tôi có thể gửi cho bạn ý kiến ​​của tôi được không?
 Tôi nói có.
 Tôi đã nói, tôi sẽ không nói chuyện với bất kỳ ai khác về những vấn đề này, vì vậy chúng tôi sẽ ổn thôi.
 Điều này chỉ trở thành vấn đề nếu bạn kết nối với một số người đại diện cho đa số ủy ban.
 Ví dụ: nếu bạn nói: Ý tôi là hai người vì tôi không chắc ai sẽ có mặt tại cuộc họp, điều đó không sao cả vì bạn chưa đến tám tuổi.
 Sau khi nói chuyện với chính mình, bao gồm cả tám người, bạn đang gặp rắc rối.
 Vậy thì bạn đang vi phạm Đạo luật về các cuộc họp mở.
 Điều khó khăn là mọi người tham gia đều phải có sự hiểu biết giống như người tham gia vào cuộc trò chuyện này.
 Tôi đang thiếu gì?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: Tôi đã bỏ lỡ điều đó trong bài viết về chiếc hộp.
 Bạn có thể rất có chủ ý.
 Tôi chỉ nói với bạn là cứ đi đi, haha.
 Nếu bạn làm như vậy, tất cả chúng ta đều sẽ vi phạm pháp luật, bất kể chúng ta làm gì để tránh vi phạm pháp luật.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ điều đó áp dụng cho tất cả những công dân tuân thủ pháp luật.
 Cân nhắc nối tiếp không quan tâm đến bất cứ điều gì, không phải về nội dung, không phải về quy hoạch, không phải về bảo hiểm.
 Chỉ có hai chúng ta thôi phải không?
 Bạn đi và vi phạm nó.
 Tôi đã vi phạm rất nhiều luật.
 Kể cả khi tôi không biết
 Được, được.
 Vâng, đó là vấn đề của tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mọi người đều được chỉ định một địa chỉ email của Trường Công lập Medford và tôi khuyên bạn không nên sử dụng email cá nhân của mình cho bất kỳ hoạt động kinh doanh nào liên quan đến MSBA trong bất kỳ trường hợp nào.
 Khi những email này được thiết lập, chúng tôi sẽ chuyển đổi mọi thứ.
 Nhưng tôi khuyên bạn không nên sử dụng email cá nhân của mình vì bất kỳ lý do gì.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: Điều này làm cho việc tuân thủ hồ sơ công cộng dễ dàng hơn.
 Tôi là nhân viên truy cập hồ sơ của khu học chánh.
 Ngoại trừ điểm số cá nhân của bạn, mọi tài liệu chính thức từ trường đều là hồ sơ công khai và phải tự động có sẵn hoặc ít nhất có thể xem lại theo yêu cầu.
 Vì vậy, thực hiện tất cả những điều này trong địa chỉ email của Trường Công lập Medford, Google Pack của Trường Công lập Medford nơi bạn có thể ghi chú và mọi thứ thực sự hữu ích để đưa mọi thứ vào không gian đó.
 Đừng chia sẻ nó với người khác.
 Đừng gửi email dự thảo của bạn.
 Đây không phải là nơi để viết ghi chú cá nhân.
 được rồi
 Chúng tôi không bao gồm bất cứ ai theo nghĩa này.
 Quả thực là đúng.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7198.191s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Có câu hỏi cuối cùng nào không?
 Bây giờ là ngày 8.03.
