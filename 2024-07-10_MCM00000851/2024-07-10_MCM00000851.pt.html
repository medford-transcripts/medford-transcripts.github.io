    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=0.391s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Bem-vindos a todos.
 Estamos aqui.
 Nós fizemos isso.
 Isso é realmente emocionante.
 Obrigado a todos por terem vindo.
 Tal como planeado para esta noite, partiremos às oito.
 Partimos antes das oito.
 Vou mudar um pouco a agenda porque Janelle da KP Law está aqui para hospedar uma reunião aberta de treinamento jurídico.
 Então, vamos pular as introduções por enquanto.
 então Janelle pode fazer uma reunião aberta durante o treinamento porque ela tem um compromisso para a segunda metade desta reunião.
 Então, eu queria ter certeza de que havia tempo suficiente para ela fazer isso.
 Mas antes de fazer isso, vou fazer uma rápida chamada para que, para que conste, saibamos quem está aqui.
 Jenny Graham aqui.
 Prefeito Lungo-Koehn?</p>

 Aqui.
 Libby Brown?
 Aqui.
 Marissa Desmond, Maria Dorsey, Brian Hilliard.
 Ele está ausente.
 Tracy Keene e Emily Lazzaro estão ausentes.
 Ele tem uma reunião do conselho esta noite.
 Nicole Morell está ausente.
 Ela teve um conflito anterior.
 Hum, Aaron está dando uma festa aqui.
 Luke Prisner, Larry Brown, Bob Dickinson.
 Ele não está aqui esta noite.
 Fiona Maxwell.
 Joan Bowen, Thomas Dalton, Chad Fallon estão vindo, eu acho, Lori Hodgton, Don McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau e Philip Santos não estão lá esta noite.
 Ele também teve uma conferência.
 Portanto, temos um quórum.
 Em apenas alguns minutos você aprenderá por que isso é importante.
 Mas vou entregá-lo a Janelle em apenas um segundo.
 Mas acho que começarei dizendo que todas as nossas reuniões estão sujeitas à lei de reuniões abertas.
 E com quatro anos de experiência no setor de reuniões abertas, é uma maneira muito complicada de realizar o trabalho.
 Então, vou apenas dizer que essa é minha experiência pessoal.
 Está lá por uma razão.
 É absolutamente necessário, mas exigirá que todos vocês pensem cuidadosamente não apenas sobre o que dizem e fazem na reunião, mas, mais importante ainda, como se comportam fora de nossas reuniões, porque
 Sem perceber, você pode entrar em conflito com a lei de reuniões abertas.
 O MSB exige que conduzamos todas as nossas reuniões de acordo com a lei de reuniões abertas.
 Então pensamos que era importante que todos tivessem algum tipo de base em tudo isso.
 Os representantes eleitos presentes na sala estão obviamente familiarizados com a lei das reuniões abertas e podem orientar qualquer pessoa que tenha dúvidas.
 Acabei de inscrevê-los para isso.
 Eu diria aos educadores presentes que eles geralmente interagem com o comitê escolar o tempo todo.
 E geralmente você não está sujeito à lei de reuniões abertas, mas nesta sala e nesta questão você está.
 Portanto, é apenas uma espécie de ajuste do seu conjunto de responsabilidades dessa forma.
 Então vou passar para Janelle.
 Janelle, por favor, diga-nos se deseja fazer perguntas durante o processo ou se deseja que guardemos nossas perguntas até terminar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=186.9s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3218.41s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Ok, então chegamos bem na hora.
 Voltaremos a algumas apresentações.
 Este é um grupo grande.
 Somos 25 no total.
 Temos alguns membros que não podem estar aqui esta noite e eles me avisaram com antecedência para que possamos conversar.
 Mas eu esperava que pudéssemos circular pela sala e você pudesse se apresentar e falar muito brevemente sobre como você vê seu papel no comitê e ter certeza de que
 todos na sala poderão conhecê-lo se você tiver uma função oficial em escolas onde talvez não o tenham conhecido antes.
 Então, Peter, você quer começar?
 Claro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3254.994s">[Unidentified]</a>: Boa noite a todos.
 Meu nome é Peter Cushing, Superintendente Adjunto de Enriquecimento, Inovação e Operações das Escolas Públicas Americanas.
 reparo de telhado verde, instalação de caldeira e ajuda na elaboração de um SOI para um projeto que começou há cerca de duas semanas em West Chester, Massachusetts.
 Então estou muito feliz por fazer parte desse time que vai ajudar a construir o futuro do Metrô.
 Meu nome é John LeBlanc.
 Sou Diretor de Edifícios e Terrenos.
 Estarei comemorando 38 anos trabalhando nas Escolas Públicas do Metrô.
 Estou ansioso por isso.
 Eu estava no laboratório de ciências quando fizemos o laboratório de ciências do MSBA do ensino médio.
 Eu estava no projeto petrolífero na Medford High School.
 Quando fizemos isso, foi outro projeto MSBA.
 Estou ansioso para trazer minha vasta experiência para a mesa a longo prazo para nos ajudar de alguma forma que possamos avançar.
 Boa noite a todos.
 Meu nome é Thomas Dalton.
 Sou o diretor cessante de comunicações dos Serviços Públicos Metropolitanos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3335.777s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Polegares para baixo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3338.48s">[Unidentified]</a>: Mas agora à sua disposição.
 Sou um profissional de comunicação com carreira no governo estadual e local.
 Mas quando eu ainda morava em Stoneham, minha cidade natal, também servi como membro do comitê escolar em Stoneham.
 Durante esse período, iniciamos o processo com o MSBA para a inauguração da nova Stonewall Middle School em setembro.
 Em particular, este período do processo MSBA parece-me muito familiar.
 Eu estava servindo como membro do comitê escolar durante esse período.
 Estou certamente muito entusiasmado com todas as oportunidades que teremos de colaborar com o estado para reunir muitas contribuições locais realmente boas.
 É realmente emocionante.
 Olá pessoal.
 Meu nome é Pablo Russo.
 Faço parte do comitê de membros da escola.
 Este é meu sétimo ano.
 Devo dizer que estou bastante impressionado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3399.517s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Boa noite.
 Meu nome é Tracy Keene.
 Moro em Medford há 12 anos.
 Trabalho profissionalmente como gerente sênior de teatro e instalações, supervisionando as operações diárias de um centro de artes cênicas em um campus público.
 Atualmente faço parte de uma equipe que está construindo um novo teatro do outro lado do rio, em Austin.
 A primeira pedra foi há apenas alguns meses, algumas semanas atrás.
 Então trago algumas operações diárias, instalações e gerenciamento de recursos.
 Meu nome é Maria Dorsey.
 Eu trabalho aqui na Mead High School como bibliotecária escolar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3443.751s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Estou em escolas há 28 anos.
 Moro em Medford há 43 anos.
 Meu marido é residente vitalício.
 E eu estava envolvido, então sinto que estive em Medford o tempo todo.
 Eu estava trabalhando na antiga Brooks-Hobbs quando fizemos a transição de lá para a nova Biblioteca McGlynn.
 E então, dois anos depois, fiz a transição para a nova Biblioteca Escolar Brooks.
 E em 2010, fiz a transição para o antigo colégio, o que foi um grande choque.
 Mas quando estávamos no processo de construção das outras escolas, eu não fazia parte do comité, mas participei em algumas visitas guiadas a outros edifícios.
 E eu vi aqueles eventos semanais de Jack Buckley dentro do prazo e do orçamento.
 Isso foi simplesmente incrível.
 E fiquei realmente tão fascinado por todo o processo.
 E vejo o meu papel como a parte funcional do edifício, como vai funcionar para os alunos, os professores e, claro, o meu aproveitamento do espaço pessoal.
 Olá pessoal.
 Eu sou Libby Brown.
 Eu sou um arquiteto.
 Moro em Medford há quase 10 anos.
 E estou muito animado agora que meus filhos estão na escola, que este é um projeto que está ganhando vida, e estou muito animado por fazer parte dele.
 Eu trabalho principalmente na educação, principalmente no ensino superior, mas também no ensino privado de ensino fundamental e médio.
 Não tenho exatamente experiência em MSBA, mas já trabalhamos em MSCBA, então um pouco na área de ensino superior.
 Só acho que esta é uma oportunidade maravilhosa para Medford.
 Eu trabalho muito com educadores, bibliotecários e pessoas, desde a programação até o projeto conceitual e a construção, especialmente com muitas reformas e avaliações em fases de instalações existentes, seja você as mantendo e renovando, demolindo-as, fazendo as duas coisas, fazendo tudo de uma vez e qualquer coisa intermediária.
 Portanto, este é um projeto emocionante.
 Estou feliz por estar aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3566.699s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Sou Larry Brown, um cara comum a alguns quarteirões de distância.
 Então não sei exatamente onde vou me encaixar nisso tudo, mas tenho muita experiência em construção, planejamento e desenvolvimento de locais principalmente residenciais, mas também comerciais.
 Não vou falar disso tudo, mas se alguém quiser saber minha formação posso falar mais sobre isso.
 Mas acho que meu interesse é saber como ajudar você no processo, porque já fiz esse tipo de coisa em vários níveis, não especificamente para uma escola, mas para outros tipos de projetos.
 Como você acabou de apontar, há muitos fatores aqui.
 E tudo isso deve ser feito sequencialmente.
 Não podemos simplesmente pular para o fim.
 E se eu puder ajudar nesse processo, ficarei feliz em fazê-lo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3620.523s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Larry, você também é professor aposentado do ensino médio profissionalizante de Medford e também trabalha aqui de vez em quando.</p>

 Também faço parte do comitê escolar aqui em Medford.
 Eu me formei no Medford High Class de 2018, então você sabe, há alguns anos e acabei de me formar no BC College em maio passado.
 Muito do trabalho que fiz nos últimos dois anos foi principalmente o envolvimento da comunidade, principalmente o envolvimento dos jovens.
 Tirei um ano de folga e trabalhei para o City Year Boston, então estava trabalhando como professor no sistema escolar de Charlestown.
 e também fiz muito trabalho comunitário enquanto estava na faculdade.
 Desde então, acabei de ser nomeado o novo diretor do Programa de Emprego Juvenil da cidade de Malden.
 Então eu trabalho no gabinete do prefeito, tentando fazer com que as crianças tenham acesso a oportunidades de emprego.
 Então, se você tem filhos interessados, me avise.
 Tentarei conseguir um emprego para eles durante o verão e o ano letivo.
 Então, estou muito animado por estar aqui.
 Acho que muitas das coisas em que estou me concentrando são apenas o envolvimento dos jovens, garantindo que nossos alunos realmente tenham acesso ao que merecem.
 E acho que é para isso que todos estamos aqui para fazer.
 Então, estou animado por todos nós.</p>

 Isso me parece ideal porque trabalho com um grupo de pessoas que gostam de desmontar, reconstruir e projetar coisas, e temos 15 programas aqui, caso você não saiba.
 Então vejo isso como uma oportunidade de expandir nossa programação, adicionando três ou quatro shows adicionais ao nosso menu de opções.

 Mas estou realmente ansioso por isso.
 No meu trabalho diário, possuo uma empresa de consultoria de gestão.
 Trabalho muito na melhoria de processos, concepção e entrega de educação de adultos, bem como gerenciamento de projetos.
 Portanto, sou um gerente de projeto certificado, não na construção.
 Mas sei como liderar um grande grupo de pessoas em direção a um objetivo.
 E é para isso que estou aqui.
 Então, muitas das coisas que Janelle estava falando são funções que tenho que assumir em termos de minutos.
 E falaremos sobre tudo isso no devido tempo.
 Mas estou tão animado que todos vocês estejam aqui.
 Temos muito trabalho a fazer.
 E na verdade fizemos uma enorme quantidade de trabalho.
 E estou muito animado para contar a vocês sobre isso.
 Então falaremos disso assim que terminarmos as apresentações.</p>

 Acho que me caracterizaria como um pai interessado e altamente motivado para melhorar o ambiente do ensino médio, para que possamos evitar decisões difíceis mais tarde.
 Acho que talvez eu me concentre demais nas coisas e é por isso que pesquiso bastante.
 Legal, eu não diria familiar, mas estou ciente de como esses esforços complexos podem sair dos trilhos e levar muito mais tempo do que deveriam.
 E então, profissionalmente, sou engenheiro de sistemas.
 Trabalhando na indústria aeroespacial, estou familiarizado com a complexidade e atenção aos processos.
 Certamente, eu acredito
 Minha função será simplesmente fazer algumas perguntas prontas para uso.
 Sei que temos muitas pessoas aqui que trabalham diretamente nas escolas ou têm alguma ligação forte com o distrito escolar, por isso posso olhar para uma questão específica de uma perspectiva diferente e dar-lhe voz.
 Talvez seja produtivo, talvez seja apenas um pedaço de espaguete escorregando da parede.
 Mas acho que esse é o meu papel aqui, um papel externo, mas certamente motivado a trazer uma nova escola secundária para Medford.
 Obrigado.</p>

 Há muitas coisas boas acontecendo na cidade de Medford e eu não sou de Medford, então estou feliz e animado com todos os projetos que estão acontecendo.
 É uma coisa ótima.
 Também venho de uma comunidade onde construímos uma nova escola de ensino fundamental e médio em 2015.
 E eu estava mais ou menos no outro extremo.
 Eu era mais um extensionista e trabalhava para a cidade de North Reading, mas em uma função diferente.

 É por isso que estou muito entusiasmado por ter sido professor do ensino médio, diretor em Vermont, diretor em Western Mass, North Shore e depois uma escola charter.
 Eu estava sempre no final de um projeto de construção quando era estudante em Middlebury, Vermont, e observava tudo acontecer.
 Todos usávamos botas e meu irmão pôde aproveitar os benefícios do prédio.
 Sinto que sempre estive no início.
 ou no final de alguma coisa.
 E eu acho que é realmente emocionante.
 Acho que a capacidade, não em todas as cidades, de construir um novo edifício escolar e pensar no futuro, especialmente com os alunos com quem trabalho atualmente, esse acesso em termos de equidade e tipo de capital e recursos culturais para os nossos alunos, acho que vai ser muito importante.
 Gostei do que Jenny disse, de alguma co-localização, ou de quem quer que tenha surgido, adorei isso, pensar que nossos alunos atuais realmente farão parte da estrutura deste edifício no futuro.
 Eles merecem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4186.071s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: Olá a todos, sou Jill Bowen.
 Sou o Diretor de Serviços Estudantis aqui nas Escolas Públicas de Bedford.
 Sou residente e funcionário vitalício.
 Este é o meu 31º ano aqui em Bedford.
 E já passei por uma gama de professor, líder de equipe de avaliação, coordenador e agora nesta posição.
 Também tive dois filhos que se formaram nas Escolas Públicas de Medford.
 Um seguiu o percurso universitário, o outro seguiu a carreira profissional.
 Portanto, estou muito animado para ver a visão desta nova escola secundária e o que ela pode trazer para Medford e nossos alunos, mas também para desenvolver o que Laurie disse, equidade e acessibilidade para todos os nossos alunos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Olá, sou Susanne Kalusi.
 Este é o meu 27º ano.
 Então eu também nasci e cresci no terceiro mês de escola.
 Não moro mais aqui, mas toda a minha carreira foi aqui.
 Comecei como professor e diretor assistente, líder escolar em Brooks, superintendente assistente de escolas primárias e agora superintendente assistente de assuntos acadêmicos e construção.
 Assim como o artigo da Marta, estou muito animado em poder trabalhar com todos vocês da região de instrução das escolas.
 Acho que alguém que foi a Maria falou um pouco sobre isso.
 Então, você sabe, meu pai era o gerente de projeto dos edifícios K a oito.
 Então eu sinto que vivi um pouco dos dois lados disso, mas sendo abençoado o suficiente
 Ser um dos professores da nova Escola McGlynn, naquela época, em 2001, também foi ótimo ver todo esse processo se desenrolar como educador e ser uma das pessoas nas novas escolas.
 Portanto, penso que o papel crítico que todos nós desempenhamos, estas grandes decisões que afectarão os nossos educadores, os nossos alunos, as nossas famílias, a nossa comunidade, são muito importantes para mim.
 leve isso muito a sério.
 E me sinto muito honrado em fazer parte da equipe e poder trabalhar com todos vocês.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4322.786s">[Unidentified]</a>: Obrigado.
 Boa noite, Marisa Parkinson.
 Também nasci na mesma rua em Lawrence.
 Minha família e minha mãe ainda estão aqui, na mesma rua, em West Medford.
 E comecei a estudar em Medford.
 Comecei na Harvey School.
 Eu tomei um caminho diferente.
 Acabei em S.
 Ray e Casey.
 Sou muito católico, mas você sabe, trabalhei no Johnny's Foodmaster em Westlake.
 Duggar Park era meu parque local.
 E você sabe, eu adoro escolas.
 Eu adoro crianças.
 Eu amo educação.
 Estou na educação há 30 anos.
 Isso é muito assustador, porque eu tinha uns 29 anos.
 Essa é minha resposta preferida.
 Então acho que vou ter que fazer um ajuste.
 Mas estou muito animado com o que isso significa: conseguir uma nova escola secundária para Medford.
 Eu sei que na época em que este edifício foi construído, era como, você sabe, provavelmente como o Taj Mahal.
 Era um lindo colégio.
 Mas, você sabe, mais de 50 anos depois, precisamos de algo novo.
 E sinto que nossos alunos merecem isso.
 E temos uma programação vocacional maravilhosa.
 Temos uma programação acadêmica maravilhosa, mas em um prédio muito antigo.
 E temos um maravilhoso programa Curtis House, que está localizado em uma instalação diferente.
 Temos opções maravilhosas para a primeira infância e nosso programa pré-escolar para os funcionários que ficam aqui.
 E temos sorte de ter essas coisas em Medford.
 E eu sinto que Medford é uma pequena joia.
 E ter uma nova escola secundária emblemática fará muito pelos nossos alunos, pela comunidade e pelo futuro da nossa comunidade, em geral, da comunidade em geral.
 E espero fazer parte desse processo e trabalhar com todos que estão aqui e viver minhas diferentes experiências.
 somando minha voz a todas as vozes que já estão aqui.
 E para o prefeito e membro Graham, entrando neste grupo de 25, havia tantos candidatos maravilhosamente qualificados que era como se fosse outro engenheiro, outro engenheiro, outro arquiteto.
 Mas para alcançar esse grupo de pessoas como,
 pessoas maravilhosas e estou muito, muito grato.
 Quero agradecer ao Luke, que iniciou o processo conosco há dois anos, eu acho, e, você sabe, ele aguentou e sempre esteve no controle.
 Portanto, estou ansioso por esse processo e realmente quero que continuemos positivos e otimistas sobre o que está por vir.
 E membro Ramjani, não sei se você deseja compartilhar com eles sobre o filtro.
 o que você pegou e como foi emocionante.
 E será mais emocionante para o resto da equipe ter experiências semelhantes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4528.482s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Claro.
 Obrigado a todos pelo...
 palavras de emoção.
 Quero fazer algumas coisas entre agora e as 20h.
 E partiremos às 8, eu prometo.
 Mas, apenas para uma verificação rápida, duas coisas importantes.
 Uma é que quero dar uma ideia do que está acontecendo.
 até hoje e onde estamos no processo.
 Então vou falar um pouco sobre isso.
 Vamos fazer uma apresentação rápida para fazer isso.
 E então, antes de partirmos esta noite, formaremos alguns subcomitês para que possamos avançar rapidamente em alguns dos trabalhos de curto prazo que precisamos fazer.
 Então falaremos sobre isso em apenas um minuto.
 Mas Peter, se você puder mencionar essa apresentação para mim, seria ótimo.
 OK.
 Você pode pular algumas páginas.
 Continue assim, mais um.
 Aqui vamos nós.
 Começamos em fevereiro, então em dezembro o MSBA nos convidou para o período de elegibilidade.
 E falaremos sobre o que significa o período de elegibilidade em apenas alguns minutos.
 Mas aquele convite dizia: você está convidado para esse processo, que começa no dia 1º de maio.
 Então amanhã começamos.
 No entanto, a comissão nomeou-me presidente desta comissão de construção em Fevereiro e muito trabalho foi feito até agora.
 Uma das coisas que tínhamos que fazer era encontrar todos eles, certo?
 Assim, no contexto de tentar dizer o que nós, como comité escolar, queremos que este comité de construção faça, estabelecemos uma lista de objectivos.
 Haverá muitos, muitos mais objetivos, mas eu queria lançar as bases para,
 o trabalho que faremos a seguir.
 cinco a sete anos.
 A primeira é planejar de forma abrangente toda a programação atualmente residente no campus da Medford High School, incluindo educação profissional e não profissional de 9 a 12 anos, atletismo de 9 a 12 anos, Medford Family Network, programação de Escolas Comunitárias de Medford, educação infantil, incluindo, mas não limitado a, o Programa de Educação Infantil de Medford, que chamamos de MEAP, e Kids 'Corner.
 Portanto, há muito mais coisas acontecendo neste prédio do que pensamos quando pensamos em uma escola secundária.
 Então isso é algo em que todos vocês precisam começar a pensar.
 Número dois, o que é isso?
 Posso pegar?
 Obrigado.
 Ah, sim, e posso compartilhar os slides.
 Não, não, posso compartilhar os slides.
 Sim, posso compartilhar todos os slides com você mais tarde.
 O número dois é considerar se a localização da Curtis Tufts High School no campus de Medford proporcionará maiores oportunidades educacionais para os alunos matriculados na Curtis Tufts.
 Número três, garantir contribuições públicas robustas e feedback das partes interessadas em marcos apropriados ao longo do projeto que cumpram as diretrizes da MSBA e as orientações do Comitê Escolar de Medford.
 Ouça educadores e administradores sobre o futuro das melhores práticas e planos educacionais para alunos de Medford.
 Isso significa que nos preocupamos muito com a funcionalidade.
 Então queremos saber se os espaços funcionarão para alunos e professores do prédio.
 É realmente muito importante.
 Hum, número cinco, criar planos para o edifício que promovam métodos, metas climáticas e alcancem todos os chips e lidere a certificação da versão cinco para cumprir as metas dos Acordos Climáticos de Paris de 2030 e 2050 e avançar de forma eficiente e eficaz através do processo de construção de uma forma que garanta que os alunos possam aprender no novo edifício o mais rápido possível.
 então
 Essa é uma tarefa enorme.
 O mais rápido possível ainda é medido em anos e não em meses.
 Mas no contexto da criação deste comité, assim que fui nomeado presidente, lançamos o convite à apresentação de candidaturas, começámos a recolher candidaturas e estão todos aqui.
 Entretanto, há muito trabalho a fazer na fase de elegibilidade que já iniciamos.
 Então falaremos sobre isso em apenas um minuto.
 Mas você pode ir para o próximo slide.
 Gráfico realmente ruim que não explorou muito bem no site.
 Mas já que estamos falando de todo o processo, ficamos fora da caixa por mais seis horas.
 No dia 1º de maio, entraremos nesse período de elegibilidade dentro da caixa.
 Em cada uma dessas etapas do processo,
 A MSBA terá que aprovar que cumprimos todos os requisitos para essa fase.
 Terá que haver um conselho de administração onde votem para nos convidar para a próxima fase.
 Portanto, a qualquer momento deste processo, a MSBA poderá dizer que não está pronta para avançar.
 Eles também poderiam dizer: não gostamos do que você está fazendo.
 E eles também podem dizer, esqueça.
 Portanto, nosso trabalho aqui é garantir que nenhuma dessas coisas aconteça.
 Nosso trabalho é jogar limpo, ser abrangente e avançar o mais rápido que for humanamente possível.
 Ok, então vamos dar uma chance ao MSBA porque estaremos prontos para eles.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4847.483s">[Unidentified]</a>: Veremos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4849.904s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mas esse período de elegibilidade dura 270 dias.
 Então, até janeiro temos que terminar a fase de elegibilidade.
 Vou falar um pouco sobre o que acontece nessa fase.
 Além da fase de elegibilidade, brevemente, quando falamos em formar a equipe do projeto, isso significa trazer o gerente de projeto do nosso proprietário.
 Depois passamos para o estudo de viabilidade.
 Quando as pessoas pensam no que estamos fazendo neste comitê, pensam que estamos fazendo um estudo de viabilidade neste momento.
 Acham que estamos decidindo, estamos construindo?
 Estamos renovando?
 Onde estamos construindo?
 Está em campo?
 Está no estacionamento?
 Como isso vai funcionar?
 Ainda não chegamos a esse ponto.
 Então conte para todos os seus amigos, nós chegaremos lá e trabalharemos com profissionais.
 para ajudar a fazer essas avaliações em nome do que precisamos fazer neste edifício.
 E depois passaremos para o desenho esquemático, financiando os projetos.
 É aí que votamos como comunidade para financiar este projeto.
 Não posso enfatizar o quão importante será, mas também temos muito trabalho a fazer antes de chegarmos lá.
 Quando isso acontecer, entraremos no projeto detalhado.
 Então colocamos uma pá no chão.
 E então, em algum momento no futuro, concluiremos o projeto.
 Então isso é uma espécie de sopa para nozes.
 Meu objetivo é que avancemos passo a passo.
 Faremos o que for necessário para cumprir o período de elegibilidade.
 E então seguiremos em frente.
 À medida que nos aproximamos da próxima fase, começaremos a falar sobre como podemos acelerar o trabalho.
 Mas, por enquanto, nosso foco é a elegibilidade.
 Então, se você puder passar para a próxima página,
 O processo de elegibilidade possui um gráfico próprio, que você não consegue visualizar.
 Então vá em frente e passe para o próximo slide.
 Bem.
 Portanto, há cinco coisas que precisam acontecer nesta fase.
 Uma é a certificação de conformidade inicial.
 É um acordo legal que obriga a cidade a cumprir o processo MSBA.
 Foi assinado e entregue ao MSBA.
 Estamos um dia adiantados e reconhecerei isso.
 Obrigado, prefeito e superintendente.
 Estamos a caminho.
 Número dois, devemos formar o comitê de construção.
 Vocês estão todos aqui.
 O comitê escolar disse para se reunir em 1º de maio e aqui estamos nós no dia 30 de abril.
 Nós fizemos isso.
 O formulário será enviado ao MSBA em breve.
 Portanto, estamos trabalhando nisso e o enviaremos em breve.
 Obviamente essa é a parte fácil.
 É papelada.
 Toda a fase de elegibilidade envolve muita papelada, mas esta é a mais fácil, e nós simplesmente faremos isso e resolveremos isso.
 O MSBA deve aprovar nosso comitê.
 Cumprimos todos os requisitos, por isso o MSBA tem todos os tipos de coisas que exige de nós em termos de quem está neste comitê.
 Atendemos a todos esses requisitos com todos vocês aqui.
 Agora vamos mergulhar no trabalho real.
 Há três coisas adicionais que precisam acontecer.
 Um deles é o que chamam de perfil educacional.
 É um documento modelo e exige que digamos: o que está acontecendo hoje neste edifício?
 Quantas salas de aula?
 Quantas salas de aula de matemática?
 Quantos espaços temporários?
 Qual é o tamanho do seu teatro?
 Tudo isso, certo?
 É por isso que ele pede que você descreva o que está acontecendo atualmente neste edifício.
 Também pede que você descreva o que você imagina para o futuro deste edifício.
 Então é aqui que essas conversas sobre Curtis Tufts, essas conversas sobre a primeira infância se tornam muito, muito importantes.
 Porque entre a nossa declaração de interesse e esta fase de elegibilidade, o perfil educacional, que dará o tom de como todos os profissionais da construção podem realmente fazer o seu trabalho.
 Portanto, isto estabelecerá o âmbito, por assim dizer, do trabalho que precisa de ser feito para conseguir esta construção.
 Portanto, há muito trabalho que foi feito agora neste processo.
 Tenho me reunido com a equipe de gestão desde fevereiro.
 Nos encontramos várias vezes por semana.
 Eles estão muito fartos de mim.
 Ele ficaria cansado de mim.
 Mas uma das coisas que começamos a fazer é dizer: o que podemos eliminar?
 É por isso que o documento está muito bem escrito no que diz respeito
 O que estamos fazendo neste prédio?
 Todas as salas de aula foram contadas.
 Todos os programas foram delineados.
 A administração tem um pouco mais de trabalho a fazer em termos do que está acontecendo hoje para descrever isso com precisão.
 A outra coisa que é obviamente muito mais complicada é conversar sobre o que faremos neste edifício no futuro.
 Então, nessa conversa, novamente, tivemos uma conversa muito ampla.
 Temos explorado as partes de planejamento estratégico do nosso cérebro para fazer grandes perguntas.
 E vou usar Curtis Tufts só por um minuto.
 Tivemos algumas discussões sobre se nossos educadores acham que isso é algo que deveríamos pensar e a resposta é sim, eles disseram que sim, deveríamos pensar sobre isso.
 E então começamos a dizer: “Ok, como seria isso?”
 os requisitos são.
 Então começamos essa conversa, mas essa conversa é maior do que este comitê pode analisar porque meio que se envolve nas responsabilidades do comitê escolar.
 Então, ontem à noite apresentei uma resolução pedindo ao nosso subcomitê de educação especial e saúde comportamental, que na verdade é presidido pelo membro Rousseau, que se reunisse em um cronograma muito apertado para coletar contribuições e comentários.
 sobre esse tópico muito limitado.
 A co-localização da Curtis-Tufts neste campus seria benéfica de alguma forma para os resultados educacionais dos alunos que frequentam a Curtis-Tufts?
 Há outro residente de Medford que falou ontem à noite.
 Ele dirige um programa muito comparável em Somerville.
 Ele falou sobre essa transição que acabou de acontecer em Somerville e como isso explodiu sua população.
 Mudou o jogo para os alunos que precisam desse ambiente alternativo em termos de acesso a coisas como equipes esportivas, no nosso caso, programas vocacionais.
 Portanto, há uma enorme, enorme oportunidade, mas
 Queremos ter certeza de que a comunidade e o comitê tenham alguma oportunidade de pensar sobre tudo o que poderiam contribuir e fornecer uma recomendação a este comitê.
 Então, ontem à noite isso foi oficialmente comunicado ao subcomitê de educação especial.
 Eles se encontrarão.
 Eles convidarão funcionários atuais, alunos atuais, ex-alunos,
 membros da comunidade, etc., e Jack Hevery de Somerville para conversar e resolver isso e dar uma recomendação para estar no caminho certo e voltar em meados de junho para que eles tenham muito trabalho pela frente, mas isso nos ajudará a informar.
 a escrita daquela parte do que imaginamos para esta escola.
 Porque o que provavelmente precisaremos não é apenas de algumas salas de aula em algum lugar do prédio.
 Parte do sucesso de Curtis Tufts se deve ao fato de o ambiente ser consideravelmente diferente deste campus muito grande, com 1.200 alunos.
 Portanto, teremos que pensar cuidadosamente sobre como o montaremos, mas esperamos que o trabalho realizado pelo subcomitê volte para nós e possa ser canalizado.
 Marta e Chad participarão de uma futura reunião do comitê escolar nas próximas semanas e Marta falará sobre algumas de suas ideias para uma programação alternativa e como tudo isso poderá parecer, mesmo no curto prazo.
 E isso é algo que terá que ser incorporado.
 Joan, Suzanne, Paul e eu conversamos ontem sobre educação infantil.
 As nossas escolas primárias estão a rebentar pelas costuras.
 Teremos que lidar com esse problema em algum momento.
 O MEEP costumava ser hospedado aqui.
 E vamos explorar um caso que diz que o MEAP deveria voltar aqui e que pode ou não ser onde pousaremos, mas isso é algo que estamos explorando porque agora é a hora.
 Também falamos muito sobre os alunos que não têm educação pré-escolar e quando ingressam nas nossas escolas públicas.
 quão desafiador é o ingresso para esses alunos.
 E também estamos falando sobre coisas como quão grande é a lista de espera?
 E quantos alunos chegam até nós que nunca estiveram em nenhum tipo de ambiente pré-escolar?
 E que tipo de capacidade precisaríamos para servir um programa de educação infantil mais amplo e abrangente a partir deste edifício?
 Porque tudo isso teria que estar incluído neste documento.
 Então, estamos trabalhando nisso.
 Então, enquanto essas coisas acontecem, muito trabalho foi feito até agora nesse perfil educacional.
 A grande peça do perfil educacional que ainda não abordamos é a estratégia de comunicação.
 Falarei sobre isso em apenas um minuto.
 Mas do lado da educação, há muito que os nossos educadores têm de fazer para que possamos elaborar esse documento.
 Eu só quero que todos saibam que tudo está em andamento.
 E à medida que avançamos nas nossas próximas reuniões, vamos apresentar esses documentos para que possamos começar a fazer uma leitura mais ampla desses documentos, pedir sugestões e ter certeza de que estamos realmente pensando em todos os ângulos do que precisamos descrever.
 E é aí que acho que todos vocês desempenham um papel muito importante ao dizer:
 Penso que é necessário descrever o que estamos a fazer aqui de uma forma um pouco diferente, com base no que sei ou com base na visão que temos para os programas artísticos ou para os programas vocacionais, etc., etc.
 Então é aí que estamos no perfil educacional.
 A co-localização de Curtis Tufts está no subcomitê.
 O outro grande tópico novo, inovador e em mudança é o MEAP.
 O que a MSBA descreve como a razão para os atrasos que ocorrem frequentemente nas comunidades é que elas têm de tomar decisões muito importantes que contribuem para o seu processo de construção.
 Vamos combinar duas escolas?
 E isso obviamente tem a sua própria energia e o seu próprio conjunto de requisitos, o que torna muito difícil conseguir
 mova-se rapidamente.
 Então, estamos tentando pensar grande porque esta é uma oportunidade única para pensar sobre o que o distrito realmente precisa de uma forma muito abrangente, mas também para avançar o mais rápido possível.
 Portanto, todo esse trabalho está em andamento e avançando o mais rápido possível.
 E Peter, você pode passar para o próximo slide?
 Muito semelhantemente na parte profissional, porque temos uma escola profissional muito ativa, temos outro documento que precisa de ser preenchido, que é o capítulo 74 de viabilidade.
 O capítulo 74 é o capítulo do regulamento que estabelece os programas profissionalizantes, certo?
 Bem.
 Essa escrita está em andamento.
 Temos que dizer a eles que aqui estão os programas que temos.
 Aqui está a capacidade desses programas.
 Aqui está nossa inscrição atual e informações como nossa lista de espera.
 Também temos a oportunidade de descrever a expansão planeada destes programas.
 Chad e Peter estarão no comitê escolar falando sobre o potencial de expansão.
 Essa é uma questão do comitê escolar porque o programa ampliado exige muito mais do que apenas um prédio.
 É necessário equipamento.
 Precisa-se de pessoal.
 Portanto, o comitê escolar tem que avaliar isso.
 Portanto, isso será apresentado ao comitê escolar em 20 de maio e contribuirá para a finalização do formulário do capítulo 70.
 E este grupo irá ler com atenção e se preparar para isso também.
 E há uma peça do quebra-cabeça sobre a qual o prefeito, o superintendente e eu conversaremos com a MSBA ainda esta semana, que na verdade são informações de planejamento urbano.
 Então podemos começar a inserir informações no que eles chamam de estudo de matrícula.
 Isso ajuda a dimensionar o edifício.
 Você provavelmente já ouviu falar muito sobre como este prédio foi construído para 4.000 alunos e agora existem apenas 1.200.
 Se 4.000 era o número ou não, não sei, mas é verdade que o número é diferente.
 Então, uma das coisas que o MSBA fará na fase de elegibilidade é dizer: vamos construir um prédio para esse número de alunos.
 Isso geralmente coincide com algo semelhante ao que está acontecendo hoje no prédio.
 Porém, se houver uma grande expansão planejada na cidade em termos de unidades habitacionais em desenvolvimento, eles vão querer saber de tudo isso.
 Assim, eles podem dimensionar o edifício porque não querem que construamos um edifício que fique imediatamente sem capacidade.
 Eles também não querem que construamos um prédio que nunca ficará cheio.
 Bom.
 Então, isso faz parte do trabalho que está sendo feito lá.
 Quarta coisa, os documentos de manutenção.
 Há um questionário que devemos preencher que descreve todas as nossas práticas de manutenção em todo o distrito.
 Então é algo como: ele foi colocado de volta em serviço?
 E como sua equipe é treinada?
 Existem cerca de 20 variáveis.
 Esse documento também está em fase de rascunho e avançando o mais rápido possível.
 Provavelmente chegaremos a isso um pouco mais tarde, em junho.
 A última coisa que precisamos de fazer para considerar que concluímos a elegibilidade é identificar o financiamento para o estudo de viabilidade, que provavelmente estará entre dois e um quarto de milhão a dois milhões e meio de dólares.
 Ainda não estamos prontos para isso, mas estamos fazendo planos.
 O prefeito e eu estamos trabalhando em qual será esse plano do ponto de vista da força-tarefa financeira, para que esse dinheiro possa ser contabilizado e administrado tão rapidamente quanto necessário.
 Dúvidas sobre o processo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5700.456s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Claro que é o quinto, então quando diz autorização local, isso implica que o eleitorado não vota?
 Não.
 E você quer a maioria ou isso significa que o governo municipal identificou o financiamento total?
 Correto.
 Uma parte será reembolsada, mas acho que a autorização tem que ser no valor total.
 Os corretos dirão qual é o reembolso com base em onde caímos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5724.632s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Correto.
 No que diz respeito à viabilidade, este financiamento terá de cobrir todas as despesas do estudo de viabilidade, não o projeto inteiro, apenas o estudo de viabilidade, o que equivale a entre dois e dois milhões e meio de dólares.
 A cidade pagará antecipadamente todo esse estudo de viabilidade.
 E então, uma vez que a MSBA certifique a nossa taxa de reembolso para o projeto e tenhamos sucesso em todo o processo, eles reembolsarão o estudo de viabilidade que é proporcional à percentagem de alocação que nos fornecem.
 Então sim, eles vão usar a mesma fórmula e solicitar o estudo de viabilidade e reembolsar a cidade.
 Mas a cidade tem que enfrentar esse dinheiro.
 Então o que tem que acontecer aqui é,
 Temos um plano de financiamento para isso.
 Hum, e devemos ser bons.
 Portanto, estivemos bem nisso, e isso exigirá uma votação do conselho municipal para autorizar os fundos e colocá-los em um local onde possamos acessá-los.
 mas
 Como mencionei, tudo isso deve estar concluído até janeiro.
 Cada um tem um prazo específico associado.
 Serei muito agressivo e direi a eles que quero que todas essas coisas sejam feitas antes do início das aulas no próximo ano.
 E sempre que possível, quero que essas coisas sejam feitas até 30 de junho.
 É por isso que temos nos reunido, trabalhado e pressionado.
 E acho que é importante nos alongarmos.
 Então vamos nos alongar e nos preparar.
 O MSBA terá trabalho a fazer em termos de certificação do estudo de matrícula e tudo mais.
 Mas quero que possamos dar-lhes tudo o que precisam para que possamos avançar o mais rapidamente possível para a próxima fase.
 Dúvidas sobre o cronograma?
 Bem.
 Então só nos restam 20 minutos.
 Para esse fim, listamos no final da agenda uma série de próximas reuniões do subcomitê.
 Gostaria que pensássemos e priorizássemos duas coisas à medida que avançamos nesta primeira fase.
 Um deles é um comitê de comunicação e envolvimento comunitário.
 Quero algum tipo de subcomitê, não mais do que sete membros votantes, mas um grupo interessado, que se reúna em um subcomitê para realmente poder descrever e delinear nosso processo de envolvimento comunitário.
 Acho que todos vocês já viram pessoas na comunidade expressarem preocupação sobre: ​​Medford vai estragar tudo?
 Isso vai funcionar?
 Isso vai acontecer?
 Então você precisa fazer muita divulgação na comunidade.
 E quanto mais cedo começarmos com isso, mais sucesso teremos no final.
 Porém, acho que essa é uma conversa mais ampla, porque também temos, na minha opinião, uma grande variedade de conselhos e comissões.
 Muitos deles estão interessados ​​neste projeto.
 Portanto, será necessário fazer alguma divulgação para entender quando e como envolvê-los, para que possamos incluí-lo em nosso plano diretor no futuro.
 O segundo grupo que gostaria de formar esta noite é o Comitê de Regras e Incorporação.
 Como disse Janelle, precisamos de estabelecer algumas regras sobre a forma como iremos operar, especialmente em relação à participação pública, mas apenas em geral.
 Espero que este comitê tenha tempo limitado.
 Espero que vocês possam se reunir uma vez, trazer um rascunho para este grupo e então poderemos adotar essas regras e gerenciá-las a partir daí.
 E então o terceiro comitê que não se reunirá tão rapidamente, mas se reunirá,
 Você sabe que antes do final de junho existe o subcomitê de finanças, então será um comitê permanente que se reunirá e continuará durante toda a vida do projeto.
 É importante ter em mente que quando chegar a hora a comunidade terá que votar.
 Este comitê não é onde esse trabalho é feito.
 Portanto, se estamos a falar da necessidade última de uma exclusão da dívida para financiar este projecto, não é esta comissão que deveria aprovar a exclusão da dívida.
 Na verdade, isso não pode acontecer aqui.
 Tem que acontecer fora deste grupo.
 Então, este comitê de finanças, eu vejo isso como uma contribuição e uma visão sobre coisas como
 Compras, compras do gerente de projetos do nosso proprietário, dos nossos arquitetos, esse tipo de coisa.
 Mas também para ajudar a informar o ajuste do que precisamos para a viabilidade?
 Existem outros custos que devemos levar em conta?
 Portanto, há algum trabalho financeiro a ser feito, embora eu não preveja essa reunião do grupo até um pouco mais tarde, em maio.
 Então falaremos um pouco mais sobre as Regras de Ordem de Robert e tudo mais em nossa próxima reunião.
 Eu sei que todo mundo está olhando para mim tipo, pare de falar, por favor.
 Então, acho que o que me interessa é se há pessoas que ouviram algum desses tópicos e disseram que realmente quero fazer parte
 Um desses subcomitês, você consegue se identificar?
 E eu também sugeriria educadamente que os administradores escolares talvez mantenham o controle, porque você tem seu próprio trabalho a fazer para se preparar para o resto do que acabamos de descrever.
 Você é 100% bem-vindo.
 para participar, mas precisamos que você compareça ao comitê escolar.
 Precisamos que John e Peter nos ajudem com esses planos de manutenção, etc.
 Portanto, se houver pessoas interessadas em algum desses outros temas, o comitê não pode ser muito grande, mas pode ter o tamanho que acharmos necessário para conseguirmos realizar o trabalho.
 Então coloquei esses subcomitês no calendário.
 Estaremos nos reunindo inteiramente pelo Zoom nessas noites, apenas para tornar as coisas um pouco mais fáceis.
 Cada um terá um resultado bastante específico para a nossa próxima reunião em 13 de maio, que será trazer um rascunho de qual é a sua proposta.
 Existem voluntários?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6100.412s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sim.
 Para os outros 2.
 especifique quantos?
 Isso importa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6105.859s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Acho que poderia ser qualquer número de pessoas.
 Não pode haver mais de sete membros votantes.
 Mas acho que se eliminarmos literalmente todo o pessoal da escola, não estou muito preocupado com a possibilidade de tropeçarmos nisso.
 Mas estou mais interessado em que as pessoas façam as coisas que consideram certas para o trabalho que realizam, para o trabalho pelo qual são apaixonadas.
 Obrigado.

 Comunicações.
 Obrigado.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6192.886s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Existem duas pessoas para regras e integração.
 Isso mesmo.
 Eu estava planejando participar de todos os comitês, mas está correto.
 Talvez possamos pedir a Emily Lazzaro para fazer parte do subcomitê de regras e incorporação.
 Então irei consultá-la.
 E também coloquei Nicole Morel no subcomitê de comunicações.
 Então vamos nos comunicar com eles.
 Mas há mais alguém que se sente fortemente a respeito disso?
 Para onde você gostaria de ir?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6227.321s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Eu posso fazer comunicações.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6230.024s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Vale, genial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6232.21s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Bem, eu ia dizer finanças, mas definitivamente não tenho muita experiência nisso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6235.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Acho que estamos bem.
 John?
 Não, você tem trabalho a fazer.
 Ah, absolutamente.
 E acho que para todos os verdadeiros técnicos do grupo,
 Antes de nos aprofundarmos nisso, haverá um grupo de trabalho que terá que elaborar uma solicitação de propostas para o gerente de projeto do proprietário.
 Essa não é a experiência que tenho.
 Não é por isso que estou aqui.
 Então, com o tempo, dependeremos de todos para os diferentes subcomitês.
 Isto é, do meu ponto de vista pessoal, o que pensei que deveríamos começar.
 Isso faz sentido?
 Alguém tem alguma outra sugestão para coisas que precisam acontecer em breve?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Eu tenho uma pergunta.
 Claro.
 Você mencionou que Curtis poderia vir aqui e todos esses vários usos das instalações.
 Quem está explorando essas opções?
 como educação comunitária, talvez trabalhar em uma faculdade comunitária, cursos noturnos como aqueles que eu estava esperando lá na Associação de Empreiteiros Gerais da AGC que oferece educação de adultos.
 Alguém gosta,
 colocando na mesa muitas opções que você gostaria de considerar ou o que você acha?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim, mais ou menos, mais ou menos não, mas não completamente.
 Ainda não chegamos a esse ponto.
 Então, acho que, uma vez que superarmos esse rubor inicial do capítulo 74, pode fazer sentido acrescentarmos isso.
 Então, ao começarmos a ler esses documentos, acho que é um bom momento para dizer: quem mais devemos procurar?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Porque todos esses tipos de coisas terão impacto
 Acessibilidade, proximidade, dimensão das instalações versus outras, arrecadação, estacionamento, você sabe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6343.879s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Bem.
 Sim, acho que é uma ótima ideia.
 Vou colocar na lista.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6350.581s">[Unidentified]</a>: Na verdade, estamos limitados pela nossa cidade.
 São.
 Se todos na sala dissessem: Bedford Rec deveria estar aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6365.68s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mas as escolas comunitárias são.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6367.861s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6375.31s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Bem.
 Sim, eu queria perguntar, quem vai fornecer a este comitê algum tipo de infraestrutura digital?
 Então farei referência ao SOI.
 Existe o SOI.
 Houve pesquisas analisando o Fed.SOI.
 Provavelmente há toda uma lista de outros documentos públicos que não são realmente acessíveis ao público, mas deveriam ser.
 Você sabe, este subcomitê de comunicação de envolvimento comunitário terá a responsabilidade de
 comunicar a mesma coisa provavelmente para muitas pessoas, isso é feito de forma mais eficiente através de um site, talvez através de um repositório compartilhado, e certamente poderia haver comunicação externa
 em um portal, como um site, como toda escola que teve um desses projetos, e depois uma espécie de repositório back-end onde Sheldon pode ver o SOI, por exemplo.
 Pode estar disponível a qualquer momento para membros que estão na lista de acesso.
 Claro.
 Tudo o que é necessário são recursos.
 Posso lhe dar uma atualização.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Nós temos isso.
 Portanto, obtivemos uma URL exclusiva deste comitê e é buildingmhs.org.
 É assim mesmo?
 Bem.
 Portanto, o URL existe.
 A página existe.
 Na verdade, Thomas está trabalhando no tipo de estrutura básica desse recurso comunitário.
 A razão pela qual estamos pedindo biografias e fotos a todos é que todas serão publicadas no site, então ele está trabalhando em tudo isso em sua função como Diretor de Comunicações.
 Tom concordou, embora seja o Diretor de Comunicações cessante, em permanecer especificamente neste projeto até contratarmos seu substituto.
 Então, Thomas e alguns de nossos alunos do ensino profissional estão construindo esse site, acho que sob a direção de Lisa Miller.
 E haverá um componente de documentos onde estarão todos esses documentos acessíveis ao público, para que quando alguém diga, onde está isso?
 Podemos indicar um lugar para você.
 Todas as atas das nossas reuniões irão para lá.
 Todas as nossas agendas de reuniões irão para lá.
 Então já temos toda uma estrutura para tentar fazer isso.
 Ainda não estamos prontos, mas espero que na próxima reunião possamos fazer um tour com vocês.
 site.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Ok, o próximo passo é que será o portal voltado para fora.
 Como estão as costas para nós?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Então essa é uma questão complicada, porque sob a lei de reuniões abertas, isso realmente não tem fim para nós.
 Assim que uma agenda é publicada, todos os seus documentos passam a fazer parte do registro público.
 E se o fizermos, o complicado é que, se estivermos trabalhando nos bastidores, há uma boa chance de estarmos violando a lei de reuniões abertas.
 Assim, os administradores têm cópias de trabalho dos documentos em que estão a trabalhar e não representam um quórum e podem continuar a fazê-lo.
 Assim que esses documentos chegarem aqui, eles serão colocados em uma unidade disponível publicamente.
 E quando falamos em edição de documento, não existe edição offline deste comitê.
 Não é permitido pela lei de reuniões abertas.
 Infelizmente, vamos sentar aqui e editar um documento juntos.
 É verdadeiramente uma das partes mais dolorosas da gestão deste processo que
 Todos vocês se inscreveram, desculpe.
 Mas sim, é incrivelmente doloroso, mas offline, o tipo de edição offline que funciona de forma super eficaz, literalmente em qualquer outro lugar do mundo, não é uma opção aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Ok, então nada de Google Drive ou documentos compartilhados.
 As coisas serão liberadas.
 Quando são publicados, aparecem no site.
 Quando aparecem no site, são essencialmente controles de configuração e não podem ser alterados, a menos que essas alterações sejam feitas aqui ao contrário.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Correto.
 Mmm, sim, é terrível.
 É sim.
 É absolutamente terrível.
 Encontramos maneiras de fazer isso.
 menos terríveis, mas, você sabe, são graus menos terríveis, infelizmente.
 E essa é uma maneira segura de causar problemas à comunidade em termos de como os documentos são editados.
 Depois haverá, e quando o fizermos, descobrirei que essas reuniões são muito mais eficazes no Zoom.
 Você pode sentar onde precisar e todos podem ver como um documento é editado e não pode haver qualquer tipo de
 ideia do documento ser editado sem que isso aconteça ao ar livre.
 Portanto, temos que agir com muita cautela nesse sentido.
 Mas sim, é um processo.
 É estranho como isso se aplica ao GraphDoc.
 Pude ver isso aplicado ao documento de liberação.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: Não.
 Este não é GraphDoc.
 Aprendemos que há muitos de nós trabalhando.
 Estamos deliberando.
 Estamos num grupo comum, jovem e partilhado.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Isso é deliberação.
 Sim.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: Tive uma conversa com cada um deles no escritório no outono passado.
 Foi esse período.
 Então tivemos uma ligação completamente longa.
 Havia 40 membros.
 E um membro disse: Simon acabou de mencionar isso no documento e leu nossos comentários lá.
 E, de fato, nós os colocamos juntos.
 E a resposta é não.
 Então você pode escrever seus comentários.
 Eu respondo que você tem sete anos.
 Eles disseram, ok, reconhecido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: Nós apenas sentimos isso.
 É como se concordássemos que isso provavelmente será perigoso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sim.
 Obrigado novamente por estar aqui.
 Também estou muito interessado na parte de comunicação, embora essas noites não funcionem, mas terei sempre prazer em atender algumas ligações.
 E eles vão voltar aqui.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Todas essas atualizações voltarão aqui.
 Alguma outra pergunta que você possa responder sobre os subcomitês ou qualquer outra coisa que estivesse na agenda?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Tenho uma pergunta sobre a votação.
 Sim, quando chegarmos à votação, sim, não estamos naquilo que nunca entendi: o poder é permitido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Não.
 Não, não é.
 O poder é permitido em uma reunião?
 Não, você não pode atribuir seu voto a outra pessoa.
 Ao encerrarmos, vamos praticar a votação, porque temos que votar para encerrar.
 Geralmente, isso aconteceria através do que eles chamam de voto verbal, onde todos simplesmente dizem sim e vamos embora.
 Vamos apenas praticar o rolamento, porque é
 Novamente, estranho e estranho, então faremos isso para encerrar.
 Mas alguma outra pergunta antes de encerrarmos?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: Eu estava prestando atenção.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mas penso que outra coisa que vale a pena descrever é que há um número considerável de membros sem direito a voto nesta comissão.
 As razões para isso não são porque não queremos ouvir de você.
 Você está aqui porque queremos ouvir de você.
 Quando a votação for realizada, não chamaremos o seu nome e você não votará.
 Mas fora isso, você é membro pleno deste comitê.
 Eles me avisaram que
 Quando há muitos membros votantes, torna-se muito difícil conduzir os negócios porque é necessário ter quórum do comitê para se reunir e conduzir os negócios.
 Tudo isso fica muito, muito complicado.
 Portanto, esta foi a nossa tentativa de dizer: queremos ter uma grande comissão redonda, mas também precisamos de ser capazes de avançar de forma eficiente e eficaz e tudo mais.
 Então essa é a razão por trás.
 o que fizemos lá.
 E penso que o tamanho deste comité irá certamente mudar ao longo da sua vida.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Então 25?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim, há 15 membros votantes no comitê, o que ainda é um número bastante bom de membros votantes.
 E praticaremos a votação em apenas um segundo.
 Mas há alguma outra pergunta na próxima reunião?
 As regras, as regras e a incorporação em 7 de maio.
 participação da comunidade em 8 de maio e trarão suas descobertas a este grupo em 13 de maio.
 Portanto, a grande maioria na nossa reunião de 13 de maio trabalhará nessas recomendações e chegará a acordo sobre esses planos.
 Novamente, estamos no modo de inicialização.
 E depois disso, vamos entrar no âmago da questão de alguns desses documentos em que a administração tem trabalhado e começar a lê-los, falando sobre o que está lá.
 E esse tipo de coisa, mas vamos agir rapidamente.
 Estabelecemos o cronograma da reunião.
 Apenas a título de justificativa, nos encontraremos da melhor maneira possível pessoalmente aqui no show por 89 por.
 De agora até o final de junho.
 Prometo que voltaremos às noites de segunda-feira no início do próximo ano letivo, mas de agora até o final de junho, entre as reuniões do comitê escolar e as férias, foi completamente impossível manter esse tipo de horário.
 Nos reuniremos apenas via Zoom no verão e, na verdade, mudaremos as reuniões para as quartas-feiras.
 tendo em conta que às segundas e sextas-feiras no Verão é realmente muito difícil conseguir quórum de alguém para fazer alguma coisa.
 Espero que possamos fazer isso funcionar, mas tentei manter a agenda de reuniões leve.
 Penso que haverá mais subcomités até ao final de Agosto, mas isto foi apenas um começo para as pessoas tentarem organizar as suas vidas ocupadas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sim.
 Então, duas coisas.
 No entanto, essa é uma questão indireta.
 Se você não consegue fazer isso,
 Ok, envie também um e-mail com todas as suas ideias e comentários para compartilhar suas vozes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Na verdade, esta é uma questão técnica.
 Um cavalheiro que não pode comparecer à reunião lhe envia um e-mail expondo suas idéias e recomendações, possivelmente até mesmo uma decisão.
 Anteriormente, ouvimos que e-mails são uma má ideia para quase tudo, exceto para definição de agenda.
 E isso soa como uma área cinzenta.
 Fiquei me perguntando se você perdeu uma reunião aberta e essas duas coisas estão em conflito.
 Como funciona?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Portanto, posso lhe dizer que acho que qualquer advogado lhe diria para nunca colocar nada por escrito.
 Então é aí que começamos.
 Nunca coloque nada por escrito.
 Dito isto, se você vai colocar algo por escrito,
 É como nesse tipo de cenário, sim, é uma área cinzenta.
 O que você deve fazer é entrar em contato com alguém e dizer: ei, posso lhe enviar minhas ideias?
 E você já conversou sobre essas coisas com mais alguém ou pretende falar?
 E você pode ter certeza razoável de que tem um ciclo fechado, certo?
 É isso que você me diz, posso te mandar minha opinião?
 E eu digo que sim.
 E eu digo, não vou falar com mais ninguém sobre essas questões, então ficaremos bem.
 Isso só se torna um problema quando você se conecta com um número de pessoas que representam a maioria dos votos no comitê.
 Se, por exemplo, você disser: Quero contar para duas pessoas porque não tenho certeza de quem comparecerá à reunião, tudo bem, porque você tem menos de oito anos.
 Depois de falar consigo mesmo, incluindo oito pessoas, você está em apuros.
 Foi quando você violou a lei de reuniões abertas.
 A parte complicada é que todos os envolvidos devem ter a mesma compreensão de quem esteve envolvido naquela conversa.
 O que eu perdi?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: Eu perdi isso no meu post na caixa.
 você pode ser muito intencional.
 Eu apenas te conto e você diz, aha.
 E se você fizer a mesma coisa, estaremos todos infringindo a lei, não importa o que tenhamos feito para tentar evitá-lo.
 Então, acho que isso é verdade para todos os cidadãos cumpridores da lei.
 A deliberação em série não se preocupa com nada, nem com o conteúdo, nem com os planos, nem com o seguro.
 Somos só nós dois, certo?
 Você vai e viola isso.
 Eu quebrei tantas leis.
 Mesmo que eu não saiba,
 Bom, bom.
 Bem, sim, essa é praticamente a minha pergunta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Forneceremos a todos um endereço de e-mail das Escolas Públicas de Medford e recomendo fortemente que você não use seu e-mail pessoal em nenhuma circunstância para qualquer negócio relacionado ao MSBA.
 Assim que esses e-mails estiverem configurados, converteremos tudo.
 Mas recomendo fortemente que você não utilize seu e-mail pessoal para nada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: Isso torna o cumprimento dos registros públicos muito mais fácil.
 Eu era o oficial de acesso aos registros do distrito escolar.
 Qualquer documento que seja oficial da escola, exceto suas anotações pessoais, é um registro público que deve poder ser fornecido automaticamente ou pelo menos revisado se alguém solicitar.
 Portanto, fazer tudo isso no endereço de e-mail das Escolas Públicas de Medford, no pacote Google das Escolas Públicas de Medford, onde você pode fazer anotações e coisas assim, é realmente útil para conter tudo nesse espaço.
 Não compartilhe com outras pessoas.
 Não envie seu rascunho, seu rascunho por e-mail.
 Não é um lugar para escrever notas privadas.
 Bom.
 Não colocamos ninguém no sentido.
 Isso é verdade.
 Bom.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7198.191s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Alguma última pergunta?
 São 8.03.
