    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=0.391s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Bienvenidos a todos.
 Estamos aquí.
 Lo logramos.
 Eso es realmente emocionante.
 Gracias a todos por venir.
 Sólo a modo de planes para esta noche, vamos a salir a las ocho.
 Nos vamos antes de las ocho.
 Voy a cambiar un poco la agenda porque Janelle de KP Law está aquí para realizar una reunión abierta de capacitación jurídica.
 Así que por el momento nos saltaremos las presentaciones.
 para que Janelle pueda hacer una reunión abierta mientras entrena porque tiene un compromiso para la segunda mitad de esta reunión.
 Así que quería asegurarme de que haya tiempo suficiente para que ella lo haga.
 Pero antes de hacer eso, voy a pasar lista rápidamente para que, para que conste, sepamos quién está aquí.
 Aquí Jenny Graham.
 ¿Alcalde Lungo-Koehn?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=44.223s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Aquí.</p>

 Aquí.
 ¿Libby Brown?
 Aquí.
 Marissa Desmond, María Dorsey, Brian Hilliard.
 Él está ausente.
 Tracy Keene y Emily Lazzaro están ausentes.
 Tiene una reunión del consejo esta noche.
 Nicole Morell está ausente.
 Ella tuvo un conflicto previo.
 Um, Aaron hará una fiesta aquí.
 Luke Prisner, Larry Brown, Bob Dickinson.
 Él no está aquí esta noche.
 Fiona Maxwell.
 Joan Bowen, Thomas Dalton, Chad Fallon vienen, creo, Lori Hodgton, Don McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau y Philip Santos no están presentes esta noche.
 También tuvo una conferencia.
 Entonces tenemos quórum.
 En tan solo unos minutos aprenderá por qué esto es importante.
 Pero se lo voy a pasar a Janelle en sólo un segundo.
 Pero creo que comenzaré diciendo que todas nuestras reuniones están sujetas a la ley de reuniones abiertas.
 Y con cuatro años de experiencia en el sector de reuniones abiertas, es una forma muy complicada de realizar el trabajo.
 Así que sólo voy a decir que esa es mi experiencia personal.
 Está ahí por una razón.
 Es absolutamente necesario, pero requerirá que todos ustedes piensen cuidadosamente no sólo en lo que dicen y hacen en la reunión, sino más importante aún, en cómo se comportan fuera de nuestras reuniones porque
 Sin darte cuenta, puedes encontrarte en conflicto con la ley de reuniones abiertas.
 MSB requiere que llevemos a cabo todas nuestras reuniones de acuerdo con la ley de reuniones abiertas.
 Así que pensamos que era importante que todos tuvieran algún tipo de base en todo eso.
 Los funcionarios electos en la sala obviamente están familiarizados con la ley de reuniones abiertas y pueden brindar orientación a cualquiera que tenga preguntas.
 Acabo de inscribirlos para eso.
 Les diría a los educadores en la sala que generalmente interactúan con el comité escolar todo el tiempo.
 Y generalmente usted no está sujeto a la ley de reuniones abiertas, pero en esta sala y en este tema sí lo está.
 Así que es simplemente una especie de ajuste de su conjunto de responsabilidades de esta manera.
 Así que se lo voy a pasar a Janelle.
 Janelle, si pudieras decirnos si quieres hacer preguntas durante el proceso o si quieres que guardemos nuestras preguntas hasta que hayas terminado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=186.9s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 Volveremos a algunas presentaciones.
 Este es un grupo grande.
 Somos 25 en total.
 Tenemos algunos miembros que no pueden estar aquí esta noche y que me lo avisaron con antelación para ponernos al día.
 Pero esperaba que pudiéramos recorrer la sala y usted pudiera presentarse y hablar muy brevemente sobre cómo ve su papel en el comité y asegurarse de que
 todos en la sala llegan a conocerte si tienes un rol oficial de capacidad en las escuelas en las que quizás no te hayan conocido antes.
 Entonces Peter, ¿quieres empezar?
 Seguro.</p>

 Voy a cumplir 38 años trabajando para las Escuelas Públicas de Metro.
 Lo espero con ansias.
 Estaba en el laboratorio de ciencias cuando hicimos el laboratorio de ciencias MSBA de la escuela secundaria.

 Soy un profesional de las comunicaciones con carrera en el gobierno estatal y local.
 Pero cuando todavía vivía en mi ciudad natal de Stoneham, también serví como miembro del comité escolar en Stoneham.
 Durante ese tiempo, comenzamos el proceso con la MSBA para la nueva escuela secundaria Stonewall que abrirá en septiembre.
 En particular, este período del proceso de MSBA me resulta muy familiar.
 Yo estaba sirviendo como miembro del comité escolar durante ese período.
 Ciertamente, estoy muy entusiasmado con todas las oportunidades que tendremos para colaborar con el estado para recopilar muchos aportes locales realmente buenos.
 Es realmente emocionante.
 Hola a todos.
 Soy Pablo Russo.
 Estoy en el comité escolar de miembros.
 Este es mi séptimo año.
 Debo decir que estoy bastante impresionado.</p>

 Llevo 12 años viviendo en Medford.
 Trabajo profesionalmente como gerente senior de instalaciones y teatro, supervisando las operaciones diarias de un centro de artes escénicas en un campus público.
 Actualmente soy parte de un equipo que construye un nuevo teatro al otro lado del río en Austin.
 La primera piedra fue hace sólo un par de meses, un par de semanas.
 Así que aporto algunas operaciones diarias, gestión de instalaciones y recursos.

 Trabajo aquí en Mead High School como bibliotecaria de la escuela.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3443.751s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Llevo 28 años en las escuelas.
 He vivido en Medford durante 43 años.
 Mi marido es residente de toda la vida.
 Y estuve involucrado, así que siento que he estado en Medford todo el tiempo.
 Estaba trabajando en la antigua Brooks-Hobbs cuando hicimos la transición de allí a la nueva Biblioteca McGlynn.
 Y luego, dos años después, hice la transición a la nueva biblioteca de la escuela Brooks.
 Y en 2010, hice la transición a la antigua escuela secundaria, lo cual fue todo un shock.
 Pero cuando estábamos en el proceso de construcción de las otras escuelas, yo no estaba en el comité, pero sí participé en algunas de las visitas guiadas en otros edificios.
 Y vi esos eventos semanales de Jack Buckley a tiempo y dentro del presupuesto.
 Eso fue simplemente asombroso.
 Y realmente estaba tan fascinado por todo el proceso.
 Y veo mi papel como la parte funcional del edificio, cómo va a funcionar para los estudiantes, los profesores y, por supuesto, mi deleite de espacio personal.
 Hola a todos.
 Soy Libby Brown.
 Soy arquitecto.
 He vivido en Medford durante casi 10 años.
 Y estoy muy emocionado ahora que mis hijos están en la escuela, que este es un proyecto que está cobrando vida, y estoy muy emocionado de ser parte de él.
 Trabajo principalmente en educación, principalmente en educación superior, pero también en educación privada K-12.
 No tengo exactamente experiencia en MSBA, pero hemos trabajado en MSCBA, por lo que un poco en el lado de la educación superior.
 Simplemente creo que esta es una maravillosa oportunidad para Medford.
 Trabajo mucho con educadores, bibliotecarios y personas desde la programación hasta el diseño conceptual y la construcción, especialmente con muchas renovaciones por fases y evaluación de las instalaciones existentes, ya sea que las mantengas y las renueves, las derribes, hagas ambas cosas, lo hagas todo a la vez y cualquier cosa intermedia.
 Así que éste es un proyecto apasionante.
 Me alegro de estar aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3566.699s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Soy Larry Brown, un ciudadano medio a un par de manzanas de distancia.
 Así que no sé exactamente dónde voy a encajar en todo esto, pero tengo mucha experiencia en construcción, planificación y desarrollo de sitios principalmente residenciales, pero también comerciales.
 No mencionaré todo eso, pero si alguien quiere conocer mis antecedentes, puedo hablar más al respecto.
 Pero supongo que mi interés es como ayudarte en el proceso, porque he hecho este tipo de cosas en una variedad de niveles, no específicamente para una escuela, sino para otros tipos de proyectos.
 Como acaba de señalar, hay muchos factores aquí.
 Y todo esto debe hacerse de forma secuencial.
 No podemos simplemente saltar hasta el final.
 Y si puedo ayudar con ese proceso, estaré feliz de hacerlo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3620.523s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Larry, también eres un profesor jubilado de secundaria vocacional de Medford que también trabaja aquí de vez en cuando.</p>

 También formo parte del comité escolar aquí en Medford.
 Me gradué de la promoción de 2018 de Medford High, así que ya sabes, hace un par de años y me acabo de graduar de la universidad de BC en mayo pasado.
 Gran parte del trabajo que he realizado en los últimos dos años ha sido principalmente la participación de la comunidad, principalmente la participación de los jóvenes.
 Me tomé un año sabático y trabajé para City Year Boston, por lo que trabajaba como profesora en el sistema escolar de Charlestown.
 y luego también hice mucho trabajo comunitario a través de eso mientras estaba en la universidad.
 Desde entonces, me acaban de nombrar nuevo director del Programa de Empleo Juvenil de la ciudad de Malden.
 Así que trabajo en la oficina del alcalde, tratando de que los niños tengan acceso a oportunidades laborales.
 Entonces, si tienes niños que estén interesados, házmelo saber.
 Intentaré conseguirles un trabajo para el verano y el año escolar.
 Así que estoy muy emocionado de estar aquí.
 Creo que muchas de las cosas en las que me estoy centrando son, creo, simplemente en la participación de los jóvenes, en garantizar que nuestros estudiantes realmente tengan acceso a lo que se merecen.
 Y creo que eso es lo que todos estamos aquí para hacer.
 Así que estoy emocionado por todos nosotros.</p>

 Entonces veo esto como una oportunidad para expandir nuestra programación, con suerte agregando tres o cuatro programas adicionales a nuestro menú de opciones.

 Pero tengo muchas ganas de que llegue esto.
 En mi trabajo diario, soy dueño de una empresa de consultoría de gestión.
 Trabajo mucho en la mejora de procesos, el diseño y la impartición de aprendizaje para adultos, así como en la gestión de proyectos.
 Entonces soy un gerente de proyectos certificado, no en construcción.
 Pero sí sé cómo llevar a un grupo grande de personas hacia una meta.
 Y eso es lo que estoy aquí para hacer.
 Entonces, muchas de las cosas de las que hablaba Janelle son roles que yo debo asumir en términos de actas.
 Y hablaremos de todo eso a su debido tiempo.

 Creo que tal vez me concentro demasiado en las cosas y por eso investigo mucho.
 Bonito, no diría familiar, pero soy consciente de cómo estos esfuerzos complejos pueden descarrilarse y tomar mucho más tiempo del que deberían.
 Y entonces, profesionalmente, soy ingeniero de sistemas.
 Trabajo en la industria aeroespacial, estoy familiarizado con la complejidad y la atención al proceso.
 Ciertamente, creo
 Mi función será simplemente hacer algunas preguntas innovadoras.
 Sé que tenemos muchas personas aquí que trabajan directamente para las escuelas o tienen alguna conexión fuerte con el distrito escolar, por lo que quizás analice un problema en particular desde una perspectiva diferente y le daré voz.
 Tal vez sea productivo, tal vez sea solo un trozo de espagueti que se deslice de la pared.
 Pero creo que ese es mi papel aquí, una especie de papel externo, pero ciertamente motivado para traer una nueva escuela secundaria a Medford.
 Gracias.</p>

 Por eso estoy muy emocionado de haber sido profesor de secundaria, director en Vermont, director en Western Mass, North Shore y luego en una escuela autónoma.
 Siempre estuve al final de un proyecto de construcción cuando era estudiante en Middlebury, Vermont y vi cómo sucedía.
 Todos llevábamos botas y mi hermano pudo aprovechar los beneficios del edificio.
 Siento que siempre he estado en el principio.
 o al final de algo.
 Y creo que es realmente emocionante.
 Creo que la capacidad, no todos los pueblos o ciudades, de construir un nuevo edificio escolar y pensar en el futuro, especialmente con los estudiantes con los que estoy trabajando actualmente, ese acceso en términos de equidad y tipo de capital y recursos culturales para nuestros estudiantes, creo que será realmente importante.
 Me gustó lo que dijo Jenny, algo de co-localización, o quienquiera que haya surgido, me encanta eso, de pensar en que nuestros estudiantes actuales realmente sean parte de la estructura de este edificio en el futuro.
 Se lo merecen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4186.071s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: Hola a todos, soy Jill Bowen.
 Soy Director de Servicios Estudiantiles aquí en las Escuelas Públicas de Bedford.
 Soy residente de por vida y empleado de por vida.
 Este es mi 31º año aquí en Bedford.
 Y he recorrido toda la gama de maestro, líder del equipo de evaluación, coordinador y ahora en este puesto.
 También tuve dos hijos que se graduaron de las Escuelas Públicas de Medford.
 Uno siguió la ruta universitaria, el otro siguió la carrera vocacional.
 Así que estoy muy emocionado de ver la visión de esta nueva escuela secundaria y lo que puede aportar a Medford y a nuestros estudiantes, pero también de aprovechar lo que dijo Laurie, la equidad y la accesibilidad para todos nuestros estudiantes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Hola, soy Susanne Kalusi.
 Este es mi año 27.
 Así que yo también nací y crecí en mi tercer mes de escuela.
 Ya no vivo aquí, pero toda mi carrera ha sido aquí.
 Comencé como maestra y subdirectora, líder escolar en Brooks, superintendente asistente de escuelas primarias y ahora superintendente asistente de asuntos académicos y construcción.
 Al igual que el artículo de Marta, estoy muy emocionado de poder trabajar con todos ustedes en la región de instrucción de las escuelas.
 Creo que alguien que era María habló un poco sobre eso.
 Entonces, ya sabes, mi padre era el director de proyecto de los edificios K a ocho.
 Así que siento que he vivido un poco ambos lados de esto, pero siendo lo suficientemente bendecido
 Para ser uno de los maestros en la nueva Escuela McGlynn, en ese momento de 2001, fue fantástico también ver cómo se desarrollaba todo ese proceso como educador y ser una de las personas en las nuevas escuelas.
 Por eso creo que el papel fundamental que todos desempeñamos, estas grandes decisiones que afectarán a nuestros educadores, nuestros estudiantes, nuestras familias, nuestra comunidad, es muy importante para mí.
 toma esto muy en serio.
 Y me siento muy honrado de ser parte del equipo y poder trabajar con todos ustedes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4322.786s">[Unidentified]</a>: Gracias.
 Buenas noches, Marisa Parkinson.
 Yo también nací en la misma calle de Lawrence.
 Mi familia y mi madre todavía están aquí en la misma calle de West Medford.
 Y comencé la escuela en Medford.
 Empecé en la Escuela Harvey.
 Tomé un camino diferente.
 Terminé en St.
 Ray y Casey.
 Soy demasiado católico, pero ya sabes, trabajé en Johnny's Foodmaster en Westlake.
 Duggar Park era mi parque local.
 Y sabes, me encantan las escuelas.
 Amo a los niños.
 Amo la educación.
 Llevo 30 años en la educación.
 Eso da bastante miedo, porque tenía como 29 años.
 Esa es mi respuesta preferida.
 Así que creo que tendré que hacer un ajuste.
 Pero estoy muy entusiasmado con lo que esto significa: conseguir una nueva escuela secundaria para Medford.
 Sé que en el momento en que se construyó este edificio, era como, ya sabes, probablemente como el Taj Mahal.
 Era una hermosa escuela secundaria.
 Pero, ya sabes, más de 50 años después, necesitamos algo nuevo.
 Y siento que nuestros estudiantes se lo merecen.
 Y tenemos una maravillosa programación vocacional.
 Tenemos una programación académica maravillosa, pero en un edificio muy antiguo.
 Y tenemos un maravilloso programa Curtis House, que está ubicado en una instalación diferente.
 Tenemos maravillosas opciones para la primera infancia y nuestro programa preescolar para el personal que se aloja aquí.
 Y somos afortunados de tener esas cosas en Medford.
 Y siento que Medford es esta pequeña joya.
 Y tener una nueva escuela secundaria emblemática hará mucho por nuestros estudiantes, por la comunidad y por el futuro de nuestra comunidad, en general, la comunidad en general.
 Y espero ser parte de este proceso y trabajar con todos los que están aquí y vivir mis diferentes experiencias.
 sumando mi voz con todas las voces que ya están aquí.
 Y para el alcalde y miembro Graham, al llegar a este grupo de 25, había tantos candidatos maravillosamente calificados que era como otro ingeniero, otro ingeniero, otro arquitecto.
 Pero para llegar a este grupo de personas como,
 personas maravillosas y estoy muy, muy agradecido.
 Quiero agradecer a Luke, quien comenzó el proceso con nosotros hace dos años, creo, y, ya sabes, aguantó y siempre estuvo controlando.
 Así que espero con ansias este proceso y realmente quiero que nos mantengamos positivos y optimistas sobre lo que está por venir.
 Y miembro Ramjani, no sé si quieres compartir con ellos sobre el filtro.
 que tomaste y lo emocionante que fue.
 Y será más emocionante para el resto del equipo ir y tener experiencias similares.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4528.482s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Seguro.
 Gracias a todos por el...
 palabras de emoción.
 Quiero hacer un par de cosas desde ahora hasta las 8 p.m.
 Y saldremos a las 8, lo prometo.
 Pero sólo como una rápida comprobación del tiempo, dos cosas importantes.
 Una es que quiero darles una idea de lo que ha estado sucediendo.
 hasta hoy y dónde nos encontramos en el proceso.
 Entonces voy a hablar un poco sobre eso.
 Vamos a hacer una presentación rápida para hacer eso.
 Y luego, antes de irnos esta noche, formaremos algunos subcomités para que podamos avanzar rápidamente en parte del trabajo a corto plazo que necesitamos hacer.
 Así que hablaremos de eso en sólo un minuto.
 Pero Peter, si puedes mencionarme esa presentación, sería genial.
 DE ACUERDO.
 Puedes avanzar un par de páginas.
 Sigue así, uno más.
 Aquí vamos.
 Comenzamos en febrero, así que en diciembre, la MSBA nos invitó al período de elegibilidad.
 Y hablaremos sobre lo que significa el período de elegibilidad en solo un par de minutos.
 Pero esa invitación decía: estás invitado a este proceso, que comienza el 1 de mayo.
 Así que mañana empezamos.
 Sin embargo, el comité me nombró presidente de este comité de construcción en febrero y se ha realizado mucho trabajo hasta ahora.
 Una de las cosas que teníamos que hacer era encontrarlos a todos, ¿verdad?
 Entonces, en el contexto de tratar de decir qué es lo que queremos como comité escolar que haga este comité de construcción, establecimos una lista de objetivos.
 Habrá muchos, muchos más objetivos, pero quería sentar las bases para,
 el trabajo que vamos a hacer para el próximo.
 cinco a siete años.
 El primero es planificar de manera integral toda la programación que actualmente reside en el campus de Medford High School, incluida la educación vocacional y no vocacional de 9 a 12, el atletismo de 9 a 12, Medford Family Network, la programación de las Escuelas Comunitarias de Medford, la educación de la primera infancia, incluido, entre otros, el Programa de Educación Temprana de Medford, que llamamos MEAP y Kids' Corner.
 Entonces, sucede mucho más en este edificio de lo que pensamos cuando pensamos en una escuela secundaria.
 Así que eso es algo en lo que todos ustedes deben empezar a pensar.
 Número dos, ¿qué es eso?
 ¿Puedo tomarlo?
 Gracias.
 Ah, sí, y puedo compartir las diapositivas.
 No, no, puedo compartir las diapositivas.
 Sí, puedo compartir todas las diapositivas contigo después.
 El número dos es considerar si la ubicación de Curtis Tufts High School en el campus de Medford brindará mayores oportunidades educativas a los estudiantes matriculados en Curtis Tufts.
 Número tres, garantizar aportes públicos sólidos y comentarios de las partes interesadas en los hitos apropiados a lo largo del proyecto que cumplan con las pautas de MSBA y la orientación del Comité Escolar de Medford.
 Escuche los comentarios de educadores y administradores sobre el futuro de las mejores prácticas y planes educativos para los estudiantes de Medford.
 Eso significa que nos preocupamos mucho por la funcionalidad.
 Por eso queremos saber si los espacios funcionarán para los estudiantes y los profesores en el edificio.
 Es realmente muy importante.
 Um, número cinco, crear planes para el edificio que promuevan métodos, objetivos climáticos y logre todos los chips y lidere la certificación de la versión cinco para cumplir con los objetivos de los Acuerdos Climáticos de París 2030 y 2050 y avance de manera eficiente y efectiva a través del proceso de construcción de una manera que garantice que los estudiantes puedan aprender en el nuevo edificio lo más rápido posible.
 entonces
 Esa es una tarea enorme.
 Lo más rápido posible todavía se mide en años y no en meses.
 Pero en el contexto de la creación de este comité, una vez que fui designado presidente, lanzamos la convocatoria de solicitudes, comenzamos a recopilar solicitudes y todos ustedes están aquí.
 Mientras tanto, hay mucho trabajo por hacer en la fase de elegibilidad que ya hemos comenzado.
 Así que hablaremos de eso en sólo un minuto.
 Pero si puedes pasar a la siguiente diapositiva.
 Gráfico realmente basura que no explotó muy bien en el sitio web.
 Pero como estamos hablando de todo el proceso, estamos fuera de la caja por otras seis horas.
 El 1 de mayo, ingresaremos dentro del cuadro a ese período de elegibilidad.
 En cada uno de estos pasos del proceso,
 La MSBA tendrá que aprobar que hemos completado todos los requisitos de esa fase.
 Tendrá que haber una junta directiva donde voten para invitarnos a la siguiente fase.
 Entonces, en cualquier punto de este proceso, la MSBA podría decir que no está listo para seguir adelante.
 También podrían decir: no nos gusta lo que estás haciendo.
 Y también podrían decir, olvídalo.
 Entonces nuestro trabajo aquí es que ninguna de esas cosas suceda.
 Nuestro trabajo es jugar limpio, ser integrales y avanzar tan rápido como sea humanamente posible.
 Bien, entonces vamos a darle una oportunidad a la MSBA porque estaremos listos para ellos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4847.483s">[Unidentified]</a>: Ya veremos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4849.904s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Pero ese período de elegibilidad dura 270 días.
 Entonces, para enero tenemos que terminar con la fase de elegibilidad.
 Voy a hablar un poco de lo que pasa en esa fase.
 Más allá de la fase de elegibilidad, brevemente, cuando hablamos de formar el equipo del proyecto, eso significa incorporar al gerente de proyecto de nuestro propietario.
 Luego pasamos al estudio de viabilidad.
 Cuando la gente piensa en lo que estamos haciendo en este comité, piensan que estamos haciendo un estudio de viabilidad ahora mismo.
 Creen que estamos decidiendo, ¿estamos construyendo?
 ¿Estamos renovando?
 ¿Dónde estamos construyendo?
 ¿Está en el campo?
 ¿Está en el estacionamiento?
 ¿Cómo va a funcionar?
 Aún no hemos llegado a ese punto.
 Así que por favor díselo a todos tus amigos, llegaremos allí y trabajaremos con profesionales.
 para ayudar a hacer esas evaluaciones en nombre de lo que necesitamos hacer en este edificio.
 Y luego pasaremos al diseño esquemático, financiando los proyectos.
 Ahí es donde votamos como comunidad para financiar este proyecto.
 No puedo enfatizar lo importante que será, pero también tenemos mucho trabajo que hacer antes de llegar allí.
 Una vez que eso sucede, entramos en el diseño detallado.
 Luego metemos una pala en el suelo.
 Y luego, en algún momento en el futuro, completaremos el proyecto.
 Así que esa es una especie de sopa de nueces.
 Mi objetivo es que vayamos paso a paso.
 Vamos a hacer lo que sea necesario para cumplir con el período de elegibilidad.
 Y luego vamos a seguir adelante.
 A medida que nos acercamos a la siguiente fase, comenzaremos a hablar sobre cómo podemos acelerar el trabajo.
 Pero por ahora, nuestro enfoque es la elegibilidad.
 Entonces, si puedes pasar a la página siguiente,
 El proceso de elegibilidad tiene su propio gráfico, que no puedes ver.
 Así que continúa y pasa a la siguiente diapositiva.
 Bueno.
 Entonces hay cinco cosas que tienen que suceder en esta fase.
 Una es la certificación de cumplimiento inicial.
 Es un acuerdo legal que obliga a la ciudad a cumplir con el proceso de la MSBA.
 Ha sido firmado y entregado a la MSBA.
 Estamos un día por delante de lo previsto y eso lo voy a reconocer.
 Gracias, alcalde y superintendente.
 Estamos en camino.
 Número dos, hay que formar el comité de construcción.
 Estáis todos aquí.
 El comité escolar dijo que nos reuniéramos antes del 1 de mayo y aquí estamos el 30 de abril.
 Lo hemos hecho.
 El formulario se enviará a la MSBA en breve.
 Así que estamos trabajando en eso y lo enviaremos en breve.
 Obviamente esa es la parte fácil.
 Es papeleo.
 Toda la fase de elegibilidad implica mucho papeleo, pero esto es lo más fácil, y simplemente lo haremos y lo eliminaremos del camino.
 La MSBA deberá aprobar nuestro comité.
 Hemos cumplido con todos los requisitos, por lo que la MSBA tiene todo tipo de cosas que nos exige en términos de quién está en este comité.
 Hemos cumplido todos esos requisitos con todos ustedes aquí.
 Ahora vamos a sumergirnos en el trabajo real.
 Hay tres cosas adicionales que tienen que suceder.
 Uno es lo que llaman perfil educativo.
 Es un documento modelo y requiere que digamos: ¿qué sucede hoy en este edificio?
 ¿Cuántas aulas?
 ¿Cuántas aulas de matemáticas?
 ¿Cuántos espacios provisionales?
 ¿Qué tamaño tiene tu teatro?
 Todo eso, ¿verdad?
 Por eso le pide que describa lo que sucede actualmente en este edificio.
 También le pide que describa lo que imagina para el futuro de este edificio.
 Entonces aquí es donde esas conversaciones sobre Curtis Tufts, esas conversaciones sobre la primera infancia se vuelven muy, muy importantes.
 Porque entre nuestra declaración de interés y esta fase de elegibilidad, el perfil educativo, eso marcará la pauta de cómo todos los profesionales de la construcción realmente pueden hacer su trabajo.
 Así que esto establecerá el alcance, por así decirlo, del trabajo que debe realizarse para que este edificio se levante.
 Así que hay mucho trabajo que se ha hecho ahora en este proceso.
 Me he estado reuniendo con el equipo administrativo desde febrero.
 Nos reunimos varias veces a la semana.
 Están muy hartos de mí.
 Estaría harto de mí.
 Pero una de las cosas que hemos empezado a hacer es decir: ¿qué podemos eliminar?
 Por eso el documento está bastante bien redactado en lo que respecta a
 ¿Qué hacemos en este edificio?
 Se han contado todas las aulas.
 Todos los programas han sido delineados.
 La administración tiene un poco más de trabajo por hacer en términos de lo que sucede hoy para describir eso con precisión.
 La otra cosa que obviamente es mucho más complicada es tener una conversación sobre qué haremos en este edificio en el futuro.
 Entonces, en esa conversación, nuevamente, hemos tenido una conversación muy amplia.
 Hemos estado aprovechando las partes de nuestro cerebro de planificación estratégica para hacer grandes preguntas.
 Y voy a utilizar Curtis Tufts sólo por un minuto.
 Hemos tenido algunas discusiones sobre si nuestros educadores creen que es algo en lo que deberíamos pensar y la respuesta es sí, dijeron que sí, deberíamos pensar en eso.
 Y entonces comenzamos a decir: "Está bien, ¿cómo se vería eso?".
 los requisitos sean.
 Así que comenzamos esa conversación, pero esa conversación es más grande de lo que este comité puede analizar porque en cierto modo incursiona en las responsabilidades del comité escolar.
 Entonces, anoche presenté una resolución pidiendo a nuestro subcomité de educación especial y salud conductual, que en realidad está presidido por el miembro Rousseau, que se reúna en un cronograma muy ajustado para recopilar aportes y comentarios.
 sobre ese tema tan limitado.
 ¿La ubicación conjunta de Curtis-Tufts en este campus sería beneficiosa de alguna manera para los resultados educativos de los estudiantes que asisten a Curtis-Tufts?
 Hay otro residente de Medford que habló anoche.
 Está a cargo de un programa muy comparable en Somerville.
 Habló sobre esta transición que acaba de ocurrir en Somerville y cómo hizo explotar su población.
 Ha cambiado el juego para los estudiantes que necesitan ese entorno alternativo en términos de acceso a cosas como equipos deportivos, en nuestro caso, los programas vocacionales.
 Entonces hay una oportunidad enorme, enorme, pero
 Queremos asegurarnos de que la comunidad y el comité tengan alguna oportunidad de pensar en todo lo que podría aportar y brindar una recomendación a este comité.
 Así que anoche eso se transmitió oficialmente al subcomité de educación especial.
 Se encontrarán.
 Invitarán al personal actual, a los estudiantes actuales, a los exalumnos,
 miembros de la comunidad, etc., y Jack Hevery de Somerville para que vengan y hablen y resuelvan eso y brinden una recomendación para que estén en camino y que regresen a mediados de junio para que tengan mucho trabajo por delante, pero eso nos ayudará a informar.
 la redacción de esa parte de lo que imaginamos para esta escuela.
 Porque lo que probablemente necesitaremos no son sólo un par de aulas en algún lugar del edificio.
 Parte del éxito de Curtis Tufts se debe a que el entorno es considerablemente diferente al de este campus muy, muy grande con 1200 estudiantes.
 Así que tendremos que pensar detenidamente cómo lo elaboramos, pero esperamos que el trabajo que hace el subcomité regrese a nosotros y pueda canalizarse.
 Marta y Chad asistirán a una futura reunión del comité escolar en las próximas semanas y Marta hablará sobre algunas de sus ideas para programación alternativa y cómo podría ser todo eso incluso en el corto plazo.
 Y eso es algo que habrá que incorporar.
 Joan, Suzanne, Paul y yo tuvimos una conversación ayer sobre la educación temprana.
 Nuestras escuelas primarias están a punto de estallar.
 Tendremos que lidiar con ese problema en algún momento.
 MEEP solía estar alojado aquí.
 Y vamos a explorar un caso que dice que MEAP debería volver aquí y que puede ser o no en última instancia donde aterrizamos, pero eso es algo que estamos explorando porque ahora es el momento.
 También hablamos mucho sobre los estudiantes que no tienen ningún tipo de educación preescolar y cuando ingresan a nuestras escuelas públicas.
 cuán desafiante es la entrada para esos estudiantes.
 Y entonces también estamos hablando de cosas como ¿cuán grande es la lista de espera?
 ¿Y cuántos estudiantes vienen a nosotros que nunca han estado en algún tipo de entorno de prekínder?
 ¿Y qué tipo de capacidad necesitaríamos para dar servicio a un programa de educación temprana más amplio e integral desde este edificio?
 Porque todo eso tendría que incluirse en este documento.
 Entonces estamos trabajando en eso.
 Entonces, mientras estas cosas suceden, se ha trabajado mucho hasta la fecha en este perfil educativo.
 La gran pieza del perfil educativo que aún no hemos tocado es la estrategia de comunicación.
 Hablaré de eso en sólo un minuto.
 Pero en el lado de la educación, hay mucho que nuestros educadores tienen que hacer para que podamos elaborar ese documento.
 Sólo quiero que todos sepan que todo está en proceso.
 Y a medida que avancemos en nuestras próximas reuniones, presentaremos esos documentos para que podamos comenzar a hacer una lectura más amplia de esos documentos, pedir sugerencias y asegurarnos de que realmente estamos pensando en todos los ángulos de lo que necesitamos describir.
 Y ahí es donde creo que todos ustedes desempeñan un papel muy importante al decir:
 Creo que es necesario describir lo que estamos haciendo aquí de manera un poco diferente según lo que sé o según cuál es la visión para los programas artísticos o para los programas vocacionales, etcétera, etcétera.
 Entonces ahí es donde estamos en el perfil educativo.
 La ubicación compartida de Curtis Tufts está en el subcomité.
 El otro gran tema nuevo, novedoso y cambiante es MEAP.
 Lo que MSBA describe como el motivo de los retrasos que a menudo ocurren en las comunidades es que tienen que tomar decisiones muy importantes que alimentan su proceso de construcción.
 ¿Combinamos dos escuelas?
 Y eso obviamente tiene su propia energía y su propio conjunto de requisitos, lo que hace que sea muy difícil poder
 muévete rápidamente.
 Así que estamos tratando de pensar en grande porque esta es una oportunidad única para pensar en lo que el distrito realmente necesita de una manera muy integral, pero también para avanzar lo más rápido posible.
 Así que todo ese trabajo ha estado en progreso y avanzando tan rápido como es humanamente posible.
 Y Peter, ¿puedes pasar a la siguiente diapositiva?
 De manera muy similar en el aspecto vocacional, debido a que tenemos una escuela vocacional muy activa, tenemos otro documento que debe completarse, que es la viabilidad del Capítulo 74.
 El capítulo 74 es el capítulo del reglamento que establece los programas vocacionales, ¿no?
 Bueno.
 Esa redacción está en curso.
 Tenemos que decirles, aquí están los programas que tenemos.
 Aquí está la capacidad de esos programas.
 Aquí está nuestra inscripción actual y cosas como cuál es nuestra lista de espera.
 También tenemos la oportunidad de describir la expansión prevista de estos programas.
 Chad y Peter estarán en el comité escolar hablando sobre el potencial de expansión.
 Ése es un asunto del comité escolar porque el programa ampliado requiere mucho más que sólo un edificio.
 Se necesita equipo.
 Se necesita personal.
 Entonces el comité escolar tiene que opinar sobre eso.
 Así que eso se presentará ante el comité escolar el 20 de mayo y alimentará la finalización del formulario del capítulo 70.
 Y este grupo leerá detenidamente y se preparará para eso también.
 Y luego hay una pieza del rompecabezas sobre la cual el alcalde, el superintendente y yo hablaremos con MSBA a finales de esta semana, que en realidad es información sobre planificación urbana.
 Entonces podemos comenzar a introducir información en lo que ellos llaman su estudio de inscripción.
 Eso ayuda a dimensionar el edificio.
 Probablemente hayas escuchado mucho acerca de que este edificio fue construido para 4000 estudiantes y ahora solo hay 1200.
 Si 4.000 era el número o no, no lo sé, pero es cierto que el número es diferente.
 Entonces, una de las cosas que hará la MSBA en la fase de elegibilidad es que dirán: vamos a construir un edificio para tantos estudiantes.
 Esto suele coincidir con algo parecido a lo que sucede hoy en el edificio.
 Sin embargo, si hay una gran expansión planificada en la ciudad en términos de unidades de vivienda en desarrollo, querrán saber todo eso.
 Para que puedan dimensionar el edificio porque no quieren que construyamos un edificio que inmediatamente esté fuera de su capacidad.
 Tampoco quieren que construyamos un edificio que nunca estará lleno.
 Bien.
 Entonces, ese es parte del trabajo que se está realizando allí.
 Cuarta cosa, los documentos de mantenimiento.
 Hay un cuestionario que debemos responder que describe todas nuestras prácticas de mantenimiento en todo el distrito.
 Entonces son cosas como, ¿se vuelve a poner en servicio?
 ¿Y cómo se capacita a su personal?
 Hay como 20 variables.
 Ese documento también está en borrador y avanza tan rápido como es humanamente posible.
 Probablemente llegaremos a eso un poco más tarde en junio.
 Lo último que debemos hacer para considerar que hemos terminado con la elegibilidad es identificar la financiación para el estudio de viabilidad, que probablemente esté entre dos millones y cuarto y dos millones y medio de dólares.
 Aún no estamos preparados para eso, pero estamos haciendo planes.
 El alcalde y yo estamos trabajando en cuál será ese plan desde la perspectiva del grupo de trabajo financiero, para que ese dinero pueda contabilizarse y administrarse tan rápido como sea necesario.
 ¿Preguntas sobre el proceso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5700.456s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Claro, es el quinto, entonces cuando dice autorización local, ¿eso implica que el electorado no vota?
 No.
 ¿Y quiere una mayoría, o eso implica que el gobierno de la ciudad ha identificado la financiación completa?
 Correcto.
 Se reembolsará una parte, pero creo que la autorización tiene que ser por el importe total.
 Los correctos te dirán en qué consiste el reembolso en función de dónde caigamos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=5724.632s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Correcto.
 En cuanto a la viabilidad, esta financiación tendrá que cubrir todos los gastos del estudio de viabilidad, no todo el proyecto, sólo el estudio de viabilidad, que equivale entre dos y dos millones y medio de dólares.
 La ciudad pagará todo ese estudio de viabilidad por adelantado.
 Y luego, una vez que la MSBA certifique nuestra tasa de reembolso para el proyecto y tengamos éxito en todo momento, reembolsarán el estudio de viabilidad que sea proporcional al porcentaje de asignación que nos proporcionen.
 Entonces, sí, usarán la misma fórmula y se postularán para el estudio de viabilidad y reembolsarán a la ciudad.
 Pero la ciudad tiene que afrontar este dinero.
 Entonces lo que tiene que pasar aquí es,
 Tenemos un plan de financiación para eso.
 Um, y deberíamos ser buenos.
 Así que estábamos bien allí, y eso requerirá un voto del concejo municipal para autorizar los fondos y ponerlos en un lugar donde podamos acceder a ellos.
 pero
 Como mencioné, todo esto debe estar terminado para enero.
 Cada uno tiene una fecha límite particular asociada.
 Voy a ser muy agresivo y les diré que quiero que todas estas cosas estén terminadas antes del inicio de clases el próximo año.
 Y siempre que sea posible, quiero que estas cosas estén hechas antes del 30 de junio.
 Por eso nos hemos estado reuniendo, trabajando y presionando.
 Y creo que es importante para nosotros estirarnos.
 Así que estiremos y preparémonos.
 La MSBA tendrá trabajo que hacer en términos de certificar el estudio de inscripción y todo eso.
 Pero quiero que podamos darles todo lo que necesitan para que podamos pasar lo más rápido posible a la siguiente fase.
 ¿Preguntas sobre la línea de tiempo?
 Bueno.
 Así que sólo nos quedan 20 minutos.
 Con ese fin, hemos enumerado al final de la agenda una serie de próximas reuniones del subcomité.
 Me gustaría que pensáramos y priorizáramos dos cosas a medida que avanzamos en esta primera fase.
 Uno es un comité de comunicaciones y participación comunitaria.
 Quiero una especie de subcomité, que no tenga más de siete miembros votantes, pero que un grupo interesado se reúna en un subcomité para realmente poder describir y delinear nuestro proceso de participación comunitaria.
 Creo que todos han visto a personas en la comunidad expresar su preocupación por: ¿Medford va a arruinar esto?
 ¿Va a funcionar?
 ¿Va a suceder?
 Así que es necesario lograr un gran alcance comunitario.
 Y cuanto antes comencemos con eso, más éxito tendremos al final.
 Sin embargo, creo que esta es una conversación más amplia, porque también, en mi opinión, tenemos una gran variedad de juntas y comisiones.
 Muchos de ellos están interesados ​​en este proyecto.
 Por lo tanto, será necesario realizar cierta divulgación para comprender cuándo y cómo involucrarlos para que podamos incluirlo en nuestro plan maestro en el futuro.
 El segundo grupo que me gustaría formar esta noche es el Comité de Reglas e Incorporación.
 Tal como lo dijo Janelle, tenemos que establecer algunas reglas sobre cómo operaremos, particularmente en torno a la participación pública, pero solo en general.
 Espero que este comité tenga un tiempo limitado.
 Espero que puedan reunirse una vez, traer un borrador a este grupo y luego podamos adoptar esas reglas y gestionarlas desde allí.
 Y luego el tercer comité que no se reunirá tan rápido, pero sí se reunirá,
 Usted sabe que antes de finales de junio está el subcomité de finanzas, por lo que será un comité permanente que se reunirá y continuará durante toda la vida del proyecto.
 Es importante tener en cuenta que cuando llegue el momento en que la comunidad tenga que votar.
 Este comité no es donde se realiza ese trabajo.
 Entonces, si estamos hablando de la necesidad final de una exclusión de la deuda para poder financiar este proyecto, este comité no es el que debe aprobar la exclusión de la deuda.
 En realidad, eso no puede suceder aquí.
 Tiene que suceder fuera de este grupo.
 Entonces, este comité de finanzas, lo veo como una aportación y visión sobre cosas como
 Compras, adquisiciones del director de proyectos de nuestro propietario, de nuestros arquitectos, ese tipo de cosas.
 ¿Pero también para ayudar a informar el ajuste de lo que necesitamos para la viabilidad?
 ¿Hay otros costos que debamos tener en cuenta?
 Así que hay algo de trabajo financiero por hacer, aunque no anticipo que ese grupo se reúna hasta un poco más tarde en mayo.
 Así que hablaremos un poco más sobre las Reglas de Orden de Robert y todo eso en nuestra próxima reunión.
 Sé que todos me miran como si dejaras de hablar, por favor.
 Así que creo que lo que me interesa es si hay personas que hayan escuchado alguno de esos temas y hayan dicho que realmente quiero ser parte de
 Uno de esos subcomités, ¿puede identificarse?
 Y también sugeriría cortésmente que los administradores de la escuela tal vez mantengan las manos bajas porque ustedes tienen su propio trabajo que hacer para prepararse para el resto de lo que acabamos de describir.
 Eres 100% bienvenido.
 para participar, pero necesitamos que usted se presente en el comité escolar.
 Necesitamos que John y Peter nos ayuden con esos planes de mantenimiento, etcétera.
 Entonces, si hay personas interesadas en cualquiera de esos otros temas, el comité no puede ser demasiado grande, pero puede tener el tamaño que consideremos necesario para poder realizar el trabajo.
 Entonces esos subcomités los puse en el calendario.
 Nos reuniremos completamente por Zoom esas noches solo para facilitar un poco las cosas.
 Cada uno tendrá un resultado bastante específico para nuestra próxima reunión el 13 de mayo, que será traer un borrador de cuál es su propuesta.
 ¿Hay voluntarios?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6100.412s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sí.
 Para los otros 2.
 especifica cuantos?
 ¿Importa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6105.859s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Creo que puede ser cualquier número de personas.
 No puede haber más de siete miembros votantes.
 Pero creo que si literalmente eliminamos a todo el personal de la escuela, no me preocupa demasiado que tropecemos con eso.
 Pero estoy más interesado en que las personas hagan las cosas que consideran adecuadas para el trabajo que están haciendo, para el trabajo que les apasiona.
 Gracias.
 María.
 Comunicaciones.
 Gracias.
 Tracy.
 Normas.
 Bueno.
 Comunicaciones.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6146.461s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Quiero decir, podría poner dos y ver si son suficientes.
 Yo me dedicaría a comunicaciones o finanzas.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6154.444s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Bueno.
 Te voy a poner en finanzas.
 ¿Cómo suena eso?

 ¿Algún otro interesado en estos comités?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6182.816s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Si no consigues suficiente financiación, te llamaré.
 Está bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6186.4s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Voy a ponerte en la lista.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6188.182s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Ponme como financiero.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6192.886s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Hay dos personas para las reglas y la incorporación.
 Eso es correcto.
 Estaba planeando formar parte de todos los comités, pero eso es correcto.
 Tal vez podamos pedirle a Emily Lazzaro que forme parte del subcomité de reglas e incorporación.
 Entonces lo consultaré con ella.
 Y también puse a Nicole Morel en el subcomité de comunicaciones.
 Así que nos comunicaremos con ellos.
 ¿Pero hay alguien más que lo sienta fuertemente?
 ¿Adónde te gustaría ir?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6227.321s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Puedo hacer comunicaciones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6230.024s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Vale, genial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6232.21s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Bueno, iba a decir finanzas, pero definitivamente no tengo tanta experiencia en eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6235.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Creo que estamos bien.
 ¿John?
 No, tienes trabajo que hacer.
 Oh, absolutamente.
 Y creo que para todos los técnicos reales del grupo,
 Antes de profundizar demasiado en esto, habrá un grupo de trabajo que tendrá que elaborar una solicitud de propuestas para el director de proyecto del propietario.
 Esa no es la experiencia que tengo.
 No es por eso que estoy aquí.
 Así que, con el tiempo, dependeremos de todos para los diferentes subcomités.
 Esto es, desde mi punto de vista cercano, con lo que pensé que deberíamos empezar.
 ¿Tiene eso sentido?
 ¿Alguien tiene alguna otra sugerencia sobre cosas que deben suceder de forma inminente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Tengo una pregunta.
 Seguro.
 Mencionaste que Curtis podría venir aquí y todos estos diversos usos de las instalaciones.
 ¿Quién está explorando esas opciones?
 como educación comunitaria, como trabajar tal vez en un colegio comunitario, cursos nocturnos como los que estuve allí esperando con la Asociación de Contratistas Generales de AGC y que están impartiendo educación para adultos.
 ¿Alguien como,
 poniendo un montón de opciones sobre la mesa que les gustaría considerar o ¿qué les parece?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí, más o menos, más o menos no, pero no del todo.
 Aún no hemos llegado a ese punto.
 Así que creo que una vez que superemos este sonrojo inicial de la pieza del capítulo 74, podría tener sentido para nosotros agregar eso.
 Entonces, cuando comencemos a leer esos documentos, creo que es un buen momento para decir: ¿a quién más debemos comunicarnos?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Porque todo ese tipo de cosas impactarán
 Accesibilidad, proximidad, tamaño de las instalaciones frente a otras, almacenamiento, aparcamiento, ya sabes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6343.879s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Bueno.
 Sí, creo que es una gran idea.
 Voy a ponerlo en la lista.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6350.581s">[Unidentified]</a>: De hecho, estamos limitados por nuestra ciudad.
 Somos.
 Si todos en la sala dijeran: Bedford Rec debería estar aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6365.68s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Pero las escuelas comunitarias sí lo son.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6367.861s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6375.31s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Bueno.
 Sí, quería preguntar, ya sabes, ¿quién proporcionará a este comité algún tipo de infraestructura digital?
 Entonces haré referencia al SOI.
 Ahí está el SOI.
 Hubo encuestas analizando Fed.SOI.
 Probablemente haya una lista completa de otros documentos públicos que en realidad no son de acceso público, pero debería serlo.
 Ya sabes, este subcomité de participación comunitaria en comunicación tendrá la carga de
 comunicar lo mismo probablemente a muchas personas, eso se hace de manera más eficiente a través de un sitio web, tal vez a través de un repositorio compartido, y ciertamente podría haber una comunicación externa
 en un portal, como un sitio web, como cada escuela que ha tenido uno de estos proyectos, y luego una especie de repositorio de back-end donde Sheldon puede ver el SOI, por ejemplo.
 Podría estar disponible en cualquier momento para los miembros que están, ya sabes, en la lista de acceso.
 Seguro.
 Todo lo que se necesita son recursos.
 Puedo darte una actualización.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tenemos esto.
 Así que conseguimos una URL que es exclusiva de este comité y es buildingmhs.org.
 ¿Es así?
 Bueno.
 Entonces la URL existe.
 La página existe.
 En realidad, Thomas está trabajando en la especie de estructura básica de ese recurso comunitario.
 La razón por la que les pedimos a todos biografías y fotografías es que todas se publicarán en el sitio web, por lo que está trabajando en todo eso en su rol de Director de Comunicaciones.
 Tom acordó, aunque es el Director de Comunicaciones saliente, quedarse específicamente para este proyecto hasta que contratemos a su reemplazo.
 Entonces, Thomas y algunos de nuestros estudiantes vocacionales están construyendo ese sitio web, supongo que bajo la dirección de Lisa Miller.
 Y habrá un componente de documentos donde estarán todos esos documentos de acceso público para que cuando alguien diga, ¿dónde está esto?
 Podemos señalarles un lugar.
 Todas nuestras actas de reuniones irán allí.
 Todas nuestras agendas de reuniones irán allí.
 Así que ya tenemos toda una estructura para intentar hacer eso.
 No estamos del todo listos, pero espero que para la próxima reunión podamos darle un recorrido.
 sitio web.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Bien, el siguiente paso es que será el portal que mira hacia afuera.
 ¿Qué tal la parte trasera para nosotros?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Entonces esa es una pregunta complicada, porque bajo la ley de reuniones abiertas, realmente no hay un final para nosotros.
 Tan pronto como se publica una agenda, todos sus documentos forman parte del registro público.
 Y si lo hacemos, lo complicado es que si estamos trabajando en cosas detrás de escena, es muy probable que estemos violando la ley de reuniones abiertas.
 Entonces los administradores tienen copias de trabajo de los documentos en los que están trabajando y no representan un quórum y pueden continuar haciéndolo.
 Una vez que esos documentos lleguen aquí, se colocarán en una unidad disponible públicamente.
 Y cuando hablamos de editar un documento, no hay edición fuera de línea de este comité.
 No está permitido según la ley de reuniones abiertas.
 Desafortunadamente, nos sentaremos aquí y editaremos juntos un documento.
 Es verdaderamente una de las partes más dolorosas de gestionar este proceso que
 Todos os habéis inscrito, lo siento.
 Pero sí, es increíblemente doloroso, pero fuera de línea, el tipo de edición fuera de línea que funciona de manera súper efectiva literalmente en cualquier otro lugar del mundo no es una opción aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Bien, entonces no hay Google Drive ni documentos compartidos.
 Las cosas serán liberadas.
 Cuando se publican, aparecen en el sitio web.
 Cuando aparecen en el sitio web, son esencialmente control de configuración y no se pueden cambiar a menos que esos cambios se realicen aquí a la inversa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Correcto.
 Mmm, sí, es terrible.
 Sí, lo es.
 Es absolutamente terrible.
 Hemos encontrado formas de hacerlo.
 menos terrible, pero, ya sabes, son grados menos terribles, lamentablemente.
 Y esa es una forma segura de meterse en problemas con la comunidad en términos de cómo se editan los documentos.
 Entonces las habrá, y cuando las hagamos, descubriré que esas reuniones son mucho más efectivas en Zoom.
 Puedes sentarte donde necesitas sentarte y todos pueden ver cómo se edita un documento y no puede haber ningún tipo de
 idea de que el documento se esté editando sin que esto ocurra al aire libre.
 Así que tenemos que actuar con mucha cautela al respecto.
 Pero sí, es un proceso.
 Es extraño cómo se aplica a GraphDoc.
 Pude ver que se aplica al documento de lanzamiento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: No.
 No se trata de GraphDoc.
 Hemos aprendido que somos muchos trabajando.
 Estamos deliberando.
 Estamos en un grupo común, joven y compartido.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Eso es deliberación.
 Sí.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: Tuve una conversación con cada uno de ellos en la oficina el otoño pasado.
 Fue ese período.
 Entonces tuvimos una llamada completamente larga.
 Eran 40 miembros.
 Y un miembro dijo: Simon acaba de mencionarlo en el documento y leyó nuestros comentarios allí.
 Y de hecho, los juntamos.
 Y la respuesta es no.
 Para que puedas escribir tus comentarios.
 Te respondo para tener tus siete años.
 Dijeron, está bien, reconocido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: simplemente lo sentimos.
 Es como si estuviéramos de acuerdo en que esto probablemente será peligroso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sí.
 Gracias de nuevo por estar aquí.
 También estoy muy interesado en la pieza de comunicaciones, aunque esas noches no funcionan, pero siempre estaré feliz de atender algunas llamadas.
 Y volverán aquí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Todas esas actualizaciones volverán aquí.
 ¿Alguna otra pregunta que pueda responder sobre los subcomités o cualquier otra cosa que estuviera en la agenda?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Tengo una pregunta sobre la votación.
 Sí, cuando lleguemos a la votación, sí, no estamos en lo que nunca he entendido: se permite el poder.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: No.
 No, no lo es.
 ¿Se permite el poder en una reunión?
 No, no puedes asignar tu voto a otra persona.
 Al levantar la sesión, vamos a practicar la votación, porque tenemos que votar para levantar la sesión.
 Generalmente, eso sucedería a través de lo que ellos llaman un voto de voz, donde todos simplemente dicen sí y nos vamos.
 Simplemente vamos a practicar pasar lista, porque es
 De nuevo, extraño e incómodo, así que lo haremos para levantar la sesión.
 ¿Pero alguna otra pregunta antes de levantar la sesión?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: Estaba prestando atención.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Pero creo que la otra cosa que vale la pena describir es que hay un número considerable de miembros sin derecho a voto en este comité.
 Las razones de esto no son porque no queramos saber de usted.
 Estás aquí porque queremos saber de ti.
 Cuando se realice la votación, no llamaremos su nombre y usted no votará.
 Pero aparte de eso, usted es miembro de pleno derecho de este comité.
 Me advirtieron que
 Cuando hay demasiados miembros votantes, resulta muy difícil realizar negocios porque se debe tener un quórum en el comité incluso para reunirse y realizar negocios.
 Todo eso se vuelve muy, muy complicado.
 Así que este fue nuestro intento de decir: queremos tener un gran comité redondo, pero también debemos poder movernos de manera eficiente y efectiva y todo eso.
 Así que esa es la razón detrás.
 lo que hicimos allí.
 Y creo que el tamaño de este comité seguramente cambiará a lo largo de su vida.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Entonces de los 25?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí, hay 15 miembros con derecho a voto en el comité, lo que sigue siendo un número bastante bueno de miembros con derecho a voto.
 Y practicaremos la votación en solo un segundo.
 ¿Pero hay alguna otra pregunta en la próxima reunión?
 Las reglas, las reglas y la incorporación el 7 de mayo.
 participación comunitaria el 8 de mayo y traerán sus hallazgos a este grupo el 13 de mayo.
 Así que la gran mayoría de nuestra reunión del 13 de mayo trabajará sobre esas recomendaciones y acordará esos planes.
 Nuevamente, estamos en modo de inicio.
 Y luego de eso, vamos a entrar en el meollo de algunos de estos documentos en los que la administración ha estado trabajando y comenzaremos a leerlos detenidamente, hablando de lo que hay allí.
 Y ese tipo de cosas, pero vamos a avanzar rápido.
 Establecimos el calendario de reuniones.
 Solo a modo de justificación, nos reuniremos lo mejor que podamos en persona aquí en la feria por 89 por.
 De aquí a finales de junio.
 Les prometo que volveremos a los lunes por la noche al comienzo del próximo año escolar, pero desde ahora hasta finales de junio, entre las reuniones del comité escolar y los días festivos, era completamente imposible mantener ese tipo de horario.
 Nos reuniremos solo a través de Zoom en el verano y, de hecho, trasladaremos las reuniones a los miércoles.
 teniendo en cuenta que los lunes y viernes en verano es realmente muy difícil conseguir el quórum de alguien para hacer algo.
 Espero que podamos hacer que eso funcione, pero traté de mantener el calendario de reuniones ligero.
 Creo que habrá más subcomités desde ahora hasta finales de agosto, pero esto fue sólo un comienzo para que la gente pueda intentar organizar sus ocupadas vidas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: Sí.
 Entonces dos cosas.
 Sin embargo, esa es una pregunta indirecta.
 Si no puedes hacerlo,
 Está bien, envía tu también envía un correo electrónico con todos tus pensamientos y comentarios para compartir tus voces.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: En realidad, esta es una cuestión técnica.
 Un caballero que no puede asistir a la reunión le envía un correo electrónico indicándole sus pensamientos y recomendaciones, posiblemente incluso una decisión.
 Anteriormente, escuchamos que los correos electrónicos son una mala idea para casi todo excepto para establecer la agenda.
 Y esto suena como un área gris.
 Me preguntaba si se perdió una reunión abierta y esas dos cosas están en conflicto.
 ¿Cómo funciona?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Así que puedo decirles que creo que cualquier abogado le diría que nunca ponga nada por escrito.
 Así que ahí es donde empezamos.
 Nunca pongas nada por escrito.
 Dicho esto, si vas a poner algo por escrito,
 Es como en ese tipo de escenario, sí, es un área gris.
 Lo que deberías hacer es ponerte en contacto con alguien y decirle, oye, ¿puedo enviarte mis pensamientos?
 ¿Y ha hablado de estas cosas con alguien más o tiene intención de hacerlo?
 Y si puedes estar razonablemente seguro de que tienes un circuito cerrado, ¿verdad?
 Eso me dices, ¿puedo enviarte mi opinión?
 Y yo digo que sí.
 Y yo digo, no voy a hablar con nadie más sobre estos asuntos, entonces estaremos bien.
 Sólo se convierte en un problema cuando se ha conectado con un número de personas que representan una mayoría de votos en el comité.
 Si, por ejemplo, dijiste: Quiero decírselo a dos personas porque no estoy seguro de quién asistirá a la reunión, aún así está bien, porque estás por debajo de las ocho.
 Cuando has hablado contigo mismo incluido, con ocho personas, ahora estás en problemas.
 Ahí es cuando usted ha violado la ley de reuniones abiertas.
 La parte complicada es que todos los involucrados deben tener la misma comprensión de quién ha estado involucrado en esa conversación.
 ¿Qué me perdí?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: Me perdí eso en mi publicación en la caja.
 puedes ser muy intencional.
 Sólo te lo digo y dices, ajá.
 Y si vas y haces lo mismo, todos estamos violando la ley, sin importar lo que hayamos hecho para intentar prevenirlo.
 Entonces, creo que eso es muy cierto para todos los ciudadanos respetuosos de la ley.
 A la deliberación en serie no le importa nada, ni el contenido, ni los planes, ni los seguros.
 Somos solo nosotros dos, ¿verdad?
 Vas y violas eso.
 He violado tantas leyes.
 Incluso si no lo sé,
 Bien, bien.
 Bueno, sí, esa es más o menos mi pregunta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Vamos a proporcionarles a todos una dirección de correo electrónico en las Escuelas Públicas de Medford, y les recomiendo encarecidamente que no utilicen su correo electrónico personal bajo ninguna circunstancia para ningún negocio relacionado con MSBA.
 Entonces, tan pronto como esos correos electrónicos estén configurados, convertiremos todo.
 Pero le recomiendo encarecidamente que no utilice su correo electrónico personal para nada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: Facilita mucho el cumplimiento de los registros públicos.
 Yo era el oficial de acceso a los registros del distrito escolar.
 Cualquier documento que se realice en los asuntos oficiales de la escuela, además de sus notas personales, es un registro público que automáticamente debe poder proporcionarse o al menos revisarse si alguien lo solicita.
 Entonces, hacerlo todo dentro de su dirección de correo electrónico de las Escuelas Públicas de Medford, dentro de su suite de Google de las Escuelas Públicas de Medford, donde puede tomar notas y cosas así, es realmente útil para contenerlo todo en ese espacio.
 No compartas con otros.
 No envíe su borrador, su borrador por correo electrónico.
 No es un lugar para escribir notas privadas.
 Bien.
 No ponemos a nadie en el sentido.
 Eso es cierto.
 Bien.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7198.191s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: ¿Alguna última pregunta?
 Son las 8.03.
 Simplemente vamos a, según las reglas de Robert, aplazar esta reunión.
 ¿Hay una moción para aplazar la sesión?
 Moción para suspender la sesión por parte del miembro Olapade, secundada por el miembro Ruseau.
