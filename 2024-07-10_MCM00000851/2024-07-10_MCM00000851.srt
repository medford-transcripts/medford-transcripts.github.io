1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:01,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:02,153
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here.

3
00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:03,334
[SPEAKER_10]: We made it.

4
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:06,376
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually really exciting.

5
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:09,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all for coming.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Just by way of some plans for tonight, we're going to leave at eight.

7
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,024
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to leave sooner than eight.

8
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:24,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to shift the agenda around a little bit because Janelle from KP Law is here to do some open meeting law training.

9
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to skip introductions for the moment.

10
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:33,117
[SPEAKER_10]: so that Janelle can do open meeting while training because she has a commitment for the second half of this meeting.

11
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:35,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to make sure there's enough time for her to get that in.

12
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:39,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But before we do that, I'm just gonna do a quick roll call so that we, for the record, know who's here.

13
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Jenny Graham here.

14
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:44,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

15
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:44,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Here.

16
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Edwarda Benson?

17
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:46,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Here.

18
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:47,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Galusi?

19
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:48,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Here.

20
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:49,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing?

21
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:50,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

22
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:51,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Margaret Cabral?

23
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:52,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

24
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:52,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Libby Brown?

25
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:53,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

26
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:57,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa Desmond, Maria Dorsey, Brian Hilliard.

27
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:58,602
[SPEAKER_10]: He is absent.

28
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:02,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Tracy Keene, Emily Lazzaro is absent.

29
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,427
[SPEAKER_10]: She has a council meeting tonight.

30
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicole Morell is absent.

31
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,730
[SPEAKER_10]: She had a prior conflict.

32
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:08,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Aaron will party here.

33
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:12,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke Prisner, Larry Brown, Bob Dickinson.

34
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:14,738
[SPEAKER_10]: He is not here this evening.

35
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Fiona Maxwell.

36
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:29,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan Bowen, Thomas Dalton, Chad Fallon is incoming, I believe, Lori Hodgton, Don McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau, and Philip Santos is not present tonight.

37
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:30,618
[SPEAKER_10]: He had a conference as well.

38
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:32,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a quorum.

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,562
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to learn why that's important in just a few minutes.

40
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,864
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm going to turn it over to Janelle in just a second.

41
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:46,108
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think I'll start by saying all of our meetings are subject to the open meeting law.

42
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:52,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And with four years of experience in the open meeting lot, it's a very clunky way to get work done.

43
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,891
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to say that that's my personal experience.

44
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,292
[SPEAKER_10]: It's there for a reason.

45
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:11,336
[SPEAKER_10]: It's absolutely necessary, but it will require all of you to think carefully about not only what you're saying and doing in the meeting, but more importantly, how you're behaving outside of our meetings because

46
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:17,320
[SPEAKER_10]: You can sort of inadvertently find yourself in conflict with the open meeting law.

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,144
[SPEAKER_10]: MSB requires that we hold all of our meetings in accordance with the open meeting law.

48
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:29,368
[SPEAKER_10]: So we thought it was important for everybody to have some sort of grounding in all of that.

49
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:36,584
[SPEAKER_10]: The elected officials in the room obviously are familiar with the open meeting law and can provide guidance to anybody who has questions.

50
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:37,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just signed them up for that.

51
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:45,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say to the educators in the room, you generally interact with the school committee all the time.

52
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:50,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And you are generally not subject to the open meeting law, but in this room and on this topic you are.

53
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just sort of a tuning of your set of responsibilities in this way.

54
00:02:57,974 --> 00:02:59,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to turn it over to Janelle.

55
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:06,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Janelle, if you could kindly let us know whether you want questions along the way or you want us to hold our questions until you're done.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

58
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone hear me OK?

59
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:09,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

60
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:13,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me this evening.

61
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:18,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.

62
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:23,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.

63
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:26,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.

64
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:31,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.

65
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:32,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent

66
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:39,535
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.

67
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:49,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.

68
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that some.

69
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:56,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.

70
00:03:57,227 --> 00:04:04,571
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.

71
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:09,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.

72
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:16,018
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.

73
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.

74
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also start by saying certification is really important.

75
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:28,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.

76
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend that be done as soon as possible.

77
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,419
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Attorney General has

78
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:42,008
[SPEAKER_01]: put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.

79
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:55,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.

80
00:04:56,278 --> 00:05:00,321
[SPEAKER_01]: We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.

81
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna go into any specifics,

82
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,986
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.

83
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.

84
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:16,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.

85
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:24,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.

86
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:25,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone see the slides okay?

87
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:25,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

89
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.

90
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about best practices.

91
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:37,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.

92
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,717
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly start with the premise that

93
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:53,764
[SPEAKER_01]: The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.

94
00:05:54,184 --> 00:06:03,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.

95
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:11,118
[SPEAKER_01]: unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.

96
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,425
[SPEAKER_01]: But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.

98
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:25,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.

99
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?

100
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,915
[SPEAKER_01]: What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?

101
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:39,002
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?

102
00:06:39,022 --> 00:07:00,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and

103
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,369
[SPEAKER_01]: in business of the committee.

104
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,774
[SPEAKER_01]: The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.

105
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:20,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.

106
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,922
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the open meeting law requires notice.

107
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:27,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted

108
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:31,041
[SPEAKER_01]: no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.

109
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:43,853
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.

110
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:49,358
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.

111
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:58,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.

112
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,482
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.

113
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:23,448
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.

114
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:30,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.

115
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:34,893
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.

116
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:43,418
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.

117
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:47,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.

118
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:55,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.

119
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about what that means.

120
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:02,032
[SPEAKER_01]: of the body's business and the public's being conducted.

121
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:13,281
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.

122
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.

123
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:23,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, what rules govern public comment?

124
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,612
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the free speech principles that may apply?

125
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,913
[SPEAKER_01]: who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.

126
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:31,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll cover that.

127
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:37,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.

128
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:48,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.

129
00:09:49,042 --> 00:10:02,388
[SPEAKER_01]: The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.

130
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:05,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about the process to do that.

131
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:20,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.

132
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:24,944
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.

133
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:43,645
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.

134
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:58,940
[SPEAKER_01]: come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.

135
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:03,643
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.

136
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:11,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs

137
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,454
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.

138
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:34,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.

139
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:40,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.

140
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:57,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.

141
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about that.

142
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that serial communications and it's something

143
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:22,159
[SPEAKER_01]: with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.

144
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:33,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.

145
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:37,637
[SPEAKER_01]: A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.

146
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:52,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.

147
00:12:53,698 --> 00:13:04,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.

148
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,106
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are exceptions to that.

149
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:17,471
[SPEAKER_01]: If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,

150
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,052
[SPEAKER_01]: a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.

151
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:33,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.

152
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:40,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.

153
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:45,069
[SPEAKER_01]: One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.

154
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:57,248
[SPEAKER_01]: And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.

155
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:00,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions so far?

156
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll continue on.

157
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:17,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.

158
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:20,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly comes from experience.

159
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:26,578
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,

160
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:33,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.

161
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:46,597
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.

162
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:56,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.

163
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:08,105
[SPEAKER_01]: or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.

164
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:23,771
[SPEAKER_01]: To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.

165
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:27,353
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing a site visit, certainly

166
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:36,283
[SPEAKER_01]: A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.

167
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:45,245
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.

168
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:56,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.

169
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,311
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst a quorum of your public body.

170
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:09,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.

171
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.

172
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:20,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.

173
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:27,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.

174
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:46,303
[SPEAKER_01]: We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.

175
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:50,237
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.

176
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:54,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.

177
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,125
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.

178
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:02,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.

179
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:15,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.

180
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:24,537
[SPEAKER_01]: What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.

181
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:31,159
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.

182
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:38,082
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or

183
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:44,998
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.

184
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:56,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.

185
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions on any of this?

186
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:00,201
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

187
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:03,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

188
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:15,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.

189
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:25,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.

190
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:31,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.

191
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:42,749
[SPEAKER_01]: And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.

192
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:49,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.

193
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:52,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Emergencies.

194
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:59,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.

195
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:09,191
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.

196
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:16,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.

197
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:24,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,

198
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:41,490
[SPEAKER_01]: You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.

199
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to be aware of.

200
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:53,039
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.

201
00:19:54,149 --> 00:20:04,034
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.

202
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:12,818
[SPEAKER_01]: You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.

203
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:23,363
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.

204
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:29,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.

205
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Conducting meetings.

206
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:40,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.

207
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:51,260
[SPEAKER_01]: These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.

208
00:20:52,280 --> 00:21:08,690
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.

209
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.

210
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,175
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.

211
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,853
[SPEAKER_01]: If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.

212
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:34,518
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.

213
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, it's iPhones.

214
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:46,415
[SPEAKER_01]: The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.

215
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:53,288
[SPEAKER_01]: members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.

216
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:59,632
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.

217
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:07,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.

218
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:15,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.

219
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions on recordings?

220
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:22,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

221
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

222
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:25,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Email.

223
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:30,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.

224
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:43,042
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.

225
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:48,064
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,

226
00:22:49,530 --> 00:23:09,142
[SPEAKER_01]: It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.

227
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:19,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.

228
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:27,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.

229
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:38,925
[SPEAKER_01]: or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.

230
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:52,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.

231
00:23:54,323 --> 00:24:02,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.

232
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:16,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.

233
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:20,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to

234
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:27,794
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.

235
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it before.

236
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:35,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.

237
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:41,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,

238
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:56,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.

239
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,

240
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:10,589
[SPEAKER_01]: and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.

241
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:14,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.

242
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a question?

243
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:20,618
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we're good.

244
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:21,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

245
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:22,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

246
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:29,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.

247
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:38,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.

248
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:47,140
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.

249
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:53,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.

250
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:59,074
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.

251
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.

252
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:13,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.

253
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:23,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.

254
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:38,889
[SPEAKER_01]: The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.

255
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:54,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.

256
00:26:56,301 --> 00:27:05,263
[SPEAKER_01]: The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.

257
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,304
[SPEAKER_01]: The open meeting law has made

258
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:16,367
[SPEAKER_01]: indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.

259
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.

260
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:36,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.

261
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:39,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly if you do allow public comment,

262
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:45,308
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.

263
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:53,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.

264
00:27:54,593 --> 00:28:00,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.

265
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:05,293
[SPEAKER_01]: People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.

266
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:09,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And some have adopted public comment policies as well.

267
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:13,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.

268
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:22,428
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.

269
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:33,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.

270
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:38,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.

271
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,859
[SPEAKER_01]: When will the public participation period occur?

272
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?

273
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?

274
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:48,761
[SPEAKER_01]: How long will it be?

275
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:50,442
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes

276
00:28:52,043 --> 00:29:00,451
[SPEAKER_01]: is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.

277
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:03,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.

278
00:29:03,313 --> 00:29:09,358
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.

279
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:16,425
[SPEAKER_01]: How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.

280
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:40,033
[SPEAKER_01]: So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.

281
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:41,993
[SPEAKER_01]: must be narrowly tailored.

282
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:46,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.

283
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:53,542
[SPEAKER_01]: During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.

284
00:29:53,562 --> 00:30:01,989
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.

285
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations

286
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:13,316
[SPEAKER_01]: to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.

287
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:15,578
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not on the meeting agenda itself.

288
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:28,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.

289
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:29,549
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have an open discussion.

290
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,531
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be able to deliberate on it.

291
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:35,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So some practical items to consider there.

292
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:49,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.

293
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give an example of that.

294
00:30:52,576 --> 00:31:03,905
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.

295
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:07,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,

296
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:14,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.

297
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:31,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.

298
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:40,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?

299
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:55,410
[SPEAKER_01]: We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.

300
00:31:58,427 --> 00:32:00,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions on any of that?

301
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a lot of content.

302
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything from any of the members?

303
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:06,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we're good so far.

304
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you so much.

305
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:22,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.

306
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:30,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.

307
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:36,404
[SPEAKER_01]: The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.

308
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:42,394
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.

309
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:47,737
[SPEAKER_01]: What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.

310
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:52,695
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.

311
00:32:53,875 --> 00:33:12,924
[SPEAKER_01]: What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?

312
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:14,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand this was the topic discussed.

313
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:17,106
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the general nature of the discussion.

314
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:22,448
[SPEAKER_01]: These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.

315
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:29,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.

316
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:35,833
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.

317
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,554
[SPEAKER_01]: You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.

318
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:46,377
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.

319
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:53,613
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.

320
00:33:53,633 --> 00:34:11,059
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.

321
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.

322
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:33,033
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.

323
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:39,438
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.

324
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:45,747
[SPEAKER_01]: alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.

325
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly things happen.

326
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:50,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.

327
00:34:51,311 --> 00:35:01,679
[SPEAKER_01]: My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.

328
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,021
[SPEAKER_01]: A question has come up

329
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:20,587
[SPEAKER_01]: very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?

330
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:33,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.

331
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:39,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.

332
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:45,026
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.

333
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:52,572
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.

334
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting minutes are

335
00:35:56,432 --> 00:36:02,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.

336
00:36:03,214 --> 00:36:08,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.

337
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:18,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's

338
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:24,771
[SPEAKER_01]: official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.

339
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:29,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.

340
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,697
[SPEAKER_01]: But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.

341
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:39,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.

342
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:41,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10 calendar days.

343
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:45,924
[SPEAKER_01]: For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.

344
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:48,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.

345
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:54,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Executive session minutes.

346
00:36:55,383 --> 00:37:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.

347
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:13,003
[SPEAKER_01]: The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session

348
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,324
[SPEAKER_01]: for specific reasons.

349
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:21,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.

350
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,447
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.

351
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:25,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to share it with all of you.

352
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:37,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.

353
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:41,960
[SPEAKER_01]: There are specific requirements that apply.

354
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,601
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be notice.

355
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:45,821
[SPEAKER_01]: There need to be roll call votes.

356
00:37:46,421 --> 00:38:02,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.

357
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:12,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.

358
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most common example of that is.

359
00:38:15,472 --> 00:38:39,308
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.

360
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:45,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.

361
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So just want to make sure everyone knew that.

362
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:59,465
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.

363
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?

364
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:06,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the purpose expired or not?

365
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:16,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.

366
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:22,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.

367
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:26,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.

368
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:29,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions on that so far?

369
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:31,949
Nope.

370
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:32,789
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.

371
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:33,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

372
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.

373
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:39,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Executive sessions.

374
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:43,995
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.

375
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:46,216
[SPEAKER_01]: This question comes up all the time.

376
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:48,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.

377
00:39:48,877 --> 00:39:50,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you mean?

378
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:57,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.

379
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:59,062
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the open meeting law requires.

380
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:04,689
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.

381
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:19,161
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.

382
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:21,743
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to be aware of.

383
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:32,188
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.

384
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:44,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.

385
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:49,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.

386
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:59,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.

387
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,213
[SPEAKER_01]: you really only wanna discuss those matters.

388
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:17,148
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.

389
00:41:17,668 --> 00:41:22,574
[SPEAKER_01]: So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.

390
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:31,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.

391
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:40,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.

392
00:41:44,442 --> 00:41:47,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.

393
00:41:48,885 --> 00:42:06,459
[SPEAKER_01]: If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.

394
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,261
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's often that

395
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:13,022
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?

396
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:15,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is most likely not.

397
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:21,305
[SPEAKER_01]: The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.

398
00:42:24,886 --> 00:42:36,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.

399
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:48,899
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.

400
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:58,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.

401
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:06,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.

402
00:43:06,938 --> 00:43:14,560
[SPEAKER_01]: with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.

403
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:24,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.

404
00:43:25,223 --> 00:43:34,045
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.

405
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,338
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a variety of options.

406
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:44,362
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.

407
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:48,364
[SPEAKER_01]: There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.

408
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:56,529
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.

409
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.

410
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:10,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.

411
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:17,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.

412
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions so far?

413
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:24,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

414
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:27,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, I think we're good.

415
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:28,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

416
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:32,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.

417
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.

418
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:48,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.

419
00:44:48,835 --> 00:44:52,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really dealt with public comment periods.

420
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:56,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, in summary, the court held that while

421
00:44:57,165 --> 00:45:02,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.

422
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:08,769
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.

423
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:25,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,

424
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:36,810
[SPEAKER_01]: is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.

425
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:46,060
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.

426
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:52,410
[SPEAKER_01]: closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.

427
00:45:53,291 --> 00:46:06,119
[SPEAKER_01]: That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.

428
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:17,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.

429
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:23,241
[SPEAKER_01]: But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.

430
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:30,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.

431
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:32,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to analyze that.

432
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:37,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.

433
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:41,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.

434
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:55,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.

435
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:58,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I've included reference to two other cases.

436
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:02,367
[SPEAKER_01]: The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.

437
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:05,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.

438
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:13,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.

439
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:19,278
[SPEAKER_01]: The current state of the open meeting law.

440
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:27,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.

441
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:35,447
[SPEAKER_01]: They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.

442
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:39,030
[SPEAKER_01]: They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.

443
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:50,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.

444
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:56,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.

445
00:47:57,052 --> 00:48:00,934
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.

446
00:48:01,034 --> 00:48:08,137
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.

447
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:16,690
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.

448
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:20,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Public body members can also participate in members.

449
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:22,128
[SPEAKER_01]: in meetings remotely as well.

450
00:48:22,668 --> 00:48:24,308
[SPEAKER_01]: The changes are still optional.

451
00:48:25,189 --> 00:48:28,130
[SPEAKER_01]: There are technological considerations.

452
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,230
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that.

453
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:37,093
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.

454
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:41,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.

455
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:46,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?

456
00:48:46,803 --> 00:48:55,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.

457
00:48:56,426 --> 00:49:05,970
[SPEAKER_01]: A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,

458
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:11,770
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.

459
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:24,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.

460
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:29,241
[SPEAKER_01]: The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.

461
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:33,344
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.

462
00:49:34,256 --> 00:49:46,983
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.

463
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:52,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.

464
00:49:53,047 --> 00:50:00,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.

465
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:12,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.

466
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.

467
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:21,676
[SPEAKER_01]: and remote meeting, remote members.

468
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:42,768
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.

469
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:46,350
[SPEAKER_01]: When holding an executive session remotely,

470
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:53,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.

471
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:57,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.

472
00:50:57,912 --> 00:51:05,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.

473
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:07,420
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be sufficient.

474
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:20,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.

475
00:51:21,652 --> 00:51:30,078
[SPEAKER_01]: You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.

476
00:51:30,098 --> 00:51:33,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also allow direct participants.

477
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a contractor or an engineer,

478
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:42,328
[SPEAKER_01]: or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.

479
00:51:42,348 --> 00:51:47,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.

480
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:54,514
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.

481
00:51:55,995 --> 00:52:03,499
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.

482
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,201
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is an issue with a technical feed,

483
00:52:07,664 --> 00:52:14,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.

484
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:19,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.

485
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:26,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.

486
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:32,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

487
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:57,825
[SPEAKER_01]: As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

488
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:01,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any questions for Janelle?

489
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:06,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

490
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Janelle, if you could send those slides along, that would be great.

491
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make sure the committee has access to them.

492
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,723
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you so much for your time.

493
00:53:15,364 --> 00:53:16,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.

494
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:25,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send the open meeting log guide, I'll send my slides, and I'll send some other helpful materials as well as a summary of that Bayer decision, so everyone has it.

495
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:26,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

496
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:27,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

497
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:28,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

498
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,210
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice seeing you all.

499
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good evening.

500
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:31,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with the rest of your meeting.

501
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:32,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

502
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:33,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

503
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:34,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.

504
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

505
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,170
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so we're right on time.

506
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:43,392
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to circle back to some introductions.

507
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:45,253
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a big group.

508
00:53:45,713 --> 00:53:47,334
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 25 of us in total.

509
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:51,957
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a few members who are not able to be here tonight that let me know that in advance, so we will catch them up.

510
00:53:52,477 --> 00:54:03,242
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was hoping that we could just go around the room and you could introduce yourself and just talk like very briefly about sort of what you see your role on the committee as and making sure that

511
00:54:04,523 --> 00:54:11,210
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody in the room sort of gets to know you if you have an official sort of capacity role in the schools that where they may not have met you before.

512
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:13,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So Peter, do you want to start?

513
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:13,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

514
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:15,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

515
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:23,603
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of the American Public Schools for Enrichment, Innovation and Operations.

516
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:51,797
[SPEAKER_05]: green roof repair, boiler installation, and helping author an SOI for a project that's currently just broke ground about two weeks ago in West Chester, Massachusetts.

517
00:54:51,817 --> 00:54:55,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really just happy to be a part of this team that's going to help build the future of Metro.

518
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm John LeBlanc.

519
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Director of Buildings and Grounds.

520
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:04,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming to my 38th year working for the Metro Public Schools.

521
00:55:05,483 --> 00:55:06,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to it.

522
00:55:07,611 --> 00:55:12,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the science lab when we did the high school science lab MSBA.

523
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the oil project at Medford High School.

524
00:55:15,557 --> 00:55:19,280
[SPEAKER_05]: When we did that, that was another MSBA project.

525
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:28,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I can bring my long-term vast experience to the forefront to help us in any way that we can push things forward.

526
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:30,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

527
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:31,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Thomas Dalton.

528
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:35,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the outgoing communications director for Metropolitan Public Services.

529
00:55:35,777 --> 00:55:38,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Thumbs down.

530
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But at your disposal now.

531
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:48,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a communications professional with a career in state and local government.

532
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:55,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I still lived in my hometown of Stoneham, I also served as a school committee member in Stoneham.

533
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:03,494
[SPEAKER_05]: During that time, we started the process with the MSBA for the new Stonewall High School that's gonna open this September.

534
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:08,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So particularly this period of the MSBA process, it's very familiar to me.

535
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I was serving as a school committee member during that timeframe.

536
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:21,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly very excited about all the opportunities that we're gonna have to collaborate with the state to gather lots of really good local input.

537
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,204
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really exciting.

538
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:26,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everybody.

539
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Paul Russo.

540
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:28,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the members' school committee.

541
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:30,133
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my seventh year.

542
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:35,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, I'm pretty impressed.

543
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:40,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

544
00:56:40,418 --> 00:56:41,198
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Tracy Keene.

545
00:56:41,678 --> 00:56:44,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been living in Medford for 12 years.

546
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:53,404
[SPEAKER_14]: I work professionally as a senior theater and facility manager, overseeing the day-to-day operations of a performing arts center on a public campus.

547
00:56:54,164 --> 00:57:00,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm currently part of a team building a new theater across the river in Austin.

548
00:57:00,706 --> 00:57:03,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Groundbreaking was just a couple of months, a couple of weeks ago.

549
00:57:04,648 --> 00:57:11,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So I bring in some day-to-day operations, facility management, and resources.

550
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Maria Dorsey.

551
00:57:12,991 --> 00:57:18,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I work here at Mead High School as the school librarian.

552
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:26,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in the schools for 28 years.

553
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:28,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived in Medford for 43 years.

554
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:30,097
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's a lifelong resident.

555
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:36,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was involved, so I feel like it's, I've been in Medford all the same time.

556
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:45,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working in the old Brooks-Hobbs when we transitioned from there into the brand new McGlynn Library.

557
00:57:46,232 --> 00:57:49,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two years later, I transitioned into the new Brooks School Library.

558
00:57:50,397 --> 00:57:57,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 2010, I transitioned into the old high school, which was quite a shock.

559
00:57:57,162 --> 00:58:07,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we were going through the building process for the other schools, I wasn't on the committee, but I did participate in some of the walkthroughs in other buildings.

560
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched those weekly Jack Buckley events with on time and on budget.

561
00:58:14,335 --> 00:58:15,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just amazing.

562
00:58:15,856 --> 00:58:19,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really, I was so fascinated by the whole process.

563
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:32,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see my role as the functional part of the building, how it's going to operate for the students, the teachers, and of course my personal space delighter.

564
00:58:36,008 --> 00:58:36,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, everybody.

565
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:37,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Libby Brown.

566
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:38,389
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm an architect.

567
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:41,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lived in Medford for almost 10 years.

568
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:49,152
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just really excited now that my kids are in school, that this is a project that's coming to life, and I'm really excited to be a part of it.

569
00:58:49,212 --> 00:58:54,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I work primarily in education, mostly in higher ed, but some private K-12 as well.

570
00:58:55,214 --> 00:59:00,396
[SPEAKER_15]: No MSBA experience exactly, but we've done MSCBA work, so a little bit on the higher ed side.

571
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:03,585
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think this is a wonderful opportunity for Medford.

572
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:22,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I work a lot with educators and librarians and people from programming through concept design and construction, especially with a lot of phase renovations and evaluating existing facilities, whether you're going to keep them and renovate, tear them down, do both, do it all at once, and anything in between.

573
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,158
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is an exciting project.

574
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:25,258
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just glad to be here.

575
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:29,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Larry Brown, just an average Joe a couple blocks away.

576
00:59:31,932 --> 00:59:47,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't exactly know where I'm going to fit in all this, but I do have a lot of background in construction, planning, site development for primarily residential, but also like commercial.

577
00:59:49,563 --> 00:59:53,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't point to all that, but if anybody wants to know my background, I can talk to you more about it.

578
00:59:54,176 --> 01:00:05,404
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess my interest is sort of like helping you in the process, because I've sort of done this kind of thing on a variety of levels, not specifically for a school, but other kinds of projects.

579
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:10,288
[SPEAKER_11]: As you just pointed out, there's a lot of factors here.

580
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's got to all sort of be done sequentially.

581
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,291
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't just jump to the end.

582
01:00:15,092 --> 01:00:19,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I can help with that process, I'm happy to do it.

583
01:00:20,523 --> 01:00:30,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Larry, you're also a retired Medford vocational high school teacher who also moonlights here now and again.

584
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:34,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've had about 38 years in construction.

585
01:00:34,586 --> 01:00:35,766
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of different things.

586
01:00:35,926 --> 01:00:37,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't sell yourself short.

587
01:00:37,107 --> 01:00:37,827
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better to.

588
01:00:37,907 --> 01:00:38,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Aaron?

589
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody, my name is Aaron Olapade.

590
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:48,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also on the school committee here in Medford.

591
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:55,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a 2018 class graduate of Medford High, so you know a couple years ago and I just graduated college from BC this past May.

592
01:00:55,814 --> 01:01:01,476
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work that I've done the past couple years has been mostly community engagement, youth engagement primarily.

593
01:01:01,496 --> 01:01:08,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a gap year and worked for City Year Boston, so I was working in class teaching in the Charlestown school system.

594
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:12,940
[SPEAKER_00]: and then doing a lot of community work through that as well while I was at university.

595
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I've just been named the new program director for City of Malden's Youth Employment Program.

596
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:22,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working in the mayor's office, trying to get kids access to job opportunities.

597
01:01:22,404 --> 01:01:24,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have kids that are interested, let me know.

598
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:27,546
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to get them a job for the summer and for the school year.

599
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:28,887
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just really excited to be here.

600
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:35,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the things that I'm focusing on are, I think, just youth engagement, making sure our students actually have access to what they deserve.

601
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:36,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what we're all here to do.

602
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:37,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just excited for all of us.

603
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:44,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi everybody, Chad Fallon, Principal Director of Career and Technical Education here at the high school.

604
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:47,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm starting my eighth year in September.

605
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:57,940
[SPEAKER_09]: This feels like right up my alley because I work with a bunch of people who like to break things down and build them back up and design things, and we have 15 programs here if you don't know.

606
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:06,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see this as an opportunity to expand our programming, hopefully adding three to four additional programs to our menu of options.

607
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:07,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to be here.

608
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:14,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Jenny Graham I'm the chair of this 20 group of 25 so thanks for being here.

609
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:18,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I have, I have two kids in the schools.

610
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:23,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they may both miss this project before it's online.

611
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:28,237
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've made lots of promises at home, so here we are.

612
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,799
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am really looking forward to this.

613
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:36,781
[SPEAKER_10]: In my day job, I own a management consulting firm.

614
01:02:37,181 --> 01:02:42,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I do a lot of work with process improvement, adult learning design and delivery, as well as project management.

615
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:45,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm a certified project manager, not in construction.

616
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,786
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do know how to move a large group of people to a goal.

617
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:50,627
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I'm here to do.

618
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:56,769
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of the things that Janelle was talking about are sort of roles for me to take on in terms of the minutes.

619
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll talk about all of that in good time.

620
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,510
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just so thrilled you're all here.

621
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:02,511
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of work to do.

622
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:05,252
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've actually done a tremendous amount of work.

623
01:03:05,272 --> 01:03:06,713
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really excited to tell you about that.

624
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:09,273
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll get to that just as soon as we finish introductions.

625
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:17,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke Preissner, parent of three children in the school system.

626
01:03:18,437 --> 01:03:27,725
[SPEAKER_03]: The oldest is seventh grade of the Andrews, and then her sister is still at the Roberts, and her younger brother is still at the Roberts.

627
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:42,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would characterize myself as an interested and very motivated parent to improve the high school environment so that we can avoid any tough choices later.

628
01:03:44,538 --> 01:03:50,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, maybe I get hyper-focused on things, and so I conduct a lot of research.

629
01:03:52,957 --> 01:04:02,982
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty, I wouldn't say familiar, but I'm aware of how these complex endeavors can kind of fall off the rails and take far longer than they ought to.

630
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:07,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, professionally, I'm a system engineer.

631
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:14,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I work in the aerospace industry, familiar with complexity and attention to process.

632
01:04:16,488 --> 01:04:18,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, I think

633
01:04:20,405 --> 01:04:26,108
[SPEAKER_03]: My role will just be to maybe ask some out-of-the-box questions.

634
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:45,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have a lot of individuals here who either work directly for the schools or have some strong connection to the school district, and so perhaps I'll be looking at a particular problem from a different perspective, and I'll give voice to that.

635
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:52,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll be productive, maybe it'll just be a piece of spaghetti that slides off the wall.

636
01:04:54,312 --> 01:05:04,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's my role here, kind of an outsider role, but certainly motivated to bring new high school to Medford.

637
01:05:04,795 --> 01:05:05,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

638
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Fiona Maxwell, the Chief Procurement Officer for the City of Medford.

639
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:15,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to see a lot of the names.

640
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:18,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I just realized I never saw your face.

641
01:05:19,622 --> 01:05:27,830
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've been with the Procurement Office for City of Medford for seven years now, and this is a great opportunity.

642
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:36,359
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many good things happening in the City of Medford, and I'm not from Medford, so I'm just happy and excited with all the projects that are going on.

643
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:37,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great thing.

644
01:05:39,175 --> 01:05:46,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I also come from a community where we did build a new high school, middle school, back in 2015.

645
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:48,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was sort of on the other end.

646
01:05:48,943 --> 01:05:54,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I was more the outreach, and I did work for the town of North Reading, but in a different capacity.

647
01:05:56,749 --> 01:06:07,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can say it was an excellent project, a great school system, and my daughter was the first graduating class, and my son graduated from there as well.

648
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:11,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to bringing, Medford deserves it.

649
01:06:13,376 --> 01:06:15,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor of Medford.

650
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:20,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank everybody for being here and thank Jenny for taking the lead in all the work that she's done.

651
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:26,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I have three children, two in the public schools, one who may get a year or two or three.

652
01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:29,805
[SPEAKER_16]: But either way, I'm just so very excited to start this process.

653
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:30,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Marissa Desmond.

654
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:36,553
[SPEAKER_13]: I am an architect.

655
01:06:36,673 --> 01:06:41,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I mostly work in campus environments, a lot of higher ed, but similarly a little bit of K through 12.

656
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:55,960
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been focusing predominantly on the programming and early conceptual design portions of projects, but have followed a lot through from like concept all the way through construction as well.

657
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:01,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I have two small children, three and five years old, so I'm really excited to

658
01:07:03,493 --> 01:07:05,114
[SPEAKER_13]: have a new school for them in the future.

659
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:07,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Be a part of the process.

660
01:07:08,177 --> 01:07:14,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, before I started my architectural education and career, I taught some grade math for a little bit.

661
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:18,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So bring a little bit of that along as well.

662
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:20,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just really excited.

663
01:07:22,008 --> 01:07:25,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Marta Cabral, high school principal here at MedStar Chi.

664
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a former teacher.

665
01:07:28,012 --> 01:07:29,293
[SPEAKER_12]: I was an AP as well.

666
01:07:29,594 --> 01:07:31,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And my first principal role

667
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:40,656
[SPEAKER_12]: So I feel extremely blessed to be able to help build a new school in my first year here for our students, because they truly deserve it.

668
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:49,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I have zero building background, zero architectural work, zero anything that all of you have as expertise.

669
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:57,523
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I can do is I can envision what kind of spaces that our students and teachers and staff need here at Medford High School.

670
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:00,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm really excited to do that, because I think we can really

671
01:08:01,253 --> 01:08:08,236
[SPEAKER_12]: move the needle forward in instruction by creating spaces that are collaborative and innovative.

672
01:08:09,096 --> 01:08:11,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to be here, and thank you.

673
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:13,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Lori Hodgdon.

674
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:18,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the school director slash principal of Curtis Stubbs, probably the oldest building.

675
01:08:20,341 --> 01:08:21,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

676
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:29,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually love old school architecture, love Curtis Stubbs, but know that it's not designed for 21st century students.

677
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:41,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm really excited having been a high school teacher, a principal in Vermont, a principal in Western Mass, North Shore, and then in a charter school.

678
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:51,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been on either the tail end of a building project where I was a student in Middlebury, Vermont and saw it happening.

679
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:56,699
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all wearing boots and my brother got to reap the benefits of the building.

680
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:59,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've always been in the beginning.

681
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:01,277
[SPEAKER_02]: or at the end of something.

682
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:02,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really exciting.

683
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:28,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the ability, not every town or city gets to build a new school building and to think about the future, especially with the students that I am working with currently, that access in terms of equity and kind of cultural capital and resources for our students, I think it's going to be really important.

684
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:43,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I've liked what Jenny has said, kind of co-localizing, or whoever came up, I love that, of thinking about our current students really being part of the fabric of this building moving forward.

685
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:44,490
[SPEAKER_02]: They deserve it.

686
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:47,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi everyone, I'm Jill Bowen.

687
01:09:47,293 --> 01:09:51,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Director of Student Services here at Bedford Public Schools.

688
01:09:51,256 --> 01:09:54,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a lifelong resident and a lifelong employee.

689
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:56,561
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my 31st year here at Bedford.

690
01:09:57,135 --> 01:10:02,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've gone the gamut of teacher, evaluation team leader, coordinator, and now in this position.

691
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:06,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also had two sons who have graduated from Medford Public Schools.

692
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:09,497
[SPEAKER_07]: One went the college route, one went vocational.

693
01:10:09,757 --> 01:10:22,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really excited to see the vision of this new high school and what it can bring to Medford and to our students, but also to piggyback on what Laurie said, the equity and accessibility for all of our students.

694
01:10:24,405 --> 01:10:25,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, I'm Susanne Kalusi.

695
01:10:26,246 --> 01:10:28,086
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my 27th year.

696
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:33,828
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, too, was born and raised in my third month of school.

697
01:10:34,089 --> 01:10:38,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I no longer live here, but my whole career has been here.

698
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:50,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I started as a teacher and assistant principal, school leader at the Brooks, and assistant superintendent for elementary schools, and now assistant superintendent for academics and construction.

699
01:10:53,788 --> 01:11:02,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Similar to kind of Marta's piece, I'm really excited to get to work with all of you for the instructional region of the schools.

700
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:07,170
[SPEAKER_17]: I think as someone that was Maria kind of spoke a little bit about it.

701
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:14,372
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, my father was the project manager for the K to eight buildings.

702
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:22,293
[SPEAKER_17]: So I feel like I have kind of lived both sides of this a little bit, but being blessed enough

703
01:11:22,716 --> 01:11:37,368
[SPEAKER_17]: to be one of the teachers in the new, at the time, 2001, McGlynn School, it was great to also see that whole process unfold as an educator and be one of the people in the new schools.

704
01:11:37,508 --> 01:11:50,739
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think the critical role that we all play, these big decisions that are going to impact our educators, our students, our families, our community, is very important to me.

705
01:11:53,304 --> 01:11:54,564
[SPEAKER_17]: take this very seriously.

706
01:11:55,204 --> 01:12:02,166
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel very honored to be part of the team and get to work with all of you.

707
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:03,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

708
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:06,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Marisa Parkinson.

709
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:11,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I, too, was born down the street at Lawrence.

710
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: My family, my mom's still here down the street in West Medford.

711
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:17,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started school in Medford.

712
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I started at the Harvey School.

713
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I went a different path.

714
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:22,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up at St.

715
01:12:22,356 --> 01:12:23,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray's and Casey.

716
01:12:24,436 --> 01:12:29,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too Catholic, but you know, I worked at Johnny's Foodmaster at Westlake.

717
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:33,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Duggar Park was my local park.

718
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:35,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I love schools.

719
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I love kids.

720
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I love education.

721
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in education now for 30 years.

722
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:44,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty scary, because I was like 29.

723
01:12:44,982 --> 01:12:47,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like my go-to answer.

724
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I'm going to have to make an adjustment.

725
01:12:51,778 --> 01:12:58,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm really excited about what this means, getting a new high school for Medford.

726
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:06,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I know at the time when this building was built, it was like, you know, probably like Taj Mahal.

727
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a beautiful high school.

728
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:14,722
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, 50 plus years later, we need something new.

729
01:13:15,302 --> 01:13:17,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel our students deserve it.

730
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:22,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have wonderful vocational programming.

731
01:13:23,453 --> 01:13:28,596
[SPEAKER_05]: We have wonderful academic programming, but in a very old building.

732
01:13:29,657 --> 01:13:37,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have a wonderful Curtis House program, which is located in a different facility.

733
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We have wonderful early childhood options and our preschool program for staff that is housed here.

734
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:50,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're fortunate to have those things in Medford.

735
01:13:50,804 --> 01:13:54,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just feel like Medford is this little gem.

736
01:13:54,085 --> 01:14:07,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And having a new flagship high school will do so much for our students, for the community, and for the future of our community, in general, the greater community.

737
01:14:08,293 --> 01:14:16,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just look forward to being part of this process and working with everyone who's here and taking my different experiences

738
01:14:17,638 --> 01:14:21,840
[SPEAKER_05]: adding my voice with all the voices that are already here.

739
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:42,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And to the mayor and member Graham, getting to this group of 25, there were so many wonderfully qualified candidates that it was like, another engineer, another engineer, another architect.

740
01:14:44,211 --> 01:14:46,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But to get to this group of like,

741
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:49,847
[SPEAKER_05]: wonderful individuals, and I'm very, very grateful.

742
01:14:50,287 --> 01:15:00,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a shout out to Luke, who started the process with us two years ago, I think, and, you know, hung in there and was always checking in.

743
01:15:01,154 --> 01:15:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just looking forward to this process and just really want us to stay positive and optimistic about what is to come.

744
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:17,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Ramjani, I don't know if you want to share with them about the filter

745
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:21,896
[SPEAKER_05]: that you took and how exciting that was.

746
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:28,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be more exciting for the rest of the team to go and have those similar experiences.

747
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:29,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

748
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:30,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all for the...

749
01:15:33,132 --> 01:15:34,134
[SPEAKER_10]: words of excitement.

750
01:15:35,075 --> 01:15:38,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do a couple of things between now and 8 p.m.

751
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,563
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're going to be out the door at 8, I promise.

752
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,227
[SPEAKER_10]: But just as a quick time check, two big things.

753
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:49,172
[SPEAKER_10]: One is I want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening.

754
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:54,055
[SPEAKER_10]: to lead up to today and where we are in the process.

755
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:56,216
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.

756
01:15:56,236 --> 01:15:58,076
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to bring up a quick presentation to do that.

757
01:15:58,196 --> 01:16:05,899
[SPEAKER_10]: And then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do.

758
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:08,099
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll talk about that in just a minute.

759
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:11,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great.

760
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:14,561
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

761
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:17,102
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go ahead a couple of pages.

762
01:16:20,908 --> 01:16:22,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going, one more.

763
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:24,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

764
01:16:25,472 --> 01:16:32,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period.

765
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:35,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes.

766
01:16:36,822 --> 01:16:42,428
[SPEAKER_10]: But that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st.

767
01:16:42,988 --> 01:16:44,950
[SPEAKER_10]: So tomorrow we start.

768
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:56,017
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far.

769
01:16:56,497 --> 01:16:59,659
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right?

770
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:09,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals.

771
01:17:09,845 --> 01:17:14,688
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of,

772
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:17,565
[SPEAKER_10]: the work that we're going to do for the next.

773
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:19,399
[SPEAKER_10]: five to seven years.

774
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:44,929
[SPEAKER_10]: The first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner.

775
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:51,341
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school.

776
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:53,923
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one thing for you all to start to think about.

777
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:56,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, what's that?

778
01:17:56,526 --> 01:17:57,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I take it?

779
01:17:57,086 --> 01:17:57,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

780
01:17:58,351 --> 01:17:59,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, and I can share the slides.

781
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:01,074
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I can share the slides.

782
01:18:01,314 --> 01:18:04,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can share all the slides with you afterwards.

783
01:18:09,762 --> 01:18:20,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts.

784
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:30,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Number three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback in appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.

785
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:37,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford.

786
01:18:37,682 --> 01:18:40,564
[SPEAKER_10]: That means we care a lot about functionality.

787
01:18:40,684 --> 01:18:46,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building.

788
01:18:46,647 --> 01:18:47,608
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, really important.

789
01:18:48,488 --> 01:19:12,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, number five, create plans for the building that advances methods, climate goals and achieves any chips and and lead five lead version five certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible.

790
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:12,805
[SPEAKER_10]: So

791
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,051
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a huge task.

792
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:19,933
[SPEAKER_10]: As quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months.

793
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:32,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here.

794
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:38,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun.

795
01:19:38,323 --> 01:19:40,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll talk about that in just a minute.

796
01:19:40,063 --> 01:19:41,224
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you can go to the next slide.

797
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:48,084
[SPEAKER_10]: really junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the website.

798
01:19:48,404 --> 01:19:55,492
[SPEAKER_10]: But as we're talking about the entire process, we are just outside the box for another six hours.

799
01:19:56,353 --> 01:20:00,217
[SPEAKER_10]: On May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period.

800
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:02,860
[SPEAKER_10]: At each of these steps in the process,

801
01:20:03,948 --> 01:20:09,110
[SPEAKER_10]: The MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase.

802
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:14,132
[SPEAKER_10]: There will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase.

803
01:20:14,572 --> 01:20:19,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So, at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on.

804
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:22,976
[SPEAKER_10]: They could also say, we don't like what you're doing.

805
01:20:24,235 --> 01:20:26,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And they could also say, forget about it.

806
01:20:26,676 --> 01:20:29,917
[SPEAKER_10]: So our job here is that none of those things happen.

807
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:38,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Our job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can.

808
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:43,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them.

809
01:20:47,483 --> 01:20:48,403
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

810
01:20:49,904 --> 01:20:53,345
[SPEAKER_10]: But that eligibility period lasts for 270 days.

811
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:57,627
[SPEAKER_10]: So by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase.

812
01:20:58,128 --> 01:21:00,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase.

813
01:21:01,429 --> 01:21:09,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Beyond the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager.

814
01:21:10,259 --> 01:21:12,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we go into the feasibility study.

815
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,201
[SPEAKER_10]: When people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now.

816
01:21:17,501 --> 01:21:20,302
[SPEAKER_10]: They think we're deciding, are we building?

817
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we renovating?

818
01:21:21,842 --> 01:21:22,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are we building?

819
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:23,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it on the field?

820
01:21:23,823 --> 01:21:25,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it in the parking lot?

821
01:21:25,323 --> 01:21:26,044
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going to work?

822
01:21:26,364 --> 01:21:27,604
[SPEAKER_10]: We are not there yet.

823
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:33,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So please tell all your friends, we will get there and we will work with professionals.

824
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:39,510
[SPEAKER_10]: to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building.

825
01:21:40,211 --> 01:21:43,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects.

826
01:21:44,574 --> 01:21:49,177
[SPEAKER_10]: That is where we vote as a community to fund this project.

827
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:54,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there.

828
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:58,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Once that happens, we go into detailed design.

829
01:21:58,852 --> 01:22:00,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we put a shovel in the ground.

830
01:22:02,033 --> 01:22:04,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And then at some point in future, we complete the project.

831
01:22:04,515 --> 01:22:06,596
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of the soup to nuts.

832
01:22:06,816 --> 01:22:09,277
[SPEAKER_10]: My goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time.

833
01:22:09,737 --> 01:22:13,619
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period.

834
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:14,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to move on.

835
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:20,483
[SPEAKER_10]: As we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work.

836
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,604
[SPEAKER_10]: But for right now, our focus is eligibility.

837
01:22:22,624 --> 01:22:24,005
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can flip to the next page,

838
01:22:26,324 --> 01:22:30,346
[SPEAKER_10]: The eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see.

839
01:22:30,406 --> 01:22:34,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So go ahead and flip to the next slide.

840
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:34,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

841
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,668
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are five things that have to happen in this phase.

842
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:40,589
[SPEAKER_10]: One is the initial compliance certification.

843
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:45,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process.

844
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:49,112
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA.

845
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:52,462
[SPEAKER_10]: We are one day ahead of schedule, and I'm going to own that.

846
01:22:53,382 --> 01:22:54,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, mayor and superintendent.

847
01:22:55,202 --> 01:22:55,762
[SPEAKER_10]: We're on our way.

848
01:22:57,103 --> 01:22:59,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, the building committee has to be formed.

849
01:22:59,443 --> 01:23:00,303
[SPEAKER_10]: You're all here.

850
01:23:00,323 --> 01:23:04,424
[SPEAKER_10]: The school committee said meet before May 1st, and here we are on April 30th.

851
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:04,964
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done it.

852
01:23:06,825 --> 01:23:10,205
[SPEAKER_10]: The form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly.

853
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:12,866
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are working on that, and that'll be submitted shortly.

854
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:15,247
[SPEAKER_10]: That's obviously the easy part.

855
01:23:15,347 --> 01:23:16,007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's paperwork.

856
01:23:17,763 --> 01:23:23,225
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff, and we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way.

857
01:23:23,705 --> 01:23:26,045
[SPEAKER_10]: The MSBA will need to sign off on our committee.

858
01:23:27,706 --> 01:23:36,028
[SPEAKER_10]: We have met all the requirements, so the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee.

859
01:23:36,088 --> 01:23:38,169
[SPEAKER_10]: We've met all of those requirements with all of you here.

860
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:41,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're going to dive into the actual work.

861
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,254
[SPEAKER_10]: there's three additional things that have to happen.

862
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:48,255
[SPEAKER_10]: One is what they call an educational profile.

863
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:57,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today?

864
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,100
[SPEAKER_10]: How many classrooms?

865
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,981
[SPEAKER_10]: How many math classrooms?

866
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:04,122
[SPEAKER_10]: How many swing spaces?

867
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:05,983
[SPEAKER_10]: How big is your theater?

868
01:24:06,403 --> 01:24:07,103
[SPEAKER_10]: All of it, right?

869
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:11,785
[SPEAKER_10]: So it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building.

870
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:18,801
[SPEAKER_10]: It also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building.

871
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:28,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important.

872
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:39,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Because between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work.

873
01:24:39,561 --> 01:24:45,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up.

874
01:24:46,888 --> 01:24:51,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process.

875
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:55,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been meeting with the administrative team since February.

876
01:24:55,832 --> 01:24:57,413
[SPEAKER_10]: We meet multiple times a week.

877
01:24:57,453 --> 01:24:58,693
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very sick of me.

878
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:04,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be sick of me.

879
01:25:04,736 --> 01:25:10,278
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at?

880
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:13,580
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to

881
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,301
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we do in this building?

882
01:25:15,562 --> 01:25:17,103
[SPEAKER_10]: All the classrooms have been counted.

883
01:25:18,645 --> 01:25:20,827
[SPEAKER_10]: All the programs have been outlined.

884
01:25:21,168 --> 01:25:26,774
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that.

885
01:25:27,534 --> 01:25:34,462
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future?

886
01:25:35,352 --> 01:25:40,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation.

887
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:47,688
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions.

888
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:51,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute.

889
01:25:51,579 --> 01:26:01,346
[SPEAKER_10]: We have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes they said yes we should be thinking about that.

890
01:26:02,107 --> 01:26:05,770
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we started to say okay what does that look like what might.

891
01:26:06,946 --> 01:26:07,987
[SPEAKER_10]: the requirements be.

892
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:21,458
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee.

893
01:26:21,838 --> 01:26:36,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback

894
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,872
[SPEAKER_10]: about that very narrow topic.

895
01:26:39,412 --> 01:26:49,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Would co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts?

896
01:26:50,662 --> 01:26:53,505
[SPEAKER_10]: There is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night.

897
01:26:54,366 --> 01:26:59,150
[SPEAKER_10]: He is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville.

898
01:26:59,838 --> 01:27:06,465
[SPEAKER_10]: He talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population.

899
01:27:06,485 --> 01:27:18,639
[SPEAKER_10]: It has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs.

900
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:21,422
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's huge, huge opportunity, but

901
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:34,607
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee.

902
01:27:34,647 --> 01:27:39,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So that has been turfed last night officially to the special education subcommittee.

903
01:27:40,231 --> 01:27:40,811
[SPEAKER_10]: They will meet.

904
01:27:41,211 --> 01:27:45,033
[SPEAKER_10]: They will invite current staff, current students, former students,

905
01:27:46,294 --> 01:28:02,480
[SPEAKER_10]: community members etc etc and Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation so they're on their way that will come back by mid-June so they have their work cut out for them but that will help us inform

906
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:07,442
[SPEAKER_10]: the drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school.

907
01:28:07,502 --> 01:28:14,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Because what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building.

908
01:28:15,346 --> 01:28:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students.

909
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:30,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will have to think carefully about how we craft that, but hopefully the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in.

910
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:45,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Marta and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term.

911
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in.

912
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education.

913
01:28:56,945 --> 01:29:00,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Our elementary schools are busting at the seams.

914
01:29:00,347 --> 01:29:03,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to grapple with that problem sometime.

915
01:29:03,689 --> 01:29:05,070
[SPEAKER_10]: MEEP used to be housed here.

916
01:29:07,462 --> 01:29:19,772
[SPEAKER_10]: and we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here and that may or may not be ultimately where we land but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time.

917
01:29:20,653 --> 01:29:28,659
[SPEAKER_10]: We also talked a lot about students who don't have any sort of pre-k education and as they enter our public schools

918
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:32,221
[SPEAKER_10]: just how challenging the entry for those students are.

919
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:36,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we are also talking about things like, how big is the wait list?

920
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:41,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-K setting?

921
01:29:41,446 --> 01:29:50,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building?

922
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all of that would need to go into this document.

923
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:53,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are working on that.

924
01:29:55,938 --> 01:30:02,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile.

925
01:30:02,504 --> 01:30:07,028
[SPEAKER_10]: The one big piece of the educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy.

926
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll talk about that in just a minute.

927
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:16,397
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together.

928
01:30:16,957 --> 01:30:19,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want you all to know it's all in process.

929
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:34,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we go through our next several meetings, we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe.

930
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:39,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say,

931
01:30:40,533 --> 01:30:51,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera.

932
01:30:51,219 --> 01:30:54,041
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where we are on the educational profile.

933
01:30:55,222 --> 01:30:57,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Curtis Tufts co-location is in subcommittee.

934
01:30:58,524 --> 01:31:05,248
[SPEAKER_10]: The other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEAP.

935
01:31:06,301 --> 01:31:17,852
[SPEAKER_10]: What MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process.

936
01:31:17,912 --> 01:31:20,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, do we combine two schools?

937
01:31:20,595 --> 01:31:27,421
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to

938
01:31:28,742 --> 01:31:29,282
[SPEAKER_10]: move quickly.

939
01:31:29,362 --> 01:31:45,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are trying to both think very big because this is a one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible.

940
01:31:45,307 --> 01:31:51,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible.

941
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:53,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And Peter, can you go to the next slide?

942
01:31:55,317 --> 01:32:04,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Very similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability.

943
01:32:04,501 --> 01:32:09,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Chapter 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right?

944
01:32:09,923 --> 01:32:10,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

945
01:32:11,644 --> 01:32:13,004
[SPEAKER_10]: That drafting is in progress.

946
01:32:13,144 --> 01:32:15,605
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to tell them, here are the programs we have.

947
01:32:16,146 --> 01:32:18,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is the capacity of those programs.

948
01:32:18,066 --> 01:32:21,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's our current enrollment and things like what is our wait list.

949
01:32:22,249 --> 01:32:28,133
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs.

950
01:32:28,813 --> 01:32:33,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Chad and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion.

951
01:32:33,976 --> 01:32:38,839
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building.

952
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:39,980
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes equipment.

953
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,761
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes staffing.

954
01:32:40,801 --> 01:32:42,742
[SPEAKER_10]: So the school committee has to weigh in on that.

955
01:32:43,122 --> 01:32:50,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of the chapter 70 form.

956
01:32:50,908 --> 01:32:53,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well.

957
01:32:55,592 --> 01:33:05,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there is a piece of the puzzle which the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning.

958
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:10,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can start to feed information into what they call their enrollment study.

959
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:13,008
[SPEAKER_10]: That helps size the building.

960
01:33:13,028 --> 01:33:17,275
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4000 students and now there's only 1200 that.

961
01:33:19,543 --> 01:33:23,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different.

962
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:32,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students.

963
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:37,932
[SPEAKER_10]: That usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today.

964
01:33:38,173 --> 01:33:48,338
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that.

965
01:33:49,579 --> 01:33:54,526
[SPEAKER_10]: So that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity.

966
01:33:54,907 --> 01:33:59,053
[SPEAKER_10]: They also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity.

967
01:33:59,293 --> 01:33:59,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

968
01:33:59,573 --> 01:34:01,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so that's some of the work that's happening there.

969
01:34:04,461 --> 01:34:07,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Fourth thing, maintenance documents.

970
01:34:08,044 --> 01:34:13,749
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district.

971
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:17,313
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's things like, do you do recommissioning?

972
01:34:17,573 --> 01:34:18,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And how is your staff trained?

973
01:34:18,954 --> 01:34:20,536
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like 20 variables.

974
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:26,801
[SPEAKER_10]: That document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible.

975
01:34:27,482 --> 01:34:29,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get to that probably a little bit later in June.

976
01:34:30,358 --> 01:34:42,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Final thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars.

977
01:34:43,628 --> 01:34:46,430
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not ready for that yet, but we're making plans.

978
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:56,978
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be.

979
01:34:58,214 --> 01:34:59,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions about the process?

980
01:35:00,456 --> 01:35:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, is the fifth one, so when it says local authorization, does that imply the electorate doesn't cast a vote?

981
01:35:08,101 --> 01:35:08,141
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

982
01:35:08,801 --> 01:35:15,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want a majority, or does it imply the city government has identified funding in full?

983
01:35:15,566 --> 01:35:16,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

984
01:35:16,406 --> 01:35:20,109
[SPEAKER_03]: A part of which will be reimbursed, but I think the authorization has to be for the full amount.

985
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:24,412
[SPEAKER_03]: The correct tell you what the reimbursement is based on where we fall.

986
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:24,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

987
01:35:25,112 --> 01:35:36,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So the feet so the feasibility, this funding will have to cover the whole expense of the feasibility study, not the whole project, just the feasibility study, which is like two to two and a half million dollars.

988
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,601
[SPEAKER_10]: The city will pay for that entire feasibility study up front.

989
01:35:43,141 --> 01:35:57,905
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once the MSBA certifies our reimbursement rate for the project, and we are successful all the way through, they will reimburse the feasibility study that is commensurate with the allocation percentage that they provide us.

990
01:35:57,945 --> 01:36:03,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, they will use that same formula and apply to the feasibility study and rebate back the city.

991
01:36:03,446 --> 01:36:05,086
[SPEAKER_10]: But the city has to front this money.

992
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:07,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So what has to happen here is,

993
01:36:08,267 --> 01:36:17,650
[SPEAKER_10]: we've got a funding plan for that.

994
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:19,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and we should be good.

995
01:36:19,431 --> 01:36:26,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were okay there, and that will require a vote of the city council to authorize the funds and put it in a place where we can access it.

996
01:36:26,393 --> 01:36:26,513
[SPEAKER_10]: But

997
01:36:30,904 --> 01:36:35,186
[SPEAKER_10]: As I mentioned, all of this has to be wrapped up by January.

998
01:36:36,026 --> 01:36:39,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Each has a particular deadline associated with it.

999
01:36:40,848 --> 01:36:49,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going to be really aggressive and tell you that I want all of these things to be completed before the start of school next year.

1000
01:36:49,211 --> 01:36:53,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And wherever it is possible, I want these things to be done by June 30.

1001
01:36:54,874 --> 01:36:57,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is why we've been meeting and working and pushing.

1002
01:36:58,857 --> 01:37:02,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it's important for us to stretch.

1003
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's stretch and let's get ready.

1004
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:13,428
[SPEAKER_10]: The MSBA will have their work to do in terms of getting the enrollment study certified and all of that.

1005
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:19,172
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want us to be able to give them everything they need so that we can move as quickly as possible into that next phase.

1006
01:37:19,993 --> 01:37:21,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions about timeline?

1007
01:37:21,714 --> 01:37:23,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1008
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:28,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we have just 20 minutes left.

1009
01:37:29,418 --> 01:37:36,523
[SPEAKER_10]: To that end, we have listed on the back of the agenda a number of upcoming subcommittee meetings.

1010
01:37:37,183 --> 01:37:44,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like us to think about and prioritize two things as we go into this first phase.

1011
01:37:44,468 --> 01:37:48,951
[SPEAKER_10]: One is a communications and community engagement committee.

1012
01:37:49,651 --> 01:38:03,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I want sort of a subcommittee, which would be no more than seven voting members, but an interested group to meet in subcommittee to really be able to describe and outline our community engagement process.

1013
01:38:04,184 --> 01:38:13,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you all have seen people in the community express their concern for, is Medford gonna screw this up?

1014
01:38:14,753 --> 01:38:15,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to work?

1015
01:38:15,513 --> 01:38:16,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to happen?

1016
01:38:16,654 --> 01:38:19,315
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's huge community outreach that has to happen.

1017
01:38:19,375 --> 01:38:23,417
[SPEAKER_10]: And the sooner that we start that, the more successful we will be in the end.

1018
01:38:24,518 --> 01:38:31,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a bigger conversation, though, because also in my mind, we have a huge array of boards and commissions.

1019
01:38:31,622 --> 01:38:33,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of them are interested in this project.

1020
01:38:34,183 --> 01:38:41,707
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's going to need to be some outreach to understand when and how to engage them so we can have that on our master plan moving forward.

1021
01:38:43,012 --> 01:38:46,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Second group I would like to form tonight is the Rules and Onboarding Committee.

1022
01:38:46,793 --> 01:38:55,175
[SPEAKER_10]: So just like you heard from Janelle, we do have to establish some rules of how we will operate, particularly around public participation, but just in general.

1023
01:38:56,135 --> 01:38:57,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I expect this committee to be time limited.

1024
01:38:58,035 --> 01:39:05,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping you can meet once, bring a draft back to this group, and then we can adopt those rules and sort of manage from there.

1025
01:39:06,697 --> 01:39:10,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the third committee that won't meet quite as quickly, but will meet,

1026
01:39:12,255 --> 01:39:21,646
[SPEAKER_10]: You know before before the end of June is the finance subcommittee so that will be a standing committee that will meet and continue throughout the life of the project.

1027
01:39:22,747 --> 01:39:27,532
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important to note that when the time comes where the community has to vote.

1028
01:39:28,253 --> 01:39:31,075
[SPEAKER_10]: This committee is not where that work happens.

1029
01:39:33,076 --> 01:39:42,020
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we are talking about ultimately needing a debt exclusion in order to fund this project, this committee is not where like, let's pass the debt exclusion happens.

1030
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,281
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually cannot happen here.

1031
01:39:44,501 --> 01:39:47,283
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to happen outside of this group.

1032
01:39:47,463 --> 01:39:53,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So this finance committee, I see this as more providing input and insight into things like

1033
01:39:54,406 --> 01:40:01,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Purchasing, procurement of our owner's project manager, of our architects, that kind of thing.

1034
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:07,173
[SPEAKER_10]: But also to help inform the fine-tuning of what do we need for feasibility?

1035
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:09,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there other costs we need to be accounting for?

1036
01:40:09,734 --> 01:40:17,378
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is some finance work to be done, albeit I'm not anticipating that that group will meet until a little bit later in May.

1037
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:24,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll talk a little bit more about like Robert's Rules of Order and all of that in our next meeting.

1038
01:40:25,675 --> 01:40:28,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's everyone's like looking at me like stop talking, please.

1039
01:40:29,417 --> 01:40:39,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think what I'm interested in is like if there are people who heard any of those topics and said I really want to be part of

1040
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:43,525
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those subcommittees, can you just identify yourself?

1041
01:40:43,665 --> 01:40:53,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would also politely suggest that the school administrators maybe keep your hands down because you have your own work to do to get ready for all the rest of what we just described.

1042
01:40:53,355 --> 01:40:54,456
[SPEAKER_10]: You're 100% welcome to.

1043
01:40:57,319 --> 01:41:01,001
[SPEAKER_10]: to participate, but we need you to be presenting at the school committee.

1044
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:04,482
[SPEAKER_10]: We need John and Peter to be helping with those maintenance plans, et cetera.

1045
01:41:04,522 --> 01:41:16,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there are folks who are interested in any of those other topics, the committee cannot be too big, but it can be any size that we deem necessary in order to get the work done.

1046
01:41:16,648 --> 01:41:19,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So those subcommittees, I put them on the calendar.

1047
01:41:19,869 --> 01:41:24,811
[SPEAKER_10]: We will meet by Zoom completely on those evenings just to make things a little bit easier.

1048
01:41:27,312 --> 01:41:35,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Each will have a pretty specific deliverable by our next meeting on May 13, which is to bring back a draft of sort of what their proposal is.

1049
01:41:37,528 --> 01:41:38,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any volunteers?

1050
01:41:40,412 --> 01:41:40,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1051
01:41:41,474 --> 01:41:42,095
[SPEAKER_16]: For the other 2.

1052
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:44,278
[SPEAKER_16]: specify how many?

1053
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:45,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it matter?

1054
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:48,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it can be any number of people.

1055
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:50,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It cannot be more than seven voting members.

1056
01:41:51,403 --> 01:42:01,111
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think if we literally have just taken all the school staff off the table, I'm not overly concerned that we'll trip on that.

1057
01:42:01,231 --> 01:42:09,977
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm more interested in people doing the things that they feel like are a good fit for the work they're doing, for the work that they're passionate about.

1058
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:14,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1059
01:42:14,057 --> 01:42:17,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Maria.

1060
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:18,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications.

1061
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:19,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1062
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:20,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Tracy.

1063
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:21,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Rules.

1064
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:21,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1065
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:25,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications.

1066
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:25,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa.

1067
01:42:26,061 --> 01:42:26,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1068
01:42:26,461 --> 01:42:29,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I could put on two and see if there would be enough.

1069
01:42:29,642 --> 01:42:33,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I would go to communications or finance.

1070
01:42:33,484 --> 01:42:34,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1071
01:42:34,444 --> 01:42:34,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1072
01:42:35,004 --> 01:42:36,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put you in finance.

1073
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:37,185
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that sound?

1074
01:42:37,205 --> 01:42:37,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

1075
01:42:37,845 --> 01:42:38,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1076
01:42:42,107 --> 01:42:43,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1077
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And Fiona?

1078
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:47,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Finance.

1079
01:42:48,093 --> 01:42:50,455
[SPEAKER_10]: And can we sign Bob up for finance as well?

1080
01:42:50,515 --> 01:42:51,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1081
01:42:51,276 --> 01:42:53,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1082
01:42:53,438 --> 01:42:54,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other takers for these committees?

1083
01:43:02,816 --> 01:43:04,698
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't get enough finance, I'll call.

1084
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:06,360
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1085
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put you on the list.

1086
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:12,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Put me as a finance.

1087
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:14,948
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two people for rules and onboarding.

1088
01:43:14,968 --> 01:43:19,573
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

1089
01:43:19,713 --> 01:43:22,976
[SPEAKER_10]: I was planning to sit on all of the committees, but that's correct.

1090
01:43:26,644 --> 01:43:32,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we can ask Emily Lazzaro to be on the rules and onboarding subcommittee.

1091
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:34,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will check with her.

1092
01:43:35,211 --> 01:43:39,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have put Nicole Morel on the communications subcommittee as well.

1093
01:43:39,275 --> 01:43:40,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll check in with them.

1094
01:43:41,036 --> 01:43:45,860
[SPEAKER_10]: But is there anybody else who feels strongly?

1095
01:43:46,421 --> 01:43:47,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Where would you like to go?

1096
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:49,843
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do communications.

1097
01:43:50,024 --> 01:43:50,504
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, great.

1098
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:55,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to say finance, but I definitely don't have as much experience in that.

1099
01:43:55,313 --> 01:43:57,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're good.

1100
01:43:58,377 --> 01:43:58,637
[SPEAKER_10]: John?

1101
01:43:59,678 --> 01:44:00,979
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you have work to do.

1102
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, absolutely.

1103
01:44:04,263 --> 01:44:04,243
100%.

1104
01:44:04,863 --> 01:44:09,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think for all of the actual technicians in the group,

1105
01:44:10,289 --> 01:44:17,094
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a working group before we get too far into this that has to put together an RFP for an owner's project manager.

1106
01:44:17,615 --> 01:44:19,756
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not expertise that I hold.

1107
01:44:20,397 --> 01:44:21,477
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not why I'm here.

1108
01:44:21,538 --> 01:44:25,981
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be relying on everybody for different subcommittees over time.

1109
01:44:26,341 --> 01:44:30,504
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just in my near view what I thought we should start with.

1110
01:44:30,524 --> 01:44:31,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

1111
01:44:31,925 --> 01:44:36,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anybody have any other suggestions on things that must happen imminently?

1112
01:44:36,969 --> 01:44:37,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question.

1113
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:37,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1114
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:46,851
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned like the Curtis potentially coming here and all these various uses for the facility.

1115
01:44:48,172 --> 01:44:51,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is exploring those options, i.e.

1116
01:44:51,153 --> 01:45:05,937
[SPEAKER_11]: like community ed, like working maybe with a community college, evening courses like I was over there hoping about with the AGC Association of General Contractors and they're doing adult education.

1117
01:45:06,838 --> 01:45:07,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Is somebody like,

1118
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:14,167
[SPEAKER_11]: putting a bunch of options on the table that you guys like consider or how's that?

1119
01:45:14,487 --> 01:45:17,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, kind of, sort of not, but not quite.

1120
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:19,209
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not quite there yet.

1121
01:45:19,349 --> 01:45:28,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think once we get through this initial blush of the chapter 74 piece, like it might make sense for us to sort of add that in.

1122
01:45:28,753 --> 01:45:34,176
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we start reading through those documents, I think that's a good time to say like, who else do we need to reach out to?

1123
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:36,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Because all that kind of stuff will impact

1124
01:45:36,977 --> 01:45:43,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Accessibility, proximity, the size of facilities versus the other, storage, parking, you know.

1125
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:44,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1126
01:45:44,379 --> 01:45:45,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

1127
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,640
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put it on the list.

1128
01:45:48,441 --> 01:45:48,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1129
01:45:50,581 --> 01:45:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in fact limited by our city.

1130
01:45:54,102 --> 01:45:54,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We are.

1131
01:45:54,602 --> 01:45:59,824
[SPEAKER_05]: If everybody in the room was like, Bedford Rec should be here.

1132
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,841
[SPEAKER_10]: But community schools is, so.

1133
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:07,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1134
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:16,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1135
01:46:16,311 --> 01:46:22,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I wanted to ask, you know, who's going to resource this committee with any form of digital infrastructure?

1136
01:46:22,995 --> 01:46:24,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll reference the SOI.

1137
01:46:24,617 --> 01:46:25,477
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the SOI.

1138
01:46:25,797 --> 01:46:29,240
[SPEAKER_03]: There were surveys looking at Fed.SOI.

1139
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:36,405
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably a whole list of other public documents that are not actually publicly accessible, but that should be.

1140
01:46:36,825 --> 01:46:43,170
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this communication community engagement subcommittee is going to have the burden of

1141
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:56,330
[SPEAKER_03]: communicating the same thing probably to many people, that's most efficiently done through a website, through maybe a shared repository, and certainly there could be an outward facing

1142
01:46:57,238 --> 01:47:09,866
[SPEAKER_03]: in a portal, right, like a website, like every school that's had one of these projects, and then kind of a back-end repository where the Sheldon can look at the SOI, for example.

1143
01:47:10,226 --> 01:47:15,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be available anytime to members who are, you know, sort of on the access list.

1144
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:15,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1145
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:17,171
[SPEAKER_03]: All it takes is resourcing.

1146
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:20,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give you an update.

1147
01:47:20,413 --> 01:47:20,954
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this.

1148
01:47:21,234 --> 01:47:30,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So we actually procured a URL that's unique to this committee and it's buildingmhs.org.

1149
01:47:30,342 --> 01:47:30,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?

1150
01:47:30,822 --> 01:47:31,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1151
01:47:32,683 --> 01:47:34,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So the URL exists.

1152
01:47:34,845 --> 01:47:36,647
[SPEAKER_10]: The page exists.

1153
01:47:37,928 --> 01:47:43,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Thomas is actually working on the sort of bones of that community resource.

1154
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:52,459
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason that we asked you all for bios and pictures is those will all go on the website, so he's working through all of that in his role as the Director of Communications.

1155
01:47:52,899 --> 01:48:00,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom has agreed, even though he is the outgoing Director of Communications, to stay on specifically for this project until we hire his replacement.

1156
01:48:01,765 --> 01:48:08,911
[SPEAKER_10]: So that website is being built both by Thomas and some of our vocational students, I'm assuming under Lisa Miller.

1157
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:16,476
[SPEAKER_10]: And there will be a documents component of that where all of those publicly accessible documents will be so that when somebody says, where is this?

1158
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:17,977
[SPEAKER_10]: We can point them to one place.

1159
01:48:18,418 --> 01:48:19,859
[SPEAKER_10]: All our meeting minutes will go there.

1160
01:48:20,019 --> 01:48:21,660
[SPEAKER_10]: All of our meeting agendas will go there.

1161
01:48:22,401 --> 01:48:27,144
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got a whole structure in place already to try to do that.

1162
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:30,867
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not quite ready, but I am hoping by the next meeting, we'll be able to give her a tour

1163
01:48:31,207 --> 01:48:31,568
[SPEAKER_10]: website.

1164
01:48:31,848 --> 01:48:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so just the follow-up is that'll be the outward-facing portal.

1165
01:48:35,853 --> 01:48:37,575
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the back end for us?

1166
01:48:39,014 --> 01:48:44,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a tricky question, because under the open meeting law, there really isn't a back end for us.

1167
01:48:44,736 --> 01:48:50,277
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as an agenda is posted, all of its documents are part of the public record.

1168
01:48:51,018 --> 01:48:59,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we are, what's tricky is if we are working on things behind the scenes, we are very likely violating the open meeting law.

1169
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:08,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So the administrators have working copies of the documents that they are working on, and they do not represent a quorum, and they can continue to do that.

1170
01:49:09,163 --> 01:49:16,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Once those documents come here, they will be placed in a publicly available drive.

1171
01:49:16,627 --> 01:49:21,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we talk about editing a document, there is no offline editing of this committee.

1172
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,951
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not allowed under the open meeting law.

1173
01:49:22,991 --> 01:49:27,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So unfortunately, we will painfully sit here and jointly edit a document.

1174
01:49:27,874 --> 01:49:35,098
[SPEAKER_10]: It is truly one of the most painful parts of managing this process that

1175
01:49:35,858 --> 01:49:39,121
[SPEAKER_10]: you all have signed up for, I'm sorry.

1176
01:49:39,161 --> 01:49:50,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it is incredibly painful, but offline, the kind of offline editing that works super effectively in literally every other place in the world is not an option here.

1177
01:49:51,263 --> 01:49:53,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there's no Google Drive, no shared documents.

1178
01:49:54,804 --> 01:49:55,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Things will be released.

1179
01:49:56,205 --> 01:49:58,405
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're released, they appear on the website.

1180
01:49:58,865 --> 01:50:06,468
[SPEAKER_03]: When they appear on the website, they're essentially configuration control and cannot be changed unless those changes are conducted here in-verse.

1181
01:50:06,908 --> 01:50:07,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1182
01:50:08,207 --> 01:50:14,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yes, it is terrible.

1183
01:50:14,258 --> 01:50:17,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

1184
01:50:17,743 --> 01:50:18,905
[SPEAKER_10]: It is absolutely terrible.

1185
01:50:20,087 --> 01:50:21,470
[SPEAKER_10]: We have found ways to make it.

1186
01:50:22,188 --> 01:50:25,710
[SPEAKER_10]: less terrible, but it's, you know, degrees of less terrible, sadly.

1187
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:34,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is a surefire way to get yourself in hot water with the community in terms of how documents get edited.

1188
01:50:36,276 --> 01:50:41,819
[SPEAKER_10]: So there will, and when we do those, I find that those meetings are far more effective on Zoom.

1189
01:50:42,259 --> 01:50:47,422
[SPEAKER_10]: You can sit where you need to sit and everybody can watch a document be edited and there can be no sort of

1190
01:50:48,162 --> 01:50:51,423
[SPEAKER_10]: idea that the document's being edited without happening in the open.

1191
01:50:51,483 --> 01:50:53,904
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to tread very lightly on that.

1192
01:50:54,904 --> 01:50:58,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it is a process.

1193
01:50:58,405 --> 01:51:00,126
[SPEAKER_10]: It's strange how it applies to the GraphDoc.

1194
01:51:00,326 --> 01:51:02,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see it applying to the release document.

1195
01:51:03,247 --> 01:51:03,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1196
01:51:04,627 --> 01:51:06,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing about the GraphDoc.

1197
01:51:06,468 --> 01:51:10,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We've learned that there's a lot of us working.

1198
01:51:10,269 --> 01:51:11,090
[SPEAKER_05]: We're deliberating.

1199
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:12,910
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a common, young, shared group.

1200
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:13,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1201
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:14,371
[SPEAKER_16]: That's deliberation.

1202
01:51:14,531 --> 01:51:14,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1203
01:51:16,729 --> 01:51:17,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1204
01:51:17,129 --> 01:51:20,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a conversation with each of them in the office last fall.

1205
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:22,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that one period.

1206
01:51:22,231 --> 01:51:25,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had an entirely long call.

1207
01:51:25,092 --> 01:51:27,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 40 members.

1208
01:51:28,353 --> 01:51:33,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And one member was like, Simon just mentioned in the doc, and like, read our comments there.

1209
01:51:33,415 --> 01:51:34,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, we put them together.

1210
01:51:36,416 --> 01:51:37,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer's no.

1211
01:51:37,356 --> 01:51:38,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can type your comments.

1212
01:51:39,557 --> 01:51:42,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm responding to have your seven years.

1213
01:51:42,137 --> 01:51:44,218
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, OK, acknowledged.

1214
01:51:46,379 --> 01:51:46,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1215
01:51:47,037 --> 01:51:48,038
[SPEAKER_05]: just, we're sorry.

1216
01:51:48,258 --> 01:51:51,281
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like, we agree this is probably going to be dangerous.

1217
01:51:53,603 --> 01:51:53,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1218
01:51:58,889 --> 01:51:59,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you again for being here.

1219
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:05,813
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very interested in the comms piece too, although those nights don't work, but I'm happy to always take some calls.

1220
01:52:05,873 --> 01:52:08,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And they will come back here.

1221
01:52:08,575 --> 01:52:10,296
[SPEAKER_10]: All of those updates will come back here.

1222
01:52:11,977 --> 01:52:18,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions I can answer about subcommittees or anything else that was on the agenda?

1223
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:22,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question about voting.

1224
01:52:23,793 --> 01:52:32,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, when we get to voting, yes, we're not what's one thing that I've never got my head around is proxy allowed.

1225
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:32,880
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1226
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:35,260
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it is not.

1227
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:38,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Is proxy allowed in a meeting?

1228
01:52:38,462 --> 01:52:41,305
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you cannot assign your vote to somebody else.

1229
01:52:42,066 --> 01:52:46,970
[SPEAKER_10]: As we adjourn this meeting, we're going to practice voting, because we have to vote to adjourn the meeting.

1230
01:52:47,991 --> 01:52:52,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally, that would happen via what they call a voice vote, where everyone just says aye, and we go.

1231
01:52:52,135 --> 01:52:55,898
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just going to practice a roll call, because it's

1232
01:52:56,858 --> 01:53:00,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, weird and awkward, so we'll do that to adjourn the meeting.

1233
01:53:00,863 --> 01:53:04,347
[SPEAKER_10]: But any other questions before we adjourn the meeting?

1234
01:53:09,224 --> 01:53:11,805
[SPEAKER_08]: He was paying attention.

1235
01:53:12,005 --> 01:53:18,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the other thing that's worth describing is that there are a healthy number of non-voting members on this committee.

1236
01:53:19,449 --> 01:53:22,530
[SPEAKER_10]: The reasons for that are not because we don't want to hear from you.

1237
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:24,952
[SPEAKER_10]: You're here because we want to hear from you.

1238
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:28,533
[SPEAKER_10]: When the vote happens, we will not call your name and you will not vote.

1239
01:53:28,573 --> 01:53:31,975
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, you are a full member of this committee.

1240
01:53:31,995 --> 01:53:34,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I was cautioned that

1241
01:53:36,497 --> 01:53:44,865
[SPEAKER_10]: When you have too many voting members, it becomes very hard to conduct business because you must have a quorum of the committee to even meet and conduct business.

1242
01:53:45,205 --> 01:53:46,807
[SPEAKER_10]: That all becomes very, very complicated.

1243
01:53:46,827 --> 01:53:57,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So this was sort of our attempt to say, we want to have a big round committee, but we also need to be able to like move efficiently and effectively and all of that stuff.

1244
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:58,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of the rationale behind.

1245
01:54:00,003 --> 01:54:00,724
[SPEAKER_10]: what we did there.

1246
01:54:02,184 --> 01:54:07,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I think that, you know, the size of this committee is going to change over the course of its life, for sure.

1247
01:54:09,128 --> 01:54:10,249
[SPEAKER_14]: So of the 25?

1248
01:54:10,469 --> 01:54:18,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there are there are 15 voting members of the committee, which is also still quite a good number of voting members.

1249
01:54:18,213 --> 01:54:19,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll practice voting in just a second.

1250
01:54:21,135 --> 01:54:23,796
[SPEAKER_10]: But are there any other questions next meeting?

1251
01:54:25,697 --> 01:54:27,959
[SPEAKER_10]: The rules, the rules and onboarding May 7.

1252
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:34,525
[SPEAKER_10]: community engagement May 8, and they will bring their findings back to this group on May 13.

1253
01:54:35,465 --> 01:54:44,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So the vast majority of our May 13th meeting will be working through those recommendations, agreeing on those plans.

1254
01:54:44,287 --> 01:54:46,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, so we're sort of in start mode.

1255
01:54:46,548 --> 01:54:56,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after that, we're going to get into the meat of some of these documents that the administration has been working on and start doing a read through of those documents, talking about what's there.

1256
01:54:57,065 --> 01:54:59,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And that kind of thing, but we're going to move fast.

1257
01:54:59,767 --> 01:55:01,268
[SPEAKER_10]: We did lay out the meeting schedule.

1258
01:55:02,929 --> 01:55:10,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Just by way of, like, a little bit of rationale there, we're going to meet as best we can in person here at show for 89 for.

1259
01:55:11,675 --> 01:55:12,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Between now and the end of June.

1260
01:55:14,564 --> 01:55:27,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I promise you we're going to get back to Monday nights come the beginning of next school year, but this between now and the end of June between school committee meetings and holidays, it was like, completely impossible to actually hold that kind of schedule.

1261
01:55:29,049 --> 01:55:33,831
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll meet only via zoom in the summer and we actually move the meetings to Wednesdays.

1262
01:55:34,431 --> 01:55:40,774
[SPEAKER_10]: in consideration that Mondays and Fridays are really very hard in the summer to get a quorum of anybody to do anything.

1263
01:55:41,294 --> 01:55:46,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully we can make that work, but I did try to keep the meeting schedule light.

1264
01:55:47,597 --> 01:55:54,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there will be more subcommittees between now and the end of August, but this was just sort of a start so people can try to organize their busy lives.

1265
01:55:56,201 --> 01:55:56,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1266
01:55:57,261 --> 01:55:58,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So two things.

1267
01:55:58,762 --> 01:56:01,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one proxy question though.

1268
01:56:01,463 --> 01:56:02,444
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't make it,

1269
01:56:03,752 --> 01:56:12,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay, send your also send an email with all your thoughts and comments to share your voices on.

1270
01:56:22,516 --> 01:56:28,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is a technical question.

1271
01:56:28,698 --> 01:56:37,342
[SPEAKER_03]: A gentleman who can't make the meeting sends you an email indicating his thoughts and recommendations, possibly even a decision.

1272
01:56:38,822 --> 01:56:44,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier, we heard emails are a bad idea for just about everything except agenda setting.

1273
01:56:44,243 --> 01:56:46,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this sounds like a gray area.

1274
01:56:46,664 --> 01:56:50,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering, so you had an open meeting lost, and those two things are in conflict.

1275
01:56:51,005 --> 01:56:51,865
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it work?

1276
01:56:52,305 --> 01:56:58,326
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can sort of tell you that I think any lawyer would tell you don't put anything in writing ever.

1277
01:56:59,006 --> 01:57:00,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where we start.

1278
01:57:00,307 --> 01:57:01,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't put anything in writing ever.

1279
01:57:03,227 --> 01:57:06,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Having said that, if you are going to put something in writing,

1280
01:57:07,788 --> 01:57:10,770
[SPEAKER_10]: It like in that kind of scenario, yes, it's a gray area.

1281
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:17,272
[SPEAKER_10]: What you should do is like make contact with somebody and say, hey, can I send you my thoughts?

1282
01:57:17,993 --> 01:57:21,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And have you discussed these things with anybody else or do you intend to?

1283
01:57:21,654 --> 01:57:26,916
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you can feel reasonably sure that you've got a closed circuit, right?

1284
01:57:27,657 --> 01:57:30,098
[SPEAKER_10]: That you say to me, can I send you my thoughts?

1285
01:57:30,398 --> 01:57:31,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, yes.

1286
01:57:31,458 --> 01:57:35,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, I'm not gonna talk to anybody else about these matters, then we're good.

1287
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:41,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It only becomes a problem when you have then connected to a number of people that represents a voting majority on the committee.

1288
01:57:43,748 --> 01:57:51,213
[SPEAKER_10]: If, for example, you said, I want to tell two people because I'm not sure who's going to actually make the meeting, that's still OK, because you're south of eight.

1289
01:57:51,474 --> 01:57:56,537
[SPEAKER_10]: When you have talked with yourself included, with eight people, now you're in trouble.

1290
01:57:56,817 --> 01:57:58,859
[SPEAKER_10]: That is when you have violated the open meeting law.

1291
01:57:59,379 --> 01:58:06,724
[SPEAKER_10]: The tricky part is everybody involved has to have the same understanding of who has been involved in that conversation.

1292
01:58:07,665 --> 01:58:08,185
[SPEAKER_10]: What did I miss?

1293
01:58:08,205 --> 01:58:11,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed that on my post on the box.

1294
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:13,600
[SPEAKER_05]: you can be very intentional.

1295
01:58:13,901 --> 01:58:15,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only telling you, and you're like, uh-huh.

1296
01:58:16,241 --> 01:58:21,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go and do the same thing, we are all violating the law, no matter what we did to try and prevent it.

1297
01:58:22,764 --> 01:58:27,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, I think that's very true of all law-abiding citizens.

1298
01:58:27,385 --> 01:58:34,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Serial deliberation does not care about anything, about content, plans, or insurance.

1299
01:58:34,147 --> 01:58:35,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the two of us, right?

1300
01:58:36,728 --> 01:58:38,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You go and violate that.

1301
01:58:39,069 --> 01:58:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I have broken so many laws.

1302
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:41,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if I don't know,

1303
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:43,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

1304
01:58:43,952 --> 01:58:46,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, that's pretty much my question.

1305
01:58:50,348 --> 01:59:00,817
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to get everybody an email address under Medford Public Schools, and I would strongly encourage you not to use your personal email under any circumstances for any business related to MSBA.

1306
01:59:00,897 --> 01:59:04,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So as soon as those emails are set up, we'll convert everything over.

1307
01:59:05,621 --> 01:59:09,084
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would strongly advise that you not use your personal email for anything.

1308
01:59:09,164 --> 01:59:12,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes public records compliance way easier.

1309
01:59:12,867 --> 01:59:15,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the records access officer for the school district.

1310
01:59:17,151 --> 01:59:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Any documents that get done in the official business of the school other than your personal notes are public records automatically need to be furnishable or at least reviewable if somebody asks for them.

1311
01:59:30,017 --> 01:59:42,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So doing it all within your Medford Public Schools email address, within your Medford Public Schools Google suite where you can take notes and things like that is really helpful to just contain it all in that space.

1312
01:59:44,446 --> 01:59:46,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't share with others.

1313
01:59:46,327 --> 01:59:48,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get your draft in, your draft email.

1314
01:59:48,648 --> 01:59:52,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a place to write private notes.

1315
01:59:52,469 --> 01:59:52,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1316
01:59:52,949 --> 01:59:54,370
[SPEAKER_05]: We put nobody in the sense.

1317
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,730
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1318
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:56,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1319
01:59:58,191 --> 01:59:59,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Any last questions?

1320
02:00:01,112 --> 02:00:01,532
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 8.03.

1321
02:00:01,572 --> 02:00:06,774
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just going to, like, Robert's rules adjourn this meeting.

1322
02:00:07,134 --> 02:00:08,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1323
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:13,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to adjourn by Member Olapade, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1324
02:00:13,772 --> 02:00:14,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1325
02:00:15,092 --> 02:00:15,852

[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1327
