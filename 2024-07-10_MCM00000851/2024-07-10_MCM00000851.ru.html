 Вот мы и здесь.
 Мы так и сделали.
 Это было действительно интересно.
 Спасибо всем, кто пришел.
 По плану мы выедем сегодня вечером в 8 часов.
 Мы выходим до восьми часов.
 Я немного изменю программу, потому что Джанель из KP Law организует здесь открытый курс юридической подготовки.
 Так что пока пропустите инструкции.
 Таким образом, Джанель может провести открытую встречу во время тренировки, поскольку у нее есть резерв на вторую половину встречи.
 Поэтому я хочу убедиться, что у него будет достаточно времени для этого.
 Но перед этим я немедленно позвоню на съемку, кого мы здесь знаем?
 Дженни Грэм здесь.
 Мэр Луго-Коэна?</p>

 Он также провел встречу.
 Итак, у нас есть делегаты.
 Всего за несколько минут вы поймете, почему это важно.
 Но сейчас я отдам его Джанель.
 Но я думаю, первое, что я хочу сказать, это то, что все наши собрания подпадают под действие Закона об открытых собраниях.
 Благодаря 4-летнему опыту работы в отрасли, такое публичное собрание является наиболее передовым способом работы.
 Поэтому я просто хочу сказать, что это мой личный опыт.
 Оно существует по какой-то причине.
 Это необходимо, но это требует от всех нас тщательного обдумывания не только того, что мы говорим и делаем на собрании, но, что более важно, того, как мы делаем это сами вне собрания, потому что
 Возможно, вы неосознанно нарушаете правила открытых собраний.
 MSB требует от нас проводить все собрания в соответствии с Правилами открытых собраний.
 Поэтому мы считаем, что это важно для людей, имеющих некоторый опыт во всем этом.
 Избранные должностные лица Палаты понимают правила открытого заседания и могут дать совет тем, у кого есть вопросы.
 Я просто зарегистрировал их для этого.
 Хочу сказать присутствующим педагогам, что они регулярно общаются с школьным комитетом.
 По сути, вы не связаны правилами собрания, но в этом зале вы связаны этим.
 Так что это всего лишь вопрос организации ваших обязанностей таким образом.
 Поэтому я отправлю его Джанель.
 Джанель. Если вы хотите задать вопросы во время этого процесса или оставить их до тех пор, пока вы не закончите, сообщите нам об этом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=186.9s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 Мы вернемся с демонстрациями.
 Это отличная команда.
 Всего нас 25 человек.
 У нас были некоторые члены, которые не смогли присутствовать здесь сегодня вечером, и они сказали мне, чтобы мы могли выступить.
 Но я надеюсь, что мы сможем войти в комнату, и вы сможете представиться и кратко рассказать о том, как вы видите свою роль в комитете, и убедиться, что
 Если вы занимаете официальную должность в школе, все в классе вас знают и, возможно, не встречали вас раньше.
 Итак, Питер, ты хочешь начать?
 Конечно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3254.994s">[Unidentified]</a>: Всем спокойной ночи.
 Меня зовут Питер Кушинг, я помощник директора по развитию, инновациям и операционной деятельности американских государственных школ.

 Поэтому я рад быть частью этой команды и помогать строить будущее Metro.
 Меня зовут Джон ЛеБлан.
 Я управляющий зданием и землей.
 Я буду отмечать 38-летие работы в государственной школе Метро.
 Я жду этого.
 Я был в научной лаборатории, когда мы проводили научный эксперимент MSBA в старшей школе.
 Я работал по топливной программе в средней школе Медфорда.
 Когда мы это сделаем, это будет еще один проект MSBA.
 В долгосрочной перспективе я надеюсь, что смогу использовать свой богатый опыт, чтобы помочь нам двигаться вперед во что бы то ни стало.
 Всем спокойной ночи.
 Меня зовут Томас Далтон.
 Я руководитель отдела по связям с общественностью муниципального отдела социальных служб.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3335.777s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Не нравится.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3338.48s">[Unidentified]</a>: Но теперь в вашем распоряжении.
 Я специалист по связям с общественностью, работаю в государственных и местных органах власти.
 Но пока я еще жил в своем родном городе Стоунхэме, я также был членом школьного совета Стоунхема.
 За это время мы начали работать с MSBA над открытием в сентябре новой средней школы Стоунволл.
 В частности, этот процесс MSBA кажется мне очень знакомым.
 В это время я был членом школьного комитета.
 Я очень рад всем возможностям, которые мы использовали с государством, чтобы собрать так много полезной информации.
 Это было действительно интересно.
 Здравствуйте, сэр
 Меня зовут Пабло Руссо.
 Я являюсь членом членского комитета школы.
 Это мой седьмой год.
 Я должен сказать, что мне очень интересно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3399.517s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Спокойной ночи
 Меня зовут Трейси Кин.
 Я прожил в Медфорде 12 лет.
 Я профессионально работаю старшим директором фестивалей и директором по повседневному управлению Центром публичных исполнительских искусств на территории кампуса.
 В настоящее время я являюсь частью команды, строящей театр New Crossing Theater в Остине.
 Первая батарея появилась всего несколько месяцев назад.
 Поэтому я включил ежедневные операции, установку и управление ресурсами.
 Меня зовут Мария Дорси.
 Я работаю библиотекарем в Mad High School.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3443.751s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Я учусь в школе 28 лет.
 Я прожил в Медфорде 43 года.
 Мой муж - пожизненный житель.
 Я часть этого, поэтому у меня такое ощущение, будто я всегда был в Медфорде.
 Я работал там, когда мы переехали из старой библиотеки Брукса Хоббса в новую библиотеку МакГлинна.
 Два года спустя я переехал в новую школьную библиотеку Брукса.
 В 2010 году я перешёл в свою прежнюю среднюю школу, что стало для меня большим шоком.
 Но когда мы строили еще одну школу, меня в комитете не было, но я выполнял указания некоторых других зданий.
 Я посетил еженедельное мероприятие Джека Бакли вовремя и в рамках бюджета.
 Это невероятно.
 Мне был очень интересен весь процесс.
 Я вижу свою роль в функциональной части здания, в том, как оно будет работать для студентов, преподавателей и в использовании моего личного пространства.
 Здравствуйте, сэр
 Меня зовут Либби Браун.
 Я архитектор.
 Я живу в Медфорде почти 10 лет.
 Теперь, когда мои дети ходят в школу, я так рада, что это продолжающийся проект, и рада участвовать в нем.
 Я работаю в основном в сфере высшего образования, но также и в частном начальном и среднем образовании.
 У меня нет опыта работы в MSBA, но мы работали в MSCBA, поэтому у нас есть некоторый опыт получения высшего образования.
 Я просто думаю, что это прекрасная возможность для Медфорда.
 Я много работаю с педагогами, библиотекарями, дизайнерами и программистами, особенно выполняю множество этапов ремонта и оценки существующего оборудования, будь то обслуживание и ремонт, демонтаж, выполнение всего сразу или что-то между ними.
 Так что это интересный проект.
 Я рад быть там.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3566.699s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Я Ларри Браун, нормальный человек, живущий в нескольких кварталах отсюда.
 Поэтому я не знаю, для какой области я подхожу, но имею большой опыт в строительстве, планировании и девелопменте крупных жилых и коммерческих объектов.
 Я не буду обо всем этом рассказывать, но если кто-то захочет узнать мое прошлое, я могу рассказать об этом подробнее.
 Но я думаю, что мне интересно знать, как помочь вам на этом пути, потому что я делал это на разных уровнях, не для школы, а для других типов проектов.
 Как вы только что отметили, здесь действует множество факторов.
 Все это нужно делать по порядку.
 Мы не можем дойти до конца.
 Если я смогу помочь в этом процессе, я буду рад это сделать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3620.523s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Ларри, вы также учитель на пенсии из Медфордской профессиональной средней школы и время от времени там работали.</p>

 Я также являюсь членом школьного комитета Медфорда.
 Знаете, несколько лет назад я окончил среднюю школу Медфорда в 2018 году и только что окончил колледж Британской Колумбии в мае прошлого года.
 Большая часть работы, которую я проделал в последние годы, заключалась в вовлечении общества, особенно молодежи.
 Я взял годичный отпуск, чтобы поработать в Бостоне, а затем работал учителем в школьной системе Чарльстона.
 Во время учебы в колледже я также много занимался общественной работой.
 С тех пор меня только что назначили директором Новой программы молодежной работы в Молдене.
 Поэтому я работаю в мэрии, стараюсь обеспечить детям возможность найти работу.
 Так что, если у вас есть дети, которые вас интересуют, пожалуйста, дайте мне знать.
 Я стараюсь найти работу летом и в учебный год.
 Так что мои малыши счастливы.
 Я думаю, что большое внимание я уделяю участию молодежи и тому, чтобы наши студенты получали то, что они заслуживают.
 Я думаю, именно для этого мы здесь и собрались.
 Так что я очень рад за вас всех.</p>

 Я думаю, вы оба можете пропустить этот проект до того, как он выйдет в свет.
 Но у меня много обязательств дома, поэтому мы должны быть здесь.
 Но я очень этого жду.
 По своей специальности я владею консалтинговой фирмой по вопросам управления.
 Я много работал над улучшением процесса разработки и реализации программ обучения взрослых и управления проектами.
 Итак, я сертифицированный менеджер проектов, а не в строительной отрасли.
 Но я знаю, как привести большую группу людей к достижению цели.
 Вот почему я здесь.
 Джанель много говорит о роли, которую мне предстоит сыграть за считанные минуты.
 Все эти вещи мы обсудим в свое время.
 Но я рад, что вы все здесь.

 Я знаю, что у нас здесь много людей, которые работают непосредственно в школе или имеют прочные отношения со школой, поэтому я могу взглянуть на конкретную проблему с другой точки зрения и дать вам возможность высказать свое мнение.
 Может, это сработает, а может, это просто кусок спагетти, скользнувший по стене.
 Но я думаю, что это моя роль здесь, внешняя роль, но действительно мотивирующая открыть новую среднюю школу в Медфорде.

 Вот почему мне повезло, что я могу помочь построить новую школу для наших первокурсников, потому что они действительно этого заслуживают.
 У меня нет такого же опыта строительства и строительства, как у всех остальных.
 Но все, что я мог сделать, это представить, где наши ученики, учителя и персонал понадобятся в средней школе Медфорда.
 Я очень рад этому, потому что думаю, что мы сможем это сделать.
 Укрепить преподавание и обучение, создав пространство для сотрудничества и инноваций.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4089.096s">[MCM00000883_SPEAKER_09]</a>: Я рад быть там, спасибо.
 Я Лори Ходждон.
 Я был директором школы Кертис Стаббс, вероятно, самого старого здания.
 Конечно.
 Я люблю старую архитектуру, люблю Кертиса Стаббса, но знаю, что это не для студентов 21 века.
 Вот почему я так рад стать учителем основной средней школы в Вермонте, директором в Массачусетсе, к западу от Норт-Шор, а затем и чартерной школы.
 Когда я был студентом в Миддлбери, штат Вермонт, я все еще находился на завершающей стадии строительного проекта и видел, как это произошло.
 Мы оба носили ботинки, и мой брат мог пользоваться преимуществами здания.
 Я чувствую, что все еще нахожусь в своем исходном состоянии.
 Или конец чего-то.
 Я думаю, это действительно интересно.
 Я не думаю, что каждый город имеет возможность строить новые школьные здания и думать о будущем, особенно ученики, с которыми я работаю, чтобы помочь нашим ученикам получить капитал и культурные ресурсы, которые, по моему мнению, действительно важны.
 Мне нравится то, что Дженни говорит некоторым местным жителям или тем, кто это придумал, мне нравится думать, что наши нынешние студенты определенно станут частью этого здания в будущем.
 Они этого заслуживают.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4186.071s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: Привет, меня зовут Джилл Боуэн.
 Я директор по работе со студентами государственных школ Бедфорда.
 Я резидент и пожизненный сотрудник.
 Это мой 31-й год в Бедфорде.
 Я занимал много разных должностей, таких как учитель, руководитель группы, оценщик, координатор, а теперь и эту должность.
 У меня двое детей, которые окончили государственную школу Медфорда.
 Один человек выбирает университетский путь, другой выбирает карьерный путь.
 Поэтому я был очень рад увидеть видение этой новой средней школы и то, что она может принести Медфорду и нашим ученикам, а также развить то, что сказала Лори о обеспечении равенства и доступности для всех наших учеников.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Привет, меня зовут Сьюзен Каруччи.
 Это мой 27-й год.
 Итак, я родился и вырос на третьем месяце обучения в школе.
 Я здесь больше не живу, но живу здесь всю свою карьеру.
 Я начинал как заместитель директора, директор, помощник начальной школы, а теперь — заместитель директора в Департаменте образования и строительства в Бруксе.
 Как и в случае со статьей Марты, я очень рад работать со всеми вами в области школьного преподавания.
 Я думаю, об этом говорит каждый, кто приходит к Марии.
 Знаешь, мой отец был руководителем проекта от корпуса К до корпуса 8.
 Так что я чувствую, что немного испытал эти две вещи, но мне посчастливилось.
 Будучи учителем в новой школе МакГлинн в 2001 году, я имел удовольствие наблюдать за тем, как разворачивается этот процесс, будучи педагогом и частью новой школы.
 Поэтому я думаю, что для меня очень важна та важная роль, которую мы все играем в этих важных решениях, которые повлияют на наших преподавателей, наших учеников, наши семьи и наше сообщество.
 Пожалуйста, отнеситесь к этому вопросу серьезно.
 Для меня большая честь быть частью команды и иметь возможность работать со всеми.</p>

 រាត្រីសួស្តី Marissa Parkinson ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​កើត​នៅ​ផ្លូវ​ដដែល​ក្នុង​ទីក្រុង Lawrence។
 គ្រួសារខ្ញុំ និងម្តាយរបស់ខ្ញុំនៅតែនៅទីនេះ តាមផ្លូវ West Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំបានចាប់ផ្តើមសិក្សានៅ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំបានចាប់ផ្តើមសិក្សានៅសាលា Harvey ។
 ខ្ញុំបានដើរផ្លូវផ្សេង។
 ខ្ញុំបានបញ្ចប់នៅ S.
 រ៉េ និង ខេធី។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នកកាន់សាសនាកាតូលិក ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការនៅ Johnny's Food Master នៅ Westlake ។
 ឧទ្យាន Duggar គឺជាឧទ្យានក្នុងស្រុករបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំស្រលាញ់សាលា។
 ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់កុមារ។
 ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់ការអប់រំ។
 ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការក្នុងវិស័យអប់រំអស់រយៈពេល 30 ឆ្នាំ។
 វាគួរឱ្យខ្លាចណាស់ព្រោះខ្ញុំមានអាយុប្រហែល 29 ឆ្នាំនៅពេលនោះ។
 នេះជាចម្លើយដែលខ្ញុំចូលចិត្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​កែ​សម្រួល។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំរំភើបចំពោះអត្ថន័យរបស់វា៖ ការកសាងវិទ្យាល័យថ្មីមួយសម្រាប់ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថានៅពេលដែលអគារនេះត្រូវបានសាងសង់ វាដូចជាអ្នកដឹងទេ ប្រហែលជាដូចជា Taj Mahal។
 វាជាសាលាដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាត។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ ជាង 50 ឆ្នាំក្រោយ យើងត្រូវការអ្វីថ្មី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសិស្សរបស់យើងសមនឹងទទួលបានវា។
 យើងមានកម្មវិធីអាជីពដ៏អស្ចារ្យ។
 យើងមានកម្មវិធីសិក្សាដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងអគារចាស់ណាស់។
 យើងមានគម្រោង Curtis House ដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាតដែលមានទីតាំងនៅកន្លែងផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងផ្តល់ជូននូវការអប់រំកុមារតូច និងកម្មវិធីកុមារតូចដ៏អស្ចារ្យសម្រាប់បុគ្គលិករបស់យើងនៅទីនេះ។
 យើងមានសំណាងណាស់ដែលមានរបស់ទាំងនេះនៅ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា Medford គឺជាត្បូងតូចមួយ។
 ការមានសាលាបឋមសិក្សាថ្មីនឹងផ្តល់អត្ថប្រយោជន៍យ៉ាងច្រើនដល់សិស្ស សហគមន៍របស់យើង និងអនាគតនៃសហគមន៍របស់យើង (សហគមន៍ទាំងមូល)។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ក្លាយ​ជា​ផ្នែក​មួយ​នៃ​ដំណើរការ និង​ធ្វើ​ការ​ជាមួយ​មនុស្ស​នៅ​ទីនោះ ហើយ​ឆ្លងកាត់​បទពិសោធន៍​ផ្សេង​ៗ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 បន្ថែមសំឡេងរបស់ខ្ញុំទៅសំឡេងទាំងអស់នៅទីនេះ។
 សម្រាប់អភិបាលក្រុង និងក្រុមប្រឹក្សាលោក Graham ដែលនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៃ 25 នេះ មានបេក្ខជនដែលមានលក្ខណៈសម្បត្តិគ្រប់គ្រាន់ជាច្រើន ដូចជាវិស្វករម្នាក់ វិស្វករម្នាក់ទៀត ស្ថាបត្យករផ្សេងទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែដើម្បីទៅដល់ក្រុមមនុស្សនេះ
 មនុស្សអស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាដឹងគុណណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំចង់អរគុណលូកា ដែលបានចាប់ផ្តើមដំណើរការនេះជាមួយយើងកាលពីពីរឆ្នាំមុន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថា អ្នកដឹងទេថា រក្សាវាឱ្យដំណើរការ និងគ្រប់គ្រងវាបាន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំដំណើរការនេះ ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាសង្ឃឹមថាយើងនៅតែមានភាពវិជ្ជមាន និងសុទិដ្ឋិនិយមចំពោះអ្វីដែលនឹងកើតឡើង។
 សមាជិក Ramjani ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកនឹងមានឆន្ទៈក្នុងការចែករំលែកព័ត៌មានអំពីតម្រងជាមួយពួកគេ។
 តើអ្នកចាប់បានអ្វី ហើយគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ប៉ុណ្ណា?
 វានឹងកាន់តែរំភើបនៅពេលដែលក្រុមដែលនៅសល់ទទួលបានបទពិសោធន៍ស្រដៀងគ្នា។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4528.482s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: ប្រាកដ។
 អរគុណអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នា...
 ពាក្យមនោសញ្ចេតនា។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​មួយ​នៅ​ចន្លោះ​ពេល​នេះ​ដល់​ម៉ោង ៨ យប់។
 ខ្ញុំសន្យាថាយើងនឹងចាកចេញនៅម៉ោង 8 ព្រឹក។

 មកដល់ពេលនេះ ហើយតើយើងនៅឯណា?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយអំពីរឿងនេះបន្តិច។

 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សារឿងនេះនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ពេត្រុស វាជាការប្រសើរជាងប្រសិនបើអ្នកអាចនិយាយជាមួយខ្ញុំអំពីសុន្ទរកថានេះ។
 មិនអីទេ
 អ្នកអាចរំលងទំព័រជាក់លាក់។
 ព្យួរនៅទីនោះសម្រាប់មួយផ្សេងទៀត។
 តោះចាប់ផ្តើម។
 យើងបានចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងខែកុម្ភៈ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកនៅក្នុងខែធ្នូ MSBA បានអញ្ជើញយើងឱ្យចូលរួមក្នុងវគ្គជម្រុះ។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សាអំពីអត្ថន័យនៃវគ្គជម្រុះក្នុងរយៈពេលពីរបីនាទីទៀត។
 នេះ​ជា​ការ​អញ្ជើញ៖ យើង​សូម​អញ្ជើញ​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ចូល​រួម​ក្នុង​ដំណើរ​ការ​នេះ​ចាប់​ពី​ថ្ងៃ​ទី 1 ខែ​ឧសភា។
 ដូច្នេះសូមចាប់ផ្តើមនៅថ្ងៃស្អែក។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងនេះក្តី គណៈកម្មាធិការបានតែងតាំងខ្ញុំជាប្រធានគណៈកម្មាធិការសាងសង់កាលពីខែកុម្ភៈ ហើយរហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះ បានធ្វើច្រើនហើយ។
 រឿងមួយដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើគឺស្វែងរកពួកគេទាំងអស់គ្នាមែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះនៅក្នុងបរិបទនៃការព្យាយាមបញ្ជាក់នូវអ្វីដែលយើងជាគណៈកម្មាធិការសាលាចង់ឱ្យគណៈកម្មាធិការអគារនេះធ្វើ យើងបានបង្កើតឡើងនូវបញ្ជីគោលដៅមួយ។
 មានគោលដៅជាច្រើនទៀត ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំចង់ដាក់គ្រឹះសម្រាប់រឿងនេះ
 តើយើងគួរធ្វើអ្វីបន្ទាប់ទៀត?
 ប្រាំទៅប្រាំពីរឆ្នាំ។
 ទីមួយគឺជាផែនការដ៏ទូលំទូលាយសម្រាប់កម្មវិធីដែលមានស្រាប់ទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងបរិវេណវិទ្យាល័យ Medford រួមទាំងការអប់រំវិជ្ជាជីវៈ និងមិនមែនវិជ្ជាជីវៈថ្នាក់ទី 9-12 អត្តពលកម្មថ្នាក់ទី 9-12 បណ្តាញគ្រួសារ Medford កម្មវិធីសាលាសហគមន៍ Medford ការអប់រំកុមារតូច រួមទាំងប៉ុន្តែមិនកំណត់ចំពោះកម្មវិធី Medford Early Education Program (ដែលយើងហៅថា MEAP) និង Kids Corner
 ដូច្នេះ មាន​អ្វី​ច្រើន​កើត​ឡើង​នៅ​ក្នុង​អគារ​នេះ ជាង​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ស្រមៃ​នៅ​វិទ្យាល័យ។
 ដូច្នេះ នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​អ្នក​ទាំង​អស់​គ្នា​ត្រូវ​ចាប់​ផ្តើម​គិត​។

 តើខ្ញុំអាចរកវាឃើញទេ?
 សូមអរគុណ

 បាទ/ចាស ខ្ញុំអាចចែករំលែកស្លាយទាំងអស់ជាមួយអ្នកនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ទីពីរគឺត្រូវពិចារណាថាតើទីតាំងវិទ្យាល័យ Curtis-Tafts នៅលើបរិវេណសាលា Medford នឹងផ្តល់ឱកាសសិក្សាកាន់តែច្រើនសម្រាប់សិស្ស Curtis-Tafts ដែរឬទេ។
 ទីបី ធានានូវការបញ្ចូលជាសាធារណៈដ៏រឹងមាំ និងមតិរបស់អ្នកពាក់ព័ន្ធនៅក្នុងព្រឹត្តិការណ៍សំខាន់ៗពេញមួយគម្រោង និងការអនុលោមតាមគោលការណ៍ណែនាំរបស់ MSBA និងគោលការណ៍ណែនាំរបស់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលសាលា Medford ។

 នេះមានន័យថាយើងយកចិត្តទុកដាក់យ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះមុខងារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​ចង់​ដឹង​ថា​តើ​កន្លែង​ទាំងនេះ​ស័ក្តិសម​សម្រាប់​សិស្ស​និង​គ្រូ​នៅ​ក្នុង​អគារ​ដែរ​ឬ​ទេ?
 នេះពិតជាសំខាន់ណាស់។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ទីប្រាំ រៀបចំផែនការសាងសង់ ជំរុញវិធីសាស្រ្ត គោលដៅអាកាសធាតុ និងសម្រេចបាននូវគោលដៅទាំងអស់ និងដឹកនាំការបញ្ជាក់នៃកំណែទីប្រាំ ដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវគោលដៅនៃកិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងអាកាសធាតុទីក្រុងប៉ារីសនៅឆ្នាំ 2030 និងឆ្នាំ 2050 និងបញ្ចប់ដំណើរការសាងសង់ប្រកបដោយប្រសិទ្ធភាព និងប្រសិទ្ធភាព ធានាឱ្យសិស្សានុសិស្សអាចរៀននៅក្នុងអគារថ្មីឱ្យបានឆាប់តាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 នៅពេលនោះ។
 នេះគឺជាកិច្ចការដ៏លំបាកមួយ។
 ល្បឿន​លឿន​បំផុត​តែង​តែ​វាស់​ជា​ឆ្នាំ​មិន​មែន​ខែ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងបរិបទនៃការបង្កើតគណៈកម្មាធិការនេះ ដរាបណាខ្ញុំត្រូវបានតែងតាំងជាប្រធាន យើងបានបើកការអំពាវនាវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធី យើងចាប់ផ្តើមប្រមូលពាក្យសុំ ហើយពួកគេទាំងអស់នៅទីនោះ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ វានៅតែមានការងារជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវធ្វើក្នុងដំណាក់កាលជម្រុះដែលយើងកំពុងចាប់ផ្តើម។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សារឿងនេះនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកអាចបន្តទៅស្លាយបន្ទាប់។
 ក្រាហ្វិកគឺអន់ណាស់ ហើយមិនត្រូវបានរុករកបានល្អនៅលើគេហទំព័រទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលដែលវាមកដល់ដំណើរការទាំងមូល យើងនៅតែមានពេលប្រាំមួយម៉ោងទៀតនៃការ unboxing ។
 នៅថ្ងៃទី 1 ខែឧសភា យើងនឹងបញ្ចូលរយៈពេលនៃការទទួលបានសិទ្ធិនេះនៅក្នុងប្រអប់។
 នៅដំណាក់កាលនីមួយៗនៃដំណើរការ។
 យើងត្រូវតែត្រូវបានអនុម័តដោយ MSBA ដើម្បីបំពេញតាមតម្រូវការទាំងអស់សម្រាប់រយៈពេលនេះ។
 ត្រូវតែមានក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលដែលអាចបោះឆ្នោតដើម្បីអញ្ជើញយើងឱ្យបោះជំហានបន្ទាប់។
 ដូច្នេះ នៅចំណុចណាមួយក្នុងដំណើរការនេះ MSBA អាចនិយាយបានថាពួកគេមិនទាន់ត្រៀមខ្លួនរួចជាស្រេចដើម្បីឆ្ពោះទៅមុខនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេក៏អាចនិយាយថា៖ យើងមិនចូលចិត្តអ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេក៏អាចនិយាយថា បំភ្លេចវាចោល។
 ដូច្នេះ​ការងារ​របស់​យើង​គឺ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​កើត​ឡើង។
 ការងាររបស់យើងគឺដើម្បីកម្រិតទីលានលេង រីកចម្រើនរួម និងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខឱ្យបានលឿនតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ផ្តល់ឱកាសដល់ MSBA ព្រោះយើងនឹងត្រៀមខ្លួនរួចជាស្រេចដើម្បីទទួលយកពួកគេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4847.483s">[Unidentified]</a>: Посмотрим.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4849.904s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但这个资格期限持续 270 天。
 因此，到一月份我们必须完成资格阶段。
 我将谈谈这个阶段发生的事情。
 简而言之，除了资格阶段之外，当我们谈论建立项目团队时，这意味着引入我们所有者的项目经理。
 然后我们继续进行可行性研究。
 当人们想到我们在这个委员会所做的事情时，他们认为我们现在正在进行可行性研究。
 你认为我们正在做决定，我们正在建设吗？
 我们要更新吗？
 我们在哪里建设？
 你在场上吗？
 你在停车场吗？
 这将如何运作？
 我们还没有达到那个程度。
 所以告诉你所有的朋友，我们将到达那里并与专业人士合作。
 帮助我们对这座大楼需要做的事情进行评估。
 然后我们将继续进行方案设计，为项目融资。
 这就是我们作为社区投票资助该项目的地方。
 我无法强调它的重要性，但在实现这一目标之前我们还有很多工作要做。
 当这种情况发生时，我们将进入详细设计。
 所以我们把铲子放在地上。
 然后，在未来的某个时候，我们将完成该项目。
 所以这有点像坚果汤。
 我的目标是让我们一步步前进。
 我们将采取一切必要措施来满足资格期限。
 然后我们将继续前进。
 当我们接近下一阶段时，我们将开始讨论如何加快工作速度。
 但目前，我们的重点是资格。
 如果您可以翻到下一页，
 资格流程有自己的图表，您无法查看。
 因此，请继续观看下一张幻灯片。
 出色地。
 所以这个阶段需要做五件事。
 一是初步合规认证。
 这是一项法律协议，要求该市遵守 MSBA 流程。
 该协议已签署并交付给 MSBA。
 我们提前一天，我会承认这一点。
 谢谢市长和警长。
 我们正在路上。
 第二，我们必须组建建筑委员会。
 你们都在这里。
 学校委员会原定于 5 月 1 日开会，但现在是 4 月 30 日。
 我们做到了。
 该表格将很快发送至 MSBA。
 所以我们正在努力，并将很快发货。
 显然这是最简单的部分。
 这是文书工作。
 整个资格阶段涉及大量文书工作，但这是最简单的，我们会做并完成它。
 MSBA 必须批准我们的委员会。
 我们满足所有要求，因此 MSBA 对我们委员会的成员提出了各种各样的要求。
 我们与大家一起满足所有这些要求。
 现在让我们深入实际工作。
 还有三件事需要发生。
 其中之一就是所谓的教育背景。
 这是一份示范文件，它要求我们说：今天这座建筑里发生了什么？
 有多少间教室？
 有多少间数学教室？
 有多少临时空间？
 你们的剧院有多大？
 所有这些，对吗？
 这就是为什么他要求你描述这座大楼里目前正在发生的事情。
 它还要求您描述您对这座建筑未来的设想。
 因此，这就是关于柯蒂斯·塔夫茨的这些对话，这些关于幼儿期的对话变得非常非常重要。
 因为在我们的利益申报和资格阶段之间，教育背景将为所有建筑专业人员如何实际完成工作定下基调。
 因此，这将确定实现此构建所需的工作范围。
 所以在这个过程中现在已经做了很多工作。
 自二月份以来，我一直在与管理团队会面。
 我们每周见几次面。
 他们已经厌倦了我。
 他会厌倦我的。
 但我们开始做的一件事是：我们可以消除什么？
 这就是为什么该文件在以下方面写得很好：
 我们在这座大楼里做什么？
 所有教室都被统计在内。
 所有计划均已概述。
 就今天发生的事情而言，政府还有更多工作要做，才能准确描述这一点。
 另一件显然要复杂得多的事情是谈论我们将来要在这座大楼里做什么。
 因此，在这次谈话中，我们再次进行了非常广泛的谈话。
 我们一直在利用大脑的战略规划部分来提出重大问题。
 我将借用柯蒂斯·塔夫茨一分钟。
 我们已经讨论过我们的教育工作者是否认为这是我们应该考虑的事情，答案是肯定的，他们说是的，我们应该考虑一下。
 然后我们开始说：“好吧，那会是什么样子？”
 要求是。
 所以我们开始了这次对话，但这次对话超出了该委员会可以分析的范围，因为它有点涉及学校委员会的职责。
 因此，昨晚我提出了一项决议，要求我们的特殊教育和行为健康小组委员会（实际上由卢梭成员担任主席）在非常紧张的时间内举行会议，以收集意见和评论。
 关于这个非常有限的话题。
 柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学位于该校区对就读于柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学的学生的教育成果是否有任何好处？
 昨晚还有另一位梅德福居民发表了讲话。
 他在萨默维尔开展了一个非常类似的项目。
 他谈到了萨默维尔刚刚发生的这一转变以及它如何导致人口爆炸。
 对于那些需要另类环境的学生来说，它改变了游戏规则，让他们可以参加运动队等活动，在我们的例子中，是职业项目。
 所以这是一个巨大的机会，但是
 我们希望确保社区和委员会有机会思考他们可以贡献的一切并向该委员会提供建议。
 昨晚，这一情况已正式传达给特殊教育小组委员会。
 他们会见面的。
 他们将邀请现任员工、现任学生、校友、
 社区成员等，以及来自萨默维尔的 Jack Hevery 进行讨论并解决这个问题，并提出建议，让他们步入正轨并在 6 月中旬回来，这样他们还有很多工作要做，但这将帮助我们了解情况。
 我们对这所学校的想象的那一部分的写作。
 因为我们可能需要的不仅仅是大楼某处的几间教室。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨大学的成功部分在于其环境与拥有 1,200 名学生的庞大校园有很大不同。
 因此，我们必须仔细考虑如何将其组合在一起，但我们希望小组委员会所做的工作能够回到我们身边并得到传达。
 玛塔和查德将参加未来几周即将举行的学校委员会会议，玛塔将谈论她对替代方案的一些想法，以及这一切可能会是什么样子，即使是在短期内。
 这是必须纳入的内容。
 琼、苏珊娜、保罗和我昨天谈论了幼儿教育。
 我们的小学已经人满为患。
 我们将不得不在某个时候处理这​​个问题。
 MEEP 曾经在这里举办。
 我们将探讨一个案例，该案例表明 MEAP 应该回到这里，这可能是也可能不是我们着陆的地方，但这是我们正在探索的事情，因为现在是时候了。
 我们还谈论了很多关于没有接受过学前教育的学生以及他们何时进入我们公立学校的问题。
 对于这些学生来说，入学是多么具有挑战性。
 我们还讨论诸如等待名单有多大之类的问题？
 有多少来到我们这里的学生从未接触过任何类型的学前环境？
 我们需要什么样的能力来从这座大楼提供更广泛、更全面的幼儿教育项目？
 因为所有这些都必须包含在本文档中。
 所以，我们正在努力解决这个问题。
 因此，在这些事情发生的同时，到目前为止，在这个教育概况上已经做了很多工作。
 我们尚未涉及的教育概况的重要部分是沟通策略。
 我稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但在教育方面，我们的教育工作者必须做很多工作才能准备这份文件。
 我只是想让每个人都知道一切都在进行中。
 当我们进入下一次会议时，我们将展示这些文件，以便我们可以开始更广泛地阅读这些文件，寻求建议，并确保我们真正从各个角度考虑我们需要描述的内容。
 这就是我认为你们都发挥着非常重要作用的地方：
 我认为有必要根据我所知道的或基于我们对艺术项目或职业项目等的愿景，稍微不同地描述我们在这里所做的事情。
 这就是我们在教育概况中所处的位置。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨 (Curtis Tufts) 担任小组委员会成员。
 另一个重大的、创新的、不断变化的主题是 MEAP。
 MSBA 描述的社区中经常发生延误的原因是，他们必须做出有助于施工过程的非常重要的决定。
 我们可以合并两所学校吗？
 这显然有它自己的能量和它自己的一套要求，这使得它很难实现
 快点行动吧。
 因此，我们试图从大处着眼，因为这是一个独特的机会，可以以非常全面的方式思考该学区的真正需求，同时也可以尽快向前推进。
 因此，所有这些工作都正在进行中，并尽快向前推进。
 彼得，你可以转到下一张幻灯片吗？
 在专业方面也非常类似，因为我们有一个非常活跃的专业学校，所以我们还有另一个文件需要完成，那就是生存能力的第74章。
 第七十四章是专业设置条例的一章吧？
 出色地。
 这篇文章正在进行中。
 我们必须告诉他们，这是我们的计划。
 这是这些程序的功能。
 这是我们当前的注册和信息，例如我们的等候名单。
 我们还有机会描述这些计划的扩展计划。
 查德和彼得将在学校委员会中讨论扩张的潜力。
 这是学校委员会的问题，因为扩大的项目需要的不仅仅是一座建筑。
 需要设备。
 需要工作人员。
 因此，学校委员会必须对此进行评估。
 因此，该报告将于 5 月 20 日提交给学校委员会，并将有助于第 70 章表格的最终确定。
 这个小组也会仔细阅读并做好准备。
 本周晚些时候，市长、总监和我将与 MSBA 讨论这一难题，这实际上是城市规划信息。
 然后我们可以开始将信息输入到他们所谓的登记研究中。
 这有助于确定建筑物的大小。
 您可能已经听说过很多关于这座大楼是如何为 4,000 名学生建造的，但现在只有 1,200 名学生。
 4000到底是不是这个数字我不知道，但确实数字不一样。
 因此，MSBA 在资格阶段要做的事情之一就是，让我们为这么多学生建造一座大楼。
 这通常与今天大楼里发生的事情类似。
 然而，如果该市计划在开发中的住房方面进行重大扩张，他们会想知道所有这些。
 所以他们可以调整建筑物的大小，因为他们不希望我们建造一座立即耗尽容量的建筑物。
 他们也不希望我们建造一座永远不会住满的建筑。
 好的。
 所以，这是那里正在进行的工作的一部分。
 第四件事，维修文件。
 我们必须填写一份调查问卷，概述我们在整个地区的所有维护实践。
 所以这就像：他被重新投入使用了吗？
 你们的团队是如何训练的？
 大约有20个变量。
 该文件也处于起草阶段，正在尽快推进。
 我们可能会稍后在六月份讨论这个问题。
 考虑到我们已完成资格，我们需要做的最后一件事是确定可行性研究的资金，该资金可能在二十五万到二百五十万美元之间。
 我们还没有准备好，但我们正在制定计划。
 市长和我正在从财务工作组的角度制定该计划，以便能够根据需要尽快核算和管理这笔资金。
 对流程有疑问吗？</p>

 ទីក្រុងនឹងបង់ថ្លៃសិក្សាលទ្ធភាពទាំងអស់ជាមុន។
 បន្ទាប់មក នៅពេលដែល MSBA បញ្ជាក់អត្រាសងត្រលប់គម្រោងរបស់យើង ហើយយើងទទួលបានជោគជ័យពេញមួយដំណើរការ របាយការណ៍សិក្សាលទ្ធភាពនឹងត្រូវបានសងវិញតាមភាគរយដែលបានបែងចែកឱ្យយើង។

 ប៉ុន្តែទីក្រុងត្រូវតែដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាប្រាក់។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីដែលត្រូវកើតឡើងនៅទីនេះគឺ
 យើង​មាន​គម្រោង​ផ្តល់​ថវិកា​ដល់​វា។
 ត្រូវហើយ យើងគួរមានចិត្តល្អ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​កិច្ចការ​នេះ​បាន​ល្អ ហើយ​វា​ត្រូវ​ការ​បោះឆ្នោត​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សា​ក្រុង​ដើម្បី​អនុញ្ញាត​មូលនិធិ​ទាំង​នោះ ហើយ​ដាក់​វា​នៅ​កន្លែង​ដែល​យើង​អាច​ប្រើ​វា។

 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងតែងតែឈរជាមួយគ្នា ប្រឹងប្រែង និងខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជា​ការ​សំខាន់​ក្នុង​ការ​ពង្រីក​ខ្លួន​អ្នក​។
 ដូច្នេះ​ត្រូវ​តានតឹង​ហើយ​រៀបចំ​ខ្លួន។
 MSBA មានការងារជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវធ្វើទាក់ទងនឹងការទទួលស្គាល់កម្មវិធីត្រៀមចូលមហាវិទ្យាល័យ និងអ្វីៗផ្សេងទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងអាចផ្តល់ឱ្យពួកគេនូវអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលពួកគេត្រូវការ ដូច្នេះយើងអាចបន្តទៅដំណាក់កាលបន្ទាប់ឱ្យបានឆាប់តាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 តើអ្នកមានសំណួរអំពីផែនការទេ?
 ល្អឥតខ្ចោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងនៅសល់តែ 20 នាទីប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ដល់ទីបញ្ចប់នោះ យើងបានរួមបញ្ចូលការប្រជុំអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការនាពេលខាងមុខជាបន្តបន្ទាប់នៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃរបៀបវារៈ។
 មានរឿងពីរដែលខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងពិចារណា និងផ្តល់អាទិភាពនៅពេលយើងឈានទៅមុខជាមួយដំណាក់កាលទីមួយនេះ។
 មួយក្នុងចំណោមពួកគេគឺ គណៈកម្មាធិការទំនាក់ទំនង និងការចូលរួមសហគមន៍។
 ខ្ញុំចង់បានអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការមួយចំនួន មិនលើសពីប្រាំពីររូបទេ ប៉ុន្តែជាក្រុមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍ដែលជួបប្រជុំគ្នាជាអនុគណៈកម្មការដែលពិតជាអាចគូសបញ្ជាក់ និងពណ៌នាអំពីដំណើរការចូលរួមសហគមន៍របស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា យើង​ទាំង​អស់​គ្នា​ឃើញ​ពី​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​របស់​មនុស្ស​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍៖ តើ Medford នឹង​ដោះស្រាយ​បញ្ហា​នេះ​ទេ?
 តើនេះនឹងដំណើរការទេ?
 តើរឿងនេះនឹងកើតឡើងទេ?
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកត្រូវបង្កើតទំនាក់ទំនងជាច្រើននៅក្នុងសហគមន៍។

 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាអ្នកអាចជួបម្តងទៀត ហើយនាំយកសេចក្តីព្រាងទៅក្រុមនេះ ដើម្បីយើងអាចអនុវត្តបទប្បញ្ញត្តិ និងគ្រប់គ្រងពីទីនោះ។
 ហើយ​គណៈកម្មការ​ទី​៣​នឹង​មិន​ជួប​គ្នា​ឆាប់ៗ​នេះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​នឹង​ជួប​។
 អ្នកដឹងទេថានឹងមានអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការហិរញ្ញវត្ថុនៅចុងខែមិថុនា ដូច្នេះនេះនឹងក្លាយជាគណៈកម្មាធិការអចិន្ត្រៃយ៍ដែលនឹងប្រជុំពេញមួយជីវិតនៃគម្រោង និងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ។
 វាជាការសំខាន់ដែលត្រូវចងចាំថា នៅពេលដែលពេលវេលាមកដល់ សហគមន៍នឹងត្រូវបោះឆ្នោត។
 គណៈកម្មាធិការនេះមិនមែនជាកន្លែងសម្រាប់ធ្វើការងារនេះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការលើកលែងបំណុលដែលចាំបាច់បំផុតដើម្បីផ្តល់មូលនិធិដល់គម្រោងនោះ គណៈកម្មាធិការនេះមិនគួរយល់ព្រមលើការលើកលែងបំណុលនោះទេ។
 តាមពិតទៅ វាមិនអាចកើតឡើងនៅទីនេះទេ។
 វាត្រូវតែកើតឡើងនៅខាងក្រៅក្រុមនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះ គណៈកម្មាធិការហិរញ្ញវត្ថុនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាទស្សនវិស័យ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីរឿងដូចជា
 លទ្ធកម្ម, លទ្ធកម្មពីអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងគម្រោងរបស់ម្ចាស់, ស្ថាបត្យកររបស់យើង, អ្វីៗដូចនោះ។
 ហើយជួយយើងឱ្យយល់ពីអ្វីដែលយើងត្រូវការដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវលទ្ធភាពជោគជ័យ?
 តើមានការចំណាយផ្សេងទៀតដែលយើងគួរពិចារណាដែរឬទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​មាន​ការងារ​ហិរញ្ញវត្ថុ​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ធ្វើ ទោះ​បី​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​រំពឹង​ថា​កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​ក្រុម​នឹង​ធ្វើ​ឡើង​រហូត​ដល់​ចុង​ខែ​ឧសភា​ក៏​ដោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​នឹង​និយាយ​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​អំពី​ច្បាប់​បញ្ជា​របស់ Robert និង​អ្វី​ៗ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​បន្ទាប់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថា គ្រប់គ្នាសម្លឹងមកខ្ញុំ ដូចឈប់និយាយអញ្ចឹង។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចាប់អារម្មណ៍នោះគឺថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ឮអំពីប្រធានបទទាំងនេះ ហើយនិយាយថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចង់ចូលរួមដែរឬទេ
 តើ​អ្នក​អាច​រក​ឃើញ​អនុគណៈកម្មការ​មួយ​ក្នុង​ចំណោម​អនុគណៈកម្មការ​ទាំង​នេះ​ទេ?

 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើនរណាម្នាក់ចាប់អារម្មណ៍លើប្រធានបទណាមួយផ្សេងទៀត គណៈកម្មាធិការមិនអាចមានទំហំធំដូចការចាំបាច់នោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែអាចមានទំហំធំដូចដែលយើងគិតថាអាចធ្វើការងារបាន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំដាក់អនុគណៈកម្មការទាំងនេះនៅលើប្រតិទិនរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 ល្ងាចនេះយើងនឹងជួបគ្នាទាំងស្រុងតាមរយៈ Zoom ដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យអ្វីៗកាន់តែងាយស្រួលបន្តិច។

 Все хорошо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6186.4s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Я внесу тебя в список.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6188.182s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Считайте, что я финансист.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6192.886s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Закон и инклюзивность состоят из двух человек.
 Это правда
 Я планирую войти во все комитеты, но это правильный поступок.
 Возможно, мы сможем пригласить Эмили Лаззаро в состав Подкомитета по правовым вопросам и примирению.
 Потом я с ним посоветуюсь.
 Я также пригласил Николь Морель присоединиться к подкомитету по коммуникациям.
 Так что поговорите с ними.
 Но есть ли у кого-нибудь еще сильные чувства по этому поводу?
 Куда вы хотите пойти?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6227.321s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Я могу общаться.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6230.024s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Большой-большой.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6232.21s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Да, я бы сказал финансовый, но у меня действительно нет большого опыта в этой сфере.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6235.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Я думаю, у нас все в порядке.
 Джон?
 Нет, у тебя еще есть работа.
 О, конечно.
 Я думаю, что все тренеры действительно в команде.
 Прежде чем мы углубимся в это, будет группа экспертов, которая будет выдавать предложения владельцам проектов.
 Это не мой опыт.
 Я здесь не поэтому.
 Поэтому со временем мы будем полагаться на людей, которые будут создавать подкомитеты.
 С личной точки зрения, я думаю, нам следует начать отсюда.
 Имеет ли это смысл?
 Есть ли у кого-нибудь еще предложения о том, что нужно сделать в ближайшее время?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: У меня есть вопрос.
 Конечно.
 Вы сказали, что Кертис мог бы прийти сюда и использовать это место по-разному.
 Кто ищет эти варианты?
 Как и в случае с общественным образованием, в местных колледжах можно работать, посещая вечерние занятия, как я надеюсь сделать в компании Associated General Contractors AGC, которая обеспечивает образование для взрослых.
 Кому-нибудь это нравится?
 Придумайте много вариантов, которые вы хотите рассмотреть или какие у вас есть идеи?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Да, более-менее, более-менее, но не полностью.
 Мы еще не там.
 Поэтому я думаю, что имеет смысл добавить его после того, как мы увидим первую двусмысленность в главе 74.
 Итак, когда мы начинаем читать эти документы, я думаю, пришло время сказать: кого еще нам следует остерегаться?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Потому что все это имеет последствия.
 Вы знаете удобство, расстояние, размер техники по сравнению с другой техникой, место для хранения, парковку.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6343.879s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Идеальный.
 Да, я думаю, это хорошая идея.
 Я внесу это в список.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6350.581s">[Unidentified]</a>: На самом деле нас определяет город.
 Они
 Если бы все в комнате сказали: «Развлекательный центр Бедфорда должен быть там».</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6365.68s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Но общественные школы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6367.861s">[Unidentified]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6375.31s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Идеальный.
 Поэтому я хочу спросить, кто обеспечит такую ​​цифровую инфраструктуру для этого комитета?
 Итак, я расскажу о СОИ.
 Есть СОИ.
 В Fed.SOI проводится исследование.
 Могут быть и другие публичные документы, которые на самом деле не являются публичными, но должны быть таковыми.
 Вы знаете, этот подкомитет по связям с общественностью будет отвечать за:
 То же самое можно сообщить многим людям, эффективнее всего это сделать через сайт (возможно, через общий репозиторий) и внешнее общение вполне возможно.
 Например, на портале, таком как веб-сайт, например, в школе, у каждого есть эти проекты, а затем тип внутренней базы данных, которую Шелдон может просмотреть на SOI.
 Участники списка входа могут использовать его в любое время.
 Конечно.
 Все, что нужно, это ресурсы.
 Я могу дать вам обновленную информацию.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: У нас это есть.
 Итак, мы получили специальный URL-адрес от сборки — buildmhs.org.
 Так?
 Идеальный.
 Итак, URL-адрес существует.
 Эта страница доступна.
 Фактически Томас изучает базовую структуру ресурсов этого сообщества.
 Причина, по которой мы просим людей предоставить биографии и фотографии, заключается в том, что все они будут опубликованы на веб-сайте, поэтому он управляет всеми этими вещами как директор по связям с общественностью.
 Том согласился, что, хотя он и был уходящим директором по коммуникациям, он продолжит заниматься проектом, пока мы не наймем преемника.
 Поэтому я думаю, что Томас и некоторые из наших студентов профессионального образования создают этот сайт под руководством Лизы Миллер.
 И каков состав документов, которые будут представлены публике, когда кто-то спросит, где?
 Мы можем порекомендовать вам место.
 Там будут протоколы всех наших встреч.
 Повестка дня всех наших встреч будет там.
 Итак, у нас есть целая структура, чтобы попытаться это сделать.
 Мы еще не готовы, но надеюсь, что сможем встретиться с вами на следующей встрече.
 Веб-сайт.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Хорошо, следующий шаг — вынести дверь наружу.
 Как твоя спина?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Так что это сложный вопрос, потому что по закону о собраниях для нас это еще не конец.
 После распечатки расписания все документы этого расписания становятся частью публичного архива.
 Если мы это сделаем, трудность в том, что если мы сделаем это за кулисами, мы можем нарушить правила собрания.
 Таким образом, у администраторов есть копия документа, над которым они работают, и они не представляют кворум и могут продолжать это делать.
 Когда файлы поступают сюда, они помещаются на общедоступный диск.
 Говоря о редактировании файлов, на этой платформе нет автономного редактирования.
 Закон запрещает массовые собрания.
 К сожалению, мы сидим здесь и вместе редактируем файлы.
 Это определенно самая болезненная часть управления этим процессом, как вы все уже заметили, извините.
 Но да, это сложно, но офлайн-редактирование, которое хорошо работает в других частях мира, здесь не вариант.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: Хорошо, никакого Google Диска и обмена файлами.
 Все будет выпущено.
 Они появятся на сайте по мере печати.
 Как только они появляются на сайте, они становятся основным элементом управления конфигурацией и не могут быть изменены без отмены этих изменений здесь.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Точно.
 Да, это страшно.
 Это верно.
 Это действительно страшно.
 Мы нашли способ сделать это.
 Не страшно, но знаешь, к сожалению, уже не страшно.
 Из-за этого сообщество не сможет понять, как редактировать файл.
 И когда мы это сделаем, я считаю, что эти встречи в Zoom будут более продуктивными.
 Вы можете сидеть где хотите, и каждый может видеть, как изменяется файл, и никакая форма невозможна.
 Идея редактирования документа без раскрытия происходящего.
 Поэтому мы должны быть осторожны с этим.
 Но да, это процесс.
 Этот незнакомец работает в GraphDoc.
 Я вижу, что это работает для печати документов.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: Нисколько. Это не GraphDoc.
 Мы понимаем, что многие из вас работают.
 Мы спорим.
 Мы простая группа молодых людей, которые делятся.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Это повод задуматься.
 Да, да.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: Прошлой осенью я разговаривал со всеми в офисе.
 Это была эпоха.
 Итак, мы долго звонили.
 Всего 40 членов.
 Один из участников сказал: «Саймон только что упомянул об этом в документе и прочитал там наши комментарии.
 По сути, мы объединили их.
 Ответ — нет.
 Затем вы можете написать свою оценку.
 Я ответил, что тебе семь лет.
 Они сказали, что можно это принять.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: Мы просто чувствуем.
 Кажется, мы все можем согласиться с тем, что это может быть опасно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Это верно.
 Еще раз спасибо, что вы здесь.
 Я также заинтересован в общении, и хотя сегодня вечером я не работаю, мне все равно нравятся телефонные звонки.
 Они вернутся сюда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Все эти обновления вернутся сюда.
 Можете ли вы ответить на другие вопросы о подкомитете или повестке дня?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: У меня есть вопросы по поводу выборов.
 Что ж, когда мы голосуем «за», мы оказываемся не в ситуации, которую я никогда не понимал: сила есть сила.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Нисколько.
 Нет, это неправда.
 Разрешено ли властям присутствовать на собрании?
 Нет, вы не можете отдать свой голос кому-то другому.
 Когда закончим, пойдем на выборы, потому что нам нужно завершить выборы.
 Обычно это происходит при так называемом голосовом голосовании, когда все говорят «да», а затем мы заканчиваем.
 Выполните для этого перекат.
 Странно и странно, поэтому закончим вот так.
 Но какие еще вопросы у нас есть, прежде чем мы закончим?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: Я осторожен.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Но я думаю, что еще стоит сказать, что в этом комитете много членов без права голоса.
 Это не потому, что мы не хотим слышать ваше мнение.
 Вы здесь, потому что мы хотим услышать ваше мнение.
 Когда мы будем голосовать, ваше имя не будет называться, и вы не будете голосовать.
 Но помимо этого, вы являетесь официальным членом этого комитета.
 Они предупредили меня
 Когда голосует много членов, ведение бизнеса становится очень трудным, поскольку для организации собраний и ведения бизнеса необходим кворум.
 Все очень сложно.
 Итак, мы говорим о том, что нам нужен большой комитет, но нам также необходимо иметь возможность эффективно и результативно двигаться вперед.
 В этом причина.
 Что мы там делали?
 Я думаю, размер комиссии действительно изменился в его жизни.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: Итак, 25?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Да, в комитете 15 членов с правом голоса, и это по-прежнему достаточное количество членов с правом голоса.
 Скоро мы проведем выборы.
 Но какие еще вопросы есть к следующей встрече?
 Правила и выводы, 7 мая.
 Сообщество присоединится 8 мая и вернет результаты команде 13 мая.
 Итак, на нашей встрече 13 мая большинство рассмотрит эти рекомендации и согласится с этими планами.
 Мы находимся в режиме перезагрузки.
 Затем мы изучим некоторые документы, которые изучило правительство, и начнем читать и обсуждать их содержание.
 Вот так, но, пожалуйста, продолжайте.
 Мы определяем повестку дня.
 По разумным причинам мы встретимся непосредственно в программе, если это возможно, цена 89 юаней.
 С этого момента и до конца июня.
 Я обещаю, что мы вернемся в понедельник в начале следующего учебного года, но до конца июня, между собраниями школьного совета и каникулами, невозможно соблюдать этот график.
 Мы будем встречаться через Zoom только летом и фактически перенесем нашу встречу на среду.
 Поскольку летом понедельник и пятница, сложно собрать кворум, чтобы что-то сделать.
 Надеюсь, мы сможем это сделать, но я стараюсь, чтобы график встреч был легким.
 Я думаю, что в конце августа подкомитетов будет больше, но это только начало попыток людей организовать свою занятую жизнь.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: Это верно.
 Итак, есть две вещи.
 Однако это косвенный вопрос.
 Если ты не можешь этого сделать,
 Хорошо, пожалуйста, поделитесь своими мыслями, отправив нам свои мысли и идеи.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: На самом деле это техническая проблема.
 Мужчина, который не может присутствовать на собраниях, напишет вам по электронной почте свои мысли и идеи, а может быть, даже решение.
 Мы уже слышали, что электронная почта — плохая идея практически во всем, кроме определения повестки дня.
 Это может звучать как серая зона.
 Интересно, пропустили ли вы публичное собрание, на котором столкнулись эти две вещи?
 Как это работает?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Итак, я могу вам сказать: я думаю, любой юрист скажет вам никогда ничего не писать.
 С этого мы и начнем.
 Не пишите ничего письменно.
 Тем не менее, если вы собираетесь что-то написать
 Как и в данном случае, это серая зона.
 Все, что вам нужно сделать, это связаться с кем-нибудь и сказать: «Эй, могу я послать тебе свои мысли?»
 Говорили ли вы это другим или планируете это сделать?
 Вы можете быть уверены, что у вас замкнутый контур, верно?
 Это то, что вы мне сказали, могу ли я отправить вам комментарий?
 Я сказал да.
 Я сказал, что не буду ни с кем говорить об этих проблемах, так что у нас все будет в порядке.
 Это становится проблемой, если вы связываетесь с несколькими людьми, представляющими комитет большинства.
 Например, если вы скажете: я имею в виду двух человек, потому что я не уверен, кто будет присутствовать на собрании, это нормально, потому что вам меньше восьми лет.
 Поговорив с самим собой, включая восемь человек, у вас возникла проблема.
 Тогда вы нарушаете закон, открывая собрание.
 Трудность в том, что все заинтересованные стороны должны иметь такое же понимание, как и те, кто участвует в разговоре.
 Что мне не хватает?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: Мне не хватает этого в статье про коробку.
 Вы можете быть очень целеустремленным.
 Я просто сказал тебе продолжать, хаха.
 Если вы сделаете это, мы все нарушим закон, независимо от того, что мы делаем, чтобы избежать нарушения закона.
 Думаю, это касается всех законопослушных граждан.
 Серийные соображения не заботятся ни о чем, ни о содержании, ни о плане, ни о страховке.
 Нас только двое?
 Вы злоупотребляете этим.
 Я нарушил многие правила.
 Хотя я не знаю.
 Хорошо, хорошо.
 Да, это моя проблема.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Каждому предоставляется адрес электронной почты государственной школы Медфорда, и я рекомендую вам ни при каких обстоятельствах не использовать свой личный адрес электронной почты для предприятий, связанных с MSBA.
 Как только эти электронные письма будут настроены, мы все перенесем.
 Но я советую вам ни по каким причинам не использовать личную электронную почту.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: Это облегчает соблюдение публичных записей.
 Я секретарь районного совета.
 За исключением вашего личного балла, все официальные документы школы являются общедоступными и должны быть доступны автоматически или, по крайней мере, с возможностью просмотра по запросу.
 Итак, вы делаете все это с помощью адреса электронной почты государственных школ Медфорда, пакета Google государственных школ Медфорда, где вы можете делать заметки, и все это действительно полезно для размещения вещей в этом пространстве.
 Не делитесь этим с другими.
 Не отправляйте черновик по электронной почте.
 Это не место для личных заметок.
 ок
 Мы никого в этом смысле не включаем.
 Абсолютно верно.
 Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7198.191s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Есть последний вопрос?
 Сейчас 8 марта.
 Пожалуйста, отложите эту встречу согласно положениям Роберта.
 Есть какие-либо задержки?
 Члены Орападе выступили с предложением о закрытии, за которое члены Руссо проголосовали во второй раз.
 Спасибо
 О, ты не можешь.
 Проголосовал доктор Эдвард-Винсент.
 Хорошо, я говорю по телефону.
