    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=0.391s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: مرحبا بالجميع.
 نحن هنا.
 هذا ما فعلناه.
 لقد كان مثيرا للاهتمام حقا.
 شكرا لكل من جاء.
 وفقا للخطة، سنغادر هذا المساء في الساعة 8 صباحا.
 نغادر قبل الساعة الثامنة.
 سأغير البرنامج قليلاً لأن Janelle من KP Law تستضيف دورة تدريبية قانونية مفتوحة هنا.
 لذا تخطي التعليمات في الوقت الحالي.
 بهذه الطريقة، يمكن لـ Janelle أن تعقد اجتماعًا مفتوحًا أثناء التدريب لأن لديها احتياطيًا للنصف الثاني من الاجتماع.
 لذلك أريد التأكد من أن لديه الوقت الكافي للقيام بذلك.
 لكن قبل ذلك، سأتصل فورًا بالتصوير، من الذي نعرفه هنا؟
 جيني جراهام هنا.

 كما عقد اجتماعا.
 لذلك لدينا مندوبين.
 في بضع دقائق فقط سوف تفهم سبب أهمية ذلك.
 لكن الآن سأعطيها لجانيل.
 ولكن أعتقد أن أول شيء أريد قوله هو أن جميع اجتماعاتنا تخضع لقانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة.
 مع 4 سنوات من الخبرة في الصناعة، يعد هذا الاجتماع العام هو الطريقة الأكثر تقدمًا للعمل.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أقول أن هذه هي تجربتي الشخصية.
 إنه موجود لسبب ما.
 وهذا أمر ضروري، ولكنه يتطلب منا جميعا أن نفكر مليا ليس فقط فيما نقوله ونفعله في الاجتماع، ولكن الأهم من ذلك، كيف نفعل ذلك بأنفسنا خارج الاجتماع، لأن
 ربما تنتهك قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح دون قصد.
 يطلب منا MSB إجراء جميع الاجتماعات وفقًا لقواعد الاجتماع المفتوح.
 لذلك نعتقد أنه من المهم للأشخاص الذين لديهم بعض الخبرة في كل هذا.
 يفهم المسؤولون المنتخبون في مجلس النواب قواعد الجلسة المفتوحة ويمكنهم تقديم المشورة لأولئك الذين لديهم أسئلة.
 لقد سجلتهم للتو لهذا الغرض.
 أود أن أخبر المعلمين الحاضرين أنهم يتواصلون بانتظام مع لجنة المدرسة.
 في الأساس، أنت لست ملتزمًا بقواعد الاجتماع، لكن في هذه الغرفة أنت ملتزم بها.
 لذا، فالأمر يتعلق فقط بتنظيم مسؤولياتك بهذه الطريقة.
 لذا سأرسلها إلى جانيل.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=186.9s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 كما تعلمون، قبل بضع سنوات، تخرجت من مدرسة ميدفورد الثانوية في عام 2018 وتخرجت للتو من كلية كولومبيا البريطانية في مايو الماضي.
 لقد كان الكثير من العمل الذي قمت به في السنوات الأخيرة يهدف إلى إشراك المجتمع، وخاصة الشباب.
 أخذت إجازة لمدة عام للعمل في بوسطن ثم عملت كمدرس في نظام مدارس تشارلستون.
 لقد قمت أيضًا بالكثير من خدمة المجتمع أثناء وجودي في الكلية.
 ومنذ ذلك الحين، تم تعييني مديرًا لبرنامج عمل الشباب الجديد في مالدن.
 ولهذا السبب أعمل في مكتب رئيس البلدية، وأحاول أن أمنح الأطفال فرصة العثور على عمل.
 لذا، إذا كان لديك أي أطفال تهتم بهم، فيرجى إبلاغي بذلك.
 أحاول العثور على عمل في الصيف وأثناء العام الدراسي.

 أركز على البرمجة والجزء الأول من تطوير أفكار المشاريع، لكني أشرف أيضًا على الكثير بدءًا من الفكرة وحتى التنفيذ.
 لدي طفلان صغيران تتراوح أعمارهما بين ثلاث وخمس سنوات، لذلك أنا سعيد.
 وستكون هناك مدارس جديدة لهم في المستقبل.
 كجزء من العملية.
 كما قمت بتدريس الرياضيات لفترة من الوقت قبل أن أبدأ دراستي وأمارس مهنة الهندسة المعمارية.
 لذا أحضر بعضًا.
 أنا متحمس جدا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4042.008s">[Marta Cabral]</a>: مارثا كابرال، مديرة مدرسة ميدستار تشي الثانوية.
 اعتدت أن أكون مدرسا.
 أنا AP أيضًا.
 وكان هذا أيضًا أول دور قيادي لي.
 لهذا السبب أنا محظوظ لأنني قادر على المساعدة في بناء مدرسة جديدة لطلابنا الجدد لأنهم يستحقون ذلك حقًا.
 ليس لدي نفس الخبرة في البناء والتشييد مثل أي شخص آخر.
 ولكن كل ما يمكنني فعله هو أن أتخيل أين ستكون هناك حاجة لطلابنا ومدرسينا وموظفينا في مدرسة ميدفورد الثانوية.
 أنا متحمس جدًا لذلك لأنني أعتقد أنه يمكننا القيام بذلك.
 تعزيز التدريس والتعلم من خلال خلق مساحة للتعاون والابتكار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4089.096s">[MCM00000883_SPEAKER_09]</a>: يسعدني أن أكون هناك، شكرا لك.
 أنا لوري هودجدون.
 كنت مديرًا لمدرسة كيرتس ستابس، وهي على الأرجح أقدم مدرسة.
 بالتأكيد.
 أنا أحب الهندسة المعمارية القديمة، وأحب كورتيس ستابس، لكنني أعلم أنها ليست لطلاب القرن الحادي والعشرين.
 لهذا السبب أنا متحمس جدًا لأن أصبح مدرسًا في مدرسة ثانوية عادية في فيرمونت، ومديرًا في ماساتشوستس غرب الساحل الشمالي مباشرةً، ثم مدرسة مستقلة.
 عندما كنت طالبًا في ميدلبري بولاية فيرمونت، كنت لا أزال في المراحل النهائية من مشروع البناء وشاهدت هذا يحدث.
 كنا نرتدي الأحذية وتمكن أخي من الاستفادة من المبنى.
 أشعر وكأنني مازلت في حالتي الأصلية.
 أو نهاية شيء ما.
 أعتقد أنه مثير للاهتمام حقًا.
 لا أعتقد أن كل مدينة لديها القدرة على بناء مباني مدرسية جديدة والتفكير في المستقبل، وخاصة الطلاب الذين أعمل معهم لمساعدة طلابنا على اكتساب رأس المال والموارد الثقافية التي أعتقد أنها مهمة حقًا.
 يعجبني ما تقوله جيني لبعض السكان المحليين أو أي شخص توصل إلى هذا، وأود أن أعتقد أن طلابنا الحاليين سيكونون بالتأكيد جزءًا من هذا المبنى في المستقبل.
 إنهم يستحقون ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4186.071s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: مرحبًا، اسمي جيل بوين.
 أنا مدير خدمات الطلاب في مدارس بيدفورد العامة.
 أنا مقيم وموظف مدى الحياة.
 هذا هو عامي الحادي والثلاثين في بيدفورد.
 لقد شغلت العديد من المناصب المختلفة مثل المعلم وقائد المجموعة والمقيم والمنسق والآن هذا المنصب.
 لدي طفلان تخرجا من مدارس ميدفورد العامة.
 شخص يختار المسار الجامعي وآخر يختار المسار الوظيفي.
 لذلك كنت متحمسًا للغاية لرؤية رؤية هذه المدرسة الثانوية الجديدة وما يمكن أن تقدمه لميدفورد وطلابنا، بالإضافة إلى البناء على ما قاله لوري حول ضمان المساواة وإمكانية الوصول لجميع طلابنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: مرحبًا، اسمي سوزان كاروتشي.
 هذه سنتي السابعة والعشرون.
 وهكذا ولدت وترعرعت في الشهر الثالث من الدراسة.
 لم أعد أعيش هنا بعد الآن، لكني عشت هنا طوال حياتي المهنية.
 لقد بدأت كمساعد مدير، ومدير، ومساعد مدرسة ابتدائية، والآن مساعد مدير في وزارة التعليم والمباني في بروكس.
 كما هو الحال مع مقالة مارثا، يسعدني العمل معكم جميعًا في مجال التدريس المدرسي.
 أعتقد أن كل من يأتي إلى مريم يتحدث عن هذا.
 كما تعلمون، كان والدي مدير المشروع من المبنى K إلى المبنى 8.
 لذلك أشعر وكأنني اختبرت هذين الأمرين قليلاً، لكنني كنت محظوظاً.
 كمدرس في مدرسة ماكجلين الجديدة في عام 2001، كان من دواعي سروري مشاهدة هذه العملية وهي تتكشف كمعلمة وجزء من المدرسة الجديدة.
 لذا أعتقد أن ما يهمني حقًا هو الدور المهم الذي نلعبه جميعًا في هذه القرارات المهمة التي ستؤثر على معلمينا وطلابنا وعائلاتنا ومجتمعاتنا.
 يرجى أخذ هذا الأمر على محمل الجد.
 يشرفني أن أكون جزءًا من الفريق وأن تتاح لي الفرصة للعمل مع الجميع.</p>

 រាត្រីសួស្តី Marissa Parkinson ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​កើត​នៅ​ផ្លូវ​ដដែល​ក្នុង​ទីក្រុង Lawrence។
 គ្រួសារខ្ញុំ និងម្តាយរបស់ខ្ញុំនៅតែនៅទីនេះ តាមផ្លូវ West Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំបានចាប់ផ្តើមសិក្សានៅ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំបានចាប់ផ្តើមសិក្សានៅសាលា Harvey ។
 ខ្ញុំបានដើរផ្លូវផ្សេង។
 ខ្ញុំបានបញ្ចប់នៅ S.
 រ៉េ និង ខេធី។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នកកាន់សាសនាកាតូលិក ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការនៅ Johnny's Food Master នៅ Westlake ។
 ឧទ្យាន Duggar គឺជាឧទ្យានក្នុងស្រុករបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំស្រលាញ់សាលា។
 ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់កុមារ។
 ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់ការអប់រំ។
 ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការក្នុងវិស័យអប់រំអស់រយៈពេល 30 ឆ្នាំ។
 វាគួរឱ្យខ្លាចណាស់ព្រោះខ្ញុំមានអាយុប្រហែល 29 ឆ្នាំនៅពេលនោះ។
 នេះជាចម្លើយដែលខ្ញុំចូលចិត្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​កែ​សម្រួល។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំរំភើបចំពោះអត្ថន័យរបស់វា៖ ការកសាងវិទ្យាល័យថ្មីមួយសម្រាប់ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថានៅពេលដែលអគារនេះត្រូវបានសាងសង់ វាដូចជាអ្នកដឹងទេ ប្រហែលជាដូចជា Taj Mahal។
 វាជាសាលាដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាត។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ ជាង 50 ឆ្នាំក្រោយ យើងត្រូវការអ្វីថ្មី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសិស្សរបស់យើងសមនឹងទទួលបានវា។
 យើងមានកម្មវិធីអាជីពដ៏អស្ចារ្យ។
 យើងមានកម្មវិធីសិក្សាដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងអគារចាស់ណាស់។
 យើងមានគម្រោង Curtis House ដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាតដែលមានទីតាំងនៅកន្លែងផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងផ្តល់ជូននូវការអប់រំកុមារតូច និងកម្មវិធីកុមារតូចដ៏អស្ចារ្យសម្រាប់បុគ្គលិករបស់យើងនៅទីនេះ។
 យើងមានសំណាងណាស់ដែលមានរបស់ទាំងនេះនៅ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា Medford គឺជាត្បូងតូចមួយ។
 ការមានសាលាបឋមសិក្សាថ្មីនឹងផ្តល់អត្ថប្រយោជន៍យ៉ាងច្រើនដល់សិស្ស សហគមន៍របស់យើង និងអនាគតនៃសហគមន៍របស់យើង (សហគមន៍ទាំងមូល)។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ក្លាយ​ជា​ផ្នែក​មួយ​នៃ​ដំណើរការ និង​ធ្វើ​ការ​ជាមួយ​មនុស្ស​នៅ​ទីនោះ ហើយ​ឆ្លងកាត់​បទពិសោធន៍​ផ្សេង​ៗ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 បន្ថែមសំឡេងរបស់ខ្ញុំទៅសំឡេងទាំងអស់នៅទីនេះ។
 សម្រាប់អភិបាលក្រុង និងក្រុមប្រឹក្សាលោក Graham ដែលនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៃ 25 នេះ មានបេក្ខជនដែលមានលក្ខណៈសម្បត្តិគ្រប់គ្រាន់ជាច្រើន ដូចជាវិស្វករម្នាក់ វិស្វករម្នាក់ទៀត ស្ថាបត្យករផ្សេងទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែដើម្បីទៅដល់ក្រុមមនុស្សនេះ
 មនុស្សអស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាដឹងគុណណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំចង់អរគុណលូកា ដែលបានចាប់ផ្តើមដំណើរការនេះជាមួយយើងកាលពីពីរឆ្នាំមុន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថា អ្នកដឹងទេថា រក្សាវាឱ្យដំណើរការ និងគ្រប់គ្រងវាបាន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំដំណើរការនេះ ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាសង្ឃឹមថាយើងនៅតែមានភាពវិជ្ជមាន និងសុទិដ្ឋិនិយមចំពោះអ្វីដែលនឹងកើតឡើង។
 សមាជិក Ramjani ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកនឹងមានឆន្ទៈក្នុងការចែករំលែកព័ត៌មានអំពីតម្រងជាមួយពួកគេ។
 តើអ្នកចាប់បានអ្វី ហើយគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ប៉ុណ្ណា?
 វានឹងកាន់តែរំភើបនៅពេលដែលក្រុមដែលនៅសល់ទទួលបានបទពិសោធន៍ស្រដៀងគ្នា។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4528.482s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: ប្រាកដ។
 អរគុណអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នា...
 ពាក្យមនោសញ្ចេតនា។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​មួយ​នៅ​ចន្លោះ​ពេល​នេះ​ដល់​ម៉ោង ៨ យប់។
 ខ្ញុំសន្យាថាយើងនឹងចាកចេញនៅម៉ោង 8 ព្រឹក។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​សម្រាប់​ការ​ពិនិត្យ​យ៉ាង​ឆាប់​រហ័ស រឿង​ពីរ​គឺ​សំខាន់។
 មួយគឺខ្ញុំចង់ឱ្យអ្នកយល់ពីអ្វីដែលកំពុងកើតឡើង។
 មកដល់ពេលនេះ ហើយតើយើងនៅឯណា?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយអំពីរឿងនេះបន្តិច។
 ចូរ​យើង​បង្ហាញ​ពី​របៀប​ធ្វើ​យ៉ាង​ឆាប់​រហ័ស។
 ហើយ​មុន​ពេល​ចេញ​ទៅ​យប់​នេះ យើង​នឹង​បង្កើត​អនុគណៈកម្មការ​មួយ​ចំនួន ដើម្បី​ឱ្យ​យើង​អាច​ធ្វើ​កិច្ចការ​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ធ្វើ​បាន​លឿន។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សារឿងនេះនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ពេត្រុស វាជាការប្រសើរជាងប្រសិនបើអ្នកអាចនិយាយជាមួយខ្ញុំអំពីសុន្ទរកថានេះ។
 មិនអីទេ
 អ្នកអាចរំលងទំព័រជាក់លាក់។
 ព្យួរនៅទីនោះសម្រាប់មួយផ្សេងទៀត។
 តោះចាប់ផ្តើម។
 យើងបានចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងខែកុម្ភៈ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកនៅក្នុងខែធ្នូ MSBA បានអញ្ជើញយើងឱ្យចូលរួមក្នុងវគ្គជម្រុះ។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សាអំពីអត្ថន័យនៃវគ្គជម្រុះក្នុងរយៈពេលពីរបីនាទីទៀត។
 នេះ​ជា​ការ​អញ្ជើញ៖ យើង​សូម​អញ្ជើញ​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ចូល​រួម​ក្នុង​ដំណើរ​ការ​នេះ​ចាប់​ពី​ថ្ងៃ​ទី 1 ខែ​ឧសភា។
 ដូច្នេះសូមចាប់ផ្តើមនៅថ្ងៃស្អែក។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងនេះក្តី គណៈកម្មាធិការបានតែងតាំងខ្ញុំជាប្រធានគណៈកម្មាធិការសាងសង់កាលពីខែកុម្ភៈ ហើយរហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះ បានធ្វើច្រើនហើយ។
 រឿងមួយដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើគឺស្វែងរកពួកគេទាំងអស់គ្នាមែនទេ?
 ដូច្នេះនៅក្នុងបរិបទនៃការព្យាយាមបញ្ជាក់នូវអ្វីដែលយើងជាគណៈកម្មាធិការសាលាចង់ឱ្យគណៈកម្មាធិការអគារនេះធ្វើ យើងបានបង្កើតឡើងនូវបញ្ជីគោលដៅមួយ។
 មានគោលដៅជាច្រើនទៀត ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំចង់ដាក់គ្រឹះសម្រាប់រឿងនេះ
 តើយើងគួរធ្វើអ្វីបន្ទាប់ទៀត?
 ប្រាំទៅប្រាំពីរឆ្នាំ។
 ទីមួយគឺជាផែនការដ៏ទូលំទូលាយសម្រាប់កម្មវិធីដែលមានស្រាប់ទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងបរិវេណវិទ្យាល័យ Medford រួមទាំងការអប់រំវិជ្ជាជីវៈ និងមិនមែនវិជ្ជាជីវៈថ្នាក់ទី 9-12 អត្តពលកម្មថ្នាក់ទី 9-12 បណ្តាញគ្រួសារ Medford កម្មវិធីសាលាសហគមន៍ Medford ការអប់រំកុមារតូច រួមទាំងប៉ុន្តែមិនកំណត់ចំពោះកម្មវិធី Medford Early Education Program (ដែលយើងហៅថា MEAP) និង Kids Corner
 ដូច្នេះ មាន​អ្វី​ច្រើន​កើត​ឡើង​នៅ​ក្នុង​អគារ​នេះ ជាង​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ស្រមៃ​នៅ​វិទ្យាល័យ។
 ដូច្នេះ នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​អ្នក​ទាំង​អស់​គ្នា​ត្រូវ​ចាប់​ផ្តើម​គិត​។
 ទីពីរ តើវាជាអ្វី?
 តើខ្ញុំអាចរកវាឃើញទេ?
 សូមអរគុណ
 បាទ ខ្ញុំអាចចែករំលែកស្លាយ។
 ទេ ខ្ញុំអាចចែករំលែកស្លាយ។
 បាទ/ចាស ខ្ញុំអាចចែករំលែកស្លាយទាំងអស់ជាមួយអ្នកនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ទីពីរគឺត្រូវពិចារណាថាតើទីតាំងវិទ្យាល័យ Curtis-Tafts នៅលើបរិវេណសាលា Medford នឹងផ្តល់ឱកាសសិក្សាកាន់តែច្រើនសម្រាប់សិស្ស Curtis-Tafts ដែរឬទេ។
 ទីបី ធានានូវការបញ្ចូលជាសាធារណៈដ៏រឹងមាំ និងមតិរបស់អ្នកពាក់ព័ន្ធនៅក្នុងព្រឹត្តិការណ៍សំខាន់ៗពេញមួយគម្រោង និងការអនុលោមតាមគោលការណ៍ណែនាំរបស់ MSBA និងគោលការណ៍ណែនាំរបស់ក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលសាលា Medford ។
 ស្តាប់ពីអ្នកអប់រំ និងអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងអំពីការអនុវត្តល្អបំផុតសម្រាប់សិស្ស Medford និងអនាគតនៃកម្មវិធីអប់រំ។
 នេះមានន័យថាយើងយកចិត្តទុកដាក់យ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះមុខងារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​ចង់​ដឹង​ថា​តើ​កន្លែង​ទាំងនេះ​ស័ក្តិសម​សម្រាប់​សិស្ស​និង​គ្រូ​នៅ​ក្នុង​អគារ​ដែរ​ឬ​ទេ?
 នេះពិតជាសំខាន់ណាស់។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ទីប្រាំ រៀបចំផែនការសាងសង់ ជំរុញវិធីសាស្រ្ត គោលដៅអាកាសធាតុ និងសម្រេចបាននូវគោលដៅទាំងអស់ និងដឹកនាំការបញ្ជាក់នៃកំណែទីប្រាំ ដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវគោលដៅនៃកិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងអាកាសធាតុទីក្រុងប៉ារីសនៅឆ្នាំ 2030 និងឆ្នាំ 2050 និងបញ្ចប់ដំណើរការសាងសង់ប្រកបដោយប្រសិទ្ធភាព និងប្រសិទ្ធភាព ធានាឱ្យសិស្សានុសិស្សអាចរៀននៅក្នុងអគារថ្មីឱ្យបានឆាប់តាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 នៅពេលនោះ។
 នេះគឺជាកិច្ចការដ៏លំបាកមួយ។
 ល្បឿន​លឿន​បំផុត​តែង​តែ​វាស់​ជា​ឆ្នាំ​មិន​មែន​ខែ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងបរិបទនៃការបង្កើតគណៈកម្មាធិការនេះ ដរាបណាខ្ញុំត្រូវបានតែងតាំងជាប្រធាន យើងបានបើកការអំពាវនាវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធី យើងចាប់ផ្តើមប្រមូលពាក្យសុំ ហើយពួកគេទាំងអស់នៅទីនោះ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ វានៅតែមានការងារជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវធ្វើក្នុងដំណាក់កាលជម្រុះដែលយើងកំពុងចាប់ផ្តើម។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សារឿងនេះនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកអាចបន្តទៅស្លាយបន្ទាប់។
 ក្រាហ្វិកគឺអន់ណាស់ ហើយមិនត្រូវបានរុករកបានល្អនៅលើគេហទំព័រទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលដែលវាមកដល់ដំណើរការទាំងមូល យើងនៅតែមានពេលប្រាំមួយម៉ោងទៀតនៃការ unboxing ។
 នៅថ្ងៃទី 1 ខែឧសភា យើងនឹងបញ្ចូលរយៈពេលនៃការទទួលបានសិទ្ធិនេះនៅក្នុងប្រអប់។
 នៅដំណាក់កាលនីមួយៗនៃដំណើរការ។
 យើងត្រូវតែត្រូវបានអនុម័តដោយ MSBA ដើម្បីបំពេញតាមតម្រូវការទាំងអស់សម្រាប់រយៈពេលនេះ។
 ត្រូវតែមានក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលដែលអាចបោះឆ្នោតដើម្បីអញ្ជើញយើងឱ្យបោះជំហានបន្ទាប់។
 ដូច្នេះ នៅចំណុចណាមួយក្នុងដំណើរការនេះ MSBA អាចនិយាយបានថាពួកគេមិនទាន់ត្រៀមខ្លួនរួចជាស្រេចដើម្បីឆ្ពោះទៅមុខនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេក៏អាចនិយាយថា៖ យើងមិនចូលចិត្តអ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេក៏អាចនិយាយថា បំភ្លេចវាចោល។
 ដូច្នេះ​ការងារ​របស់​យើង​គឺ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​កើត​ឡើង។
 ការងាររបស់យើងគឺដើម្បីកម្រិតទីលានលេង រីកចម្រើនរួម និងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខឱ្យបានលឿនតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ផ្តល់ឱកាសដល់ MSBA ព្រោះយើងនឹងត្រៀមខ្លួនរួចជាស្រេចដើម្បីទទួលយកពួកគេ។</p>

 帮助我们对这座大楼需要做的事情进行评估。
 然后我们将继续进行方案设计，为项目融资。
 这就是我们作为社区投票资助该项目的地方。
 我无法强调它的重要性，但在实现这一目标之前我们还有很多工作要做。
 当这种情况发生时，我们将进入详细设计。
 所以我们把铲子放在地上。
 然后，在未来的某个时候，我们将完成该项目。
 所以这有点像坚果汤。
 我的目标是让我们一步步前进。
 我们将采取一切必要措施来满足资格期限。
 然后我们将继续前进。
 当我们接近下一阶段时，我们将开始讨论如何加快工作速度。
 但目前，我们的重点是资格。
 如果您可以翻到下一页，
 资格流程有自己的图表，您无法查看。
 因此，请继续观看下一张幻灯片。
 出色地。
 所以这个阶段需要做五件事。
 一是初步合规认证。
 这是一项法律协议，要求该市遵守 MSBA 流程。
 该协议已签署并交付给 MSBA。
 我们提前一天，我会承认这一点。
 谢谢市长和警长。
 我们正在路上。
 第二，我们必须组建建筑委员会。
 你们都在这里。
 学校委员会原定于 5 月 1 日开会，但现在是 4 月 30 日。
 我们做到了。
 该表格将很快发送至 MSBA。
 所以我们正在努力，并将很快发货。
 显然这是最简单的部分。
 这是文书工作。
 整个资格阶段涉及大量文书工作，但这是最简单的，我们会做并完成它。
 MSBA 必须批准我们的委员会。
 我们满足所有要求，因此 MSBA 对我们委员会的成员提出了各种各样的要求。
 我们与大家一起满足所有这些要求。
 现在让我们深入实际工作。
 还有三件事需要发生。
 其中之一就是所谓的教育背景。
 这是一份示范文件，它要求我们说：今天这座建筑里发生了什么？
 有多少间教室？
 有多少间数学教室？
 有多少临时空间？
 你们的剧院有多大？
 所有这些，对吗？
 这就是为什么他要求你描述这座大楼里目前正在发生的事情。
 它还要求您描述您对这座建筑未来的设想。
 因此，这就是关于柯蒂斯·塔夫茨的这些对话，这些关于幼儿期的对话变得非常非常重要。
 因为在我们的利益申报和资格阶段之间，教育背景将为所有建筑专业人员如何实际完成工作定下基调。
 因此，这将确定实现此构建所需的工作范围。
 所以在这个过程中现在已经做了很多工作。
 自二月份以来，我一直在与管理团队会面。
 我们每周见几次面。
 他们已经厌倦了我。
 他会厌倦我的。
 但我们开始做的一件事是：我们可以消除什么？
 这就是为什么该文件在以下方面写得很好：
 我们在这座大楼里做什么？
 所有教室都被统计在内。
 所有计划均已概述。
 就今天发生的事情而言，政府还有更多工作要做，才能准确描述这一点。
 另一件显然要复杂得多的事情是谈论我们将来要在这座大楼里做什么。
 因此，在这次谈话中，我们再次进行了非常广泛的谈话。
 我们一直在利用大脑的战略规划部分来提出重大问题。
 我将借用柯蒂斯·塔夫茨一分钟。
 我们已经讨论过我们的教育工作者是否认为这是我们应该考虑的事情，答案是肯定的，他们说是的，我们应该考虑一下。
 然后我们开始说：“好吧，那会是什么样子？”
 要求是。
 所以我们开始了这次对话，但这次对话超出了该委员会可以分析的范围，因为它有点涉及学校委员会的职责。
 因此，昨晚我提出了一项决议，要求我们的特殊教育和行为健康小组委员会（实际上由卢梭成员担任主席）在非常紧张的时间内举行会议，以收集意见和评论。
 关于这个非常有限的话题。
 柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学位于该校区对就读于柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学的学生的教育成果是否有任何好处？
 昨晚还有另一位梅德福居民发表了讲话。
 他在萨默维尔开展了一个非常类似的项目。
 他谈到了萨默维尔刚刚发生的这一转变以及它如何导致人口爆炸。
 对于那些需要另类环境的学生来说，它改变了游戏规则，让他们可以参加运动队等活动，在我们的例子中，是职业项目。
 所以这是一个巨大的机会，但是
 我们希望确保社区和委员会有机会思考他们可以贡献的一切并向该委员会提供建议。
 昨晚，这一情况已正式传达给特殊教育小组委员会。
 他们会见面的。
 他们将邀请现任员工、现任学生、校友、
 社区成员等，以及来自萨默维尔的 Jack Hevery 进行讨论并解决这个问题，并提出建议，让他们步入正轨并在 6 月中旬回来，这样他们还有很多工作要做，但这将帮助我们了解情况。
 我们对这所学校的想象的那一部分的写作。
 因为我们可能需要的不仅仅是大楼某处的几间教室。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨大学的成功部分在于其环境与拥有 1,200 名学生的庞大校园有很大不同。
 因此，我们必须仔细考虑如何将其组合在一起，但我们希望小组委员会所做的工作能够回到我们身边并得到传达。
 玛塔和查德将参加未来几周即将举行的学校委员会会议，玛塔将谈论她对替代方案的一些想法，以及这一切可能会是什么样子，即使是在短期内。
 这是必须纳入的内容。
 琼、苏珊娜、保罗和我昨天谈论了幼儿教育。
 我们的小学已经人满为患。
 我们将不得不在某个时候处理这​​个问题。
 MEEP 曾经在这里举办。
 我们将探讨一个案例，该案例表明 MEAP 应该回到这里，这可能是也可能不是我们着陆的地方，但这是我们正在探索的事情，因为现在是时候了。
 我们还谈论了很多关于没有接受过学前教育的学生以及他们何时进入我们公立学校的问题。
 对于这些学生来说，入学是多么具有挑战性。
 我们还讨论诸如等待名单有多大之类的问题？
 有多少来到我们这里的学生从未接触过任何类型的学前环境？
 我们需要什么样的能力来从这座大楼提供更广泛、更全面的幼儿教育项目？
 因为所有这些都必须包含在本文档中。
 所以，我们正在努力解决这个问题。
 因此，在这些事情发生的同时，到目前为止，在这个教育概况上已经做了很多工作。
 我们尚未涉及的教育概况的重要部分是沟通策略。
 我稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但在教育方面，我们的教育工作者必须做很多工作才能准备这份文件。
 我只是想让每个人都知道一切都在进行中。
 当我们进入下一次会议时，我们将展示这些文件，以便我们可以开始更广泛地阅读这些文件，寻求建议，并确保我们真正从各个角度考虑我们需要描述的内容。
 这就是我认为你们都发挥着非常重要作用的地方：
 我认为有必要根据我所知道的或基于我们对艺术项目或职业项目等的愿景，稍微不同地描述我们在这里所做的事情。
 这就是我们在教育概况中所处的位置。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨 (Curtis Tufts) 担任小组委员会成员。
 另一个重大的、创新的、不断变化的主题是 MEAP。
 MSBA 描述的社区中经常发生延误的原因是，他们必须做出有助于施工过程的非常重要的决定。
 我们可以合并两所学校吗？
 这显然有它自己的能量和它自己的一套要求，这使得它很难实现
 快点行动吧。
 因此，我们试图从大处着眼，因为这是一个独特的机会，可以以非常全面的方式思考该学区的真正需求，同时也可以尽快向前推进。
 因此，所有这些工作都正在进行中，并尽快向前推进。
 彼得，你可以转到下一张幻灯片吗？
 在专业方面也非常类似，因为我们有一个非常活跃的专业学校，所以我们还有另一个文件需要完成，那就是生存能力的第74章。
 第七十四章是专业设置条例的一章吧？
 出色地。
 这篇文章正在进行中。
 我们必须告诉他们，这是我们的计划。
 这是这些程序的功能。
 这是我们当前的注册和信息，例如我们的等候名单。
 我们还有机会描述这些计划的扩展计划。
 查德和彼得将在学校委员会中讨论扩张的潜力。
 这是学校委员会的问题，因为扩大的项目需要的不仅仅是一座建筑。
 需要设备。
 需要工作人员。
 因此，学校委员会必须对此进行评估。
 因此，该报告将于 5 月 20 日提交给学校委员会，并将有助于第 70 章表格的最终确定。
 这个小组也会仔细阅读并做好准备。
 本周晚些时候，市长、总监和我将与 MSBA 讨论这一难题，这实际上是城市规划信息。
 然后我们可以开始将信息输入到他们所谓的登记研究中。
 这有助于确定建筑物的大小。
 您可能已经听说过很多关于这座大楼是如何为 4,000 名学生建造的，但现在只有 1,200 名学生。
 4000到底是不是这个数字我不知道，但确实数字不一样。
 因此，MSBA 在资格阶段要做的事情之一就是，让我们为这么多学生建造一座大楼。
 这通常与今天大楼里发生的事情类似。
 然而，如果该市计划在开发中的住房方面进行重大扩张，他们会想知道所有这些。
 所以他们可以调整建筑物的大小，因为他们不希望我们建造一座立即耗尽容量的建筑物。
 他们也不希望我们建造一座永远不会住满的建筑。
 好的。
 所以，这是那里正在进行的工作的一部分。
 第四件事，维修文件。
 我们必须填写一份调查问卷，概述我们在整个地区的所有维护实践。
 所以这就像：他被重新投入使用了吗？
 你们的团队是如何训练的？
 大约有20个变量。
 该文件也处于起草阶段，正在尽快推进。
 我们可能会稍后在六月份讨论这个问题。
 考虑到我们已完成资格，我们需要做的最后一件事是确定可行性研究的资金，该资金可能在二十五万到二百五十万美元之间。
 我们还没有准备好，但我们正在制定计划。
 市长和我正在从财务工作组的角度制定该计划，以便能够根据需要尽快核算和管理这笔资金。
 对流程有疑问吗？</p>

 ទីក្រុងនឹងបង់ថ្លៃសិក្សាលទ្ធភាពទាំងអស់ជាមុន។
 បន្ទាប់មក នៅពេលដែល MSBA បញ្ជាក់អត្រាសងត្រលប់គម្រោងរបស់យើង ហើយយើងទទួលបានជោគជ័យពេញមួយដំណើរការ របាយការណ៍សិក្សាលទ្ធភាពនឹងត្រូវបានសងវិញតាមភាគរយដែលបានបែងចែកឱ្យយើង។
 ដូច្នេះ​ពួកគេ​នឹង​ប្រើ​រូបមន្ត​ដូចគ្នា ហើយ​ទាមទារ​ឱ្យ​មាន​ការ​សិក្សា​ពី​លទ្ធភាព និង​ការ​ទូទាត់​សង​ទៅ​ទីក្រុង។
 ប៉ុន្តែទីក្រុងត្រូវតែដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាប្រាក់។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីដែលត្រូវកើតឡើងនៅទីនេះគឺ
 យើង​មាន​គម្រោង​ផ្តល់​ថវិកា​ដល់​វា។
 ត្រូវហើយ យើងគួរមានចិត្តល្អ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​កិច្ចការ​នេះ​បាន​ល្អ ហើយ​វា​ត្រូវ​ការ​បោះឆ្នោត​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សា​ក្រុង​ដើម្បី​អនុញ្ញាត​មូលនិធិ​ទាំង​នោះ ហើយ​ដាក់​វា​នៅ​កន្លែង​ដែល​យើង​អាច​ប្រើ​វា។

 នីមួយៗមានថ្ងៃកំណត់ជាក់លាក់មួយភ្ជាប់ជាមួយវា។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ប្រាប់​ពួកគេ​ក្នុង​វិធី​វិជ្ជមាន​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ធ្វើ​រឿង​ទាំង​អស់​នេះ​មុន​ពេល​សាលា​ចាប់​ផ្ដើម​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។
 ប្រសិនបើអាចធ្វើបាន ខ្ញុំចង់ឱ្យអ្វីៗទាំងអស់ត្រូវបញ្ចប់ត្រឹមថ្ងៃទី 30 ខែមិថុនា។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងតែងតែឈរជាមួយគ្នា ប្រឹងប្រែង និងខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជា​ការ​សំខាន់​ក្នុង​ការ​ពង្រីក​ខ្លួន​អ្នក​។
 ដូច្នេះ​ត្រូវ​តានតឹង​ហើយ​រៀបចំ​ខ្លួន។
 MSBA មានការងារជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវធ្វើទាក់ទងនឹងការទទួលស្គាល់កម្មវិធីត្រៀមចូលមហាវិទ្យាល័យ និងអ្វីៗផ្សេងទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងអាចផ្តល់ឱ្យពួកគេនូវអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលពួកគេត្រូវការ ដូច្នេះយើងអាចបន្តទៅដំណាក់កាលបន្ទាប់ឱ្យបានឆាប់តាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 តើអ្នកមានសំណួរអំពីផែនការទេ?
 ល្អឥតខ្ចោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងនៅសល់តែ 20 នាទីប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ដល់ទីបញ្ចប់នោះ យើងបានរួមបញ្ចូលការប្រជុំអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការនាពេលខាងមុខជាបន្តបន្ទាប់នៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃរបៀបវារៈ។
 មានរឿងពីរដែលខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងពិចារណា និងផ្តល់អាទិភាពនៅពេលយើងឈានទៅមុខជាមួយដំណាក់កាលទីមួយនេះ។
 មួយក្នុងចំណោមពួកគេគឺ គណៈកម្មាធិការទំនាក់ទំនង និងការចូលរួមសហគមន៍។
 ខ្ញុំចង់បានអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការមួយចំនួន មិនលើសពីប្រាំពីររូបទេ ប៉ុន្តែជាក្រុមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍ដែលជួបប្រជុំគ្នាជាអនុគណៈកម្មការដែលពិតជាអាចគូសបញ្ជាក់ និងពណ៌នាអំពីដំណើរការចូលរួមសហគមន៍របស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា យើង​ទាំង​អស់​គ្នា​ឃើញ​ពី​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​របស់​មនុស្ស​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍៖ តើ Medford នឹង​ដោះស្រាយ​បញ្ហា​នេះ​ទេ?
 តើនេះនឹងដំណើរការទេ?
 តើរឿងនេះនឹងកើតឡើងទេ?
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកត្រូវបង្កើតទំនាក់ទំនងជាច្រើននៅក្នុងសហគមន៍។
 កាលណា​យើង​ចាប់​ផ្តើម​មុន នោះ​យើង​នឹង​ទទួល​បាន​ជោគជ័យ​កាន់​តែ​ខ្លាំង​នៅ​ទី​បញ្ចប់។

 ពួកគេជាច្រើនចាប់អារម្មណ៍លើគម្រោងនេះ។

 ក្រុមទី 2 ដែលខ្ញុំចង់បង្កើតនៅយប់នេះគឺ គណៈកម្មាធិការច្បាប់ និងសាជីវកម្ម។

 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាអ្នកអាចជួបម្តងទៀត ហើយនាំយកសេចក្តីព្រាងទៅក្រុមនេះ ដើម្បីយើងអាចអនុវត្តបទប្បញ្ញត្តិ និងគ្រប់គ្រងពីទីនោះ។
 ហើយ​គណៈកម្មការ​ទី​៣​នឹង​មិន​ជួប​គ្នា​ឆាប់ៗ​នេះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​នឹង​ជួប​។
 អ្នកដឹងទេថានឹងមានអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការហិរញ្ញវត្ថុនៅចុងខែមិថុនា ដូច្នេះនេះនឹងក្លាយជាគណៈកម្មាធិការអចិន្ត្រៃយ៍ដែលនឹងប្រជុំពេញមួយជីវិតនៃគម្រោង និងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ។
 វាជាការសំខាន់ដែលត្រូវចងចាំថា នៅពេលដែលពេលវេលាមកដល់ សហគមន៍នឹងត្រូវបោះឆ្នោត។
 គណៈកម្មាធិការនេះមិនមែនជាកន្លែងសម្រាប់ធ្វើការងារនេះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការលើកលែងបំណុលដែលចាំបាច់បំផុតដើម្បីផ្តល់មូលនិធិដល់គម្រោងនោះ គណៈកម្មាធិការនេះមិនគួរយល់ព្រមលើការលើកលែងបំណុលនោះទេ។
 តាមពិតទៅ វាមិនអាចកើតឡើងនៅទីនេះទេ។
 វាត្រូវតែកើតឡើងនៅខាងក្រៅក្រុមនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះ គណៈកម្មាធិការហិរញ្ញវត្ថុនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាទស្សនវិស័យ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីរឿងដូចជា
 លទ្ធកម្ម, លទ្ធកម្មពីអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងគម្រោងរបស់ម្ចាស់, ស្ថាបត្យកររបស់យើង, អ្វីៗដូចនោះ។
 ហើយជួយយើងឱ្យយល់ពីអ្វីដែលយើងត្រូវការដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវលទ្ធភាពជោគជ័យ?
 តើមានការចំណាយផ្សេងទៀតដែលយើងគួរពិចារណាដែរឬទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​មាន​ការងារ​ហិរញ្ញវត្ថុ​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ធ្វើ ទោះ​បី​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​រំពឹង​ថា​កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​ក្រុម​នឹង​ធ្វើ​ឡើង​រហូត​ដល់​ចុង​ខែ​ឧសភា​ក៏​ដោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​នឹង​និយាយ​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​អំពី​ច្បាប់​បញ្ជា​របស់ Robert និង​អ្វី​ៗ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​បន្ទាប់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថា គ្រប់គ្នាសម្លឹងមកខ្ញុំ ដូចឈប់និយាយអញ្ចឹង។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចាប់អារម្មណ៍នោះគឺថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ឮអំពីប្រធានបទទាំងនេះ ហើយនិយាយថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចង់ចូលរួមដែរឬទេ

 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​សូម​ណែនាំ​ដល់​រដ្ឋបាល​សាលា​ឲ្យ​យក​ចិត្ត​ទុក​ដាក់​ផង​ដែរ ព្រោះ​អ្នក​មាន​ការងារ​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ធ្វើ​ដើម្បី​ត្រៀម​ខ្លួន​សម្រាប់​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ទើប​នឹង​រៀប​រាប់។
 អ្នកត្រូវបានស្វាគមន៍ 100% ។
 ចូលរួម ប៉ុន្តែយើងនឹងត្រូវការអ្នកទៅជួបជាមួយគណៈកម្មាធិការសាលា។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំដាក់អនុគណៈកម្មការទាំងនេះនៅលើប្រតិទិនរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 ល្ងាចនេះយើងនឹងជួបគ្នាទាំងស្រុងតាមរយៈ Zoom ដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យអ្វីៗកាន់តែងាយស្រួលបន្តិច។

 معيار.
 مثالي.
 تواصل.
 ماريسا.
 مثالي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6146.461s">[Libby Brown]</a>: أعني أنه يمكنني وضع اثنين هناك ومعرفة ما إذا كان هذا كافيًا.
 سأركز على الاتصالات أو التمويل.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6154.444s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: مثالي.
 سأقدم لك التمويل.
 كيف يبدو الأمر؟
 تبدو جيدة.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6162.107s">[Unidentified]</a>: بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6165.55s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: أين فيونا؟
 تمويل.
 هل يمكننا طلب التمويل من بوب؟
 مثالي.
 نعم، نعم، في الواقع.
 فهل من مهتم بهذه اللجان؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6182.816s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: إذا لم تتمكن من الحصول على ما يكفي من المال، سأتصل بك.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6186.4s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: سأضعك على القائمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6188.182s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: اعتبرني ممولًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6192.886s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: القانون والشمول مكونان من شخصين.
 هذا صحيح
 أخطط أن أكون في جميع اللجان، ولكن هذا هو الشيء الصحيح الذي ينبغي القيام به.
 ربما يمكننا دعوة إميلي لازارو للانضمام إلى اللجنة الفرعية للشؤون القانونية والمصالحة.
 ثم سأتشاور معه.
 كما قمت بدعوة نيكول موريل للانضمام إلى لجنة الاتصالات الفرعية.
 لذا تحدث معهم.
 ولكن هل لدى أي شخص آخر مشاعر قوية حول هذا؟
 أين تريد أن تذهب؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6227.321s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: أستطيع التواصل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6230.024s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: كبير، كبير.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6232.21s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: نعم، أود أن أقول ماليًا، لكن ليس لدي خبرة كبيرة في هذا المجال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6235.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: أعتقد أننا بخير.
 جون؟
 لا، لا يزال لديك عمل للقيام به.
 اه بالطبع.
 أعتقد أن جميع المدربين موجودون بالفعل في الفريق.
 قبل أن نخوض في هذا الأمر، سيكون هناك لجنة من الخبراء الذين سيقدمون اقتراحات لأصحاب المشاريع.
 هذه ليست تجربتي.
 هذا ليس سبب وجودي هنا.
 لذلك، مع مرور الوقت، سوف نعتمد على الأشخاص لإنشاء لجان فرعية.
 من وجهة نظر شخصية، أعتقد أننا يجب أن نبدأ من هنا.
 هل هذا منطقي؟
 هل لدى أي شخص أي اقتراحات أخرى بشأن ما يجب القيام به في المستقبل القريب؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: لدي سؤال.
 بالتأكيد.
 لقد قلت أن كورتيس يمكن أن يأتي إلى هنا ويستخدم هذا المكان بطرق مختلفة.
 من يبحث عن هذه الخيارات؟
 كما هو الحال مع التعليم العام، من الممكن العمل في كليات المجتمع أثناء تلقي دروس ليلية، كما آمل أن أفعل في Associated General Contractors AGC، التي توفر تعليم الكبار.
 هل أي شخص مثل هذا؟
 توصل إلى العديد من الخيارات التي تريد أخذها بعين الاعتبار أو ما هي الأفكار التي لديك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: نعم، أكثر أو أقل، أكثر أو أقل، ولكن ليس بشكل كامل.
 نحن لم نصل إلى هناك بعد.
 لذا أعتقد أنه من المنطقي إضافتها بعد أن نرى الغموض الأول في الفصل 74.
 لذا، عندما نبدأ في قراءة هذه الوثائق، أعتقد أن الوقت قد حان لنقول: من غيرهم الذي يجب أن نكون حذرين منه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: لأن كل هذا له عواقب.
 أنت تعرف الراحة والمسافة وحجم المعدات مقارنة بالمعدات الأخرى ومساحة التخزين ومواقف السيارات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6343.879s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: مثالي.
 نعم، أعتقد أن هذه فكرة جيدة.
 سأضيف هذا إلى القائمة.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6350.581s">[Unidentified]</a>: في الواقع، المدينة تحدد هويتنا.
 هم
 إذا قال كل من في الغرفة: "يجب أن يكون مركز بيدفورد الترفيهي موجودًا هناك."</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6365.68s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: لكن المدارس الحكومية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6367.861s">[Unidentified]</a>: في.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6375.31s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: مثالي.
 لذلك أريد أن أسأل من سيوفر هذه البنية التحتية الرقمية لهذه اللجنة؟
 لذلك، سأتحدث عن SDI.
 هناك سدي.
 يقوم Fed.SOI بإجراء الأبحاث.
 قد تكون هناك وثائق عامة أخرى ليست عامة بالفعل ولكن ينبغي أن تكون كذلك.
 كما تعلمون، ستكون اللجنة الفرعية للشؤون العامة مسؤولة عن:
 يمكن توصيل نفس الشيء إلى العديد من الأشخاص، ومن الأكثر فاعلية القيام بذلك من خلال موقع ويب (ربما من خلال مستودع مشترك) ويكون الاتصال الخارجي ممكنًا تمامًا.
 على سبيل المثال، على بوابة مثل موقع الويب، مثل المدرسة، كل شخص لديه هذه المشاريع ثم نوع من قاعدة البيانات الداخلية التي يمكن لشيلدون الاطلاع عليها في SOI.
 يمكن لأعضاء قائمة تسجيل الدخول استخدامه في أي وقت.
 بالتأكيد.
 كل ما تحتاجه هو الموارد.
 يمكنني أن أقدم لك معلومات محدثة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: لدينا ذلك.
 لذلك حصلنا على عنوان URL خاص من الإصدار - buildmhs.org.
 لذا؟
 مثالي.
 إذن عنوان URL موجود.
 هذه الصفحة متاحة.
 في الواقع، يدرس توماس بنية الموارد الأساسية لهذا المجتمع.
 السبب الذي يجعلنا نطلب من الأشخاص تقديم السير الذاتية والصور هو أنه سيتم نشرها جميعًا على الموقع، لذلك فهو يدير كل هذه الأشياء كمدير للعلاقات العامة.
 وافق توم على أنه، على الرغم من أنه كان مدير الاتصالات المنتهية ولايته، فإنه سيظل مشاركًا في المشروع حتى نقوم بتعيين خليفة له.
 لذلك أعتقد أن توماس وبعض طلاب التعليم المهني لدينا يقومون بإنشاء هذا الموقع تحت إشراف ليزا ميلر.
 وما هي تركيبة الوثائق التي ستعرض على الجمهور عندما يسأل أحد أين؟
 يمكننا أن نوصي بمكان لك.
 سيكون هناك محاضر لجميع اجتماعاتنا.
 سيكون جدول أعمال جميع اجتماعاتنا موجودًا هناك.
 لذلك لدينا هيكل كامل لمحاولة القيام بذلك.
 نحن لسنا مستعدين بعد، ولكن أتمنى أن نلتقي بكم في الاجتماع القادم.
 موقع إلكتروني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: حسنًا، الخطوة التالية هي تحريك الباب للخارج.
 كيف حال ظهرك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: لذا، هذا سؤال صعب، لأنه وفقًا لقانون الاجتماعات، هذه ليست النهاية بالنسبة لنا.
 بمجرد طباعة الجدول، تصبح جميع المستندات الموجودة في هذا الجدول جزءًا من السجل العام.
 وإذا فعلنا ذلك فالصعوبة تكمن في أننا إذا فعلنا ذلك خلف الكواليس فقد نخالف قواعد الاجتماع.
 بهذه الطريقة، يحصل المسؤولون على نسخة من المستند الذي يعملون عليه دون تمثيل النصاب القانوني ويمكنهم الاستمرار في القيام بذلك.
 عند وصول الملفات إلى هنا، يتم وضعها على مساحة Drive مشتركة.
 عند الحديث عن تحرير الملفات، لا يوجد تحرير في وضع عدم الاتصال على هذا النظام الأساسي.
 ويحظر القانون التجمعات الجماهيرية.
 لسوء الحظ، نجلس هنا ونقوم بتحرير الملفات معًا.
 هذا بالتأكيد هو الجزء الأكثر إيلامًا في إدارة هذه العملية، كما لاحظتم جميعًا بالفعل، آسف.
 لكن نعم، إنه أمر صعب، لكن التحرير دون الاتصال بالإنترنت، والذي يعمل بشكل جيد في أجزاء أخرى من العالم، ليس خيارًا هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: حسنًا، لا يوجد Google Drive أو مشاركة الملفات.
 سيتم الافراج عن كل شيء.
 وسوف تظهر على الموقع الإلكتروني عند طباعتها.
 بمجرد ظهورها على الموقع، تصبح عنصر التحكم الأساسي في التكوين ولا يمكن تغييرها دون عكس تلك التغييرات هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: بالضبط.
 نعم، إنه مخيف.
 هذا صحيح.
 إنه أمر مخيف حقا.
 لقد وجدنا طريقة للقيام بذلك.
 إنه ليس مخيفًا، لكن كما تعلمون، لسوء الحظ، لم يعد مخيفًا بعد الآن.
 سيمنع هذا المجتمع من فهم كيفية تحرير الملف.
 وعندما نفعل ذلك، أعتقد أن اجتماعات Zoom هذه ستكون أكثر إنتاجية.
 يمكنك الجلوس أينما تريد ويمكن للجميع رؤية الملف يتغير ولا يوجد شكل ممكن.
 فكرة تحرير مستند دون الكشف عما يحدث.
 لذلك علينا أن نكون حذرين مع هذا.
 لكن نعم، إنها عملية.
 هذا الغريب يعمل في GraphDoc.
 أستطيع أن أرى هذا يعمل لطباعة المستندات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: مُطْلَقاً. هذا ليس GraphDoc.
 نحن نفهم أن الكثير منكم يعمل.
 نحن نجادل.
 نحن مجموعة بسيطة من الشباب الذين يشاركون.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: هذا شيء للتفكير فيه.
 نعم نعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: في الخريف الماضي تحدثت مع الجميع في المكتب.
 لقد كانت حقبة.
 لذلك اتصلنا لفترة طويلة.
 هناك 40 عضوا في المجموع.
 قال أحد المشاركين: "لقد ذكر سايمون هذا للتو في الوثيقة وقرأ تعليقاتنا هناك.
 في الأساس، قمنا بدمجها.
 الجواب هو لا.
 يمكنك بعد ذلك كتابة تقييمك.
 أجبت أن عمرك سبع سنوات.
 قالوا أنه لا بأس بقبول ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: في.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: Мы просто чувствуем.
 Кажется, мы все можем согласиться с тем, что это может быть опасно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 شكرا مرة أخرى لوجودك هنا.
 أنا أيضًا مهتم بالاتصالات، وعلى الرغم من أنني لا أعمل الليلة، إلا أنني مازلت أستمتع بالمكالمات الهاتفية.
 سوف يعودون هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: كل هذه التحديثات سوف تعود هنا.
 هل يمكنك الإجابة على أي أسئلة أخرى حول اللجنة الفرعية أو جدول الأعمال؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: لدي أسئلة حول الانتخابات.
 حسنًا، عندما نصوت بنعم، نجد أنفسنا في موقف لم أفهمه أبدًا: القوة هي القوة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: مُطْلَقاً.
 لا، هذا ليس صحيحا.
 هل يسمح للسلطات بحضور الاجتماع؟
 لا، لا يمكنك إعطاء صوتك لشخص آخر.
 وعندما ننتهي سنذهب إلى صناديق الاقتراع، لأننا بحاجة إلى استكمال الانتخابات.
 يحدث هذا عادة فيما يسمى بالتصويت الصوتي، حيث يقول الجميع نعم ثم نسميه يومًا.
 للقيام بذلك، قم بإجراء لفة.
 إنه أمر غريب وعجيب، لذا دعونا ننتهي بهذا الشكل.
 ولكن ما هي الأسئلة الأخرى التي لدينا قبل أن نختتم؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: أنا حذر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: ولكن أعتقد أنه من الجدير بالذكر أيضًا أن هناك الكثير من الأعضاء الذين لا يحق لهم التصويت في هذه اللجنة.
 ليس لأننا لا نريد أن نسمع رأيك.
 أنت هنا لأننا نريد أن نسمع رأيك.
 عندما نقوم بالتصويت، لن يتم استخدام اسمك ولن تقوم بالتصويت.
 ولكن أبعد من ذلك، أنت عضو رسمي في هذه اللجنة.
 لقد حذروني
 عندما يقوم العديد من الأعضاء بالتصويت، تصبح إدارة الأعمال صعبة للغاية لأن النصاب القانوني مطلوب لعقد الاجتماعات وتسيير الأعمال.
 كل شيء معقد للغاية.
 لذا فإن ما نقوله هو أننا بحاجة إلى لجنة كبيرة، ولكننا بحاجة أيضًا إلى أن نكون قادرين على المضي قدمًا بكفاءة وفعالية.
 هذا هو السبب.
 ماذا كنا نفعل هناك؟
 أعتقد أن حجم العمولة قد تغير بالفعل في حياته.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: إذن 25؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: نعم، هناك 15 عضواً لهم حق التصويت في اللجنة، وهو عدد كافٍ من الأعضاء الذين يحق لهم التصويت.
 سنجري انتخابات قريبا.
 ولكن ما هي الأسئلة الأخرى التي لديك للاجتماع القادم؟
 القواعد والاستنتاجات، 7 مايو.
 سينضم المجتمع في 8 مايو ويعيد النتائج إلى الفريق في 13 مايو.
 لذلك، في اجتماعنا يوم 13 أيار/مايو، ستنظر الأغلبية في هذه التوصيات وتوافق على هذه الخطط.
 نحن في وضع إعادة التشغيل.
 وسنقوم بعد ذلك بدراسة بعض الوثائق التي اطلعت عليها الحكومة ونبدأ بقراءة ومناقشة محتوياتها.
 هذا كل شيء، ولكن يرجى الاستمرار.
 لقد وضعنا جدول الأعمال.
 لأسباب معقولة سنلتقي مباشرة في البرنامج إن أمكن، السعر 89 يوان.
 من الآن وحتى نهاية شهر يونيو.
 أعدك بأننا سنعود يوم الاثنين في بداية العام الدراسي المقبل، ولكن حتى نهاية يونيو، بين اجتماعات مجلس إدارة المدرسة والعطلات، من المستحيل الحفاظ على هذا الجدول الزمني.
 سنجتمع فقط عبر Zoom خلال فصل الصيف وسننقل اجتماعنا إلى الأربعاء.
 وبما أنه يومي الاثنين والجمعة في الصيف، فمن الصعب الحصول على النصاب القانوني لإنجاز أي شيء.
 نأمل أن نتمكن من القيام بذلك، ولكنني أحاول إبقاء جدول الاجتماعات خفيفًا.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون هناك المزيد من اللجان الفرعية في نهاية شهر أغسطس، ولكن هذه مجرد بداية للأشخاص الذين يحاولون تنظيم حياتهم المزدحمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 لذلك هناك شيئين.
 ومع ذلك، هذا سؤال غير مباشر.
 إذا كنت لا تستطيع أن تفعل ذلك،
 حسنًا، يرجى مشاركة أفكارك عن طريق إرسال أفكارك وأفكارك إلينا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: هذه في الواقع مشكلة فنية.
 الرجل الذي لا يستطيع حضور الاجتماعات سيرسل إليك بريدًا إلكترونيًا يتضمن أفكاره وأفكاره، وربما حتى الحل.
 لقد سمعنا بالفعل أن البريد الإلكتروني يعد فكرة سيئة في كل شيء تقريبًا باستثناء إعداد جدول الأعمال.
 قد يبدو هذا وكأنه منطقة رمادية.
 أتساءل هل فاتتك الجلسة العامة التي اصطدم فيها هذان الأمران؟
 كيف يعمل هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: لذا، أستطيع أن أقول لك: أعتقد أن أي محام سيطلب منك ألا تكتب أي شيء أبدًا.
 هذا هو المكان الذي سنبدأ فيه.
 لا تضع أي شيء في الكتابة.
 ومع ذلك، إذا كنت تنوي كتابة شيء ما
 كما في هذه الحالة، هذه منطقة رمادية.
 كل ما عليك فعله هو الاتصال بشخص ما والقول له: "مرحبًا، هل يمكنني أن أرسل لك أفكاري؟"
 هل أخبرت الآخرين بهذا أم أنك تخطط لذلك؟
 يمكنك التأكد من أن لديك حلقة مغلقة، أليس كذلك؟
 هذا ما قلته لي، هل يمكنني أن أرسل لك تعليقًا؟
 قلت نعم.
 قلت أنني لن أتحدث مع أي شخص عن هذه المشاكل، لذلك سنكون بخير.
 تصبح هذه مشكلة إذا كنت تتعامل مع عدة أشخاص يمثلون لجنة الأغلبية.
 على سبيل المثال، إذا قلت: أقصد شخصين لأنني لست متأكداً من سيكون في الاجتماع، فلا بأس لأن عمرك أقل من ثماني سنوات.
 بعد التحدث مع نفسك، بما في ذلك ثمانية أشخاص، لديك مشكلة.
 إذن أنت تخالف القانون بافتتاحك للاجتماع.
 ويتمثل التحدي في أن جميع أصحاب المصلحة يجب أن يكون لديهم نفس الفهم الذي يتمتع به المشاركون في المحادثة.
 ما الذي أفتقده؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: أفتقد هذا في المقال حول الصندوق.
 يمكنك أن تكون موجهًا نحو الهدف للغاية.
 قلت لك فقط استمر هههه
 إذا قمت بذلك، فسنخرق القانون جميعًا، بغض النظر عما نفعله لتجنب خرق القانون.
 وأعتقد أن هذا ينطبق على جميع المواطنين الملتزمين بالقانون.
 الاعتبارات التسلسلية لا تهم شيئا، لا المحتوى، لا الخطة، لا التأمين.
 هل هناك اثنان منا فقط؟
 أنت تسيء استخدامه.
 لقد كسرت العديد من القواعد.
 لا أعرف بالرغم من ذلك.
 حسنا، حسنا.
 نعم، هذه مشكلتي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: يتم تزويد الجميع بعنوان بريد إلكتروني لمدرسة ميدفورد العامة، وأوصي بعدم استخدام عنوان بريدك الإلكتروني الشخصي، تحت أي ظرف من الظروف، للأعمال التجارية ذات الصلة ببرنامج MSBA.
 بمجرد إعداد رسائل البريد الإلكتروني هذه، سنقوم بنقل كل شيء.
 لكن أنصحك بعدم استخدام البريد الإلكتروني الشخصي لأي سبب من الأسباب.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: وهذا يجعل من السهل الالتزام بالسجلات العامة.
 أنا أمين سر مجلس المنطقة.
 باستثناء درجاتك الشخصية، تكون جميع السجلات المدرسية الرسمية عامة ويجب أن تكون متاحة تلقائيًا أو على الأقل قابلة للعرض عند الطلب.
 لذلك يمكنك القيام بكل هذا باستخدام عنوان البريد الإلكتروني لمدارس ميدفورد العامة، وحزمة Google لمدارس ميدفورد العامة حيث يمكنك تدوين الملاحظات، وكل ذلك مفيد حقًا لوضع الأشياء في هذا المجال.
 لا تشارك هذا مع الآخرين.
 لا ترسل مسودتك عبر البريد الإلكتروني.
 هذا ليس مكانًا للملاحظات الشخصية.
 حسنا
 ونحن لا نشمل أحدا بهذا المعنى.
 صحيح تماما.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7198.191s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: أي سؤال أخير؟
 إنه الثامن من مارس.
 يرجى تأجيل هذا الاجتماع وفقا لأحكام روبرت.
 هل هناك أي تأخير؟
 قدم أعضاء Orapade اقتراحًا للإغلاق، والذي صوت عليه أعضاء Russo للمرة الثانية.
 شكرا لك
 أوه، لا يمكنك ذلك.
