 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me OK?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly, I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent
 The city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices talk a little bit in terms of what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 And I understand that some.
 Members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification.
 I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has
 put forth a new updated open meeting law guide last year that's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are gonna cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't wanna go into any specifics,
 or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly, if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen, so I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 Again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject, I won't take offense, or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Yeah.
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the Open Meeting Law.
 I'm going to talk about best practices.
 I'm going to go through the sort of fundamentals of the Open Meeting Law.
 We certainly start with the premise that
 The open meeting law, public records, and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings.
 unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting?
 sufficient to give members of the public notice, and what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and
 in business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted
 no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 Really, someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're gonna talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session.
 So members of the public can see in real time what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation.
 And we'll talk about what that means.
 of the body's business and the public's being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot topic in recent years.
 Essentially, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings.
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially, the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice, to allow someone that wasn't present to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with usually have them approved at an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially 48 hours I can tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting so certainly to be cognizant of legal holidays vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months.
 come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly, we know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs
 whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're going to spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're going to talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're going to talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something
 with the explosion and all of us use technology all the time, it's something to be aware of certainly as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanted to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the Attorney General will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law, just as the entire complement would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself, or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law,
 a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact-specific analysis, so we just want to be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical, as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, you know, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would want to post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble, and this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public bodies, school committees, city council,
 Another, I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or a social event or a community event, that you are discussing matters within this public body's jurisdiction.
 I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an allegation, well, I saw a quorum of the public body, you know, in this room at a retirement party.
 or there was a community event, and I think that they were talking about X, Y, and Z. So certainly you want to avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place, and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly
 A best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're going to want to file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say, I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, DEF DESI, but certainly for the first time you may wanna spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail.
 So we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 No?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Floor planning doesn't equal an emergency, we know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can,
 You certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet, there's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies, but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're going to move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about, so I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that if the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording, and then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body.
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting wall complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly I'm sure you all use it in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives, but really the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum either collectively so reply all situation.
 or a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 So members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to
 you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law, because even if you're volunteers,
 Emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message,
 and there is a public records request for that, that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not going to speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches.
 If you are posting on your service, you don't want to direct comments to your other members.
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might want to consider not engaging.
 Certainly, again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights, so certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law does not mandate, we're going to talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law has made
 indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law, allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech other than based on time, place and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes.
 People are allowed to speak once or twice, depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 Here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes
 is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour.
 We just wanna make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process for such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles, any restrictions on an individual's speech.
 must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine both under the open meeting law as well as under constitutional considerations
 to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a future meeting agenda so that members of the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you want to make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice,
 The updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time-sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know I get this question all the time do we are the meeting minutes a transcript and the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired.
 particularly as I would imagine you're gonna have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the Attorney General's Office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken, here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do wanna do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires, under the current regulations, that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints.
 alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up
 very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process?
 And generally, that is not allowed under the open meeting law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 Certainly, it can be delegated this task to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency.
 But there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take, you know, personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's
 official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons.
 Those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21, and I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Um, essentially executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is.
 If you were meeting regarding threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the Open Meeting Law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away, but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney-client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 We're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions.
 If you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would send you sports for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 We're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting took, what happened at the meeting, what transpired.
 And really only I can stress this enough discuss the matters that are cited.
 So, if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly and again, they're, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 you really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 30A section 21 and the open meeting role guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail.
 And there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct, as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in Superior Court.
 I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spalding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 You know, if we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time.
 But regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly we'll keep all of you updated along the way.
 If there are changes, we would update, certainly update you.
 But for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in members.
 in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional.
 There are technological considerations.
 We'll talk about that.
 But essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely, then you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes,
 The meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that the Attorney General's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on Medford community, then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means, but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely, you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded again under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call just as we do an executive session.
 and remote meeting, remote members.
 So if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting and the camera should be on to the extent that someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely,
 Members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings, many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer,
 or project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops, then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email.
 If there is an issue with a technical feed,
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 저는 학교에서 직접 일하거나 학교와 긴밀한 관계를 맺고 있는 사람들이 많다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 따라서 문제를 다른 관점에서 바라보고 여러분의 의견을 표현할 기회를 줄 수 있습니다.
 아마도 효과가 있을 수도 있고, 아니면 단지 스파게티 조각이 벽을 따라 미끄러지는 것일 수도 있습니다.
 하지만 저는 그것이 여기서 제 역할이고 외부 역할이라고 생각합니다. 하지만 그것은 메드포드에 새로운 고등학교를 열도록 동기를 부여해 줍니다.
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3906.235s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 안녕하세요. 저는 Medford의 구매 관리자인 Fiona Maxwell입니다.
 이름이 많아서 반갑네요.
 나는 당신의 얼굴을 본 적이 없다는 것을 방금 깨달았습니다.
 하지만 저는 메드퍼드 시 구매 부서에서 7년 동안 일했는데, 그게 좋은 기회였어요.
 메드포드에서 좋은 일들이 많이 일어나고 있는데, 저는 메드포드 출신이 아니기 때문에 진행되는 모든 프로젝트가 기쁘고 설렌다.
 이것은 훌륭합니다.
 저는 또한 2015년에 새로운 고등학교를 지은 지역 출신입니다.
 나에겐 어느 정도 다른 장점도 있다.
 저는 North Reading에서 근무하는 지도 상담사이지만 다른 직책을 맡고 있습니다.
 내 말은, 그것은 훌륭한 프로그램이고 훌륭한 학교 시스템이라는 것입니다. 내 딸이 먼저 졸업했고, 내 아들이 그곳에서 먼저 졸업했습니다.
 나는 정말로 그를 여기로 데려오고 싶습니다. Medford는 그럴 자격이 있습니다.</p>

 여기 와주신 모든 분들께 감사드리고, Jenny가 하는 모든 일에서 리더십을 보여주셔서 감사드립니다.
 나에게는 세 명의 자녀가 있는데 그 중 두 명은 공립학교에 다니고 다른 한 명은 1년, 2년 또는 3년 동안 학교에 다닐 수 있습니다.
 하지만 어느 쪽이든 이 과정을 시작하게 되어 매우 기쁩니다.
 안녕하세요, 제 이름은 마리사 데스몬드입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=3995.553s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 나는 건축가입니다.
 저는 주로 대학, 특히 고등 교육 분야에서 일하지만 초등 및 중등 교육 분야에서는 덜 자주 일합니다.
 저는 프로그래밍과 프로젝트 아이디어 개발의 초기 부분에 중점을 두고 있지만 개념부터 구현까지 많은 부분을 감독하기도 합니다.
 저는 3세와 5세의 어린 자녀가 두 명 있어서 행복합니다.
 미래에는 그들을 위한 새로운 학교가 생길 것입니다.
 프로세스의 일부로.
 나는 또한 공부를 시작하고 건축 분야에서 경력을 쌓기 전에 한동안 수학을 가르쳤습니다.
 그러니 좀 가져오세요.
 정말 신난다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4042.008s">[Marta Cabral]</a>: Martha Cabral, Midstar Chi 고등학교 교장.
 나는 교사였습니다.
 나도 AP야.
 이것이 나의 첫 주연이기도 했다.
 그렇기 때문에 신입생들을 위해 새로운 학교를 짓는 것을 도울 수 있어서 행운입니다. 왜냐하면 그들은 진정으로 그럴 자격이 있기 때문입니다.
 나는 다른 사람들과 같은 건축 및 건설 경험이 없습니다.
 하지만 제가 할 수 있는 것은 메드포드 고등학교에서 우리 학생, 교사, 교직원이 어디에 필요할지 상상하는 것뿐입니다.
 우리가 할 수 있다고 생각하기 때문에 매우 기대됩니다.
 협업과 혁신을 위한 공간을 만들어 교육 및 학습을 향상합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4089.096s">[MCM00000883_SPEAKER_09]</a>: 거기 있어서 기쁘네요. 감사합니다.
 저는 로리 호지던이에요.
 저는 아마도 가장 오래된 학교인 Curtis Stubbs 학교의 교장이었습니다.
 틀림없이.
 나는 오래된 건축물을 좋아하고 커티스 스텁스(Curtis Stubbs)도 좋아하지만 그것이 21세기 학생들을 위한 것이 아니라는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 그렇기 때문에 저는 버몬트에서 정규 고등학교 교사가 되고, 노스 쇼어 바로 서쪽에 있는 매사추세츠에서 교장이 되고, 차터 스쿨이 되는 것을 매우 기쁘게 생각합니다.
 제가 버몬트 주 미들버리에서 학생이었을 때 저는 아직 건설 프로젝트의 마지막 단계에 있었고 이것이 일어나는 것을 지켜보았습니다.
 우리는 신발을 신고 있었고 동생은 건물을 이용할 수 있었습니다.
 아직 원래 상태에 있는 것 같아요.
 아니면 뭔가의 끝.
 정말 흥미로운 것 같아요.
 저는 모든 도시가 새로운 학교 건물을 짓고 미래에 대해 생각할 수 있는 능력을 갖고 있다고 생각하지 않습니다. 특히 제가 생각하는 문화적 자본과 자원을 학생들이 얻을 수 있도록 돕기 위해 함께 일하는 학생들은 더욱 그렇습니다.
 저는 Jenny가 일부 지역 주민이나 이 아이디어를 제안한 사람에게 하는 말이 마음에 듭니다. 그리고 현재의 학생들이 미래에 확실히 이 건물의 일부가 될 것이라고 생각하고 싶습니다.
 그들은 그럴 자격이 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4186.071s">[SPEAKER_07]</a>: 안녕하세요, 제 이름은 질 보웬입니다.
 저는 Bedford 공립학교의 학생 서비스 책임자입니다.
 저는 평생 거주자이자 직원입니다.
 올해로 베드포드에서의 31년차입니다.
 저는 교사, 그룹 리더, 평가자, 코디네이터 등 다양한 직책을 맡았으며 지금은 이 직책을 맡고 있습니다.
 저에게는 메드포드 공립학교를 졸업한 두 자녀가 있습니다.
 한 사람은 대학 진학을 선택하고, 다른 사람은 진로를 선택합니다.
 그래서 저는 이 새로운 고등학교의 비전과 그것이 Medford와 우리 학생들에게 무엇을 제공할 수 있는지, 그리고 Laurie가 말한 모든 학생들의 형평성과 접근성 보장에 대해 구축할 수 있는 것을 보고 매우 기뻤습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4224.405s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 안녕하세요, 제 이름은 수잔 카루치입니다.
 올해로 스물일곱 살이에요.
 그래서 저는 학교 3개월에 태어나고 자랐습니다.
 저는 더 이상 여기에 살지 않습니다. 하지만 저는 평생 이곳에서 살았습니다.
 저는 교감, 교장, 초등학교 조교로 시작하여 현재는 Brooks 교육 및 건축부 교감입니다.
 Martha의 기사와 마찬가지로 저는 여러분 모두와 함께 학교 교육에 참여하게 되어 기쁩니다.
 메리를 찾아오는 사람들은 모두 이 이야기를 하는 것 같아요.
 아시다시피 저희 아버지는 K동에서 8동까지의 프로젝트 관리자였습니다.
 그래서 그 두 가지를 조금은 경험한 것 같지만 운이 좋았던 것 같아요.
 2001년 McGlynn New School의 교사로서 저는 교사로서 그리고 새 학교의 일부로서 이 과정이 전개되는 것을 지켜보는 즐거움을 누렸습니다.
 따라서 저에게 정말 중요한 것은 교사, 학생, 가족 및 지역 사회에 영향을 미칠 중요한 결정에서 우리 모두가 수행하는 중요한 역할이라고 생각합니다.
 이것을 진지하게 받아들이십시오.
 저는 팀의 일원이 되어 모든 사람과 함께 일할 수 있는 기회를 갖게 된 것을 영광으로 생각합니다.</p>

 រាត្រីសួស្តី Marissa Parkinson ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​កើត​នៅ​ផ្លូវ​ដដែល​ក្នុង​ទីក្រុង Lawrence។
 គ្រួសារខ្ញុំ និងម្តាយរបស់ខ្ញុំនៅតែនៅទីនេះ តាមផ្លូវ West Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំបានចាប់ផ្តើមសិក្សានៅ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំបានចាប់ផ្តើមសិក្សានៅសាលា Harvey ។
 ខ្ញុំបានដើរផ្លូវផ្សេង។
 ខ្ញុំបានបញ្ចប់នៅ S.
 រ៉េ និង ខេធី។
 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នកកាន់សាសនាកាតូលិក ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការនៅ Johnny's Food Master នៅ Westlake ។
 ឧទ្យាន Duggar គឺជាឧទ្យានក្នុងស្រុករបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំស្រលាញ់សាលា។
 ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់កុមារ។
 ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់ការអប់រំ។
 ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការក្នុងវិស័យអប់រំអស់រយៈពេល 30 ឆ្នាំ។
 វាគួរឱ្យខ្លាចណាស់ព្រោះខ្ញុំមានអាយុប្រហែល 29 ឆ្នាំនៅពេលនោះ។
 នេះជាចម្លើយដែលខ្ញុំចូលចិត្ត។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​កែ​សម្រួល។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំរំភើបចំពោះអត្ថន័យរបស់វា៖ ការកសាងវិទ្យាល័យថ្មីមួយសម្រាប់ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថានៅពេលដែលអគារនេះត្រូវបានសាងសង់ វាដូចជាអ្នកដឹងទេ ប្រហែលជាដូចជា Taj Mahal។
 វាជាសាលាដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាត។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ ជាង 50 ឆ្នាំក្រោយ យើងត្រូវការអ្វីថ្មី។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាសិស្សរបស់យើងសមនឹងទទួលបានវា។
 យើងមានកម្មវិធីអាជីពដ៏អស្ចារ្យ។
 យើងមានកម្មវិធីសិក្សាដ៏អស្ចារ្យ ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងអគារចាស់ណាស់។
 យើងមានគម្រោង Curtis House ដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាតដែលមានទីតាំងនៅកន្លែងផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងផ្តល់ជូននូវការអប់រំកុមារតូច និងកម្មវិធីកុមារតូចដ៏អស្ចារ្យសម្រាប់បុគ្គលិករបស់យើងនៅទីនេះ។
 យើងមានសំណាងណាស់ដែលមានរបស់ទាំងនេះនៅ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា Medford គឺជាត្បូងតូចមួយ។
 ការមានសាលាបឋមសិក្សាថ្មីនឹងផ្តល់អត្ថប្រយោជន៍យ៉ាងច្រើនដល់សិស្ស សហគមន៍របស់យើង និងអនាគតនៃសហគមន៍របស់យើង (សហគមន៍ទាំងមូល)។
 ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ក្លាយ​ជា​ផ្នែក​មួយ​នៃ​ដំណើរការ និង​ធ្វើ​ការ​ជាមួយ​មនុស្ស​នៅ​ទីនោះ ហើយ​ឆ្លងកាត់​បទពិសោធន៍​ផ្សេង​ៗ​របស់​ខ្ញុំ។
 បន្ថែមសំឡេងរបស់ខ្ញុំទៅសំឡេងទាំងអស់នៅទីនេះ។
 សម្រាប់អភិបាលក្រុង និងក្រុមប្រឹក្សាលោក Graham ដែលនឹងចូលទៅក្នុងក្រុមប្រឹក្សានៃ 25 នេះ មានបេក្ខជនដែលមានលក្ខណៈសម្បត្តិគ្រប់គ្រាន់ជាច្រើន ដូចជាវិស្វករម្នាក់ វិស្វករម្នាក់ទៀត ស្ថាបត្យករផ្សេងទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែដើម្បីទៅដល់ក្រុមមនុស្សនេះ
 មនុស្សអស្ចារ្យ ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាដឹងគុណណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំចង់អរគុណលូកា ដែលបានចាប់ផ្តើមដំណើរការនេះជាមួយយើងកាលពីពីរឆ្នាំមុន ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថា អ្នកដឹងទេថា រក្សាវាឱ្យដំណើរការ និងគ្រប់គ្រងវាបាន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំទន្ទឹងរង់ចាំដំណើរការនេះ ហើយខ្ញុំពិតជាសង្ឃឹមថាយើងនៅតែមានភាពវិជ្ជមាន និងសុទិដ្ឋិនិយមចំពោះអ្វីដែលនឹងកើតឡើង។
 សមាជិក Ramjani ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកនឹងមានឆន្ទៈក្នុងការចែករំលែកព័ត៌មានអំពីតម្រងជាមួយពួកគេ។
 តើអ្នកចាប់បានអ្វី ហើយគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ប៉ុណ្ណា?
 វានឹងកាន់តែរំភើបនៅពេលដែលក្រុមដែលនៅសល់ទទួលបានបទពិសោធន៍ស្រដៀងគ្នា។</p>

 មកដល់ពេលនេះ ហើយតើយើងនៅឯណា?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយអំពីរឿងនេះបន្តិច។

 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សារឿងនេះនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ពេត្រុស វាជាការប្រសើរជាងប្រសិនបើអ្នកអាចនិយាយជាមួយខ្ញុំអំពីសុន្ទរកថានេះ។
 មិនអីទេ
 អ្នកអាចរំលងទំព័រជាក់លាក់។
 ព្យួរនៅទីនោះសម្រាប់មួយផ្សេងទៀត។
 តោះចាប់ផ្តើម។
 យើងបានចាប់ផ្តើមនៅក្នុងខែកុម្ភៈ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកនៅក្នុងខែធ្នូ MSBA បានអញ្ជើញយើងឱ្យចូលរួមក្នុងវគ្គជម្រុះ។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សាអំពីអត្ថន័យនៃវគ្គជម្រុះក្នុងរយៈពេលពីរបីនាទីទៀត។
 នេះ​ជា​ការ​អញ្ជើញ៖ យើង​សូម​អញ្ជើញ​អ្នក​ឱ្យ​ចូល​រួម​ក្នុង​ដំណើរ​ការ​នេះ​ចាប់​ពី​ថ្ងៃ​ទី 1 ខែ​ឧសភា។

 ទោះជាយ៉ាងនេះក្តី គណៈកម្មាធិការបានតែងតាំងខ្ញុំជាប្រធានគណៈកម្មាធិការសាងសង់កាលពីខែកុម្ភៈ ហើយរហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះ បានធ្វើច្រើនហើយ។
 រឿងមួយដែលយើងត្រូវធ្វើគឺស្វែងរកពួកគេទាំងអស់គ្នាមែនទេ?

 តើយើងគួរធ្វើអ្វីបន្ទាប់ទៀត?
 ប្រាំទៅប្រាំពីរឆ្នាំ។

 នេះមានន័យថាយើងយកចិត្តទុកដាក់យ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះមុខងារ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​ចង់​ដឹង​ថា​តើ​កន្លែង​ទាំងនេះ​ស័ក្តិសម​សម្រាប់​សិស្ស​និង​គ្រូ​នៅ​ក្នុង​អគារ​ដែរ​ឬ​ទេ?

 នៅពេលនោះ។
 នេះគឺជាកិច្ចការដ៏លំបាកមួយ។
 ល្បឿន​លឿន​បំផុត​តែង​តែ​វាស់​ជា​ឆ្នាំ​មិន​មែន​ខែ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅក្នុងបរិបទនៃការបង្កើតគណៈកម្មាធិការនេះ ដរាបណាខ្ញុំត្រូវបានតែងតាំងជាប្រធាន យើងបានបើកការអំពាវនាវសម្រាប់កម្មវិធី យើងចាប់ផ្តើមប្រមូលពាក្យសុំ ហើយពួកគេទាំងអស់នៅទីនោះ។
 ទោះជាយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ វានៅតែមានការងារជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវធ្វើក្នុងដំណាក់កាលជម្រុះដែលយើងកំពុងចាប់ផ្តើម។
 យើងនឹងពិភាក្សារឿងនេះនៅពេលក្រោយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកអាចបន្តទៅស្លាយបន្ទាប់។
 ក្រាហ្វិកគឺអន់ណាស់ ហើយមិនត្រូវបានរុករកបានល្អនៅលើគេហទំព័រទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលដែលវាមកដល់ដំណើរការទាំងមូល យើងនៅតែមានពេលប្រាំមួយម៉ោងទៀតនៃការ unboxing ។
 នៅថ្ងៃទី 1 ខែឧសភា យើងនឹងបញ្ចូលរយៈពេលនៃការទទួលបានសិទ្ធិនេះនៅក្នុងប្រអប់។
 នៅដំណាក់កាលនីមួយៗនៃដំណើរការ។
 យើងត្រូវតែត្រូវបានអនុម័តដោយ MSBA ដើម្បីបំពេញតាមតម្រូវការទាំងអស់សម្រាប់រយៈពេលនេះ។
 ត្រូវតែមានក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលដែលអាចបោះឆ្នោតដើម្បីអញ្ជើញយើងឱ្យបោះជំហានបន្ទាប់។
 ដូច្នេះ នៅចំណុចណាមួយក្នុងដំណើរការនេះ MSBA អាចនិយាយបានថាពួកគេមិនទាន់ត្រៀមខ្លួនរួចជាស្រេចដើម្បីឆ្ពោះទៅមុខនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេក៏អាចនិយាយថា៖ យើងមិនចូលចិត្តអ្វីដែលអ្នកកំពុងធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ពួកគេក៏អាចនិយាយថា បំភ្លេចវាចោល។
 ដូច្នេះ​ការងារ​របស់​យើង​គឺ​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​រឿង​ទាំង​នេះ​មិន​កើត​ឡើង។
 ការងាររបស់យើងគឺដើម្បីកម្រិតទីលានលេង រីកចម្រើនរួម និងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខឱ្យបានលឿនតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ផ្តល់ឱកាសដល់ MSBA ព្រោះយើងនឹងត្រៀមខ្លួនរួចជាស្រេចដើម្បីទទួលយកពួកគេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=4849.904s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 但这个资格期限持续 270 天。
 因此，到一月份我们必须完成资格阶段。
 我将谈谈这个阶段发生的事情。
 简而言之，除了资格阶段之外，当我们谈论建立项目团队时，这意味着引入我们所有者的项目经理。
 然后我们继续进行可行性研究。
 当人们想到我们在这个委员会所做的事情时，他们认为我们现在正在进行可行性研究。
 你认为我们正在做决定，我们正在建设吗？
 我们要更新吗？
 我们在哪里建设？
 你在场上吗？
 你在停车场吗？
 这将如何运作？
 我们还没有达到那个程度。
 所以告诉你所有的朋友，我们将到达那里并与专业人士合作。
 帮助我们对这座大楼需要做的事情进行评估。
 然后我们将继续进行方案设计，为项目融资。
 这就是我们作为社区投票资助该项目的地方。
 我无法强调它的重要性，但在实现这一目标之前我们还有很多工作要做。
 当这种情况发生时，我们将进入详细设计。
 所以我们把铲子放在地上。
 然后，在未来的某个时候，我们将完成该项目。
 所以这有点像坚果汤。
 我的目标是让我们一步步前进。
 我们将采取一切必要措施来满足资格期限。
 然后我们将继续前进。
 当我们接近下一阶段时，我们将开始讨论如何加快工作速度。
 但目前，我们的重点是资格。
 如果您可以翻到下一页，
 资格流程有自己的图表，您无法查看。
 因此，请继续观看下一张幻灯片。
 出色地。
 所以这个阶段需要做五件事。
 一是初步合规认证。
 这是一项法律协议，要求该市遵守 MSBA 流程。
 该协议已签署并交付给 MSBA。
 我们提前一天，我会承认这一点。
 谢谢市长和警长。
 我们正在路上。
 第二，我们必须组建建筑委员会。
 你们都在这里。
 学校委员会原定于 5 月 1 日开会，但现在是 4 月 30 日。
 我们做到了。
 该表格将很快发送至 MSBA。
 所以我们正在努力，并将很快发货。
 显然这是最简单的部分。
 这是文书工作。
 整个资格阶段涉及大量文书工作，但这是最简单的，我们会做并完成它。
 MSBA 必须批准我们的委员会。
 我们满足所有要求，因此 MSBA 对我们委员会的成员提出了各种各样的要求。
 我们与大家一起满足所有这些要求。
 现在让我们深入实际工作。
 还有三件事需要发生。
 其中之一就是所谓的教育背景。
 这是一份示范文件，它要求我们说：今天这座建筑里发生了什么？
 有多少间教室？
 有多少间数学教室？
 有多少临时空间？
 你们的剧院有多大？
 所有这些，对吗？
 这就是为什么他要求你描述这座大楼里目前正在发生的事情。
 它还要求您描述您对这座建筑未来的设想。
 因此，这就是关于柯蒂斯·塔夫茨的这些对话，这些关于幼儿期的对话变得非常非常重要。
 因为在我们的利益申报和资格阶段之间，教育背景将为所有建筑专业人员如何实际完成工作定下基调。
 因此，这将确定实现此构建所需的工作范围。
 所以在这个过程中现在已经做了很多工作。
 自二月份以来，我一直在与管理团队会面。
 我们每周见几次面。
 他们已经厌倦了我。
 他会厌倦我的。
 但我们开始做的一件事是：我们可以消除什么？
 这就是为什么该文件在以下方面写得很好：
 我们在这座大楼里做什么？
 所有教室都被统计在内。
 所有计划均已概述。
 就今天发生的事情而言，政府还有更多工作要做，才能准确描述这一点。
 另一件显然要复杂得多的事情是谈论我们将来要在这座大楼里做什么。
 因此，在这次谈话中，我们再次进行了非常广泛的谈话。
 我们一直在利用大脑的战略规划部分来提出重大问题。
 我将借用柯蒂斯·塔夫茨一分钟。
 我们已经讨论过我们的教育工作者是否认为这是我们应该考虑的事情，答案是肯定的，他们说是的，我们应该考虑一下。
 然后我们开始说：“好吧，那会是什么样子？”
 要求是。
 所以我们开始了这次对话，但这次对话超出了该委员会可以分析的范围，因为它有点涉及学校委员会的职责。
 因此，昨晚我提出了一项决议，要求我们的特殊教育和行为健康小组委员会（实际上由卢梭成员担任主席）在非常紧张的时间内举行会议，以收集意见和评论。
 关于这个非常有限的话题。
 柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学位于该校区对就读于柯蒂斯-塔夫茨大学的学生的教育成果是否有任何好处？
 昨晚还有另一位梅德福居民发表了讲话。
 他在萨默维尔开展了一个非常类似的项目。
 他谈到了萨默维尔刚刚发生的这一转变以及它如何导致人口爆炸。
 对于那些需要另类环境的学生来说，它改变了游戏规则，让他们可以参加运动队等活动，在我们的例子中，是职业项目。
 所以这是一个巨大的机会，但是
 我们希望确保社区和委员会有机会思考他们可以贡献的一切并向该委员会提供建议。
 昨晚，这一情况已正式传达给特殊教育小组委员会。
 他们会见面的。
 他们将邀请现任员工、现任学生、校友、
 社区成员等，以及来自萨默维尔的 Jack Hevery 进行讨论并解决这个问题，并提出建议，让他们步入正轨并在 6 月中旬回来，这样他们还有很多工作要做，但这将帮助我们了解情况。
 我们对这所学校的想象的那一部分的写作。
 因为我们可能需要的不仅仅是大楼某处的几间教室。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨大学的成功部分在于其环境与拥有 1,200 名学生的庞大校园有很大不同。
 因此，我们必须仔细考虑如何将其组合在一起，但我们希望小组委员会所做的工作能够回到我们身边并得到传达。
 玛塔和查德将参加未来几周即将举行的学校委员会会议，玛塔将谈论她对替代方案的一些想法，以及这一切可能会是什么样子，即使是在短期内。
 这是必须纳入的内容。
 琼、苏珊娜、保罗和我昨天谈论了幼儿教育。
 我们的小学已经人满为患。
 我们将不得不在某个时候处理这​​个问题。
 MEEP 曾经在这里举办。
 我们将探讨一个案例，该案例表明 MEAP 应该回到这里，这可能是也可能不是我们着陆的地方，但这是我们正在探索的事情，因为现在是时候了。
 我们还谈论了很多关于没有接受过学前教育的学生以及他们何时进入我们公立学校的问题。
 对于这些学生来说，入学是多么具有挑战性。
 我们还讨论诸如等待名单有多大之类的问题？
 有多少来到我们这里的学生从未接触过任何类型的学前环境？
 我们需要什么样的能力来从这座大楼提供更广泛、更全面的幼儿教育项目？
 因为所有这些都必须包含在本文档中。
 所以，我们正在努力解决这个问题。
 因此，在这些事情发生的同时，到目前为止，在这个教育概况上已经做了很多工作。
 我们尚未涉及的教育概况的重要部分是沟通策略。
 我稍后会讨论这个问题。
 但在教育方面，我们的教育工作者必须做很多工作才能准备这份文件。
 我只是想让每个人都知道一切都在进行中。
 当我们进入下一次会议时，我们将展示这些文件，以便我们可以开始更广泛地阅读这些文件，寻求建议，并确保我们真正从各个角度考虑我们需要描述的内容。
 这就是我认为你们都发挥着非常重要作用的地方：
 我认为有必要根据我所知道的或基于我们对艺术项目或职业项目等的愿景，稍微不同地描述我们在这里所做的事情。
 这就是我们在教育概况中所处的位置。
 柯蒂斯·塔夫茨 (Curtis Tufts) 担任小组委员会成员。
 另一个重大的、创新的、不断变化的主题是 MEAP。
 MSBA 描述的社区中经常发生延误的原因是，他们必须做出有助于施工过程的非常重要的决定。
 我们可以合并两所学校吗？
 这显然有它自己的能量和它自己的一套要求，这使得它很难实现
 快点行动吧。
 因此，我们试图从大处着眼，因为这是一个独特的机会，可以以非常全面的方式思考该学区的真正需求，同时也可以尽快向前推进。
 因此，所有这些工作都正在进行中，并尽快向前推进。
 彼得，你可以转到下一张幻灯片吗？
 在专业方面也非常类似，因为我们有一个非常活跃的专业学校，所以我们还有另一个文件需要完成，那就是生存能力的第74章。
 第七十四章是专业设置条例的一章吧？
 出色地。
 这篇文章正在进行中。
 我们必须告诉他们，这是我们的计划。
 这是这些程序的功能。
 这是我们当前的注册和信息，例如我们的等候名单。
 我们还有机会描述这些计划的扩展计划。
 查德和彼得将在学校委员会中讨论扩张的潜力。
 这是学校委员会的问题，因为扩大的项目需要的不仅仅是一座建筑。
 需要设备。
 需要工作人员。
 因此，学校委员会必须对此进行评估。
 因此，该报告将于 5 月 20 日提交给学校委员会，并将有助于第 70 章表格的最终确定。
 这个小组也会仔细阅读并做好准备。
 本周晚些时候，市长、总监和我将与 MSBA 讨论这一难题，这实际上是城市规划信息。
 然后我们可以开始将信息输入到他们所谓的登记研究中。
 这有助于确定建筑物的大小。
 您可能已经听说过很多关于这座大楼是如何为 4,000 名学生建造的，但现在只有 1,200 名学生。
 4000到底是不是这个数字我不知道，但确实数字不一样。
 因此，MSBA 在资格阶段要做的事情之一就是，让我们为这么多学生建造一座大楼。
 这通常与今天大楼里发生的事情类似。
 然而，如果该市计划在开发中的住房方面进行重大扩张，他们会想知道所有这些。
 所以他们可以调整建筑物的大小，因为他们不希望我们建造一座立即耗尽容量的建筑物。
 他们也不希望我们建造一座永远不会住满的建筑。
 好的。
 所以，这是那里正在进行的工作的一部分。
 第四件事，维修文件。
 我们必须填写一份调查问卷，概述我们在整个地区的所有维护实践。
 所以这就像：他被重新投入使用了吗？
 你们的团队是如何训练的？
 大约有20个变量。
 该文件也处于起草阶段，正在尽快推进。
 我们可能会稍后在六月份讨论这个问题。
 考虑到我们已完成资格，我们需要做的最后一件事是确定可行性研究的资金，该资金可能在二十五万到二百五十万美元之间。
 我们还没有准备好，但我们正在制定计划。
 市长和我正在从财务工作组的角度制定该计划，以便能够根据需要尽快核算和管理这笔资金。
 对流程有疑问吗？</p>

 ទាក់ទងនឹងលទ្ធភាព ប្រភពមូលនិធិនេះត្រូវតែគ្របដណ្តប់លើការចំណាយទាំងមូលនៃការសិក្សាលទ្ធភាព មិនមែនគម្រោងទាំងមូលទេ ប៉ុន្តែមានតែការសិក្សាលទ្ធភាពប៉ុណ្ណោះ ដែលស្មើនឹងពីរទៅពីរលានកន្លះ។
 ទីក្រុងនឹងបង់ថ្លៃសិក្សាលទ្ធភាពទាំងអស់ជាមុន។
 បន្ទាប់មក នៅពេលដែល MSBA បញ្ជាក់អត្រាសងត្រលប់គម្រោងរបស់យើង ហើយយើងទទួលបានជោគជ័យពេញមួយដំណើរការ របាយការណ៍សិក្សាលទ្ធភាពនឹងត្រូវបានសងវិញតាមភាគរយដែលបានបែងចែកឱ្យយើង។
 ដូច្នេះ​ពួកគេ​នឹង​ប្រើ​រូបមន្ត​ដូចគ្នា ហើយ​ទាមទារ​ឱ្យ​មាន​ការ​សិក្សា​ពី​លទ្ធភាព និង​ការ​ទូទាត់​សង​ទៅ​ទីក្រុង។
 ប៉ុន្តែទីក្រុងត្រូវតែដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាប្រាក់។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីដែលត្រូវកើតឡើងនៅទីនេះគឺ
 យើង​មាន​គម្រោង​ផ្តល់​ថវិកា​ដល់​វា។
 ត្រូវហើយ យើងគួរមានចិត្តល្អ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​កិច្ចការ​នេះ​បាន​ល្អ ហើយ​វា​ត្រូវ​ការ​បោះឆ្នោត​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សា​ក្រុង​ដើម្បី​អនុញ្ញាត​មូលនិធិ​ទាំង​នោះ ហើយ​ដាក់​វា​នៅ​កន្លែង​ដែល​យើង​អាច​ប្រើ​វា។
 ប៉ុន្តែ
 ដូច​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​បាន​លើក​ឡើង​នេះ អ្វីៗ​ទាំង​អស់​នឹង​ត្រូវ​បញ្ចប់​នៅ​ខែ​មករា។
 នីមួយៗមានថ្ងៃកំណត់ជាក់លាក់មួយភ្ជាប់ជាមួយវា។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​ប្រាប់​ពួកគេ​ក្នុង​វិធី​វិជ្ជមាន​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​ធ្វើ​រឿង​ទាំង​អស់​នេះ​មុន​ពេល​សាលា​ចាប់​ផ្ដើម​ឆ្នាំ​ក្រោយ។
 ប្រសិនបើអាចធ្វើបាន ខ្ញុំចង់ឱ្យអ្វីៗទាំងអស់ត្រូវបញ្ចប់ត្រឹមថ្ងៃទី 30 ខែមិថុនា។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងតែងតែឈរជាមួយគ្នា ប្រឹងប្រែង និងខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជា​ការ​សំខាន់​ក្នុង​ការ​ពង្រីក​ខ្លួន​អ្នក​។
 ដូច្នេះ​ត្រូវ​តានតឹង​ហើយ​រៀបចំ​ខ្លួន។
 MSBA មានការងារជាច្រើនដែលត្រូវធ្វើទាក់ទងនឹងការទទួលស្គាល់កម្មវិធីត្រៀមចូលមហាវិទ្យាល័យ និងអ្វីៗផ្សេងទៀត។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងអាចផ្តល់ឱ្យពួកគេនូវអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលពួកគេត្រូវការ ដូច្នេះយើងអាចបន្តទៅដំណាក់កាលបន្ទាប់ឱ្យបានឆាប់តាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាន។
 តើអ្នកមានសំណួរអំពីផែនការទេ?
 ល្អឥតខ្ចោះ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងនៅសល់តែ 20 នាទីប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ដល់ទីបញ្ចប់នោះ យើងបានរួមបញ្ចូលការប្រជុំអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការនាពេលខាងមុខជាបន្តបន្ទាប់នៅចុងបញ្ចប់នៃរបៀបវារៈ។
 មានរឿងពីរដែលខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងពិចារណា និងផ្តល់អាទិភាពនៅពេលយើងឈានទៅមុខជាមួយដំណាក់កាលទីមួយនេះ។
 មួយក្នុងចំណោមពួកគេគឺ គណៈកម្មាធិការទំនាក់ទំនង និងការចូលរួមសហគមន៍។
 ខ្ញុំចង់បានអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការមួយចំនួន មិនលើសពីប្រាំពីររូបទេ ប៉ុន្តែជាក្រុមចំណាប់អារម្មណ៍ដែលជួបប្រជុំគ្នាជាអនុគណៈកម្មការដែលពិតជាអាចគូសបញ្ជាក់ និងពណ៌នាអំពីដំណើរការចូលរួមសហគមន៍របស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា យើង​ទាំង​អស់​គ្នា​ឃើញ​ពី​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​របស់​មនុស្ស​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍៖ តើ Medford នឹង​ដោះស្រាយ​បញ្ហា​នេះ​ទេ?
 តើនេះនឹងដំណើរការទេ?
 តើរឿងនេះនឹងកើតឡើងទេ?
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកត្រូវបង្កើតទំនាក់ទំនងជាច្រើននៅក្នុងសហគមន៍។
 កាលណា​យើង​ចាប់​ផ្តើម​មុន នោះ​យើង​នឹង​ទទួល​បាន​ជោគជ័យ​កាន់​តែ​ខ្លាំង​នៅ​ទី​បញ្ចប់។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​ជា​ការ​សន្ទនា​ទូលំទូលាយ​ជាង​នេះ​ព្រោះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​យើង​មាន​ក្រុមប្រឹក្សា​និង​គណៈកម្មការ​មួយ​ចំនួន​ផង​ដែរ។
 ពួកគេជាច្រើនចាប់អារម្មណ៍លើគម្រោងនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះ ទំនាក់ទំនងមួយចំនួនត្រូវធ្វើឡើង ដើម្បីស្វែងយល់ពីពេលណា និងរបៀបដែលពួកគេពាក់ព័ន្ធ ដូច្នេះយើងអាចបញ្ចូលវាទៅក្នុងផែនការមេដែលនឹងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ។
 ក្រុមទី 2 ដែលខ្ញុំចង់បង្កើតនៅយប់នេះគឺ គណៈកម្មាធិការច្បាប់ និងសាជីវកម្ម។
 ដូចដែល Janelle បាននិយាយ យើងត្រូវតែមានច្បាប់មួយចំនួនអំពីរបៀបដែលវាដំណើរការ ជាពិសេសនៅក្នុងការចូលរួមជាសាធារណៈ ប៉ុន្តែជាទូទៅ។
 ខ្ញុំ​សង្ឃឹម​ថា គណៈកម្មាធិការ​នេះ​នឹង​ត្រូវ​កំណត់​ក្នុង​ពេល​វេលា។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាអ្នកអាចជួបម្តងទៀត ហើយនាំយកសេចក្តីព្រាងទៅក្រុមនេះ ដើម្បីយើងអាចអនុវត្តបទប្បញ្ញត្តិ និងគ្រប់គ្រងពីទីនោះ។
 ហើយ​គណៈកម្មការ​ទី​៣​នឹង​មិន​ជួប​គ្នា​ឆាប់ៗ​នេះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​នឹង​ជួប​។
 អ្នកដឹងទេថានឹងមានអនុគណៈកម្មាធិការហិរញ្ញវត្ថុនៅចុងខែមិថុនា ដូច្នេះនេះនឹងក្លាយជាគណៈកម្មាធិការអចិន្ត្រៃយ៍ដែលនឹងប្រជុំពេញមួយជីវិតនៃគម្រោង និងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ។
 វាជាការសំខាន់ដែលត្រូវចងចាំថា នៅពេលដែលពេលវេលាមកដល់ សហគមន៍នឹងត្រូវបោះឆ្នោត។
 គណៈកម្មាធិការនេះមិនមែនជាកន្លែងសម្រាប់ធ្វើការងារនេះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីការលើកលែងបំណុលដែលចាំបាច់បំផុតដើម្បីផ្តល់មូលនិធិដល់គម្រោងនោះ គណៈកម្មាធិការនេះមិនគួរយល់ព្រមលើការលើកលែងបំណុលនោះទេ។
 តាមពិតទៅ វាមិនអាចកើតឡើងនៅទីនេះទេ។
 វាត្រូវតែកើតឡើងនៅខាងក្រៅក្រុមនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះ គណៈកម្មាធិការហិរញ្ញវត្ថុនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាជាទស្សនវិស័យ និងការយល់ដឹងអំពីរឿងដូចជា
 លទ្ធកម្ម, លទ្ធកម្មពីអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងគម្រោងរបស់ម្ចាស់, ស្ថាបត្យកររបស់យើង, អ្វីៗដូចនោះ។
 ហើយជួយយើងឱ្យយល់ពីអ្វីដែលយើងត្រូវការដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវលទ្ធភាពជោគជ័យ?
 តើមានការចំណាយផ្សេងទៀតដែលយើងគួរពិចារណាដែរឬទេ?
 ដូច្នេះ​មាន​ការងារ​ហិរញ្ញវត្ថុ​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ធ្វើ ទោះ​បី​ជា​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​រំពឹង​ថា​កិច្ច​ប្រជុំ​ក្រុម​នឹង​ធ្វើ​ឡើង​រហូត​ដល់​ចុង​ខែ​ឧសភា​ក៏​ដោយ។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​នឹង​និយាយ​បន្ថែម​ទៀត​អំពី​ច្បាប់​បញ្ជា​របស់ Robert និង​អ្វី​ៗ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ប្រជុំ​បន្ទាប់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថា គ្រប់គ្នាសម្លឹងមកខ្ញុំ ដូចឈប់និយាយអញ្ចឹង។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចាប់អារម្មណ៍នោះគឺថាតើមាននរណាម្នាក់ឮអំពីប្រធានបទទាំងនេះ ហើយនិយាយថាខ្ញុំពិតជាចង់ចូលរួមដែរឬទេ
 តើ​អ្នក​អាច​រក​ឃើញ​អនុគណៈកម្មការ​មួយ​ក្នុង​ចំណោម​អនុគណៈកម្មការ​ទាំង​នេះ​ទេ?

 그렇죠
 나는 모든 위원회에 참여할 계획이지만 이것이 옳은 일입니다.
 아마도 우리는 Emily Lazzaro를 법률 및 화해 소위원회에 초대할 수 있을 것입니다.
 그러면 제가 그와 상의하겠습니다.
 저는 또한 Nicole Morrell을 커뮤니케이션 소위원회에 초대했습니다.
 그러니 그들과 이야기하십시오.
 하지만 이것에 대해 강한 감정을 갖고 있는 사람이 또 있나요?

 아, 물론이죠.
 내 생각에는 모든 코치들이 이미 팀에 있다고 생각한다.
 이에 대해 알아보기 전에 기업가들에게 제안을 제공할 전문가 패널이 있을 것입니다.
 이것은 내 경험이 아닙니다.
 그것이 내가 여기 있는 이유가 아닙니다.
 따라서 시간이 지남에 따라 사람들에게 의지하여 소위원회를 만들 것입니다.
 개인적인 관점에서는 여기서부터 시작해야 한다고 생각합니다.
 이것이 말이 되나요?
 가까운 장래에 무엇을 해야 할지에 대한 다른 제안이 있는 사람이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6276.969s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 질문이 있습니다.
 틀림없이.
 커티스가 여기 와서 이곳을 다양한 방법으로 활용할 수 있다고 했잖아요.
 누가 이러한 옵션을 찾고 있습니까?
 일반 교육과 마찬가지로, 성인 교육을 제공하는 Associated General Contractors AGC에서 하고 싶은 것처럼 야간 수업을 들으면서 커뮤니티 칼리지에서 일하는 것이 가능합니다.
 누구든지 이것을 좋아합니까?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6314.487s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 예, 다소간, 다소간, 하지만 완전히는 아닙니다.
 우리는 아직 거기에 있지 않습니다.
 그래서 74장의 첫 번째 미스터리를 본 후에 추가하는 것이 타당하다고 생각합니다.
 따라서 우리가 이 문서를 읽기 시작하면 이제 다음과 같이 말할 때가 된 것 같습니다. 또 누구를 경계해야 합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6334.376s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 이 모든 것에는 결과가 따르기 때문입니다.

 그렇다면 이 위원회에 디지털 인프라를 누가 제공할 것인지 묻고 싶습니다.
 그럼 SDI에 대해 이야기하겠습니다.
 거기 내 댐이 있어요.
 Fed.SOI는 연구를 수행합니다.
 아직 공개되지 않았지만 공개되어야 하는 다른 공개 문서가 있을 수 있습니다.
 아시다시피 공보소위원회는 다음과 같은 업무를 담당합니다.
 동일한 내용을 많은 사람들에게 전달할 수 있으며, 웹사이트(아마도 공유 저장소를 통해)를 통해 이를 수행하는 것이 가장 효율적이며 외부 커뮤니케이션도 전적으로 가능합니다.
 예를 들어, 학교와 같은 웹사이트와 같은 포털에서는 모든 사람이 이러한 프로젝트를 갖고 있고 Sheldon이 SOI에서 볼 수 있는 일종의 내부 데이터베이스가 있습니다.
 로그인 목록의 회원은 언제든지 사용할 수 있습니다.
 틀림없이.
 필요한 것은 자원뿐입니다.
 업데이트된 정보를 알려드릴 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6440.413s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 우리는 그것을 가지고 있습니다.
 그래서 우리는 빌드에서 특별한 URL인 buildmhs.org를 얻었습니다.
 그래서?
 이상적인.
 따라서 URL이 존재합니다.
 이 페이지를 사용할 수 있습니다.
 실제로 토마스는 이 사회의 기본 자원 구조를 연구합니다.
 이력서나 사진을 제출하라고 하는 이유는 모두 사이트에 게시되기 때문인데, 그는 홍보 매니저로서 그 모든 것을 관리한다.
 Tom은 자신이 퇴임하는 커뮤니케이션 이사이더라도 우리가 후임자를 임명할 때까지 프로젝트에 계속 참여하기로 동의했습니다.
 그래서 저는 Thomas와 우리 직업 교육 학생들 중 일부가 Lisa Miller의 감독하에 이 웹사이트를 만들고 있다고 생각합니다.
 누군가가 어디에 있느냐고 물으면 대중에게 선보일 문서의 구성은 어떻게 될까요?
 우리는 당신에게 장소를 추천해 드릴 수 있습니다.
 우리의 모든 회의에는 회의록이 있을 것입니다.
 모든 회의의 의제가 거기에 있을 것입니다.
 그래서 우리는 그렇게 하기 위한 전체 구조를 가지고 있습니다.
 아직 준비가 되지 않았지만 다음 회의 때 만나길 바랍니다.
 웹사이트.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6511.848s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 음, 다음 단계는 문을 밀어내는 것입니다.
 허리는 어때요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6519.014s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 그러므로 이것은 어려운 질문입니다. 왜냐하면 집회의 법칙에 따르면 이것이 우리에게 끝이 아니기 때문입니다.
 일람표가 인쇄되면 해당 일람표에 포함된 모든 문서는 공공 기록의 일부가 됩니다.
 이렇게 하면, 뒤에서 그렇게 하면 모임의 규칙을 어길 수도 있다는 것이 어려운 점입니다.
 이런 방식으로 관리자는 정족수 없이 작업 중인 문서의 사본을 받고 계속 그렇게 할 수 있습니다.
 파일이 여기에 도착하면 공유 드라이브에 저장됩니다.
 파일 편집에 관해 말하자면, 이 플랫폼에는 오프라인 편집이 없습니다.
 법은 대규모 집회를 금지하고 있습니다.
 불행하게도 우리는 여기 앉아서 함께 파일을 편집합니다.
 이미 모두 알고 계시겠지만 이는 이 프로세스를 관리하는 데 있어 가장 고통스러운 부분입니다. 죄송합니다.
 하지만 네, 어렵습니다. 하지만 세계 다른 지역에서는 잘 작동하는 오프라인 편집은 여기서는 선택 사항이 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6591.263s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 음, Google 드라이브나 파일 공유는 없습니다.
 모든 것이 공개됩니다.
 인쇄되면 웹사이트에 표시됩니다.
 사이트에 나타나면 기본 구성 제어가 되며 여기에 변경 사항을 반영하지 않고는 변경할 수 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6606.908s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 정확히.
 네, 무섭습니다.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 정말 무섭습니다.
 우리는 그것을 할 수 있는 방법을 찾았습니다.
 무섭지는 않지만 안타깝게도 더 이상 무섭지 않습니다.
 이렇게 하면 커뮤니티가 파일 편집 방법을 이해하지 못하게 됩니다.
 그렇게 하면 Zoom 회의가 더욱 생산적이 될 것이라고 생각합니다.
 원하는 곳에 앉을 수 있으며 모든 사람이 파일이 변경되는 것을 볼 수 있으며 모양은 불가능합니다.
 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 공개하지 않고 문서를 편집한다는 아이디어.
 그러므로 우리는 이것을 조심해야 합니다.
 하지만 그렇습니다. 그것은 과정입니다.
 이 이상한 점은 GraphDoc에서 작동합니다.
 문서 인쇄에 작동하는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6663.247s">[Unidentified]</a>: 절대. 이것은 GraphDoc이 아닙니다.
 많은 분들이 일하고 계시다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 우리는 논쟁합니다.
 우리는 참여하는 단순한 젊은이들의 그룹입니다.
 이것은 정확합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6673.63s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 이것은 생각해 볼 문제입니다.
 응, 응.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6677.129s">[Unidentified]</a>: 지난 가을에 나는 사무실에 있는 모든 사람과 이야기를 나눴습니다.
 시대였습니다.
 그래서 우리는 오랫동안 전화를 걸었습니다.
 총 40명의 회원이 있습니다.
 한 참가자는 이렇게 말했습니다. “사이먼이 방금 문서에서 이 내용을 언급했고 거기에 있는 우리의 의견을 읽었습니다.
 기본적으로 우리는 그것을 결합했습니다.
 대답은 '아니요'입니다.
 그런 다음 리뷰를 작성할 수 있습니다.
 나는 당신이 일곱 살이라고 대답했습니다.
 받아들여도 괜찮다고 하더군요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6706.379s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 안에.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6707.037s">[Unidentified]</a>: 우리는 단지 느낀다.
 이것이 위험할 수 있다는 점에는 우리 모두 동의할 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6713.603s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 여기에 있어주셔서 다시 한번 감사드립니다.
 나는 또한 의사소통에 관심이 있어서 오늘 밤 일을 하지 않더라도 여전히 전화 통화를 즐깁니다.
 그들은 여기로 돌아올 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6728.575s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 모든 업데이트가 여기에 다시 표시됩니다.
 소위원회나 안건에 관해 다른 질문에 답변해주실 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6738.82s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: 선거에 관해 질문이 있습니다.
 글쎄요, 우리가 찬성표를 던지면 우리는 제가 전혀 이해하지 못했던 상황에 처하게 됩니다. 권력은 곧 권력입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6752.78s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 절대.
 아니요, 이는 사실이 아닙니다.
 당국이 회의에 참석하는 것이 허용됩니까?
 아니요, 귀하의 투표권을 다른 사람에게 줄 수는 없습니다.
 끝나면 투표소로 가겠습니다. 왜냐하면 우리는 선거를 완료해야 하기 때문입니다.
 이는 일반적으로 모두가 '예'라고 답한 후 이를 하루로 정하는 음성 투표에서 발생합니다.
 이렇게하려면 롤을 만드십시오.
 이상하고 이상하니 이쯤에서 끝내자.
 하지만 결론을 내리기 전에 어떤 질문이 더 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6789.224s">[Unidentified]</a>: 조심해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6792.005s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 하지만 이 위원회에 투표권이 없는 위원이 많다는 점도 주목할 가치가 있다고 생각합니다.
 우리가 당신의 의견을 듣고 싶지 않기 때문이 아닙니다.
 우리는 귀하의 의견을 듣고 싶어서 여기에 왔습니다.
 우리가 투표할 때 귀하의 이름은 사용되지 않으며 투표할 수도 없습니다.
 하지만 그 이상으로 당신은 이 위원회의 공식 회원입니다.
 그들은 나에게 경고했다
 너무 많은 회원이 투표하면 회의를 열고 업무를 수행하기 위해 정족수가 필요하기 때문에 업무 수행이 매우 어려워집니다.
 모든 것이 매우 복잡합니다.
 따라서 우리가 말하고자 하는 것은 훌륭한 위원회가 필요하지만 효율적이고 효과적으로 앞으로 나아갈 수 있어야 한다는 것입니다.
 이것이 바로 이유이다.
 우리는 거기서 무엇을 하고 있었나요?
 나는 커미션의 규모가 그의 생애 동안 실제로 변했다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6849.128s">[Tracy Keene]</a>: 그럼 25?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6850.469s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 예, 위원회에는 15명의 투표 회원이 있습니다. 이는 충분한 투표 회원 수입니다.
 우리는 곧 선거를 하게 될 것입니다.
 그런데 다음 회의에는 또 어떤 질문이 있나요?
 규칙 및 결론, 5월 7일.
 커뮤니티는 5월 8일에 합류하고 5월 13일에 결과를 팀에 반환할 예정입니다.
 따라서 5월 13일 회의에서 대다수는 이러한 권장 사항을 고려하고 이러한 계획을 승인할 것입니다.
 재부팅 모드에 있습니다.
 그런 다음 정부가 검토한 문서 중 일부를 연구하고 그 내용을 읽고 토론하기 시작합니다.
 그게 다입니다만 계속해 주세요.
 우리는 의제를 설정했습니다.
 합리적인 이유로 가능하다면 프로그램에서 직접 만날 것입니다. 가격은 89위안.
 지금부터 6월 말까지.
 다음 학년이 시작되는 월요일에 다시 오겠다고 약속했지만, 학교 위원회 회의와 방학 사이인 6월 말까지는 그 일정을 유지하는 것이 불가능합니다.
 여름 동안에는 Zoom을 통해서만 만날 예정이며 회의를 수요일로 옮길 예정입니다.
 여름에는 월요일과 금요일이기 때문에 정족수를 모으기가 어렵습니다.
 그렇게 할 수 있기를 바랍니다. 하지만 회의 일정을 가볍게 유지하려고 노력하고 있습니다.
 8월 말쯤 되면 소위원회가 더 많아질 것 같지만, 바쁜 일상을 정리하려는 분들에게는 이제 시작일 뿐입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6956.201s">[Unidentified]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 그래서 두 가지가 있습니다.
 그러나 이것은 간접적인 질문이다.
 그렇게 할 수 없다면,
 여러분의 생각과 아이디어를 보내주시면 여러분의 생각을 공유해 주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=6982.516s">[Richard Orlando]</a>: 이는 실제로 기술적인 문제입니다.
 회의에 참석할 수 없는 남성은 자신의 생각, 아이디어, 심지어는 해결책까지 이메일로 알려줄 것입니다.
 우리는 이메일이 의제 설정을 제외한 거의 모든 것에 좋지 않은 아이디어라는 것을 이미 들었습니다.
 이것은 회색 영역처럼 보일 수 있습니다.
 이 두 사람이 충돌했던 본회의를 놓치셨는지 궁금합니다.
 어떻게 작동하나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7012.305s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 그래서 나는 당신에게 말할 수 있습니다: 어떤 변호사라도 당신에게 아무것도 적지 말라고 말할 것이라고 생각합니다.
 이것이 우리가 시작할 곳입니다.
 아무것도 글로 쓰지 마세요.
 하지만, 뭔가를 쓰려고 한다면
 이 경우와 마찬가지로 이것은 회색 영역입니다.
 당신이 해야 할 일은 누군가에게 전화를 걸어 "내 아이디어를 보내도 될까요?"라고 말하는 것뿐입니다.
 이에 대해 다른 사람들에게 말했거나 할 계획입니까?
 닫힌 루프가 있는지 확인할 수 있습니다. 그렇죠?
 그렇게 말씀하셨는데요, 댓글을 보내도 될까요?
 나는 그렇다고 말했다.
 나는 이 문제에 대해 아무에게도 말하지 않을 테니 우리는 괜찮을 것이라고 말했습니다.
 다수 위원회를 대표하는 여러 사람을 상대하는 경우 이는 문제가 됩니다.
 예를 들어, 회의에 누가 참석할지 모르기 때문에 두 사람을 의미한다고 말하면 귀하는 8세 미만이므로 괜찮습니다.
 8명을 포함해 자신과 대화를 나눈 후 문제가 생겼습니다.
 그래서 당신은 회의를 열면 법을 위반하는 것입니다.
 문제는 모든 이해관계자가 대화 참가자와 동일한 이해를 가져야 한다는 것입니다.
 내가 무엇을 놓치고 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7088.205s">[Unidentified]</a>: 상자에 관한 기사에서 이것을 놓쳤습니다.
 당신은 매우 목표 지향적일 수 있습니다.
 계속 하라고 했잖아 하하
 그렇게 한다면, 법을 위반하지 않기 위해 무엇을 하든 우리 모두는 법을 위반하게 될 것입니다.
 나는 이것이 법을 준수하는 모든 시민에게 적용된다고 믿습니다.
 일련의 고려 사항은 내용도, 계획도, 보험도 중요하지 않습니다.
 우리 둘 밖에 없나요?
 당신은 그것을 남용하고 있습니다.
 나는 많은 규칙을 어겼습니다.
 그래도 모르겠어요.
 알았어, 알았어.
 예, 이것이 내 문제입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7130.348s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 모든 사람에게는 Medford 공립학교 이메일 주소가 제공되며, 어떤 경우에도 MSBA 관련 사업에 개인 이메일 주소를 사용하지 않을 것을 권장합니다.
 이러한 이메일을 설정하고 나면 모든 내용을 이전해 드리겠습니다.
 하지만 어떤 이유로든 개인 이메일을 사용하지 말 것을 권합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000851&t=7149.164s">[Unidentified]</a>: 이렇게 하면 공공 기록을 더 쉽게 준수할 수 있습니다.
 저는 지구 의회의 비서입니다.
 개인 성적을 제외하고 모든 공식 학교 기록은 공개되며 자동으로 이용 가능하거나 최소한 요청 시 볼 수 있어야 합니다.
 따라서 Medford 공립학교 이메일 주소, 메모할 수 있는 Medford 공립학교 Google 패키지를 사용하여 이 모든 작업을 수행할 수 있으며, 이 모든 것이 정보를 게시하는 데 정말 도움이 됩니다.
 이것을 다른 사람과 공유하지 마십시오.
 초안을 이메일로 보내지 마세요.
 이곳은 개인적인 발언을 하는 곳이 아닙니다.
 알았어
 우리는 이런 의미에서 누구도 포함하지 않습니다.
 물론 사실입니다.
 괜찮은</p>
