1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,292
Okay, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:04,212
This is the Medford Historical Commission.

3
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,333
Today is Monday, September 8th.

4
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:09,594
I'm going to call the meeting to order at 7.04.

5
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,275
I'll just read our little statement here.

6
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:20,957
Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

7
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:27,159
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,340
No in-person attendance of

00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:38,137

10
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,005
Um, okay.

11
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,667
We have a full agenda tonight, so we're going to get started.

12
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:50,151
Um, first up, we have a couple of demolition applications to receive commissioners.

13
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,192
We sent around links earlier.

14
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,893
Let's, uh, we'll go right down the agenda.

15
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:57,535
We're going to start with 41 mystic Avenue.

16
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:01,757
Uh, we have, uh, yes, Brian move to approve.

17
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:03,118
Okay.

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,039
Thank you.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,300
Thank you, Kit.

20
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:15,631
Okay, I will go around for a roll call vote as I see on my screen to approve the demolition application for 41 Mystic Avenue.

21
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:16,431
Ryan?

22
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:17,052
Yes.

23
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:18,292
Kit?

24
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:19,373
Yes.

25
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:20,434
Peter?

26
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:21,374
Yes.

27
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:22,415
Doug?

28
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:23,256
Yes.

29
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,498
Okay, motion is approved for zero.

30
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:31,541
The application is accepted and we will have a significance hearing next month.

31
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:34,323
Point of clarification.

32
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:35,625
Yes, Ryan.

33
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:40,326
Because of the timeline, we're having a meeting on October 6th.

34
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:42,587
Is that correct?

35
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:43,547
We are, yes.

36
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:57,951
October 6th, because the following Monday, or because of the Indigenous Peoples Holiday slash formerly Columbus Day, it screws up our schedule to get things in our 30-day timeline.

37
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,772
So we are moving our meeting up to October 6th for next month.

38
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:07,959
Okay, moving right along.

39
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,361
Demolition application for 121 Second Street.

40
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,001
Moved to approve.

41
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:15,942
Thank you, Ryan.

42
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,082
Second.

43
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:18,403
Thank you, Peter.

44
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:23,405
Motion to approve the demolition application for 121 Second Street.

45
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:24,605
Ryan.

46
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:25,345
Yes.

47
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,346
Kit.

48
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:27,906
Yes.

49
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:28,867
Peter.

50
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:29,727
Yes.

51
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:30,687
And Doug.

52
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:31,728
Yes.

53
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:33,609
Okay, thank you.

54
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,950
That one is also approved for zero.

55
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,673
And we will hold the significant hearings next month on October 6th.

56
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,954
Do we have forms for those, Ryan?

57
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,556
I have a form for Mystic Ave.

58
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,016
I don't have one for 2nd Street.

59
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:51,817
Okay.

60
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,638
Will John be able to get us one in time?

61
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:57,499
Yeah, should be.

62
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,660
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,741
I mean, it's almost 30 days from today.

64
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:01,301
So, okay.

65
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,285
Okay, moving on to our agenda, we have three determinations of significance tonight.

66
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:13,248
We received applications for demolition last month.

67
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,791
And again, I'm going to go right down the agenda.

68
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:23,997
But before I do that, I'm just going to remind everybody about the definition of significance and what that means.

69
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:45,175
It means that the property is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the city or the Commonwealth, or that it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period, style,

70
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:54,737
method of building construction, or association with an important architect or builder, either by itself or in the context of a group of buildings.

71
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:00,137
So, moving on to 4648 Pinkert Street.

72
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,778
Commissioners, if somebody would like to make a motion and then we can start the discussion.

73
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,839
Motion defined for significance with the caveat that I'm going to shoot it down.

74
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:10,959
Okay.

75
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,840
Is there a second?

76
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:18,551
Second.

77
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,011
OK, thank you, Doug.

78
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:24,373
OK, Ryan, I will start the conversation with you.

79
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,273
There's a lot of.

80
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:38,276
These types of buildings, these two families in this neighborhood laid out by George McCormick was very prolific land developer.

81
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:49,707
made housing very affordable, put up a lot of, rather made land accessible to developers to then put up these buildings.

82
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:56,829
And this is a sort of a nice looking two family, but there's a lot of them.

83
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,210
So I don't necessarily think it arises the occasion of significance.

84
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,891
Okay, thank you, Ryan.

85
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:06,312
Doug, I'll move on to you.

86
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,326
Yeah, I echo everything Ryan said.

87
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:14,867
We have a lot of battles over buildings that are our close calls, but this doesn't feel like one of them.

88
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:18,629
So I think we should just cut to the chase here as quickly as we can.

89
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:20,629
OK, great.

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,630
Peter, anything to add?

91
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:28,952
No, I'm just curious about the addition that's already on there.

92
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:31,373
Did they get halted?

93
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:51,920
So for this particular project, we signed off on the zoning submittal to the building department with the understanding normally that a building permit comes.

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:01,142
And when that time came, because things change during the zoning process and zoning approvals, when that came, I put a note on it

95
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:03,544
that they needed to apply for demolition.

96
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:09,530
And by the time the building department saw it, they had already issued the permit and demolition had occurred.

97
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,477
So this is a pause, but it's a pause just to collectively get through the process at this point.

98
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,343
So, okay.

99
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,748
So yes, it was stopped, Peter.

100
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:40,633
And I think, you know, I'm hoping, I'm hopeful that if and when the zoning conversations get reengaged at some point, I mean, I just.

101
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,075
It's just unclear between zoning and historical.

102
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:53,619
We need a citywide flowchart to be able to educate people and help them through the process.

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,622
I just halted during the zoning process now.

104
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:00,943
It just gets to us faster, that's all.

105
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:05,906
I just don't like interjecting on another board's processes, that's all.

106
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:07,187
Right.

107
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:07,767
Just curious.

108
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:17,358
applied for a variance to get the full three floors or is that the new zoning quote-unquote?

109
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,119
There were variances required.

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,060
Okay.

111
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:26,405
Yeah, I'm assuming it was either a lot size or yeah, that's what the variances were for.

112
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:31,468
I don't think anything on the new zoning is in effect.

113
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:32,749
Yeah.

114
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,955
No, there's definitely zoning in effect on this side, but I don't think this property was there at that time.

115
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:46,805
I was just curious if a lot of the, depends on the zone, I guess.

116
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:53,929
I guess there is a full, some zones they do allow the full three floors, but most are two and a half.

117
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,252
So that's why I was curious about it anyway.

118
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:03,515
Yeah, I don't have too much more to add.

119
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:05,676
I think it is a nice building.

120
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,057
It's got some nice detail on it,

121
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:19,705
Like you say, it's not an uncommon building type, and I doubt if it would rise to preferably preserved, especially now, since the roof's torn off.

122
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:24,108
So I don't see the point in holding it up any further.

123
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:28,130
Okay, thank you, Peter.

124
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,591
Kit, anything to add on this one?

125
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,086
I don't have anything to add.

126
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:39,413
I think it's already been said, and there are lots of houses in Medford that look like this.

127
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,177
Old, but not significant.

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:45,700
OK.

129
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:56,222
I just wanted to point out that on the form B there was a recommendation for a national register, you know, potential for a national register.

130
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:05,770
And, you know, that in reading the form B, that just made me kind of, you know, pause and read this a little bit more closely and really think about it.

131
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:12,817
But I think if it sounds like we're all in agreement, so that'll be all I'll say about that.

132
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:23,496
Okay, we have a motion on the table to find for significance for 46-48 Pinker Street, and that has been seconded.

133
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,257
I'll go around for a roll call vote.

134
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:26,878
Ryan?

135
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:28,500
No.

136
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:29,980
Kit?

137
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:31,101
No.

138
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:32,302
Peter?

139
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:33,243
No.

140
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:34,503
And Doug?

141
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:35,504
No.

142
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:39,627
Okay, so the motion fails zero to four.

143
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:48,916
So we will send out a letter by the end of the week and get these folks on their way with their project.

144
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:55,981
Okay, next up we have 10 Irving Street.

145
00:09:56,521 --> 00:10:04,307
Again, we accepted the application on this one last month and tonight we're going to have a same determination of significance.

146
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:09,810
And so commissioners, when you're ready, I will take a motion on this one to jump off the conversation.

147
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:11,892
Move for significance.

148
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,511
Okay, thanks, Ryan.

149
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:24,980
I'll second.

150
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,082
Okay, thanks, Peter.

151
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:34,008
Ryan, if you'd like to jump off the conversation on this one, that would be great.

152
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:39,036
So I went back and forth with John a little bit on this particular building.

153
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:51,765
It relates to the Usher family of West Medford who developed this intermediate block and of who is associated with the Usher block on the corner of Playstate Road and High Street.

154
00:10:53,085 --> 00:11:15,830
I'm concerned that given the style and size of the building, that this perhaps actually may be the Usher building that was shown on the 1855 map of, walling map of Medford, and that the date that John assigns for it, 1889 to 1898, was the date that it was moved to its current location and appears here.

155
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:28,413
I did take a look at interior photos to sort of get a sense of what remains for interior fabric and historic fabric in this building, but that's a discussion for another time.

156
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:35,135
In terms of its relationship with the landscape, I feel there's a strong case for significance here.

157
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:38,936
Okay, thank you, Ryan.

158
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,757
Peter, I'll come to you next.

159
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:53,511
I found this one to have a really interesting history too with this family that is pretty significant in the town.

160
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,839
I also found that Playstead Brook reservation really interesting.

161
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,302
There must have been a stream going back there anyway.

162
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:29,383
Um, and the house, I think, even though it's like buried behind a lot of stuff, like bad stuff, I'll say not in the not in a sympathetic style, like the front porch or whatever was filled in with brick, got the brick pillars, and then there's a kind of horrific

163
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:37,448
I guess you don't really see it from the street, but the back porches are not so great stylistically.

164
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:44,052
But if you look at the center part of the building, it seems to have a lot of nice detail.

165
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:48,755
And it seemed like something could be made out of it.

166
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:55,039
I'm kind of on the fence about it because of all these alterations and stuff.

167
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,242
But I'd like to hear what the others have to say too.

168
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,206
Okay, thank you, Peter.

169
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:05,267
Doug, I'll come to you next.

170
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:09,769
Yeah, I'm kind of on the fence in this one.

171
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,891
My sense is to pause to understand it a little bit better.

172
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:23,756
The Form B does make a pretty strong case, more than most of these that we see about the historical connections.

173
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,699
Is this a teardown or just what's going on here?

174
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,480
I just look for some context, if you don't mind.

175
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,341
It is a full teardown.

176
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,242
It's currently a four-family.

177
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:37,823
That's a four-family.

178
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,184
If I could add some context, if you like.

179
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:41,705
Sure.

180
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,406
Kathleen, can we just get your name and address for the record, please?

181
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:44,566
Sure.

182
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:49,269
Kathleen Desmond, attorney for the applicant in this instance.

183
00:13:50,449 --> 00:14:00,194
I think, and it's been alluded to by Peter a bit in this, the additions on this make it difficult to do any kind of a renovation to the property that

184
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:07,218
that makes sense based on the layout with the front porch and the side porch and then the rear porches that are in back.

185
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:23,345
I think the client believes that it would be more simplistic to be able to tear it down and start over with respect to this based on the layout and how all the additions have been added along.

186
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,106
Also, there has been some issues with the foundation.

187
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,587
I think it's a double foundation.

188
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:29,613
I don't know if he's on the line.

189
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,254
He was going to try and join.

190
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:35,276
But I know that that was one of his issues.

191
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:40,920
So in terms of just being able to create, it is currently a four family.

192
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,702
I know this has it as a three, but it's being used as a four.

193
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,864
And I looked at the assessors, and it's a four as well.

194
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:57,350
But in terms of just being able to make sense of the layout and what he wants to do is expand on the units, the current edition after edition makes that.

195
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:58,694
makes that difficult.

196
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:02,576
Attorney Desmond, can I ask a question?

197
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:04,336
How many square feet is this building right now?

198
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:05,717
Do you know?

199
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,078
The existing house?

200
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:07,838
Yes.

201
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:14,182
Heavens.

202
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:15,943
I thought I pulled the card.

203
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:17,603
It should be on the application, right?

204
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:19,545
Hold on, I can look it up.

205
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:20,845
I have the application here.

206
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:21,426
So 1,170 square feet.

207
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:35,042
is the existing, you know, the one story, that's not the total gross area, but that's the lot area of the structure.

208
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,223
And it's two and a half stories.

209
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:39,704
It must be really small.

210
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:41,925
When it was sold, so it was sold

211
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:57,116
back in 2024, and they marketed it as just under 2,200 square feet of living area, but that was approximate, and it's on a 9,100 square foot lot.

212
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:00,959
That would include the two floors and the half story probably.

213
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:05,902
Correct, so it's one two-bedroom, two one-bedrooms, and one studio.

214
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:09,605
Yeah, I mean, that's...

215
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,980
That's amazing.

216
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,962
They can fit four units in there because it just doesn't seem right.

217
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:32,329
And this is kind of a tandem project as well, because depending on, you know, how this proceeds and where we proceed, there's going to be a discussion with the building department about, it's a preexisting nonconforming structure because it's more units than is allowed in a general residence.

218
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,952
So under section five, if they kept the same square footage, it would be an issue of,

219
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:47,493
just being able to replace it as a right, or then having to go to the Zoning Board of Appeals if they wanted to increase that to make four units that were more livable.

220
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,864
First of all, and it is a large lot, you know.

221
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:57,088
Obviously you can build, physically build more, even if maybe that may be a challenge in the zoning.

222
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,111
First of all, Dr. Desmond, it's been a while since we've seen you.

223
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:00,631
Welcome back.

224
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:01,652
Thank you.

225
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,273
You were a regular for many years.

226
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:04,254
Yeah, I was.

227
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:08,938
And you had a string where you're there every month for a while there.

228
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,119
Yeah, that's true.

229
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,240
What does double the foundation mean?

230
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,241
That's a new one for me.

231
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:14,662
I'm not sure.

232
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,624
That's why I was hoping my client was on the line.

233
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:18,145
We had a conversation about it.

234
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:26,244
I'm not sure exactly what that is, but he indicated that there's more than one section to the foundation, which makes it difficult.

235
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:28,505
And I didn't quite get it.

236
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:29,745
I don't see him on.

237
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:33,486
Yeah, and there's no one in the waiting room either.

238
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,947
Yeah.

239
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:42,369
And I had kind of said that that may be a question if it comes up that needs further explanation that I don't have.

240
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:43,929
Understood.

241
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,090
Ryan or Peter, have you ever heard that term?

242
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,170
Wait, what was the term?

243
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:54,425
double foundation double foundation almost like it felt to me like there was a foundation and then it was encased in another one, which is.

244
00:17:54,525 --> 00:18:03,175
yeah yeah to me that that's a usual normal practice if the rebel foundation is failing they just encase it with another one inside.

245
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,538
Inside or outside.

246
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:07,013
usually inside.

247
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:14,616
If it's outside, that usually indicates that it was some sort of step down, and they've removed the grade against the building.

248
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:21,739
And so, yeah, I mean, to Peter's earlier point, there was a time in so-called Place Dead Park, where they stream came through there.

249
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,420
This is the continuation of that stream.

250
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,741
Both are obviously long gone now.

251
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:31,923
But I think that could be the source of some of the problems with the foundation, if they have any.

252
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:41,552
And I don't know if it's so much of a problem, but that it's double and that creates other issues in terms of building, I guess.

253
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:42,753
That's my understanding.

254
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,454
That creates some issues.

255
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:51,479
I'm just, I have to ask the question, who has access to Playstead Brook Reservation?

256
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,020
Is that just common space now shared by all the neighbors?

257
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:01,705
Because it obviously contains the Brook culvert, but I was curious as to what's back there and who maintains it.

258
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:05,331
No.

259
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:06,592
Okay.

260
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,712
I don't know.

261
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,073
It goes under houses.

262
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,034
I mean it goes under structures.

263
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:15,534
It's been there a while.

264
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:16,875
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:22,317
I'm gonna have to check this out because I didn't even know it was there.

266
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:25,417
Go ahead.

267
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:33,100
And then if I could, I had one question on it being moved because the Form B has it being moved and is there going to be

268
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:50,361
Or where can we look in terms of whether, I think, Ryan, you referenced the fact that this may be something other than what the Form B author indicated it was, that you think it may not be the property that he believes it to be?

269
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,162
Yeah, is the house occupied?

270
00:19:53,182 --> 00:20:02,845
Because a walker would probably be useful to see some of the framing.

271
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:07,639
details because I believe it is occupied.

272
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:11,701
I could find out from my client and get back to the board on that point, certainly.

273
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:12,401
Yeah.

274
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:19,164
There are usually some pretty indicative features that would set it apart from the mid to late 19th century.

275
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:23,206
Yeah.

276
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:27,888
Just looking at the shape and scale, it's exactly like 333 Winthrop Street, which is an 1855.

277
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,265
building which would predate the date of the building here by 25 years, which would put it squarely on that 1855 map.

278
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:47,052
Ryan, are you saying you think they moved it from the location of the present Usher building to this location to build that building?

279
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:48,753
Yeah, most likely.

280
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:52,436
Yep, that's when all that development sort of happened.

281
00:20:53,343 --> 00:21:08,555
I don't know if this building will rise to the level of protection, the next level, if beyond significance, but I do think, I think there is finding out a few of the kind of detective sleuthing issues that we're talking about here.

282
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,276
a little bit more detail about the brook, a little bit more about the foundation.

283
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:16,458
Documentation is really what I'd be looking for.

284
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:18,359
I'm not sure.

285
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:22,580
I won't speak for anyone else on the commission obviously, but that's my interest in it.

286
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,662
I just want to understand what this is and the actual data, if there's any difference.

287
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:34,365
To me, that's worth pausing just to get that information and potentially re-evaluate in 30 days.

288
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:43,739
So, if the board likes, I can try and find some dates that would be available.

289
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,782
For an inspection, you know, there, I believe it is tenanted.

290
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:49,364
So that makes it a little trickier, but.

291
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:52,906
You know, we could certainly attempt to do that.

292
00:21:52,926 --> 00:22:04,536
I think that would be helpful, but before we do that, I'd like to ask kit if she had any comments on this, because she has been the only commissioner that hasn't had a chance to speak.

293
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:05,937
So kit the floor is yours.

294
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:07,859
Yeah, no, I agree with Doug.

295
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:24,934
I mean, I was on the fence coming into this meeting, but I think we all have enough questions and there are enough sort of curiosities about this building, both in terms of its architecture and its history and where this stream was that I think we should take a pause.

296
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:27,576
Great, thank you.

297
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,124
I know.

298
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:29,464
Yeah.

299
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:30,945
And I agree with everybody.

300
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:34,247
I definitely think that it warrants a little bit more research here.

301
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:50,075
And personally, I think a tour would be great, especially the basement and just walking around the exterior and just getting a sense of, you know, the lot and where it is and and whatnot.

302
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:54,557
But so I think, Attorney Desmond, if you could get back to us with some dates, that would be great.

303
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,522
Commissioners, does anybody else have any comments on this one before we take a vote?

304
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:15,610
I was just going to say, if you look at the shot on the Form B that goes up the driveway, you can kind of see how the foundation is.

305
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,412
It looks like there's rubble down low and then stucco above it.

306
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:23,274
It looks like maybe it was built to the inside, although

307
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:34,212
It's not a super clear photo, but you can kind of see the shelving of the foundation wall there.

308
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:40,034
I don't know if that's what he's talking about, but it would be interesting to see what's going on in that basement.

309
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,576
Thanks for pointing that out.

310
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:46,977
Yeah, I see exactly what you're pointing out.

311
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:56,362
Okay, we have a motion on the table for 10 Irving Street to find for significance that has been seconded.

312
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:57,723
Ryan?

313
00:23:58,984 --> 00:23:59,265
Yes.

314
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:00,666
Kit?

315
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:01,647
Yes.

316
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:02,748
Peter?

317
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:04,149
Yes.

318
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,250
Doug?

319
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,392
Yes.

320
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:08,874
Okay, so this one passes 4-0.

321
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:25,767
So attorney Desmond, let us know on those dates and then we will get you the information for the public hearing for, which will be October 6th and for the legal ad and for the sign out front.

322
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:32,510
I think this one is a good one too, if we get public comment, so.

323
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,492
Okay, terrific.

324
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:36,072
Great, thank you so much.

325
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:36,873
Thank you.

326
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:42,090
Okay, next up we have 173 Arlington Street.

327
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:48,734
So again, we accepted the application for this one last month and we have a significance hearing tonight.

328
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:52,176
Commissioner is the paperwork and the form B is in the file.

329
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,938
And I will take a motion when someone is ready.

330
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,901
Motion to find for significance.

331
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:00,862
Okay, thank you, Ryan.

332
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:08,047
I'll second.

333
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,524
OK, thanks, Kit.

334
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,442
OK, Ryan, if you want to jump us off again, that would be great.

335
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:17,858
Sure.

336
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:21,140
It's a small Moses Man Cottage.

337
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,784
Moses Man's really well known for his high style decorative Queen Anne Victorian buildings.

338
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:38,892
This is a much smaller, more modest example of that, but Moses Man is responsible almost single-handedly for the entirety of development south of High Street.

339
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,595
That includes Arlington Street, Jerome Street, and all the other

340
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:50,561
little developments along the way, and it's importantly associated with an important architect and builder.

341
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:52,683
So I'll leave it at that.

342
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:56,746
Okay, thank you, Ryan.

343
00:25:57,687 --> 00:25:59,148
Kit, I'll come to you next.

344
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:09,325
And in addition, and obviously my architect colleagues know far more about this than I do, but it's remarkably intact.

345
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:15,889
And it has all sorts of original detail that's still there, easy enough to preserve.

346
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,193
And I have to say, I think the fact that it has a twin right next door makes it particularly interesting.

347
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:25,175
Can I say something, or?

348
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:26,836
Hold on, sir.

349
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,096
I'll come to you.

350
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:28,916
Great, thank you.

351
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:38,078
I would like to point out for the commissioners, if you, I know it's been a while, maybe since you've looked at the application, this is a partial demolition.

352
00:26:39,118 --> 00:26:48,740
It's an interior gut, removing the rear addition with dormers on one side and a, I think,

353
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,142
shed dormer on the other side if I have that terminology correct.

354
00:26:53,262 --> 00:27:00,827
So just want to point that out that this is not a total teardown on this one as opposed to the last case we just heard.

355
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:04,709
Doug, I'll come to you next.

356
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:12,554
Yeah, I, I kind of agree with, with Kit and this is, this is an interesting building.

357
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:19,279
I'm glad where it's looking like it's going to be at least partially restored and maybe re-imagined.

358
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,020
I don't think there's any issue.

359
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:30,007
We've seen plenty of partial full shed dormers come through this commission and we've hardly ever blinked at those.

360
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:34,690
So my instincts are, you know, if it's,

361
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:43,872
This is one of those things, a judgment call here, if we want to go through this process, but we're happy with the design, like, what are we doing here?

362
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:44,993
We should think about that.

363
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:52,898
But that may just be the pause we need to kind of make sure we like what's coming down the pike on this building.

364
00:27:53,819 --> 00:28:01,244
But if it's what you described, and I haven't really looked at those plans in a while, Jen, since they were sent out, but if that doesn't sound to me like it's

365
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:03,593
There are plans in the drive.

366
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:10,399
So if you go back to the application folder, there are some proposed, at least there's elevations there.

367
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:17,645
Yeah.

368
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:18,326
Okay.

369
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:20,568
Peter, I will come to you next.

370
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:24,551
Yeah.

371
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:29,816
I mean, it sounds like it's a fairly modest intervention.

372
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:32,843
that the owner wants to do.

373
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:43,131
And that it probably will be mostly left the massing intact and hopefully enhanced.

374
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:47,294
I think the front porch could use some work as well.

375
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:53,779
I would be curious to see those elevations.

376
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:58,103
This building and the building next door has the,

377
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:09,222
this dormer, window dormer, if you want to call it that, or whatever you call it, that breaks the eave, which I think is kind of an interesting feature.

378
00:29:09,322 --> 00:29:12,083
And it's on both houses.

379
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:16,284
So they kind of make a nice pair.

380
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:26,167
So I'd be interested to see if that feature was preserved in the new design, because it's kind of a distinctive feature.

381
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:36,731
Other than that, I mean, yeah, I think it's worth a pause just because I haven't seen the drawings.

382
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:52,218
But on the other hand, I am a little bit on the fence about this one too, because it seems like such a small intervention.

383
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,780
But anyway, it'd be good to know more.

384
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:58,316
Yeah, so the applicant is here.

385
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:04,758
Mr. Foote, if you could please give us your name and address for the record, and then I'll let you have the floor.

386
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:06,479
I'm Don Foote.

387
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:12,301
I currently live at 35 Myrtle Terrace in Winchester, and I own this house in Medford.

388
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:19,419
So just to be clear, my wife and I are going to be the end users on this house.

389
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,160
It's not a flip.

390
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,942
We're going to rehab it and have my daughter live there for a while, and then move in hopefully in four or five years.

391
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:36,384
I specifically, we had to get a zoning variance to extend the rear of the house.

392
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:37,204
The house is tiny.

393
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:38,324
It's 910 square feet.

394
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:54,900
And we asked for a very small rear addition in the exact same profile of the existing house, just pushing back 12 and a half feet at the 19 foot width of the house.

395
00:30:56,182 --> 00:31:08,822
The goal was to create a three-bedroom, two-bath house as opposed to a two-bedroom, one-bath, tiny house that is just not functional by today's standards.

396
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:28,156
The problem on the second floor, and I do love the house, we're maintaining the front facade completely, although we will rip the plywood decking off and the collapsing front porch that's been there.

397
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:29,577
I mean, the house is a complete wreck.

398
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,700
The fact that it was called in good condition and

399
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:41,705
The form that was filled out, I really question that.

400
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:42,945
It's a complete mess.

401
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,509
It hadn't been, I mean, the foundation walls are collapsing in the basement.

402
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,091
It was just a lot of issues with this house.

403
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:57,474
But my wife and I both loved just the overall look of it.

404
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:18,452
We were trying in our design and our request for the zoning variants to maintain that and not try to build some giant addition on the rear, which apparently my neighbor is going to be doing that shortly.

405
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:23,757
So I think what we're doing is way more in kind of

406
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,083
in cahoots with what the existing house looks like.

407
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:30,864
So that's our goal.

408
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:35,148
We're not trying to create a giant mansion here.

409
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:40,172
We're just trying to make it a 1,350-square-foot, three-bedroom home.

410
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,196
So that's really what we're asking for.

411
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:47,958
We just want to get going and build it.

412
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:49,519
And we do.

413
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,801
So that's where we're at.

414
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:54,263
Thanks.

415
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,229
All right, thank you, that's very helpful.

416
00:32:56,689 --> 00:33:00,654
Jen, would it be worth spending two minutes to show the elevations that are part of it?

417
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:03,658
I just looked at him while Mr. Phuong was talking and I agree with him.

418
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,420
Sure.

419
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:06,982
I can do it or you can, it's up to you.

420
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,026
I can do it, I have it right here.

421
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:10,627
Okay.

422
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:14,654
Because I think it is a very sympathetic intervention.

423
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:16,475
You're saving the important pieces.

424
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:19,698
You're expanding a little bit.

425
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:24,142
And a 1,350-square-foot home is tiny by any standards in Medford, I think.

426
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,023
Can everybody see this?

427
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:29,586
Yeah, there's the front elevation at the top there, the rear, and the back.

428
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,687
And then they have both sides.

429
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:32,189
And you can pretty much see what's new.

430
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:35,031
And the dormers are obviously new on either side.

431
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:37,893
But the mass thing is pretty much there.

432
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:42,638
Ryan, did we get this application?

433
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:47,059
Or was this diverted by a permit application to us?

434
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,100
I flagged this during the zoning process and then the.

435
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,182
Asbestos remediation took place and I doubly flagged it with the building department.

436
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:03,383
It's got right on nature, yeah, yeah.

437
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:08,484
I'm just thinking that if we if this had come in and

438
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:15,049
What if these went to subcommittee, like it might've just been.

439
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:20,031
Yeah, I seem to think that the original plan may have been.

440
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:23,692
Larger and more.

441
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:25,973
This is the only plan we've ever had.

442
00:34:25,993 --> 00:34:28,234
We only had one plan.

443
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:32,936
The only one must have been the gut rehab then that flagged it.

444
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:36,698
So yeah, we, we never.

445
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,532
We weren't trying to make this into some other building.

446
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:44,395
We were just trying to do something that was reasonable.

447
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:49,719
In fact, in our zoning variants, they were shocked at how little we asked for.

448
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,783
I mean, because we asked for a 12 by 19 two-story addition.

449
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,665
When did you get approval from the zoning folks?

450
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,146
A couple of months ago.

451
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,830
So yeah, we've just been waiting on this now.

452
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:14,008
I mean, yeah, I mean, like I said, our goal was to do something that was not to wreck this house.

453
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:15,629
We like the house.

454
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:16,949
We love the house.

455
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,011
But it's just not functional by today's standards.

456
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:21,572
Yeah.

457
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:29,778
I guess my instincts here are to just speed up the process.

458
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:43,468
As someone who's served on many of these subcommittees, I don't think I would change much on the drawings I see, so I'm not sure other than making it significant and calling for a perfect preserved.

459
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:53,795
To me, it's just slowing down the process of something that I think I'm already at the end line here myself, but I defer to the other commissioners obviously if they agree or not.

460
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:57,503
I agree.

461
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:01,486
I mean, it sounds like what Mr. Foote is saying is that they're trying to preserve it.

462
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:04,548
We are.

463
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:10,591
There's not many of you Mr. Foote.

464
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,272
I would agree.

465
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:14,053
I would say, you know, go for it.

466
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:20,778
I'd like to make one advisory comment about the design though.

467
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:22,759
Go ahead Peter.

468
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,020
Take it or leave it.

469
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:27,409
Well, let me ask you a question.

470
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,517
The long shed dormer on the, I believe it's the left side of the house.

471
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:33,138
Correct.

472
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:37,304
Is that dependent upon the layout?

473
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:39,568
Could it be flipped to the other side?

474
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:49,846
Uh, well, actually the way the stairs work, because the stairs, if you're looking at the house from the front, they, they start on the right hand side and go up to the left.

475
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:51,106
So, okay.

476
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:54,648
So, so the answer is, is yes, it is planned dependent.

477
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:54,848
Yeah.

478
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,088
Or no, whatever.

479
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,009
So it needs to be on that side.

480
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:04,052
Um, I guess then, um, I think it would be cool.

481
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:09,494
Like for the shed, the little shed dormer on the right side, then.

482
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:15,176
I'll, my advisory comment is I'd love to see a gable roof on that.

483
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:18,019
So it would kind of like mirror it's next door neighbor.

484
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,260
Yeah.

485
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,281
Yeah.

486
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:21,382
I don't have an issue with that.

487
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:23,684
It's just, I don't want to wait a whole month.

488
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:28,168
It's not a binding thing.

489
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:32,112
It's just, that'd be my, that'd be my comment.

490
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,603
Wouldn't that give you more space too, Peter, in the room itself, if we did it?

491
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,645
Well, yeah, I guess you could say.

492
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:46,571
Depending on how big it is, the existing dormer that's on the other side of the house now is tiny.

493
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:51,355
And it goes into the, I mean, it's so, that barely gives you enough room.

494
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:58,381
The reason we're putting that dormer on the other side is because we have to have a window in that, what is going to become the central bedroom.

495
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:00,766
You have to see the second floor.

496
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:03,168
So you have to have an egress window, obviously, in a bedroom.

497
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:04,549
And you have to have a window.

498
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:10,974
So it has to be a dormer that's big enough to have an egress window in it.

499
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:11,835
Right.

500
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:20,302
No, I was just saying, it would be like the two little dormers are talking to each other across the driveway there.

501
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:21,423
I'm a gable.

502
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:24,345
I promise I'll yell out the window to the other dormer.

503
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:26,587
Whatever.

504
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:27,968
Take it for what it's worth.

505
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:31,939
Okay.

506
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,320
Hi, Ed.

507
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,923
Our other commissioner just joined us.

508
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:53,136
Ed, we're discussing 173 Arlington Street, and we were about to take a vote on significance, but I wanted to just give you the option if you had a comment or had anything to say on this one, or you can abstain from voting if you choose.

509
00:38:56,708 --> 00:39:01,109
I think I know where I'd be or I will abstain for politeness sake.

510
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:01,989
Okay.

511
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:03,290
Okay.

512
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,230
Okay.

513
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,011
Um, does anybody else have any comments on this one?

514
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:11,792
Otherwise I'll go around for a roll call vote.

515
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:14,052
Okay.

516
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:21,874
We have a motion on the table to find for significance for one 73 Arlington street that has been seconded Ryan.

517
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:23,054
Yes.

518
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:24,234
Kit.

519
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:24,935
Yes.

520
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:26,435
Peter.

521
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,531
Wait, what are we voting for, for significance?

522
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:33,572
We are voting for significance.

523
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:34,373
Okay.

524
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:41,218
I'm gonna say no, because I think I want this to go forward.

525
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,479
Okay, Doug?

526
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,300
No.

527
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,282
Okay, tiebreaker.

528
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,743
We have a tie.

529
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,064
Can I ask a question?

530
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:54,287
I mean, can we find it preferably preserved?

531
00:39:55,143 --> 00:40:01,848
because that's essentially what we're saying and move ahead, do we have to wait the month?

532
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,470
You need a public hearing for that.

533
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:13,476
Yeah, I don't think we can, I know this was like, I also had this, and I apologize, I should have asked this before we voted.

534
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:19,260
I don't think we can find yes for significance and then not have a public hearing.

535
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,202
Right, that's the process.

536
00:40:22,293 --> 00:40:23,094
Right.

537
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:34,483
It's either yes, the building's significant, so it's afforded a public hearing, or no, it's not, so that you could move forward with the project, but also can move forward with demolition entirely.

538
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:36,545
Not that that's the plan, but it could be.

539
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:40,388
Well, the plan is to do what is on my plan.

540
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:41,309
Understood.

541
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:41,869
Understood.

542
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:43,611
But not everybody.

543
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,932
I mean, that's what I applied for a building permit for.

544
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:47,634
I can't do anything other than that.

545
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,972
Yeah, it's okay.

546
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:53,033
I'm happy to, I can vote and make the tie break.

547
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:56,434
Or is, does anybody, are we good?

548
00:40:56,714 --> 00:40:58,114
Am I allowed to vote, right?

549
00:40:58,494 --> 00:40:59,114
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:40:59,174 --> 00:40:59,955
Yeah, okay.

551
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,736
My vote- No, no, no, no, not present, so that will always make it- Correct, you're, yeah.

552
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:06,436
My vote is no.

553
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:15,258
So the significance vote fails two to three with one abstention.

554
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:17,969
two to two, one abstention.

555
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:19,951
No, sorry, two to three, one abstention.

556
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:28,818
So sir, we will get out a letter to you that your property was found not significant, and you'll be on your merry way.

557
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,339
Oh, thank you so much.

558
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:31,040
Thank you.

559
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,901
My wife's been listening the whole time.

560
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:34,102
She appreciates it also.

561
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:35,323
Thanks so much.

562
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:36,784
She's on the edge of her seat.

563
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:39,907
This is, I think, one of those cases where it was a little bit of like,

564
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:50,571
We wanted to put the pin and say, yes, it's significant, but then we wanted to skip the second step, which we can't do.

565
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,453
I respect, but I like the house.

566
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:56,014
Like you said, we're not trying to destroy it.

567
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,294
We're trying to enhance it.

568
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,215
Preserve it, actually.

569
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:00,636
Thank you so much.

570
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:01,296
Appreciate it.

571
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:01,896
Thank you.

572
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:03,357
Thank you.

573
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,177
Thank you so much.

574
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:04,938
Have a good night.

575
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:05,478
You too.

576
00:42:07,753 --> 00:42:09,794
Okay, that was an interesting case.

577
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:10,314
Okay.

578
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:13,156
All righty.

579
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:19,239
Does anybody else have any new business before we move on to old business?

580
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:22,901
No?

581
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:23,601
Okay.

582
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:25,664
All right.

583
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:27,045
Fantastic.

584
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:40,560
Ed, just to catch you up, our meeting next month is October 6th because we have that weird, like, all that happens every fall with Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples Day and then Veterans Day in November.

585
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,421
So, yeah.

586
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:45,365
Kit, I did get your email, so no worries there.

587
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:48,918
Okay, moving on to old business.

588
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:50,058
Madam Chair.

589
00:42:50,658 --> 00:42:52,119
Yes, Ryan, thank you.

590
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,879
Motion to suspend the rules and take something out of order.

591
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,480
Go for it.

592
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,221
Well, you need to do a roll call vote.

593
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:00,141
Oh, okay.

594
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:01,241
Sorry.

595
00:43:02,222 --> 00:43:05,103
Motion to suspend the rules and take things out of order.

596
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:05,963
Do I have a second?

597
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:08,984
I second.

598
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:10,744
Okay, thank you, Doug.

599
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:13,725
Okay, roll call vote on that motion.

600
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:14,205
Ryan.

601
00:43:14,746 --> 00:43:14,986
Yes.

602
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:19,081
Yes.

603
00:43:19,782 --> 00:43:20,122
Peter.

604
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:21,403
Yes.

605
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:22,124
Doug.

606
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:23,205
Yes.

607
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:24,146
Ed.

608
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:25,787
Yep.

609
00:43:26,528 --> 00:43:26,748
Okay.

610
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:27,869
Motion passes.

611
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:28,870
Ryan.

612
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,271
Thanks.

613
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:30,932
Yeah.

614
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:38,459
So in, in terms of vacant seats, I reached out to Ted Blake, who is here tonight.

615
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:39,299
Hi, Ted.

616
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:47,167
And he's a Somerville school teacher, lives in the South Street local historic district.

617
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:53,232
And sorry, Teresa, I poached him, because I don't think you guys reached out to him.

618
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:56,956
So the commission needed some new members.

619
00:43:57,056 --> 00:43:58,657
So I thought Ted would be a good candidate.

620
00:43:58,737 --> 00:43:59,959
So I just wanted to have him

621
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,963
at tonight's meeting so he can see the full broad spectrum of everything that we do.

622
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:09,548
And I wanted to give him a chance to introduce himself to the commission.

623
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:19,129
Yeah, I've been living in Medford Hillside for over 10 years.

624
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:27,311
And last year I moved on to Toro Ave, into one of the more historic homes here.

625
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,752
So I had that interest there.

626
00:44:30,052 --> 00:44:32,533
And last spring, I think the city put out a call for

627
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:37,614
Hey, we're looking for people to join some of our various boards and commissions and things like that.

628
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,675
And I was interested in this.

629
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:42,415
And so it's some of what I teach in Somerville.

630
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:44,036
I do a lot of local history things.

631
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:53,738
My students were not necessarily architectural history right now, but I'm doing actually a whole semester course in public history right now with my mostly 11th graders.

632
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:55,979
That's awesome.

633
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,321
Thank you.

634
00:44:57,642 --> 00:44:58,703
We're so glad to have you.

635
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:01,688
And tonight's a good meeting to observe.

636
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:08,279
We have had a little bit of, you know, two out of our three kind of nuts and bolts.

637
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:13,830
type cases where we're taking demolition applications, we're reviewing for significance.

638
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:25,036
So that was a really good kind of mix of properties and votes and you get a little flavor of what we do most months.

639
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:32,300
And then, you know, we kind of have some ongoing projects and other things that we tackle from month to month as well.

640
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:36,202
But yeah, it's a good meeting to be at.

641
00:45:36,262 --> 00:45:37,303
So we're so glad to have you.

642
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:38,778
Thanks for having me.

643
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:42,461
Commissioner, does anybody have any questions for Ted?

644
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:45,883
Just curious.

645
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:48,224
We're a fun bunch, so you should totally join us.

646
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:50,446
I live in your neighborhood, too.

647
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:53,148
Which house do you live in?

648
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:55,449
11 Toro.

649
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:56,350
OK.

650
00:45:59,171 --> 00:46:00,412
And have you ever researched your house?

651
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:02,093
A little bit.

652
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:04,195
We've done a lot of, actually,

653
00:46:05,468 --> 00:46:09,710
more snooping on the previous owners who have quite a weird history as well.

654
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:24,758
Part of the reason why we ended up with the house, it was in foreclosure and I think the guy didn't pay his mortgage for 20 years and basically it was back if you remember say the big short when all the mortgage default swaps were going on.

655
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:30,702
I think he figured out that no one could prove ownership of his mortgage and refused to pay and eventually

656
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:31,782
I don't know.

657
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:34,844
I think that we've done a lot of searching on him.

658
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:37,406
2008, is that what you're talking about?

659
00:46:37,686 --> 00:46:38,407
Something like that.

660
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:52,896
I mean, that is a very common technique to prolong foreclosure is to ask the lenders to prove that they actually own the debt.

661
00:46:53,797 --> 00:46:54,017
Yep.

662
00:46:55,658 --> 00:46:57,359
Says a lawyer.

663
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:06,786
I don't know, my wife did a lot of research on the previous owners.

664
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:14,691
And the other thing that brought me to it was just in the Medford Library once and kind of the, I have two young kids and so we're often going to the library.

665
00:47:15,171 --> 00:47:25,518
And just on the dollar bookshelf, it was the, when we were there last year, it was the, from the 70s, from the, this commission put out a book of like your home in the streetcar suburb.

666
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:26,459
Streetcar suburb.

667
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:31,042
Yeah, and I picked it up and I was looking at, doing some of the architectural history of Medford.

668
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:32,263
Nice.

669
00:47:35,044 --> 00:47:43,509
Jim, this might be an odd time to discuss it, but aren't there a fair number of people on this board, this commission, who are considering exiting soon?

670
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:52,475
Yes, we have some turnover coming, and so we are definitely looking to kind of refill.

671
00:47:52,515 --> 00:48:00,061
I mean, we had Eleni leave, and then, you know, Kit is hanging on for voting, but, you know, she has asked to step back.

672
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:04,903
And Ed as well at the end of his term this year.

673
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:11,907
So yeah, we're definitely in a point where we know about some seats that are turning over.

674
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:20,872
And, you know, there's other folks who are here that have been on the commission for a while that might like to do something else.

675
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:29,717
And if the opportunity arose, you know, to somebody that somebody wanted to fill our seats as well, then we could shift around a little bit.

676
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah.

677
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:41,807
I'm not the guy I should be asking this question, but do we know, has the mayor's office gotten names we don't know about?

678
00:48:42,827 --> 00:48:51,335
Not that we have, and we do ask periodically because they kind of have applications for boards and commissions on a rolling basis.

679
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:57,640
But before our meeting started today, I asked Teresa, who's staffing our meeting tonight for us,

680
00:48:58,127 --> 00:49:03,769
To ask the communications office to put out a blast on socials for our board specifically.

681
00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:08,631
I know they do some they do some like board opening announcement posts on a periodic basis.

682
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:14,133
Um, you know, we have posted on some other social forums as well.

683
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:15,894
And, you know, I'll continue to kind of like.

684
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:20,077
put things out there as well to see if we can get some new interest.

685
00:49:20,117 --> 00:49:25,501
And I would encourage everybody to talk to your network, ask your friends, share on your own socials.

686
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:28,023
We have a blog post on our website that you can share.

687
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:32,726
And yeah, we'd love to just have some new folks.

688
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:43,214
I mean, the process is, you know, Ryan and I will talk to them or they can come to a meeting and then we have to make a recommendation up to the mayor's office and ultimately

689
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:49,536
This is a mayoral appointed board, so ultimately it's the mayor's choice to appoint somebody on the board.

690
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:56,338
So, it's a pretty simple process and we've obviously all gone through it.

691
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:58,499
So, yeah.

692
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:02,380
Ted, do you have any questions for any of us?

693
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:10,387
Um, I think Ryan's going to give me a little bit more of just a nuts and bolts description of what kind of the commitments are and things like that.

694
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:13,169
Um, we were going to talk beforehand, but I think we rescheduled.

695
00:50:13,189 --> 00:50:15,071
So maybe after the meeting, right, Ryan.

696
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:16,532
Yeah.

697
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:24,498
I was going to say, do you want me to, uh, meet with you to sort of go over the finer points before I recommend you to the mayor?

698
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:30,242
Cause, uh, I have no issue recommending you to the mayor, at which point it will take about 30 days for her to.

699
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,545
appoint you to the board to fill the currently one vacancy.

700
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:38,469
But if you feel you want me to wait, I can wait for that time.

701
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:44,235
But I'm comfortable recommending you for appointing to the board.

702
00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:49,421
And you can always decline if you feel that the responsibility is too much.

703
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:50,962
But I think you'll find it's

704
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:55,260
It's perfectly, you know, we're, we're pretty easy going here.

705
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,521
You don't have to decide right now if you're don't know.

706
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,082
There's plenty of time.

707
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:04,263
So, um, I can wait 30 days.

708
00:51:04,343 --> 00:51:06,003
I think that that'll be fine.

709
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:08,904
And we'll between then and now we'll go over everything.

710
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:16,267
And then at that point, I'll have a sort of a committee of one report back to the board about what you decided.

711
00:51:16,287 --> 00:51:17,627
That was great.

712
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:41,500
Just sort of quickly in terms of, and I know that there's sort of the role description that's probably on the website and I don't think it changed as much, but especially with Ed stepping off as sort of our resident lawyer, I mean, it sort of seems like that would, that sort of legal expertise is really useful to have.

713
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,443
And if we're thinking about names to suggest, is there other,

714
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:51,442
I'm just curious if the committee thinks there are other sort of skill sets that it would be useful to bring.

715
00:51:52,240 --> 00:52:00,905
Well, we typically ask for architectural, like historical slash preservation, real estate and law.

716
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:20,318
But, you know, I think Ryan and I are kind of of the mindset, I'm sure you would all agree that at the end of the day, if somebody is interested and they want to help, we would love to just talk to you and, you know, get a sense, you know, let the candidate get a sense for what we do, get a sense for what we're all about and, you know,

717
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:21,999
see if there's a fit.

718
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:28,104
I don't think it's a certainly not a prerequisite, but it's an ideal those folks in that.

719
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:35,451
But I wouldn't want to have somebody not kind of step up to the plate and want to volunteer if they didn't have those specific skills.

720
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:39,574
Yeah, but I mean, I obviously like.

721
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:44,539
I love having Ed on here as our legal voice.

722
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,760
We're so lucky to have him.

723
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,161
Yes.

724
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:54,230
Are you sure this move is a good idea, Ed?

725
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:55,131
I know.

726
00:52:57,773 --> 00:53:02,838
He's just lining up so I can buy the house again.

727
00:53:03,018 --> 00:53:04,039
It's 35 years.

728
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,501
I've had 35 years.

729
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:07,162
Somebody else can become the caretaker.

730
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:09,064
If you read my last copy of the subject.

731
00:53:09,504 --> 00:53:17,512
Hey, the Budweiser site is, Budweiser site, even though the T grabbed it, maybe I can weasel out an acre and we'll move the building back to its original site.

732
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:21,531
Ryan, you were there to watch it.

733
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:25,152
I don't think you'd want to orchestrate the next, orchestrate the return.

734
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:30,373
No, no, especially because I don't think a lot of the, well, I don't, I don't know how they dealt with all the bridges.

735
00:53:33,574 --> 00:53:34,474
It's there long enough.

736
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:35,454
Doesn't it just stay there?

737
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:36,295
Yeah.

738
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:36,695
Yeah.

739
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:37,295
Well, yeah.

740
00:53:37,335 --> 00:53:38,615
I mean, it's, it's historic.

741
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,896
The move itself now is now historically important.

742
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:41,596
That's what I mean.

743
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:45,877
It's already, it's, you can't put the GD back in the bottle here.

744
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:46,457
Yeah.

745
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:50,460
Yeah, but we can get the pictures of the next owner, and we will.

746
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:54,486
All right, great.

747
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:58,853
Well, Ted, as I said, we're a fun bunch.

748
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:00,996
So keep us posted, and we'd love to have you.

749
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:02,538
Thanks so much.

750
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:07,259
Ryan, do we have to have a motion to go back to the agenda?

751
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,621
No, now you just do it as you see fit.

752
00:54:10,182 --> 00:54:11,783
Fabulous.

753
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:14,026
Returning to the ordinary order of business.

754
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:15,387
Yes, thank you, Ed.

755
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,449
See, this is why we need you.

756
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:21,193
We need a parliamentarian.

757
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:24,947
Back to the agenda.

758
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:27,489
Mystic Valley Parkway.

759
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:29,731
Ryan, I'll let you take this one.

760
00:54:31,173 --> 00:54:44,605
I sent out the PNF that was sent around that contained all that wonderful information about the archaeological testing that they did up and down the Mystic Lakes, and I don't think we have any concern.

761
00:54:47,028 --> 00:55:12,922
The question we were being asked is did we have any comment on the proposed design that's sort of at the very back, the reasoning for all the archaeological testing, and TCR is adding a bunch of paths and bike lanes and making minor changes to the roadway, all of which I think are a welcome improvement to what is currently there now, which in a lot of cases is fragmented pathways and nothing.

762
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:26,932
for lack of a better term, called desire paths, where they've just been worn in by the hundreds of people using that side of the, you know, road without a cross, without a sidewalk.

763
00:55:26,972 --> 00:55:29,534
So DCR is putting one in basically.

764
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:31,755
So I'm fine with that.

765
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:36,159
I don't think we have any comment, but we should comment that we don't have any comment.

766
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:37,880
This is a reminder.

767
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,542
Okay, do we need to just write a letter?

768
00:55:40,562 --> 00:55:40,642
Okay.

769
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:44,647
Did you hear me?

770
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:46,028
Sounds like a one-line letter.

771
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:47,329
Yeah, right.

772
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,749
Hold on.

773
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:50,131
There we go.

774
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:50,591
Sorry.

775
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,492
My cat muted you.

776
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:56,575
So sorry, I missed what, where did I leave off?

777
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:59,457
I said, did we, do we have to write a letter that we have no comments?

778
00:55:59,597 --> 00:56:02,799
We should just write a brief email that says we have no comment.

779
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,439
Okay.

780
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:04,640
Okay.

781
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:07,022
That sounds good to me.

782
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:08,483
Do we need to vote on it or are we good?

783
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:08,803
Nope.

784
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:09,483
Nope.

785
00:56:09,623 --> 00:56:12,505
If that's what we want to do, then I'll do that.

786
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:13,466
Great.

787
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:19,664
Does anybody else have any comments on this one?

788
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,826
Are we good to move to the next agenda item?

789
00:56:22,326 --> 00:56:22,947
Let's move on.

790
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:25,149
It's a great thing they're doing along the river.

791
00:56:25,169 --> 00:56:27,371
I don't think I want to slow down that process at all.

792
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:28,732
Yeah, I agree.

793
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,902
Their testing did a lot of good for Thomas Brooks Park.

794
00:56:37,642 --> 00:56:48,386
The report literally states that the sensitivity, even at surface level, like literally just walking over the site, is incredibly high.

795
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:49,767
Incredibly high.

796
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:53,968
Do read the report because it is incredibly sensitive landscape.

797
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:59,370
That means Thomas Brooks Park is probably going to be incredibly sensitive as well.

798
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:02,438
which we basically already know, but yeah.

799
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:07,542
Yeah, we knew, but it could get a lot, it could get a lot more tense, so.

800
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:07,862
Cool.

801
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:14,247
Speaking of, Teresa, I meant to, I think I mentioned this and I meant to email you that that's like a jungle over there.

802
00:57:14,707 --> 00:57:15,748
It needs to be cut.

803
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:19,691
Can we ask the DPW to go by and?

804
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:21,612
Yes, I'll reach out to them.

805
00:57:21,632 --> 00:57:23,054
Along the street, thank you.

806
00:57:26,516 --> 00:57:27,217
Yeah.

807
00:57:27,297 --> 00:57:28,618
Okay, 10-20 Revere Beach Parkway.

808
00:57:28,638 --> 00:57:30,239
Is there anything we need on this one, Ryan?

809
00:57:30,778 --> 00:57:31,618
I sent this around.

810
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:34,039
I just want to confirm that the commission has no comments.

811
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:36,280
The comments were supposed to be made to Danielle tonight.

812
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,820
I don't think we have anything to say.

813
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:43,962
I just, you know, other than the form for Cappy's building, I just want to make sure that we're okay with letting it go.

814
00:57:45,242 --> 00:57:46,122
Yeah.

815
00:57:47,123 --> 00:57:50,564
We ought to get the documentation, but there's nothing to preserve there.

816
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:57,766
I mean, you know, it's an industrial 1950s industrial building is,

817
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:00,637
get the history, but that's about it.

818
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:03,878
Yeah.

819
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:06,879
I didn't really have any comments on the proposed design.

820
00:58:06,919 --> 00:58:13,921
It seems to fit in with some of the other stuff that's going across the way.

821
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:24,023
And it is funny that they're preserving the tattoo parlor, but, um,

822
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:27,345
That's the site we're talking about, right?

823
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:27,825
Yeah.

824
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:30,946
They're just waiting for their check to be big enough.

825
00:58:31,427 --> 00:58:32,347
Yeah.

826
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:34,268
Let's be honest.

827
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:37,530
Like Doug said, get ready for a pocket park, right?

828
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:38,530
Yeah.

829
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,011
But I think it makes the building more interesting.

830
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:44,593
And I think Doug said that as well, too, to break the corner there.

831
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:49,916
So I think it's fine, personally.

832
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:50,556
Yeah.

833
00:58:50,576 --> 00:58:51,836
We just had not to write a letter.

834
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:52,837
That was fine.

835
00:58:54,219 --> 00:58:58,963
Yeah, I think we can all agree that's the perfect spot for people and development.

836
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:00,324
Yep.

837
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:02,266
Okay, great.

838
00:59:04,087 --> 00:59:05,849
The Medford Wayfinding Project.

839
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,132
That's Doug, you're on that committee, I think.

840
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:13,655
Kind of, yeah.

841
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:18,959
I was approached on this, and Teresa can speak to this as well.

842
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,443
There's a group that had been hired by the city to try to improve

843
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:35,626
you know, signage in the city to direct people towards interesting resources across the city, and they were kind of casting a wide net to find out what stories they think they should tell.

844
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:39,808
And so, you know, we brought up a bunch of stuff about the historic buildings, about

845
00:59:40,728 --> 01:00:01,202
about immigration across the centuries, about slavery, you know, there's a lot of narratives here that are kind of not in signage presently that could even the Brooks Heritage Trail from the square to the state is something I put on the table that, you know, exists now, periodically gets brought out again.

846
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:06,145
So there's a bunch of stories that I don't know, you know, they were kind of just information gathering.

847
01:00:06,785 --> 01:00:08,847
I don't know if they've made any progress or any recommendations.

848
01:00:08,887 --> 01:00:10,568
I don't think so, Teresa, but you tell me.

849
01:00:10,588 --> 01:00:12,990
I haven't heard.

850
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:17,433
It's not my project, but I got big ears in that office, so I tend to eavesdrop.

851
01:00:17,773 --> 01:00:18,974
I haven't heard anything about it.

852
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:24,138
Yeah, I think they had like 60 days or something or at least to do that, and it hasn't been like 30.

853
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,759
That sounds accurate.

854
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:43,787
Did the planning department get anywhere with sort of the concept of standardizing signage across the city for interpretive panels and wayfinding so that there's no matter who's doing it, whether it's

855
01:00:43,927 --> 01:01:00,681
DCR or this wayfinding group or the city or some state entity that it all has some uniform look across our entire city because it just looks like trash when we start throwing up signs and then abandoning one concept and going to another.

856
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:06,867
And I would like to see some sort of uniformity across the entire city to

857
01:01:07,187 --> 01:01:16,331
sort of keep it on a, you know, if we lay it out now and sort of starting adding to it, then that will just sort of make everything harmonized.

858
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:27,977
And my key point is the interpretive panels across the city, they started off using like a National Park Service standard sign that was, you know, low and accessible.

859
01:01:28,077 --> 01:01:31,218
And then as they morphed through like Clippership Park,

860
01:01:31,218 --> 01:01:34,219
park and the area over by the cotton shell.

861
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:40,682
They sort of experimented with different ideas and they sort of clash with each other.

862
01:01:40,803 --> 01:01:46,525
And they, of course, recycle the same three rum, chips and brick over and over and over again.

863
01:01:46,705 --> 01:01:58,091
So I'd like to see at least some sort of if the wayfinding group says this is what the wayfinds are, they should also say this is what they should be for the rest of the city.

864
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:00,672
So this is the program and then spread it out.

865
01:02:03,782 --> 01:02:06,363
To the best of my knowledge, that has not yet occurred.

866
01:02:06,983 --> 01:02:11,225
I think it's a great idea, and that's something I'm happy to help champion to kind of get right.

867
01:02:11,245 --> 01:02:18,468
I think most, if not all, the members on this board know that I also support the Historic District Commission.

868
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:25,170
We are looking at updating some signage across our districts, as well as to install new South Street signage.

869
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,551
So, Ted, you should weigh in on that one.

870
01:02:28,886 --> 01:02:33,512
but maybe that could be a catalyst for really pushing forward some standardization.

871
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:41,863
I'm a good squeaky wheel, so I can kind of help make that, kind of try to implement it, but it's a great suggestion.

872
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:46,349
I'll definitely take it back to the powers that be and see what I can do to help move that forward.

873
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:46,850
Thank you, Ryan.

874
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:51,203
Teresa, do you know if that's in their scope of work?

875
01:02:51,223 --> 01:02:53,786
Because I'm not sure if standardization is assigned.

876
01:02:53,906 --> 01:02:57,789
As much as I agree with Ryan, I'm not sure that's what they're assigned to do.

877
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:00,011
But if they are, that's great.

878
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,073
I doubt that they are.

879
01:03:02,774 --> 01:03:14,164
But is this an opportunity to course correct or just jump on this and ride the coattails of this project to then induct some standardization?

880
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:27,434
If they take the lead on the wayfinding portion of it, then, I mean, we had talked about the interpretive panels because we do them, have done them for various projects.

881
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:39,998
So, you know, we would want some sort of graphic designer to help us, you know, sort of put that together and pull it together and say, these are the, you know, come up with three standard options, but, you know,

882
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:40,919
have it there.

883
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:51,998
So, you know, if they take the weight, you know, if they stay focused on this is how we display it for their wayfinding mission, then that will be enough for them, I think.

884
01:03:54,462 --> 01:04:01,285
Yeah, and as somebody who worked at an ad agency for 20 years, this is a pain point for me.

885
01:04:02,145 --> 01:04:04,786
It's like, obviously, street signs look one way.

886
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:07,087
Even your blue hospital signs look one way.

887
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:11,148
The brown old Paul Revere root signs look one way.

888
01:04:11,168 --> 01:04:19,012
There should absolutely be consistency, because your eye will just go right to it, and you'll know exactly what it is.

889
01:04:25,503 --> 01:04:25,723
Great.

890
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:26,584
Well, that's exciting.

891
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:28,947
I mean, the wayfinding project is exciting, so.

892
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:35,455
Okay, moving on to the database for historic resources.

893
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:36,476
Ryan, these looked great.

894
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:42,524
I looked at the samples you sent, and if you want to kind of refresh everybody on this project.

895
01:04:43,935 --> 01:04:45,916
Yeah, so we have all these inventory forms.

896
01:04:45,956 --> 01:05:06,344
There's probably like 2000 plus and part of the issue people were saying macros is not user friendly, so macros will be sort of the state level database that they maintain, but our goal is to take the forms and make all the information within searchable and usable and OCR readable so that.

897
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:13,925
so that search engines can pick up on the information within.

898
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:21,011
So Jess Farrell did an excellent job sort of coming up with three or different concepts.

899
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:29,779
I think the last one that I sent out sort of had like a user, good user interface, and they can code

900
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:34,077
to sort of meet the demands of what the forms are.

901
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:43,699
We just took a small area in the local historic district and Hillside Ave and just started to gauge like how difficult this will be to get the information out there.

902
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:56,642
And it seems like we can incorporate it, but I just, you know, sort of want to give you guys some time to find out what works, what doesn't, you know, at the surface level, what is, you know, is this really doing what it's supposed to be doing, you know,

903
01:05:57,362 --> 01:06:25,161
if you have friends that you say you know might be interested in stuff like that share away you know just to get some input and one comment oh go ahead i was just gonna say my goal i think is to integrate it into our existing website and to have it in our existing website rather than try to create something standalone because i want people to to remain in our website i don't think it's that difficult and even if we have a lot of

904
01:06:27,393 --> 01:06:30,775
data, like inventory forms and stuff, tracking, it's really static.

905
01:06:30,915 --> 01:06:32,835
Once it's up there, it's up there, so.

906
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:47,582
One thing I want to point out is that whatever we build, we need to have very clear language on it that something to the effect of, yes, here's why.

907
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:48,342
I am running into issues

908
01:06:53,413 --> 01:07:00,397
on property sales where people are having trouble getting insurance if there's an inventory form.

909
01:07:01,398 --> 01:07:07,241
Because these insurance companies are saying that the house is historic and we're not going to insure it.

910
01:07:07,782 --> 01:07:17,608
And they don't understand that all it means is when it's in macros or that if a Form B exists, all it means is that the house has been inventoried.

911
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:19,387
It's been researched.

912
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:21,908
It doesn't mean anything else.

913
01:07:23,469 --> 01:07:31,854
And so I just want to be, I don't think that there's a reason not to do it because obviously these things are in macros.

914
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,075
They're already finding them because they're in macros.

915
01:07:34,696 --> 01:07:36,156
I think it could be a beneficial.

916
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:48,210
point for us to have more language on there that explains what a form is, explain why it exists, and explain what it isn't.

917
01:07:49,558 --> 01:07:53,241
Yeah, I think- Nothing is historic until there's a determination made.

918
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:58,286
And just because an inventory form is created doesn't mean a determination has been made.

919
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:12,739
Yeah, so one of the things that MHC did is when you log into Macris, and I will demand that this will be the same way, before you have access to that database, there comes up all sorts of disclaimers which nobody ever reads.

920
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:23,021
But among those disclaimers is information that basically says to the tune of the Massachusetts Historical Commission has this database.

921
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:29,542
It's one of the many tasks of the local historical commission and state level historic commissions to document their community's resources.

922
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:39,525
They use a standardized inventory form and that when they receive the form, MHC puts it up on MACRS and that MACRS is the database to store.

923
01:08:39,905 --> 01:08:41,085
But inventory forms

924
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:51,375
or inclusion in MACRS in itself places no restrictions on what historic property owners may do and it also provides no designation.

925
01:08:51,755 --> 01:08:56,660
So that information... Right, but insurance companies don't care and they don't understand that.

926
01:08:57,481 --> 01:09:01,667
And so I'm just I'm just playing devil's advocate because I'm seeing it on my side.

927
01:09:01,687 --> 01:09:13,101
So I just don't want us to get complaints later on that that because this exists, their property owners that are having so I'm going to force them to make.

928
01:09:13,902 --> 01:09:24,695
To click a checkbox that says that they verbally agree with the statement that then becomes, in theory, and Ed may agree or disagree, it becomes a contract.

929
01:09:24,735 --> 01:09:31,403
In order to get access to that database, you have to agree that with the statement that says it's just documentation.

930
01:09:32,226 --> 01:09:34,007
But insurance companies won't care about that.

931
01:09:34,348 --> 01:09:35,088
They won't.

932
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:36,409
No, they won't.

933
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:45,696
But it clears us from any sort of wrongdoing, because we said the insurance company got it by going through and agreeing that it's documentation.

934
01:09:45,776 --> 01:09:48,938
What they do with it afterwards has nothing to do with the commission.

935
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:51,100
Right, but they can get it from MACRS.

936
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,881
They don't have to get it from us.

937
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:53,341
Correct.

938
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:54,803
And same thing.

939
01:09:56,475 --> 01:09:57,737
It has nothing to do with the commission.

940
01:09:57,757 --> 01:10:04,082
So if somebody's saying your inventory form did this, it's no, it's up on the state level.

941
01:10:04,122 --> 01:10:06,704
And even the state says that it's just documentation.

942
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:06,964
Right.

943
01:10:07,104 --> 01:10:10,007
I think we need to have very plain language.

944
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:10,927
Sure.

945
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,229
That explains what it is.

946
01:10:13,249 --> 01:10:13,329
Yeah.

947
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:22,177
We'll send this memo around and we can sort of dissect it and make it less state level and more local level.

948
01:10:24,244 --> 01:10:35,166
Do you have any idea why the insurance, it's not- Because insurance companies are looking for excuses to not give people insurance.

949
01:10:35,507 --> 01:10:38,647
Yes, so I- Why would that be a reason not to give it?

950
01:10:38,987 --> 01:10:44,028
You'd think that that would be like, make it even more insurable because it's going to be there.

951
01:10:44,048 --> 01:10:48,269
I think they think it's going to be too expensive.

952
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:50,070
There could be potential claims.

953
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:50,470
There could be

954
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,633
bigger issues that then they don't want to deal with.

955
01:10:53,653 --> 01:10:56,836
I mean, insurance companies want everybody in a box.

956
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:59,619
And if you have a historic home, it's outside the box.

957
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:04,425
Peter, just for an example, my insurance company,

958
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:10,725
canceled my insurance on the property I own because I had paint that wasn't proper on the house.

959
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:18,952
It was starting to scrape and it was winter and I couldn't paint it and they canceled it because they're doing what Jen said.

960
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:26,939
They're just looking for excuses to get out of certain, maybe it's certain cities, maybe it's certain neighborhoods.

961
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:31,603
I don't know what it is, but they're acting like bad players, frankly.

962
01:11:32,324 --> 01:11:35,205
They're all getting drones and they're going up and looking at roofs.

963
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:53,254
The discussion that I had on the historic preservation listserv from some people who worked in the insurance industry seemed to center on the idea that insurance companies and the underwriters all of a sudden realized that the language that they were using sort of demanded

964
01:11:54,294 --> 01:12:00,640
in full or partial replacement, that they had to replicate the house exactly one for one.

965
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:09,268
And that means materials, methods, construction, many of which are antiquated and just simply not feasible to reconstruct.

966
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:19,157
And therefore, the cost associated with that, like the cost to build a timber frame colonial is probably... Okay, so it's replacement costs that's their big...

967
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:27,500
Yeah, and so I think and I think a lot of you know This is sort of a will cancel the policy and then we'll work out.

968
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:43,287
Okay, it's no longer full replacement It's replacement in kind where you might have a similar looking building, but it's not a one-for-one so it really depends on the the coverage and who the underwriter is and and and what that definition of

969
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,647
replacement value is?

970
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:56,990
Because, you know, a lot of times I remember hearing like fire rebuilds, you can have replacement value, but if it may not mean replacement in full, bring it up to code.

971
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:01,832
It just means what was the cost of the building here if you were to build it today?

972
01:13:02,532 --> 01:13:05,553
And that's something different than actual reconstruction cost.

973
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,353
Theresa, you had a comment?

974
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:10,634
No.

975
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:25,975
I had just a thought in a completely different direction, though, which is if this is up on our site, I think the other thing we need to be prepared for are people requesting Form Bs for their homes.

976
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:30,136
And what's our response going to be to that?

977
01:13:30,176 --> 01:13:33,378
I mean, can they pay for their own and we would facilitate it?

978
01:13:33,398 --> 01:13:38,419
Yeah, I mean, they could hire their own consultant.

979
01:13:42,950 --> 01:14:00,304
wouldn't necessarily make it back to us, I guess, or maybe it would have to, I don't know, it might... I guess it sort of depends on, I mean, if it's attached to our site or... Yeah, I would be hesitant to, you know, unless that form

980
01:14:03,559 --> 01:14:12,930
I mean, I guess I wouldn't say no to an owner who wanted to spend money, but usually the forms have some sort of purpose, like to understand the neighborhood.

981
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:18,276
And we do want to understand individual buildings, but we also don't want people to necessarily waste

982
01:14:19,137 --> 01:14:25,582
waste hard-earned dollars on just creating an inventory form unless, you know, like, okay, I'm interested in my house.

983
01:14:25,602 --> 01:14:31,447
I do want to turn around and turn it into a local historic district, so the form is the first step to get me there.

984
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:39,033
That's fine, you know, or I'm just interested in the history, you know, that's fine too.

985
01:14:39,153 --> 01:14:42,275
I just... But if somebody hired a consultant to create a form,

986
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:44,952
And they paid them privately.

987
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:48,514
Would the consultant then send it to MACRS anyway?

988
01:14:49,434 --> 01:14:49,974
They should.

989
01:14:49,994 --> 01:14:51,235
They don't always.

990
01:14:51,635 --> 01:14:51,835
Right.

991
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:56,438
So I mean, we know it takes like sometimes a year to get the forms into MACRS.

992
01:14:56,498 --> 01:15:00,880
But eventually it would be there for us.

993
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,121
It'll be there a second.

994
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:04,562
So.

995
01:15:08,025 --> 01:15:10,546
I don't know, I don't know that I'm against that kid.

996
01:15:10,626 --> 01:15:24,871
I don't wonder if there's a way, I wonder if A, it makes sense for us to facilitate it or B, maybe we just provide a link to consultants that they can hire and go discuss the fee and... Or ask the historical society.

997
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:34,114
I mean, they're the ones who get everybody showing up wanting to research their houses because most people don't know about the historic, the Manfred Historic Commission.

998
01:15:35,463 --> 01:15:35,683
Right.

999
01:15:35,783 --> 01:15:41,269
Well, and, you know, we could just say the databases, the forms that we've produced for various projects, right?

1000
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:43,471
Macris still has the be all end all.

1001
01:15:44,271 --> 01:15:49,917
So our database is just mainly, primarily our inventory forms that we've created through survey and planning projects.

1002
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:54,361
But, you know, we could just say, this is not everything.

1003
01:15:54,381 --> 01:15:56,123
If you want everything, go to Macris.

1004
01:15:57,622 --> 01:16:05,385
If it exists, if it exists, yeah, and you can also know that there's a delay with macros too, right?

1005
01:16:05,405 --> 01:16:11,607
Because ours is mainly ours is more getting the information and content within the forms out there.

1006
01:16:12,608 --> 01:16:16,589
Macros is just, you know, is there information on this property?

1007
01:16:17,709 --> 01:16:18,910
That's all that I can tell you.

1008
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,191
And you know, sometimes there is sometimes there isn't.

1009
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,112
So yeah, Teresa.

1010
01:16:25,687 --> 01:16:31,009
I was just gonna say, I can also, we have a city solicitor on staff now, which is very exciting.

1011
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:37,052
So I can always have him weigh in on some verbiage to kind of make this clear.

1012
01:16:37,652 --> 01:16:38,933
That's right up his alley.

1013
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:45,116
So I'm happy to matchmake that.

1014
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:45,696
There we go.

1015
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:47,037
That was the word I was looking for.

1016
01:16:49,098 --> 01:16:49,558
Thank you.

1017
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:55,656
Okay, and then are we going to revisit this when Jess is back?

1018
01:16:56,197 --> 01:16:56,437
Yeah.

1019
01:16:57,178 --> 01:16:57,438
Okay.

1020
01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:59,000
Okay.

1021
01:17:02,544 --> 01:17:04,085
Okay, moving on the agenda.

1022
01:17:04,105 --> 01:17:09,231
Oak Grove, any updates on that?

1023
01:17:09,623 --> 01:17:11,545
Yeah, I sent around the stormwater condition.

1024
01:17:11,905 --> 01:17:16,389
The roads, as expected, are in pretty poor shape in that whole section.

1025
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:18,131
They need some reworking.

1026
01:17:19,432 --> 01:17:21,274
City's sort of wrestling with the cost.

1027
01:17:21,374 --> 01:17:27,980
I'm sure there'll be some combination of some will be repaved, some will be maybe graveled, some might be...

1028
01:17:28,962 --> 01:17:33,863
removed, you know, and just sort of restored to naturalistic conditions.

1029
01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:47,107
I do think we should weigh in at some future point if like say they decide to pursue preservation funding to sort of regrade the roads and kind to what it originally was, then that might be worth it.

1030
01:17:47,407 --> 01:17:48,528
There are some historic

1031
01:17:49,348 --> 01:17:52,089
drainage features, like you can see that there's a cobblestone.

1032
01:17:52,209 --> 01:18:00,850
All the cobblestone swales still exist next to the road, so there are sort of unique surface level features that are important to the landscape.

1033
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:16,273
But, you know, in the meantime, I think that's just one piece of many pieces of an Oak Grove master plan, so they should then take that information and keep going with other information for the rest of the cemetery.

1034
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:26,348
Yeah, and I mean, if anybody, if they're going to do anything with this road project, are they going to come before us and ask for a letter of support or something?

1035
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:29,870
I don't think so, but I do want to point out something that's very important.

1036
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:34,913
The entirety of the stormwater system in that area drains into Brooks Pond.

1037
01:18:35,953 --> 01:18:46,599
So although it is not really an automobile-intense location, you might want to consider doing some

1038
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:59,273
Reasonable level of stormwater management there that doesn't dump into or or confirms or doesn't, you know, corrects that where it's managed to.

1039
01:19:00,134 --> 01:19:03,996
There are better ways than just simply surface dumping into Brooks Pond.

1040
01:19:05,798 --> 01:19:08,840
So do we know is any of that addressed Doug in the?

1041
01:19:09,821 --> 01:19:12,082
Drive plans from from Ben Ash.

1042
01:19:13,343 --> 01:19:14,824
No, not really, because there.

1043
01:19:17,317 --> 01:19:20,418
Ryan, are you saying, which side of the cemetery are you saying is draining into the ponds?

1044
01:19:21,778 --> 01:19:26,160
The old rock, what's called rock, rock pasture.

1045
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,040
So that's the upper hill.

1046
01:19:29,441 --> 01:19:30,861
Yeah, that's the far hillside.

1047
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:38,383
And all of that sort of surface level road swales drain down into like a subterranean features.

1048
01:19:38,463 --> 01:19:44,825
And then their subterranean plans that they have on file in that report show it heading right towards Brooks Pond.

1049
01:19:45,578 --> 01:19:48,219
But that's from the cemetery side, not through the estate, right?

1050
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:48,899
Correct.

1051
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:49,500
Yeah.

1052
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:49,800
Yeah.

1053
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:53,141
So that, that's not the access drive, Jen, to answer your question.

1054
01:19:53,281 --> 01:20:01,464
So there's no, there's plenty of areas in the estate that go right into the pond because that was a historic marsh, you know, that's, that makes a lot of sense, including an underground stream.

1055
01:20:01,544 --> 01:20:12,068
But that is something we, that's the CONCOM, you know, they've got to deal with that as part of wetlands, as part of their, their purview to make sure that that is done right.

1056
01:20:12,128 --> 01:20:13,969
I will say that there's a meeting tomorrow night.

1057
01:20:15,085 --> 01:20:24,988
related to the cemetery expansion within the historic Brooks Estate, that Tim McGivern is going to go there and ask for more funding for the next round of design.

1058
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:28,390
Carly, the president of MNBELT will be there as well.

1059
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,690
We've had a meeting with them.

1060
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:33,371
We're trying to get into alignment.

1061
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:40,514
We're trying to go there with a common sense like where we all need to be on the same page for the design of that, for the access drive design.

1062
01:20:41,954 --> 01:21:00,899
And so I think we're beginning to have some decent dialogue with Tim McGiven and a few other people there to try to move that in a positive direction since we're all going to need many millions of dollars of funding for both the tribe and whatever future cemetery expansion happens that was conceived in 1997 but never executed for 28 years.

1063
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:02,879
A reasonable question.

1064
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,640
Did they throw out like a

1065
01:21:07,001 --> 01:21:11,810
site work number that they needed to actually develop that parcel.

1066
01:21:12,131 --> 01:21:16,259
And I ask this question because at some point

1067
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:41,899
the amount of money and you know so doing a cost analysis is the cost of developing that's like going to be paid back by the cost of the graves would it not make sense if that number is extremely high or the profit margin is low to just simply ask cpc to purchase of that parcel that parcel purchase money would then go towards

1068
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:51,020
a perpetual endowment for the cemetery which they already have so it's simply just you know preserving the seven acres there

1069
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:55,029
and having the cemetery get something out of it.

1070
01:21:55,049 --> 01:21:56,089
They're getting money out of it.

1071
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:57,909
They're getting an endowment out of it.

1072
01:21:58,189 --> 01:22:00,350
So they no longer need to develop the parcel.

1073
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:08,092
And yes, that puts them in a position of they no longer can accept people for burial at Oak Grove because they're running out of space.

1074
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:12,173
But I think the green space is far more important here.

1075
01:22:12,753 --> 01:22:22,135
And I just I'm deeply concerned about the city's intent on spending money there when it seems like it seems like it's not going to be worth it financially.

1076
01:22:23,236 --> 01:22:23,796
long term.

1077
01:22:23,936 --> 01:22:27,819
I mean, yes, you know, there is the benefit to weigh out.

1078
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:37,207
Maybe it does make sense to cost out and build out that space to provide more burial locations for people in Medford, but I just I don't see it.

1079
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:42,103
I don't know if you want to touch that one, Teresa.

1080
01:22:42,143 --> 01:22:43,384
It's a pretty loaded.

1081
01:22:43,444 --> 01:22:47,144
First of all, I love the creativity, Brian, for sure.

1082
01:22:47,264 --> 01:22:49,104
I'm trying to get it so everybody wins.

1083
01:22:49,204 --> 01:23:02,107
I know that was the bargaining chip back in the 90s that the Brooks Estate Board sort of gave up to get the house and to put the provincial preservation restriction on the property.

1084
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:09,388
But now I'm trying to think of how can we sort of make ends meet now where everybody wins with this parcel

1085
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:20,196
It's hard for me to imagine the Oak Grove Cemetery Commission thinking of giving up seven acres of future cemetery land as a win, but I'm willing to entertain anything at this point.

1086
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:22,057
There's only three.

1087
01:23:22,317 --> 01:23:24,279
It's only three people, right?

1088
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:25,440
So it's not a huge board.

1089
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,982
No, I know.

1090
01:23:27,422 --> 01:23:30,385
But I think they're clearly heading in a different direction.

1091
01:23:30,425 --> 01:23:33,447
But look, this is the time to think outside the box.

1092
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:34,609
This is the time to think about

1093
01:23:35,489 --> 01:23:46,397
All kinds of things, you know, and that's what I think, hopefully, the next level of design will, because again, you're right, if it's $3 million to develop X number of graves, what's the ROI for that?

1094
01:23:46,477 --> 01:23:47,298
Does it make sense?

1095
01:23:47,418 --> 01:23:51,321
That number, by the way, will be 4 million in five or six years, right?

1096
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:54,023
You know, we've seen how things escalate quickly.

1097
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,785
on any capital improvement project.

1098
01:23:56,925 --> 01:23:58,827
So there's a ton of moving pieces here.

1099
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:04,552
But I don't know if they're thinking about things like mausoleums and different designs.

1100
01:24:04,912 --> 01:24:06,754
There's all kinds of factors here.

1101
01:24:06,814 --> 01:24:10,717
Right now, this one plan, which we weren't a big fan of, we told them that.

1102
01:24:10,817 --> 01:24:12,839
And we said, let's try to work together on a better plan.

1103
01:24:12,919 --> 01:24:19,625
And they are, to their credit, taking that under advisement and looking for additional design dollars.

1104
01:24:20,228 --> 01:24:23,877
Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing that we should say that I could say is is.

1105
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:44,948
is to put it to the city voters that it should, you know, if there's a dollar amount and they have that dollar amount before moving forward with that plan, they should just ask the city and the city residents if that plan should be moved forward with or not.

1106
01:24:45,148 --> 01:24:55,415
And that will settle the question of, you know, yay or nay, it's not then in any of our hands that yes, you work together to come up with some proposal, but at that point,

1107
01:24:56,293 --> 01:25:02,177
then the city residents have directed, you know, the final outcome for that site.

1108
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:10,702
So, and then nobody can say, you know, we didn't look into every conceivable option.

1109
01:25:12,903 --> 01:25:16,946
So, but just trying to toss out different ideas.

1110
01:25:18,137 --> 01:25:18,878
you mean grenades?

1111
01:25:20,339 --> 01:25:21,700
I mean, they're not really grenades.

1112
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,003
Everybody lives here in Medford, and everybody has a role.

1113
01:25:26,043 --> 01:25:31,267
The commission has a responsibility, like we had to deal with Arlington Street.

1114
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:37,432
The trustees have a role to provide for the deceased residents of Medford.

1115
01:25:37,752 --> 01:25:43,417
So I mean, I just look at it as they're trying to do their job, where we're doing our job.

1116
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:45,438
The Berks Estate Board is doing your job.

1117
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:49,982
So it's just trying to get them to come together in creative ways.

1118
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:52,364
Fair enough.

1119
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:53,705
So.

1120
01:25:56,587 --> 01:25:58,148
OK, anything else on this topic?

1121
01:25:59,609 --> 01:25:59,969
We good?

1122
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:00,510
OK.

1123
01:26:02,311 --> 01:26:04,873
Anything on the cemetery, Ryan, Cross Street Cemetery?

1124
01:26:06,574 --> 01:26:07,435
The work is done.

1125
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:11,838
I put out a request for reimbursement from Freedom's Way.

1126
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:12,979
They're going to send a check.

1127
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:14,660
So Teresa be on the lookout for their check.

1128
01:26:16,423 --> 01:26:16,764
Okay, great.

1129
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:20,789
I don't think we have any updates on anything under demo delay.

1130
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:21,831
No.

1131
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:24,154
Okay, so no update there.

1132
01:26:25,957 --> 01:26:27,399
No update on Thomas Brooks Park.

1133
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:28,400
No.

1134
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:29,162
No.

1135
01:26:29,362 --> 01:26:29,602
Okay.

1136
01:26:30,504 --> 01:26:32,526
And anything on the Hastings Heights surveys?

1137
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:46,665
Yes, I'm working with procurement to get a draft bid docs together so then they can send them to the state and the state has some contracts work with us and then we can go out to bid.

1138
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:48,787
Fabulous.

1139
01:26:51,809 --> 01:26:56,713
OK, does anybody have anything else for tonight before we move on to our meeting minutes?

1140
01:26:59,295 --> 01:27:02,958
OK, and Peter sent around the meeting minutes and I will take a motion to approve those.

1141
01:27:05,057 --> 01:27:05,738
when someone is ready.

1142
01:27:05,758 --> 01:27:08,240
I think I've made enough motions tonight, so.

1143
01:27:11,422 --> 01:27:12,002
So moved.

1144
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:13,384
Okay, thanks, Doug.

1145
01:27:16,626 --> 01:27:17,026
Second, anyone?

1146
01:27:20,089 --> 01:27:20,369
Second.

1147
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,850
Okay, thanks, Ryan.

1148
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:29,376
Okay, motion to approve the meeting minutes from our August 2025 meeting.

1149
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:31,118
I will go around for a roll call vote.

1150
01:27:31,718 --> 01:27:32,118
Ryan?

1151
01:27:32,559 --> 01:27:32,719
Yes.

1152
01:27:33,559 --> 01:27:33,859
Kit?

1153
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:36,480
I'll abstain because I wasn't here in August.

1154
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,840
Okay, thank you.

1155
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:38,801
Peter?

1156
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:40,061
Yes.

1157
01:27:40,801 --> 01:27:41,101
Doug?

1158
01:27:41,641 --> 01:27:41,921
Yes.

1159
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:43,042
And Ed?

1160
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:46,003
I muted him.

1161
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:47,723
Oh, Ed, you're muted.

1162
01:27:50,744 --> 01:27:51,284
Abstain.

1163
01:27:52,084 --> 01:27:52,364
Okay.

1164
01:27:52,805 --> 01:27:57,466
Okay, so we have three, three pass, two abstentions.

1165
01:27:57,506 --> 01:27:58,646
You should probably vote, Jen.

1166
01:27:58,746 --> 01:28:00,627
I will vote to approve the meeting minutes as well.

1167
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:05,685
So four votes to pass, two abstentions.

1168
01:28:08,307 --> 01:28:11,469
Okay, I'll take a motion to adjourn, 8.32 PM.

1169
01:28:11,509 --> 01:28:13,129
So moved.

1170
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,110
Thanks, Ry.

1171
01:28:15,231 --> 01:28:15,671
I'll second.

1172
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:16,772
Thank you, Kit.

1173
01:28:17,532 --> 01:28:19,113
Okay, motion to adjourn.

1174
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:19,573
Ryan?

1175
01:28:20,154 --> 01:28:20,394
Yes.

1176
01:28:20,894 --> 01:28:21,134
Kit?

1177
01:28:21,595 --> 01:28:21,855
Yes.

1178
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:22,595
Peter?

1179
01:28:23,135 --> 01:28:23,376
Yes.

1180
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:24,076
Doug?

1181
01:28:24,676 --> 01:28:24,957
Yes.

1182
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:25,577
Ed?

1183
01:28:30,175 --> 01:28:30,635
Yes.

1184
01:28:31,236 --> 01:28:31,816
Thank you, Ed.

1185
01:28:32,436 --> 01:28:32,637
All right.

1186
01:28:32,677 --> 01:28:33,317
Thanks, everybody.

1187
01:28:33,437 --> 01:28:34,898
See you on October 6th.

1188
01:28:35,238 --> 01:28:37,080
Have a good night.

1189
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:37,660
Thank you.

1190
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,260
Thanks, Teresa.
