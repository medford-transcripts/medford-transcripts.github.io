1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send it to her.

2
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:03,117
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

3
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:04,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:13,728
[SPEAKER_02]: As we did last night, we're going to wait a minute as we just went live for us to for us to get our viewership up.

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night, we had went from zero viewers to about 200 in the span of about a minute.

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:23,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to give everybody that opportunity.

7
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Tom on or not?

8
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:47,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:48,345
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Peter Cushing.

10
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:52,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the assistant superintendent of schools for Medford Public Schools.

11
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are, we're happy to have you here again for another StreamYard.

12
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, just want to remind people, StreamYard is not like Zoom.

13
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:09,883
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of like a television broadcast studio where we have several people who come in and out during the course of the meeting.

14
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are also

15
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:20,631
[SPEAKER_02]: able to take questions when you submit them in the comment box to Facebook or YouTube.

16
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:25,915
[SPEAKER_02]: These videos are saved and logged there for in perpetuity.

17
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:39,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be able to refer back to them as necessary or if other parents aren't able to join us there will be a There will be a thing there will be issues there.

18
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:54,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I wanted to jump into right away was yesterday last night We shared some information that was put out by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as well as the governor's office and so we are

19
00:03:56,203 --> 00:04:04,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna share my screen here real quick and hold on one second, I apologize.

20
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I just gotta deal with a technical issue here.

21
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I get into that, I also just wanna introduce other people in the room with me right now.

22
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:28,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Suzanne Galluzzi, assistant superintendent of schools for the elementary level.

23
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, everyone.

24
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,371
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent of schools.

25
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:44,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And I look forward to continuing to get feedback from all stakeholders, parents, community staff who are participating during this Green Yard session.

26
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:53,244
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a lot of updates for you and we'll give you some similar information that was presented last night for those of you that weren't able to join us.

27
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:56,678
[SPEAKER_07]: just so that everyone has the same baseline information.

28
00:04:56,818 --> 00:05:02,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will look forward to answering your questions as they come in.

29
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

30
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:10,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then we'll also be having our superintendent resident Tom Malachewski joining us soon.

31
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:15,448
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to get started and not delay any further.

32
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:20,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our, we've got our, and here's Tom right now.

33
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, you want to introduce yourself to the community.

34
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:23,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, everyone.

35
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for taking the time to join us today.

36
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, you're good.

37
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,751
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good to go.

38
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good morning, everyone.

39
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:36,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for taking the time to join us today to share your questions, your thoughts, your comments, and your feedback.

40
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:46,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be moderating the chat, so I'll be doing my best to pull off some of the comments that are coming from Facebook and coming from YouTube, and to get as many as I can out to our team.

41
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize if I don't get to your question.

42
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:51,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, they've been coming in over the past few times.

43
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,401
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done this very quickly.

44
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:53,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of participation.

45
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'll do my best to get to as many questions as we can.

46
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:58,683
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're gonna take about an hour here.

47
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:05,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So just you can kind of, we'll be here till about 11 and just diving into some of the things that you throw our way.

48
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:17,018
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I wanna share my screen with you real quick and get you to this information.

49
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:23,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So this graph was first presented last week by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

50
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:26,585
[SPEAKER_02]: It's put out by Johns Hopkins University.

51
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you can see here, uh, the 50 States and Puerto Rico, uh, one of the American territories.

52
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so you have our, um, positivity levels.

53
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go down the line, you see right where Massachusetts is here.

54
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:52,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also one of them moved to the map that the governor's office released yesterday for the 14 days between seven 22.

55
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:55,804
[SPEAKER_02]: and August 5th.

56
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see the various color codings.

57
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:02,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Red is greater than eight cases per 100,000.

58
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see where those communities are.

59
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellow, four to eight cases per 100,000.

60
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:14,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Green is fewer than four cases per 100,000.

61
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the white communities are fewer than five cases reported

62
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: in total, not per 100,000, fewer than five cases reported in total.

63
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:29,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was provided by the governor's office yesterday.

64
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:40,082
[SPEAKER_02]: The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education released this color coded metric with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education expectation for learning model.

65
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so right there, you can have, uh, that for reference that was put out by the commissioner last night and is on the Desi website.

66
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so red is expected, uh, remote.

67
00:07:52,734 --> 00:08:07,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellow is expected hybrid or remote, um, if extenuating circumstances, uh, and then green, which is where Medford is green and white unshaded, uh, is considered full-time in-person or hybrid.

68
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:17,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here are the specific numbers for Medford, 722 through 85 that are published on the state website.

69
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just go to mass.gov.

70
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a tab for COVID.

71
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:26,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will link that to our Facebook page at the end of today's session.

72
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:32,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to stop sharing right now and head back into the stream yard.

73
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:32,698
So

74
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:40,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we will be taking questions now.

75
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to address our frequently asked questions.

76
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:50,690
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be producing those answers in an executive summary format by tomorrow night at 5 o'clock.

77
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We have teams of people working on them.

78
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:56,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We received almost 100 pages of questions.

79
00:08:56,973 --> 00:09:02,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to sort through all of that, there are many similar questions.

80
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:11,431
[SPEAKER_02]: sorting through them to provide executive summary answers to best address everybody's questions.

81
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:15,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're ready to take your questions at this time.

82
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,603
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I understand the survey is not binding.

83
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:32,986
[SPEAKER_02]: When will we have to officially select hybrid or remote for our children?

84
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believe we have to put in a formal request in during the first semester if we want to make a change.

85
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:41,823
[SPEAKER_02]: How likely do you think that is possible?

86
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:43,584
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

87
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:44,825
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, Bill.

88
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,346
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to start by saying that

89
00:09:48,852 --> 00:10:00,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The draft dynamic plan is being updated based on community input, educator and administrative input, as well as DESE input.

90
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:06,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've reached out to communities and districts to give us feedback on our plan as well.

91
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the middle of finalizing all of that so that we can submit it by the end of the week.

92
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:17,065
[SPEAKER_01]: The new deadline for DESE for finalization is this Friday.

93
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:29,543
[SPEAKER_01]: In that updated plan, which the community will see probably Friday, we have put in for some movement within plans.

94
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So, or excuse me, learning models.

95
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So we understand that it may not be a fit.

96
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:45,319
[SPEAKER_01]: for students if they started in hybrid or if they started in remote and wanted to move to a different learning model.

97
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,845
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that situations may arise in families where you need to switch models.

98
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:55,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have put some language in the updated dynamic plan to reflect that.

99
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:59,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, a family would put a request in.

100
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,576
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will look at the logistics of it.

101
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:10,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And the request needs to come in about, we're going to go by the semesters, the marking periods.

102
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:15,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So another piece is that DESE is requiring that all grading is in place and continues.

103
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:21,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So the typical grading systems and report cards will start day one.

104
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:25,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of lends itself to natural semesters.

105
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we're going to be

106
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:31,994
[SPEAKER_01]: switching and taking parent requests at that time.

107
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:42,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So about two weeks before the close of a semester, parents can formally request if they would like their child to have a learning model switch.

108
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:49,108
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the elementary level where there are three report cards and a winter break,

109
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:56,789
[SPEAKER_01]: their date for that first semester is Friday, December 11th, that they would have to put the request in.

110
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:09,152
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives administration and school buildings the time to work on the logistics so that it could go into effect coming back in January.

111
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:16,253
[SPEAKER_01]: At the secondary level, two weeks prior to the first semester close is Monday, November 2nd.

112
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that would go into effect when the new semester starts, which would begin Monday, November 16th.

113
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:28,772
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this is contingent upon capacity.

114
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:32,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to look at numbers and we have to look at balance.

115
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:40,415
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want it to be noted that if a parent is putting in a request for a learning model change,

116
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:54,127
[SPEAKER_01]: that it may include a change in teacher as well as classmates, because those models are not set up to share classmates or educators.

117
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are currently still in the process of impact bargaining.

118
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have proposed some dates.

119
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,463
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for confirmation.

120
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:36,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So the district lawyer and the MTA union representative, they are coordinating schedules to get those dates down.

121
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:40,056
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did propose three dates, there were some conflicts.

122
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:45,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are working, waiting to get what the new proposed dates are going to be.

123
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:51,778
[SPEAKER_07]: But ongoing negotiations will continue to take place between now and the start of school.

124
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay muted, because you can use this.

125
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next one from Patricia.

126
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:18,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that the hybrid plan allows for stage reopening slash return.

127
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,103
[SPEAKER_03]: What specific metrics are being used to determine that the next stage group can return to in-person instruction?

128
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:27,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in the graphic that we shared with the school committee on Monday night,

129
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:38,431
[SPEAKER_03]: It outlined some of the specific dates, potential dates of the phases, and also had a box on the side that said that that was contingent upon certain metrics being used.

130
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:45,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if someone on the team can just maybe speak about some of those metrics that are going to be used as we try to determine whether or not we can move in between two phases.

131
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly right.

132
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:54,929
[SPEAKER_01]: The phases right now go for every two weeks to bring in a new group.

133
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:06,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So using the metrics that were supplied to us yesterday by the governor and Commissioner Riley from the Department of Education, in collaboration with Medford's Board of Health,

134
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:12,127
[SPEAKER_01]: will help keep us aligned with our staggered approach.

135
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:23,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the metrics are, if the Medford community is still in the unshaded or green color code, then we are able to keep proceeding with our staggered approach.

136
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:36,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next question, how many close contacts do you expect students and teachers to have at each grade level?

137
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:43,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe this is a chance for us also to talk about some of the ways that we're trying to maintain social distancing throughout our buildings when our students come back in.

138
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:48,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And also a chance for us to talk about school-based teams and some of the work that they'll be doing to map some of these logistics.

139
00:15:49,297 --> 00:16:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So the school-based teams are going to be working to put up signage, to have signage on the floors, spray painting markers at the exterior of the building at six feet, and all those types of things.

140
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are really committed to limiting the number of students in the buildings to maximize

141
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: actually to minimize the close contacts.

142
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:22,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So close contact is very specifically defined by within six feet without a mask for X period of time.

143
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:30,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's all detailed in the dynamic reopening plan starting on pages 41

144
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: with general health guidelines 41.

145
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I also noticed people talking about, you know, if a student gets sent home, does the whole class get sent home?

146
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is not the case.

147
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:51,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So just please be sure to read through starting on page 41.

148
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Tony Ray, our nurse director wasn't able to be here today because of other meetings and commitments, but we will have her on again.

149
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:07,010
[SPEAKER_02]: in the near future for another event so that she can help answer all those questions specifically.

150
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:17,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a very, very detailed plan that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education actually praised in a phone call the other day because of its level of detail around these informations.

151
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, you know, we will be doing that.

152
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:23,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I also noticed another question.

153
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Tom didn't put it up.

154
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:31,228
[SPEAKER_02]: People are asking about a student who might have a legitimate medical reason why they can't wear a mask.

155
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:36,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we have purchased about 1,000 desktop screens.

156
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not one of the ones we purchased.

157
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,853
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a free sample that someone sent.

158
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:46,355
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll give you a sense of, hours are 100% clear all around, right?

159
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll go on top of the desktops.

160
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're made up of a stronger or firm material.

161
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:17,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So for students who aren't able to wear a mask for legitimate IEP or medically documented issues, that is definitely something that we will be working with.

162
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next question comes from Muzzy Lim.

163
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,852
[SPEAKER_03]: If we choose hybrid and part way through the semester, the schools are forced to go all remote.

164
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:34,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Will class continue to be taught using the hybrid schedule or just a remote schedule?

165
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously a circumstance we don't want to happen, but we're certainly planning for the possibility of that happening.

166
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know someone on the team can speak about what does that transition look like in the case that we do have to go all remote for everyone.

167
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:54,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, because the schedules will be created for students based on the learning model that they choose.

168
00:18:55,114 --> 00:19:02,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So students that are in the hybrid model, whether you're in elementary or secondary level, a schedule is created for you.

169
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:11,228
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are forced to close partway through at any time, we will stay in the hybrid model.

170
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:17,898
[SPEAKER_01]: so that the teachers are the same because the students have already started working with them and a rapport has been set.

171
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:28,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the length of the closure, the hybrid teachers will remain the same, but the schedule may shift so that

172
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:37,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be that your students are receiving two and a half days of virtual instruction and two full days of asynchronous.

173
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:41,769
[SPEAKER_01]: It would mirror a little bit the remote overall schedule.

174
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Those details are being worked out with the school-based teams right now.

175
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:55,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next question from Jessica, are all children with an IEP considered high needs?

176
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:58,999
[SPEAKER_03]: When will a parent be notified if their child has been identified as a high needs?

177
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And does that mean they will return to a hybrid platform on day one of school?

178
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we use the term high needs a lot in some of these presentations.

179
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:17,549
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's important for us to maybe clarify what exactly may be categorized as high needs in this circumstance, and particularly address whether or not all students on IEPs are considered high needs.

180
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:18,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll turn it over to Ms.

181
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Pelosi, who can address that.

182
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:39,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joan Bowen, the Director of Pupil Services, has been working around the clock all summer with many of us to ensure that student needs are taken care of and well thought in terms of scheduling and their IEP needs.

183
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:43,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So IEP needs in a remote situation

184
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:56,403
[SPEAKER_01]: remote learning plans are created in that case so that student needs are taken into account both in person and virtually, depending on what learning model families choose.

185
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:03,728
[SPEAKER_01]: High needs, as Dr. Edouard-Vincent has said many times, includes five protected classes of students.

186
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:11,233
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're specifically talking about students on an IEP, the high needs are for students where

187
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:21,836
[SPEAKER_01]: about 75% of their IEP academic needs encompass the school day.

188
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:34,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, if during a typical school day, your child has IEP services that equal about 75% of their day, then they are qualified as high needs.

189
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Joan Bowen is working on with her staff diligently is

190
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:44,153
[SPEAKER_01]: is coming up with groupings for students.

191
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:52,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would anticipate that you would be hearing something probably in September at some point.

192
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:57,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, our official first day of school is Wednesday, September 16th.

193
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:10,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what the school-based teams are working on right now are the schedules and the cohorts and all the fine details that we will be able to share with families in September.

194
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:19,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just want to piggyback and say that your first question explicitly, are all children with an IEP considered high needs?

195
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,320
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer to that question is no.

196
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:40,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That all children are an IEP, yes, they are receiving additional services, but do they qualify for receiving that 70 to 75% of the day where they have targeted physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapies?

197
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:48,898
[SPEAKER_07]: other related service providers that are working with their students, those would be the students that are specifically classified.

198
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ms.

199
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:57,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Joan Bowen and her team, they are reaching out to families, but that's still in the works right now.

200
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,382
[SPEAKER_07]: But every single student on an IEP would not be classified in that grouping, just to provide clarification.

201
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:06,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll hear directly from Ms.

202
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:07,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Bowen.

203
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next question relates to masks.

204
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,358
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes from Dana.

205
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:19,627
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the recommended protocol that ensures safety and health for all students and staff if a student is prompted to put on a mask and they refuse?

206
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,311
[SPEAKER_03]: What if a student can't use a mask due to medical needs?

207
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be individual plans for each student who falls into this category?

208
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:26,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn it over.

209
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to share one thing.

210
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:31,377
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of questions last night about whether or not masks are mandatory.

211
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to emphasize that masks are mandatory for all grade levels.

212
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:36,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's the given here.

213
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:40,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I think your question gets at sort of how do we enforce that?

214
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:45,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also how do we accommodate for students who can't use a mask due to medical needs?

215
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:49,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll turn it over to Dr. Cushing to give that level of detail.

216
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:55,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've detailed in our plan the specifics on masks quite extensively.

217
00:23:55,408 --> 00:24:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: We've added graphics on how students should be wearing them and all those types of things.

218
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:06,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And so quite simply, if a student does not put on a mask and refuses,

219
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,171
[SPEAKER_02]: the student will be transferred to the remote learning plan.

220
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:20,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the middle of a public health crisis and we need to do everything possible to keep as many students and as many teachers as safe as possible.

221
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:28,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that parents understand that you have the option for the remote learning.

222
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:32,876
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a personal belief or bias against mask wearing,

223
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:46,653
[SPEAKER_02]: despite it being proven to have really helped to get Massachusetts where it is, the three big things are wearing a mask, which you can buy at bcmask.com for your Medford branding.

224
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:50,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, all right, physical distancing.

225
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:56,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three, frequent hand washing slash hand sanitization.

226
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:07,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, if a student refuses, then unfortunately they will be, um, they will be part of the remote learning plan.

227
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we need our staff and students to be safe.

228
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:28,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, and those students with medical needs, uh, I addressed this a little bit ago, Dana, but just in case you didn't see it, your question may have been, um, we will be providing these desk shields for students as well as having them maintain that six feet of distance.

229
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, that is, that is where we are with that.

230
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on page 13, yep, page 13.

231
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:48,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have the, uh, we have the masks, uh, quite here you go.

232
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sorry, page 14.

233
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:53,442
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our masks right there.

234
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:57,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, the full color, the full color does it more justice.

235
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:02,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, we've got a student mask right there.

236
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to go really heavy on the graphics.

237
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:08,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so boom.

238
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:17,438
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so our next question relates to computer usage.

239
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:21,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the district issue Chromebooks formatted in a way to personalize the user?

240
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:29,361
[SPEAKER_03]: The school Chromebook that we borrowed in the spring consistently logged off the internet, would not allow password slash websites to be saved, and would not allow Zoom to be downloaded.

241
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:35,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I have had to set up, log in my first grader multiple times a day so she gets the content she needed.

242
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like our team and Guus to address just some of the consistency that we're striving for and maybe some of the lessons that we've learned from, you know, our taking on remote in the spring and now how that may look different here in the fall.

243
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right, Tom.

244
00:26:50,795 --> 00:27:01,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So we heard this concern a lot when we asked for feedback from families in the community based on how last year's remote experience was.

245
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:14,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that consistency piece and also having students create a little bit more ease for access on a lot of the educational platforms and websites that they need to go on

246
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:19,481
[SPEAKER_01]: The district is now going to utilize a system called Clever.

247
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:24,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It is detailed in our dynamic plan and we've even included a link.

248
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:29,633
[SPEAKER_01]: so that if you would like to find out a little bit more about the Clever platform, you can just click that link.

249
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:30,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll bring you.

250
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:34,214
[SPEAKER_01]: But what Clever is, is a single stream platform.

251
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:39,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So using this, every student is issued an email address.

252
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:45,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the students use their Metro Public Schools email address, they just log on to Clever once.

253
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:54,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of the educational platforms that Metro Public Schools will be using at every level will be housed in Clever.

254
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:59,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all students will need to do is click on the icon that they need.

255
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:09,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it takes away having to keep and manage all of the individual logons and passwords.

256
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:17,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next question from Allison, have you considered creating a brief questionnaire

257
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: a smartphone, web-based, or a daily health check in upon arrival for each student slash staff.

258
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Many workplaces have implemented this already and it discourages people from having symptoms.

259
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn over to some of the team to chat through this.

260
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:42,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to share, this is something that our ESY team did and asked families to complete just a quick questionnaire before they sent their students to ESY for a way for them just to monitor their students and make sure they were coming in healthy.

261
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's certainly something that has been tried here in the district throughout the summer.

262
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:54,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn over someone from the team who can share maybe what that might look like possibly in the fall and if we don't have the answer maybe just a good idea for us to consider as well.

263
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:58,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually have a really good answer on that.

264
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:03,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are going to be working with a company called AlphaMed.

265
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:13,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really awesome is that these types of services is driving some profitability for some companies during this COVID crisis.

266
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:20,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these apps usually have a per user fee that Medford would be paying around $30,000 to use this app for the school year.

267
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:28,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, because we have a connection, we have an app.

268
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:30,592
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called AlphaMed.

269
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:38,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of a Medford connection, we are able to do this for free, which is really awesome.

270
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be pushing that out.

271
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:45,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really phenomenal that we're going to have this app.

272
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So visitors to the building will be expected to use it.

273
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,663
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these types of things are really, really important.

274
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:55,726
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are going to have this so that people can do it.

275
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:57,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we need people to be honest.

276
00:29:57,988 --> 00:29:59,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's be honest here.

277
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,612
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a community now more than ever.

278
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,473
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

279
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:09,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And we cannot be selfish and put others in jeopardy.

280
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:13,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we have to be very careful with how we travel.

281
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be very careful with how we do things for the greater good.

282
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:34,382
[SPEAKER_02]: uh and so that's so critically important look wearing a mask isn't comfortable all right but we need to do it and we need to be very careful with who we associate with in our circle of friends right now

283
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:39,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate the, uh, I hate the concept of this new normal.

284
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's the temporary normal.

285
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:42,404
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

286
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

287
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's not the new normal.

288
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:51,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's the temporary normal so that we can get back to, uh, the society that we want to be.

289
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:57,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so just want to say that we have that and we need people to be honest upfront and working with us.

290
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:03,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should just know that we are working on, um, language to inform parents.

291
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,428
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding the alphabet and how it will be utilized as part of the daily correspondence with schools.

292
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:14,133
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

293
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:15,275
[SPEAKER_03]: great.

294
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:18,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not able to pull, I can't find the question on here.

295
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it disappeared with a great question.

296
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to, I'm going to raise a comment that was related.

297
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:29,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It was from Jamie Lee who actually helped answer a question for us about sibling preferences.

298
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: The other, the other question I'm asking, how will the cohort be developed from a single parent to a child with multiple grades of two to six?

299
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:39,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it will still be taking into account

300
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:48,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that this is a huge topic of questions related to learning pods and families will ask, can they possibly make their own pods?

301
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:55,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So just want to maybe we can talk through the process of how are we going to develop our cohorts and especially, you know, taking sibling preference.

302
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:04,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to start by just saying that sibling preference and working with families is critically important.

303
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:14,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we get the surveys in and we were just this morning, we were almost at 2000 surveys within two days.

304
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So parent response has been phenomenal.

305
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:25,414
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to continue to send reminders out, but we need parents to fill out that survey.

306
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:29,319
[SPEAKER_07]: in order for us to have an idea of what the numbers are.

307
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:36,806
[SPEAKER_07]: The one constraint is where cohorts are concerned, where families have children in more than one building.

308
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:49,958
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to be able to have families have their children participating in the hybrid model on the same day, so that as a family unit,

309
00:32:50,511 --> 00:33:04,741
[SPEAKER_07]: to the extent possible, you're having all of your children, whether you have one at the elementary, one at the middle, and one at the high, if hybrid is your selected model, they would be participating in the same cohort grouping.

310
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:15,608
[SPEAKER_07]: The cohorts, to the extent possible, once we have the final data from the survey, we will start looking at the cohorts.

311
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:17,289
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been a lot of questions.

312
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,471
[SPEAKER_07]: As we set up the cohorts,

313
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:25,992
[SPEAKER_07]: for the hybrid instruction, we need to try to balance the classrooms.

314
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:41,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for example, if there are 22 students in a classroom, we wouldn't be able to have a cohort, Monday, Tuesday cohort, cohort B, have 19 students and only end up with two students

315
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:44,593
[SPEAKER_07]: and cohort C on the Thursday, Friday cohort.

316
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:49,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is something that we have to try to take into consideration.

317
00:33:49,734 --> 00:34:01,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that there have been a lot of questions and asks as community and family are trying to figure out how to manage groupings.

318
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:07,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are definitely gonna, once all the data is in and it goes to the school-based teams,

319
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:18,966
[SPEAKER_07]: they're gonna look at the cohorts, they're gonna look at families, trying to ensure that children are able, siblings are able to go to school on the same days.

320
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:27,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once we have that information, trying to balance the cohorts as much as possible.

321
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:32,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It might not be exactly 50-50, it might be 45-55 or 40-60, but we really need to keep the groups balanced

322
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:52,783
[SPEAKER_07]: to the extent possible so that the teachers have balanced groups of students and we're limiting the amount of students that are in a classroom honoring the six feet of space.

323
00:34:53,583 --> 00:35:01,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do wanna say that because it's possible once all the data comes in, that we could end up again with 19 or 20 students

324
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:08,702
[SPEAKER_07]: families selecting the same exact cohort and two on the other day.

325
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:19,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, we won't have that final information until the surveys are completed and it goes to the school-based teams and we look at balancing the numbers.

326
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:27,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I do ask for a little patience, but completing that survey for us will really help us to start moving forward with the next phase.

327
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:28,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

328
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:32,443
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ms.

329
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Brando, so right, so Ms.

330
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:37,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Brando, one of our great science teachers.

331
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:42,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So the HVAC system will be evaluated next week.

332
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:45,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as we get the report, we'll be sharing that out.

333
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:48,770
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the issues need to be addressed.

334
00:35:49,491 --> 00:36:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've actually added later in the document, you'll see coming out from a Harvard University publication, Dr. Joseph Allen does a lot of work on this.

335
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've added a graphic.

336
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:09,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a triangular shaped graphic that has been added to the dynamic planning framework.

337
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,971
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it's in the draft right now that is not published, uh, for our second run.

338
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:27,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Patty, I have no problem, uh, emailing that to you, uh, later today, that graphic, so that you can see it, but we will be sharing out the... hold on one second, I think we might be getting back feed again.

339
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mielczewski, can you mute your mic?

340
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:34,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that work?

341
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:35,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, perfect.

342
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:43,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really want to make sure that that HVAC information is clearly published to the community.

343
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:46,605
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have three engineers at the high school next week.

344
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:57,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I also saw Andrea mentioning, I think Andrea also mentioned related to this, I am curious to hear about individual classrooms being evaluated.

345
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have crews working on that.

346
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in the new buildings, there are individual classrooms

347
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:04,013
[SPEAKER_02]: where the ventilation isn't reliable.

348
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:20,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Arctic Engineering and our own team of maintenance crew have been there working on the outside buildings, replacing the belts, pulleys, driveshafts, motors as needed.

349
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,200
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that those buildings are fully up and running.

350
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:29,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, several of the buildings, I'm just, last summer was my first summer here.

351
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:36,083
[SPEAKER_02]: There was substantial work done on the HVAC systems last summer for various issues.

352
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, those buildings have been really focused on and well-maintained.

353
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:48,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have work to do with the high school and the report from WB Engineering, that's the company that we are working with,

354
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:56,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that report, um, is going to be part of a comprehensive plan to make sure that we're providing a safe space.

355
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:06,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And miss Brando, just real quick, you know, I mean, your science labs are where we want the rest of the facility to be for sure.

356
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:08,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so.

357
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:11,655
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

358
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:17,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So next question from Jennifer.

359
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:21,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Logistical question around remote and hybrid and just how we're going to be able to pull that off.

360
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:25,402
[SPEAKER_03]: You've said that all levels of classes will be offered remote and hybrid.

361
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:26,363
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that possible?

362
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:29,467
[SPEAKER_03]: There are classes that usually only run as one section.

363
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those classes getting split up or are teachers going to be teaching remote and hybrid?

364
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:43,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't know if someone from our team can talk just a little bit about how we are planning, especially, last, there was a question about AP and honors classes.

365
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:49,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Will those both be offered, you know, remote and hybrid, or do families have to select one particular track to access those classes?

366
00:38:49,766 --> 00:39:00,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if someone on our team can talk about just how, what types of classes we're planning on offering, and do families have to select a certain track to be able to access those particular classes?

367
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:05,396
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question, but what our intention right now

368
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:37,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, you're gonna have to start over.

369
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:38,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

370
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:40,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

371
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:41,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

372
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys, we're trying to manage the feedback.

373
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So we apologize.

374
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the feedback to really be causing an issue.

375
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So we apologize.

376
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:54,745
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to manage our microphones here.

377
00:39:54,985 --> 00:40:03,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for the audio comments because that triggered us to not to... Unfortunately, Ms.

378
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Galussi needs to start over.

379
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:06,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I was rolling.

380
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:16,236
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want parents to select the learning plan that works for their family and for their children.

381
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:26,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is the intent that Medford public educators will teach either the hybrid learning model or the remote learning model.

382
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:34,942
[SPEAKER_01]: How those teachers will be selected is a decision that needs to be made in collaboration with the teachers association.

383
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:37,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't have those answers yet.

384
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,467
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of

385
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:55,342
[SPEAKER_01]: high school level courses, the specifics of the scheduling, I'm sorry, we don't have more detail just yet, but the details of the scheduling is what the school-based teams are working on right now.

386
00:40:55,722 --> 00:41:01,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And those school-based teams were the second part of this planning phase.

387
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:06,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to wait until the school committee decision, which was just last Thursday.

388
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:07,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the first week.

389
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,033
[SPEAKER_01]: that the school based teams are getting up and running.

390
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:15,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we have the specifics on scheduling, we will let the community know.

391
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:27,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next question, while we try to get up on the screen here,

392
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,590
[SPEAKER_03]: is about just transitions.

393
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to find the question here from Erica.

394
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, there is a transitional year for freshmen.

395
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be orientation for ninth graders who will be remote until October 26?

396
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:53,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, maybe this is an opportunity for some of our team to chime in on just what are we looking at during those initial orientations for students, particularly thinking about those students who may be going into remote model, to give them the chance to meet their teacher and to meet their peers.

397
00:41:53,874 --> 00:42:00,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not only going to be looking at orientations for our ninth graders, we're going to be orientations for our

398
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be looking at orientations and trainings for our parents as well.

399
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:16,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So setting up sessions for parents to be able to watch, learn, to do it both live and on video at their own leisure.

400
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:27,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be working on putting together a slate of classes for them, but we will definitely be having an orientation for not only our rising ninth graders,

401
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:33,250
[SPEAKER_02]: but our rising sixth graders and others as we need and see fit.

402
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:43,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Also last night, we had a great suggestion to have StreamYards, this app to be used with our elementary, middle and high school leadership.

403
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:48,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said last night that we would probably set that up for next week.

404
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:53,285
[SPEAKER_02]: In all honesty, just given we have a tremendous amount of professional development going on next week.

405
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:58,637
[SPEAKER_02]: You will more than likely have to do that the following week, Monday or Tuesday.

406
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:00,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to put it off.

407
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:03,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just when we actually sat down and looked at the calendar.

408
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:11,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do want to make sure that we are providing you guys as much information as possible, as quickly as possible.

409
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:22,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, just being part of this process that, as I said last night, it feels like, you know, Medford used to build clipper ships in the Mystic River.

410
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:28,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like we're sailing a ship without a star or a map sometimes, and we're really trying to figure it out as we go.

411
00:43:31,324 --> 00:43:35,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there was a question that was about kindergarten orientation, so maybe.

412
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:55,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think just overall in our timeline, which is reflected in the dynamic plan, the commissioner gave every district in the Commonwealth 10 days so that staff have time to plan, work, collaborate, be professionally developed,

413
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:58,806
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as families that Dr. Cushing mentioned.

414
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:06,330
[SPEAKER_01]: But within those 10 days, we have earmarked three of them for orientation purposes at every level.

415
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:10,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So regardless if your family has chosen the hybrid learning model,

416
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: or the remote learning model, we are going to use those three days to create safe socially distant opportunities, possibly outdoors, for families, so parents and caregivers, as well as children to meet their educators.

417
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:44,561
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you're going remote, we feel that it's extremely important for you to be able to meet in person and start to build that rapport so that you can know someone more than just the pixelated boxes on the computer screen.

418
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:54,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will send out, you will probably be hearing from the building-based teams on your schedule for the orientation days.

419
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:07,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question that we're going to post from Mitch from Mom says, is there any update on the bus service for kids staying two miles and beyond?

420
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:23,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also know that that was a question that was asked on the survey, which was just asking how transportation preferences are for families, but also didn't know what are the boundaries that we're setting on who can access the transportation and what that looks like.

421
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That comment was at 1041.

422
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:32,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you mute your mic?

423
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:53,675
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so until we have a comprehensive understanding of the number of families looking to come into the buildings by a hybrid, what we need to do is we need to really stick with the two miles.

424
00:45:55,036 --> 00:46:00,660
[SPEAKER_02]: The two miles is a really, so our bus capacity has been reduced by 68%.

425
00:46:02,762 --> 00:46:11,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We can increase that a little bit by having students who have brothers and sisters sit in the same seat together.

426
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:13,350
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately,

427
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:19,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't have the buses nor the bus drivers.

428
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of you who don't know, there's a bus and van driver shortage in the state.

429
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:33,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is extraordinarily difficult for us to get drivers in a normal situation.

430
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:38,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so there was, there was that issue as well.

431
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, the buses, let me just give you a quick hit on bus cleaning.

432
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:47,585
[SPEAKER_02]: The buses will be sanitized in between runs MBTA buses.

433
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:51,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent about a half an hour speaking to a supervisor at the MBTA.

434
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:54,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no equipment to add for additional.

435
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they have no extra equipment to add additional runs.

436
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:05,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So the runs that we have will be the runs that we have on the MBTA.

437
00:47:06,786 --> 00:47:12,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Those buses will be sanitized and cleaned before the runs and they will be sanitized midday as well.

438
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So by having a hybrid model, we will naturally cut down the number of students riding those buses, but the MBTA is not adding any extra equipment for any public schools from what I was told.

439
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:39,345
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing too, I know we're going to move on to the next question here, but we are going to be

440
00:47:41,157 --> 00:48:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be working with Walk Medford and our principals are setting up meetings with a state representative who can help us organize walking school buses, who can help us organize students walking to school with parent volunteers and safely entering students to building and then walking them home.

441
00:48:05,857 --> 00:48:09,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, that's what we're trying to do.

442
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:13,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we know it's a challenge that really has no good answer.

443
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:16,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

444
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:17,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to go back?

445
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go to Megan's question.

446
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

447
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:29,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to briefly answer Megan's question, some of those decisions have somewhat been made for us through the Department of Education.

448
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:35,454
[SPEAKER_01]: So they released some standards regarding specialists or fine arts classes.

449
00:48:35,674 --> 00:48:41,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So in particular, as of right now, music classes cannot occur indoors.

450
00:48:42,095 --> 00:48:55,841
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means either we need to look at having those classes outdoors during in-person hybrid days, or most likely a lot of music education will take place virtually for students.

451
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:59,643
[SPEAKER_01]: The physical education requirements.

452
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:04,504
[SPEAKER_01]: They have given a different set of requirements when you're outdoors.

453
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:17,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if you have your students engage in a physical education class and you can keep the students six feet or more, if you can keep the students at 10 feet, masks do not need to be worn.

454
00:49:17,672 --> 00:49:21,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And those could be opportunities for mask breaks for students.

455
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:27,657
[SPEAKER_01]: But if students are six feet or closer, of course, masks have to be worn even during a physical education class.

456
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:39,350
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the other guidance from the Department of Education, it says to try and keep the cohorts with as less movement as possible.

457
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:47,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that might mean at the elementary level is that the students remain in the classroom and those specialist teachers rotate into the classrooms.

458
00:49:48,573 --> 00:49:55,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the secondary level, it just means that they're trying to cluster them so that there's not too much movement.

459
00:49:57,675 --> 00:50:01,577
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're also looking at having some of those classes be done virtually.

460
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:06,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I also wanted to jump in to say where specials are concerned.

461
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:24,725
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we're thinking about with the mixing of cohorts, if I were to use elementary schools as an example, where students may have art and they have phys ed and where the elementary school calendar, they have three terms, trimesters,

462
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:32,064
[SPEAKER_07]: that it may be possible to reduce the amount of interaction with different cohorts.

463
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:48,100
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing we're looking at, again, this is gonna be determined on the school-based teams level, is that it may be for a trimester, instead of going to five different specials, a student may have two specials.

464
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:52,128
[SPEAKER_07]: or three specials that repeat during that trimester.

465
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:56,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that reduces the mixing of cohorts.

466
00:50:57,009 --> 00:51:08,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, from September to, you know, early December, it could be, you know, phys ed and art, but these particular grades have phys ed and art.

467
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:16,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when the next term starts, it could be different specials so that, again, we limit the amount of mixing of cohorts

468
00:51:17,105 --> 00:51:18,606
[SPEAKER_07]: if in fact that is possible.

469
00:51:19,186 --> 00:51:40,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of this information, we're kind of on standby as the data is coming in from the parent surveys and we end up having hard numbers of what the interest is and what scheduling and planning we need to provide for our students.

470
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:46,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do wanna say that we have thought about that and at the school-based teams levels, depending on the setup of the school,

471
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:59,201
[SPEAKER_07]: and what could be available that that is something that would reduce mixing of cohorts and keep groups of students together for a longer period of time.

472
00:51:59,221 --> 00:52:01,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

473
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:02,803
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

474
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:06,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to add to the stream, Ms.

475
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:11,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Shulman, who's our director of... Oh, we lost Ms.

476
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:11,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Shulman.

477
00:52:13,827 --> 00:52:15,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually wanted to show you...

478
00:52:17,215 --> 00:52:25,862
[SPEAKER_07]: This question came up earlier about our students with disabilities or students who are unable to stay with a mask.

479
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:33,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clear all the way through, but if you can see, I'm putting it on the table.

480
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:43,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some of you, it might not even look like I'm behind something, but this is what we have purchased for our students.

481
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,562
[SPEAKER_07]: that have the need to be behind a protective shield, but they can see.

482
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:55,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it has four sides, one, two, three, and four.

483
00:52:56,364 --> 00:53:03,266
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again, it's, we'll sit on their desk or on their table, and they'll be able to be behind the shield.

484
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:10,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they're talking for students who may have a particular need, we have purchased these for

485
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:17,670
[SPEAKER_07]: students that have a specific need to use this in the classroom environment.

486
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:32,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are really trying to be proactive and we are really trying to think about all of the challenges that some of our students may have, whether it's a medical requirement to keep not only the students safe, but the staff safe as well.

487
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:39,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to show you that other artifact as an example for you to know that we are trying

488
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:44,775
[SPEAKER_07]: will those desk shields be able to fit on the smaller high school desk?

489
00:53:45,435 --> 00:54:08,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So this size desk shield, I would say if this particular one does not fit on the desk, then for that student or the students that would need, we would be able to, because we're only gonna have 50% capacity in a classroom that if we needed to move desks around,

490
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:11,712
[SPEAKER_07]: if we needed to move them around, then we could do that.

491
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:19,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing too, Dana, I don't know how well you can see it, but this model flexes at four points.

492
00:54:20,443 --> 00:54:27,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually put it on a desk and it's locked in at the bottom right now, but

493
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we would be able to actually wrap this around the desk and cut it as necessary.

494
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So this model allows us a tremendous, as it attacks me, this model allows us a tremendous amount of flexibility for us to be able to modify to some of those smaller desks.

495
00:54:49,656 --> 00:55:00,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The other option that we have is by pulling desks out of some of our middle and elementary schools, we can bring those up to the high school as necessary.

496
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So, great question.

497
00:55:04,023 --> 00:55:05,164
[SPEAKER_02]: You all have those options.

498
00:55:05,224 --> 00:55:11,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's try to get Ms.

499
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:11,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Schulman in.

500
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:13,748
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

501
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:14,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

502
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:19,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Schulman, thanks so much for joining us.

503
00:55:19,874 --> 00:55:27,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you were just working on our racial equity task force, but wanted to see if you had anything to add from your perspective.

504
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:36,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here just to answer questions that parents, students, or the community have, if I can be helpful related to counseling services.

505
00:55:36,925 --> 00:55:38,346
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't hear you.

506
00:55:39,951 --> 00:55:40,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't hear me.

507
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:41,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, we're good.

508
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:42,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can hear you.

509
00:55:42,535 --> 00:55:43,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

510
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:54,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I'm happy to answer any questions parents, students, teachers have, caregivers related to counseling services or behavioral health of students as we're gearing up for the new school year.

511
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:02,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so thank you very much.

512
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Vicki, I see a question about the N95 masks.

513
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:09,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible that students who won't wear a mask have behavioral challenges and they won't like remain seated.

514
00:56:09,893 --> 00:56:14,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Will teachers working with those special populations receive N95 masks?

515
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:16,777
[SPEAKER_02]: We can definitely work for that.

516
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:23,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of N95, we have KN95 masks really available to us and

517
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:29,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have ordered for all teachers face shields.

518
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:35,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna try to bring up a picture here of one of our teachers.

519
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:39,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'll just give me a second to find it and share my screen.

520
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:43,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have another question pulled up while I try to find it.

521
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:55,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just find a question here so that someone else can answer.

522
00:56:55,324 --> 00:57:00,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is there a plan in place for COVID testing?

523
00:57:01,346 --> 00:57:03,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So- Yeah, I can speak to COVID testing.

524
00:57:03,927 --> 00:57:09,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So COVID testing, we're working closely with the Medford Department Board of Health.

525
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:18,413
[SPEAKER_07]: For Medford public schools, for Medford public school staff, COVID testing will be available

526
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,521
[SPEAKER_07]: every two weeks.

527
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:32,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mayor Lungo Kern, the Board of Health, in collaboration with Tufts University, will be conducting COVID testing for Medford staff on a biweekly basis.

528
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:41,976
[SPEAKER_07]: For staff that have already reported to work, we will be able to start beginning testing the week of August 24th.

529
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:42,596
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working

530
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:49,972
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working on getting information back, specifying that.

531
00:57:50,032 --> 00:58:03,620
[SPEAKER_07]: But once the school year is in session, all staff in Medford Public Schools, teachers, parents, everyone who works for Medford Public Schools, COVID testing will be available on a biweekly basis.

532
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:08,964
[SPEAKER_07]: So people can continue to get tested free of charge to them.

533
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:15,508
[SPEAKER_07]: they will be able to continue to get tested throughout the year to ensure their safety.

534
00:58:15,969 --> 00:58:31,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford will also be having additional sites that is continued to be, we're working in collaboration with the board of health to figure out where the testing sites for the community and students will be during the school year.

535
00:58:32,152 --> 00:58:33,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is something

536
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:38,909
[SPEAKER_07]: that will be a separate ask, but it's part of the plan.

537
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:49,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working collaboratively, but for Medford Public Schools staff testing, COVID testing will be available for all staff on a biweekly basis.

538
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:50,334
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

539
00:58:50,954 --> 00:58:51,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

540
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to get back to that question about the, about students and then Sarah Hyman Witherill, you know, you've got a question as well.

541
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:03,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to do is just quickly share my screen.

542
00:59:04,885 --> 00:59:06,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second here while I...

543
00:59:07,658 --> 00:59:08,038
[SPEAKER_02]: move.

544
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:12,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a high school teacher by the name of Carla Andre Miss Andre.

545
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:15,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So she worked with us this summer.

546
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to Tanya Sullivan for sending in this picture.

547
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:22,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the signage up on the doors.

548
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,488
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on page 44.

549
00:59:24,988 --> 00:59:30,411
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not just you know, this is in the draft plan that is being worked on.

550
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:31,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not published yet.

551
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:34,754
[SPEAKER_02]: The original draft is still published.

552
00:59:34,894 --> 00:59:37,035
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've added the picture here.

553
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:44,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are, you know, this this face shield that you see here will be issued to all staff.

554
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, additional PPE, right here you can see, additional PPE will be provided to direct service providers in accordance with their role and job responsibilities as modeled by Ms.

555
00:59:57,915 --> 00:59:58,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre.

556
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:02,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know if you're on the call, Ms.

557
01:00:02,497 --> 01:00:08,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre, but thanks for being in our modeling session and really appreciate that help.

558
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to scroll down here just so that if I can find it quickly,

559
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what I said to miss Brando.

560
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:23,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's the graphic that I was mentioning patty brandel if you uh, I will send you that later on today All right.

561
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:33,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So but you see ventilate without door air increase filter efficiency and there's a flow chart, uh effect to this And supplement with portable air cleaners.

562
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all stuff that our engineering firm wb engineering Uh is going to be able to help us make those determinations on so i'm going to stop sharing right now

563
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:46,512
[SPEAKER_02]: and go back to the stream yard.

564
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:49,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take one more question if we can.

565
01:00:49,753 --> 01:01:03,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what about kindergarten screening?

566
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:06,560
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something about kindergarten screening for EL students.

567
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:11,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not able to get Paul Textera on the call today, this morning.

568
01:01:11,682 --> 01:01:12,163
[SPEAKER_07]: However,

569
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:14,769
[SPEAKER_07]: for our EL students.

570
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:23,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Our newcomers and our ELs are part of the five groups of students that are required to be receiving instruction.

571
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:37,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Our students with high needs, our EL students, newcomers, Desi is going to be sending out that official guidance, so a group of our ELs specific.

572
01:01:37,876 --> 01:01:42,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Our homeless students, our students that are in foster care, and early childhood students

573
01:01:43,391 --> 01:01:58,784
[SPEAKER_07]: were the five groups that Desi asked to be considered as part of the high needs group that schools will work at educating those students in a full-time capacity.

574
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:02,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to address that.

575
01:02:02,828 --> 01:02:11,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I wasn't able to have Mr. Textera on live with us today, but there will be additional guidance coming forward.

576
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:20,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we get that guidance, we will definitely pass that on to all teachers and families so everyone knows who's impacted by those groups.

577
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:22,128
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't stress it enough.

578
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:38,240
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you who are online today, if you haven't done the survey yet, please do the survey so that it can help us better prepare because the school-based teams have just kicked off and we need that data to be able to answer some of these questions.

579
01:02:38,982 --> 01:02:41,106
[SPEAKER_07]: So ladies and gentlemen, I really want to say thank you very much.

580
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:56,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is, like I said earlier, you know, sailing a ship without a star or a map.

581
01:02:57,041 --> 01:03:00,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for your patience, your understanding.

582
01:03:02,163 --> 01:03:04,824
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sorry that we don't get to every single question.

583
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:10,207
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, even if this were a Zoom, we wouldn't get to every single question.

584
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:14,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hoping that our frequently asked

585
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:17,710
[SPEAKER_02]: frequently asked questions document.

586
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow we'll provide some help.

587
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:22,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 100 pages of questions.

588
01:03:22,272 --> 01:03:29,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to try to answer them in an executive summary answer as best as possible.

589
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:36,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have two people to call today based on the conversations today.

590
01:03:37,577 --> 01:03:38,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ms.

591
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:38,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Anderson and Ms.

592
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Zotter, I'll be giving you a call.

593
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate the support of Medford.

594
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:47,954
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said earlier, we need our community to come together.

595
01:03:48,728 --> 01:03:55,094
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to put any selfish interests of, you know, traveling as we're approaching school.

596
01:03:55,775 --> 01:03:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to put travel plans on hold.

597
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do, then you need to hold out for the 14 days.

598
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Our staff, our teachers, there's a moral imperative to the work that they're doing to support our students and to help them for their future.

599
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,132
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and.

600
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:30,462
[SPEAKER_02]: their lives, we need you to be strong and enforce the mask wearing, enforce the physical distancing and enforce good hand washing frequently to keep everyone as safe as possible.

601
01:04:31,883 --> 01:04:34,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much everybody for your time.

602
01:04:34,986 --> 01:04:37,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna give it to our superintendent for final words and then Ms.

603
01:04:37,868 --> 01:04:38,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Galussi as well.

604
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:42,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say thank you to everyone who jumped on the call.

605
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the comments.

606
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to continue to go through those comments.

607
01:04:46,613 --> 01:04:47,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the feedback.

608
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:52,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel the outpouring of support from Medford has been phenomenal.

609
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:57,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It was noted even by Jesse the amount of community involvement

610
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:00,681
[SPEAKER_07]: community stakeholder, community feedback.

611
01:05:01,121 --> 01:05:02,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Your feedback's important to us.

612
01:05:03,342 --> 01:05:12,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, even though the proposed plan that we put forward, the staggered hybrid, the hybrid schedule was developed by the hybrid team.

613
01:05:12,688 --> 01:05:17,751
[SPEAKER_07]: The remote schedule was developed by the collaborative remote team.

614
01:05:18,391 --> 01:05:27,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And the communications work group, the steering work group, all of the feedback that was given, everything was taken into consideration and we are now

615
01:05:28,942 --> 01:05:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: finalizing our document where Dr. Cushing just showed you the screenshot of what some teachers will wear.

616
01:05:35,506 --> 01:05:41,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I was able to show you a sample of what the actual screens look like to protect our students.

617
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,330
[SPEAKER_07]: We have sanitizer.

618
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:45,592
[SPEAKER_07]: We have electrostatic sprayers.

619
01:05:46,532 --> 01:05:47,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You name it, we have it.

620
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:54,637
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone tells us about it and it's a great idea, we want to take the good advice, throw out the bad advice.

621
01:05:55,457 --> 01:05:57,098
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to keep our schools

622
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:01,232
[SPEAKER_07]: open, safe for both students and families.

623
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:05,734
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to help all those families out there that are saying they need help, they need coverage.

624
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:13,518
[SPEAKER_07]: The majority of people thus far are saying they want the hybrid, but we're almost at the 50% cutoff.

625
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:18,381
[SPEAKER_07]: So encourage your neighbors, encourage your friends to turn that survey in.

626
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:23,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And once we get that information, that information will be made public.

627
01:06:23,863 --> 01:06:25,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can also see what

628
01:06:27,414 --> 01:06:32,917
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the pieces of it that say what our community is saying they actually need.

629
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:45,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So your safety, your health, your health and safety, providing a consistent educational experience for our students, whether it's remote learning or whether it's hybrid learning.

630
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:54,291
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to provide a consistent experience because the feedback you gave us from the spring, we knew there was room for improvement.

631
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:58,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel that what we're offering is significantly improved.

632
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:03,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dr. Cushing just ran and got the electrostatic sprayers.

633
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:10,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, safety, masks, sanitizing, cleaning,

634
01:07:11,288 --> 01:07:16,853
[SPEAKER_07]: social distancing, signs, stickers, and tape is going to be on the floor, arrows.

635
01:07:17,393 --> 01:07:23,718
[SPEAKER_07]: The school-based teams will be determining, use this stairwell to go up, that stairwell to go down.

636
01:07:24,138 --> 01:07:26,660
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be bathroom schedules set up.

637
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:33,766
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try to do everything in our power possible to get schools up and running

638
01:07:34,981 --> 01:07:36,482
[SPEAKER_07]: so that everyone is safe.

639
01:07:36,622 --> 01:07:41,545
[SPEAKER_07]: COVID testing for staff, that was like the icing on the cake.

640
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:45,408
[SPEAKER_07]: We were so excited to get that news yesterday, caught off the press.

641
01:07:45,988 --> 01:07:47,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're going to continue.

642
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:52,032
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as we get the information, we're going to pump that information out to you.

643
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:54,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, thank you so much for joining us.

644
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the feedback.

645

[SPEAKER_07]: It's truly appreciated.

646
01:07:58,216 --> 01:08:04,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look forward to continuing these conversations and hearing your feedback so that Medford Public Schools

647
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:05,772
[SPEAKER_07]: can be even greater.

648
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:05,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

649
01:08:06,953 --> 01:08:07,573

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

651
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:16,721
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I just want to echo what Dr. Edouard Vincent said that, you know, the continued partnership with you is essential moving forward.

654
01:08:32,434 --> 01:08:33,775
