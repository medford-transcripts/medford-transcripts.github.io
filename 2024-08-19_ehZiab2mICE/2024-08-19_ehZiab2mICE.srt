1
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:39,099
Yeah.

2
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:30,657
[SPEAKER_04]: do do

3
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:51,901
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, check, check.

4
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:53,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everybody hear me, first of all?

5
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:54,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think so.

6
00:09:55,183 --> 00:10:00,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the 2024 Medford Jazz Festival finale, I guess.

7
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:01,847
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our last of three days.

8
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:11,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just so excited to be here at the West Medford Community Center, which Terry's gonna tell you a little bit more about that, because it truly is a historic space.

9
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:19,756
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of history here right on the Mystic River, and we've been doing this festival here for the last three years, though this is actually year five, hard to believe.

10
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:24,199
[SPEAKER_01]: of this particular kind of configuration of things.

11
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:28,721
[SPEAKER_01]: It started in 2020 as a virtual festival, and it's just grown a little bit every year.

12
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,884
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there are a lot of people helping out behind the scenes with it.

13
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:35,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, before we get into anything else, want to take a minute and thank them.

14
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go in order here.

15
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Galel and Avi Fagan doing the sound today.

16
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:50,990
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Medford Community Media and Kevin Harrington.

17
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,172
[SPEAKER_01]: We're there, waving to you.

18
00:10:53,192 --> 00:11:00,457
[SPEAKER_01]: At the table, I've had a student, I've been very lucky this year to have a student volunteer helping out every day.

19
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:03,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, one of my piano students, Alex Eckford, is at the table.

20
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,641
[SPEAKER_01]: So ask him for things if you need them.

21
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:15,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, of course, to my partner, Shayla McDermott, who is responsible for the beautiful programs that are finally there this year.

22
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:16,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is great.

23
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:23,496
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you feel like you enjoy something about an artist that you hear, please just flip to that page in the program.

24
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:28,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got links to all of their websites and bios and other projects as well.

25
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:35,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of all, I think thank you to Terry Carter, who is going to be kind of the master of ceremonies.

26
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,302
[SPEAKER_01]: This afternoon, he works over here at the West Medford Community Center.

27
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:43,263
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have heard him yesterday as part of the Ally Project.

28
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:49,628
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the former Poet Laureate of the city of Method, and has written six books, going on seven at this point.

29
00:11:51,209 --> 00:12:00,415
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of interesting material about everything from sports to social justice, and I'm sure he would be happy to talk more about that.

30
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:03,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and last, just to our organizational sponsors.

31
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:13,031
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, to all the individuals who donated, Susan Klein, Steve Shulman, and Ken Krause this year, along with all of our longtime Patreon members.

32
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:18,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is a subscription service, you know, we all have too many of them anyway, so what's one more?

33
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:23,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple dollars a month, it really does make a big difference.

34
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:29,161
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows us to put on our jam session series, which has been about once a month for the last couple of years now.

35
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,582
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good opportunity for

36
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:35,604
[SPEAKER_01]: student musicians, to interact with professionals, and just to explore this space once again.

37
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:43,669
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping this coming year to do some of them at Arts Collaborative Medford, which is a brand new gallery space that opened up on Mystic Ave.

38
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:51,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So please check those out if you haven't, and consider donating to that page, because it really does sustain all of the stuff that we do.

39
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And last, to our organizational sponsors.

40
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I should mention along those lines, I'm sorry.

41
00:12:56,858 --> 00:13:00,841
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a conveniently placed donate link at the bottom of your program.

42
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:06,807
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to that Patreon page, and then also there is a one-time Venmo link as well.

43
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:15,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you like what you hear, it is a free public event, but free events are not truly free, and so consider dropping a few dollars into that.

44
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:21,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, though, to our organizational sponsors, first and foremost to the West Medford Community Center.

45
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:23,033
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an amazing space.

46
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:31,078
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been so lovely to work with and so aligned with our mission, and we hope that we can be even more aligned with theirs going forward.

47
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:33,420
[SPEAKER_01]: They're launching some really exciting campaigns coming up.

48
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Terry and Lisa can tell you way more about that.

49
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,522
[SPEAKER_01]: To the Medford Arts Council, which has been a huge supporter over the last several years.

50
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,602
[SPEAKER_01]: To the Arts Alive Medford Foundation.

51
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:49,504
[SPEAKER_01]: To Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, who played yesterday, they were phenomenal.

52
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:55,966
[SPEAKER_01]: To the West, oh, to Arts Collaborative Medford, that space that I was just referring to.

53
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,207
[SPEAKER_01]: To Morningside Music Studio, who sent a student ensemble.

54
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Audience Sound Company, over there.

55
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:08,576
[SPEAKER_01]: to Members Plus Credit Union, to Triangle Manor, which is a really great t-shirt company in the city of Method.

56
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:15,999
[SPEAKER_01]: They made our t-shirts, and they have a lot of interesting stuff, to Nomen Copy and Print, and also to Medford Community Media.

57
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a true community effort to keep this thing going and to grow it a little bit every year.

58
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So please check out all of your local businesses.

59
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:28,764
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll hand it over to Terry.

60
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:32,605
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to tell you a little bit about this group and just about the community center as well.

61
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:43,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jonathan, and if you wanna give it up while you're doing it, Jonathan Fagan is the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival.

62
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,251
[SPEAKER_00]: We got together about five years ago.

63
00:14:50,271 --> 00:15:02,940
[SPEAKER_00]: He found me and was interested in that intersection between jazz and social justice and as a poet and him as a composer and arranger and pianist extraordinaire.

64
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,682
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to kind of figure out what we could do together.

65
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:11,605
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how the Ally Project got started.

66
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:14,346
[SPEAKER_00]: The big bass back there, that's Greg Toro.

67
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,048
[SPEAKER_00]: He's our bassist, and then John is the piano.

68
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:23,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And John Dalton, a drummer from Arlington, is our rhythm guru.

69
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:26,933
[SPEAKER_00]: So that band played yesterday.

70
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:31,965
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hot, I'm just going to say it, if you missed it.

71
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:35,329
[SPEAKER_00]: There are CDs, as a matter of fact, on the back table.

72
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in the CD of our music, it's called the Ally Project.

73
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,094
[SPEAKER_00]: We released it last year.

74
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hot, too.

75
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:44,998
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to get away from that.

76
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:50,122
[SPEAKER_00]: In any case, this is the backyard of the West Medford Community Center.

77
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:54,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an institution of West Medford.

78
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:59,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, we'll be celebrating our 90th year in existence.

79
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Started as a little men's club in the late 30s and early 40s.

80
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:10,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the mid 40s, some men from the community actually trucked over in old army barracks

81
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:20,326
[SPEAKER_00]: from Charlestown, laid a foundation, put the Quonset hut on top of the foundation, and that became the first community center.

82
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:34,874
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second building on the site, but in case you were unaware of it, West Medford is one of the oldest historic African American communities in the country, came into an existence.

83
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:41,556
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 1890s and has a really, really amazing history of achievement.

84
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:45,798
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into the building, there are two rows, an upper and a lower.

85
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:55,681
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper portraits, there's 28 of them, that is the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and those were shakers and movers and builders of the community.

86
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:01,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the lower portion is the West Method Afro-American Remembrance Project.

87
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:07,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really traces the contemporary history of an amazing community of doers and builders.

88
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:12,938
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in that history, and I hope you are, go in and have a look and

89
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,942
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, you can certainly hit me up or talk with Lisa Crossman.

90
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:24,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa Crossman back there in a white sweater, she is the executive director of the West Medford Community Center.

91
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:31,732
[SPEAKER_00]: And really through her leadership, we've really been able to rekindle a lot of wonderful programs.

92
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:36,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Our young people's programs are kind of up and running through after school.

93
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:43,902
[SPEAKER_00]: And I direct elder services, so the older folks, they come and see me three days a week.

94
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:49,347
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lunch, we tell stories, and we keep the history of the community alive.

95
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:52,890
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in any of that, you can see either of us.

96
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,271
[SPEAKER_00]: But you didn't come here to, you know, hear me chat, chat, chat.

97
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:59,031
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get to the rat-tat-tat.

98
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:00,591
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the drummer, obviously.

99
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,112
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a poet thing.

100
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:03,232
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we do that a lot.

101
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:08,493
[SPEAKER_00]: In any case, Jim Repp has been at a couple of our events.

102
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:16,235
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been at our jazz jams and, you know, he's been a fixture in the Medford Jazz Festival movement.

103
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:17,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought

104
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:19,876
[SPEAKER_00]: A no net, okay?

105
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:24,299
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that the fishermen don't get to throw in the ocean.

106
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,361
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real thing, right?

107
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,822
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nine folks back here.

108
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:40,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even think we'd be able to fit nine folks in this little area, but they're squeezed and scrunched in there pretty good together, and they sound just as good as they look.

109
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:49,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to let Jim introduce the members of the band because I don't have them all written down here and I don't want to do an injustice to anybody.

110
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:58,319
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, it's going to be a great mixture of jazz classics and standards and new music and I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.

111
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,142
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, the Jim Repa Nonet.

112
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:50,774
[SPEAKER_04]: do

113
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:11,994
[SPEAKER_03]: uh

114
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,308
you

115
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:28,045
so

116
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:28,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

117
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:31,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming, everybody.

118
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is Arnonet.

119
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The soloists on that were Mark Weissman, who is not on your program.

120
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:40,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is Mark.

121
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:44,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's filling in for Ed Harlow.

122
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:44,964
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing a great job.

123
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:47,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bob Hallfelder on trombone.

124
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:52,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll announce the rest of the band later.

125
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:58,516
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got the program, we're listed except Mark Weisman instead of Ed Harlow.

126
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:03,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next tune we're going to do was arranged by Bob Hallfelder.

127
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is The River Man.

128
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:06,463
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our version of that.

129
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:17,044
I don't know, where's our next stranger?

130
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:17,565
Okay.

131
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:18,726
Okay, very good.

132
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:11,166
do

133
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:38,577
you

134
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:02,552
you

135
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:12,376
Bye.

136
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:53,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

137
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:57,007
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Kathy Olson on the baritone sax solo.

138
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:04,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And she composed and arranged the next song we're playing, Tigert Valley.

139
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's funny how that works out.

140
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:09,652
[SPEAKER_05]: You play a solo and then we play your tune.

141
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go, Tigert Valley.

142
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:02,982
you

143
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:00,952
Bye!

144
00:38:50,129 --> 00:39:00,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was Kathy Olson again on her composition, Tigert Valley.

145
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:07,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Also featured Jonathan Fagan on piano.

146
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:13,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd like to do a

147
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:18,055
[SPEAKER_05]: our arrangement of a Cedar Walton composition, Dear Ruth.

148
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:21,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, this features some flutes and things.

149
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:25,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually features Jonathan again on piano.

150
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's Dear Ruth by Cedar Walton.

151
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:45,360
you

152
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:01,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, again, that featured Jonathan Fagan on piano.

153
00:45:01,822 --> 00:45:03,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Jonathan.

154
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:06,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I haven't announced the rest of the people.

155
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:11,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Phil Person over on the end there, he was playing flugelhorn on this.

156
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:17,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian Lewis on trumpet.

157
00:45:19,485 --> 00:45:20,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I've mentioned Bob Howlfelder.

158
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:23,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Barry Litt on drums.

159
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Barry.

160
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:28,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg Toro on bass.

161
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've heard from this side of the band.

162
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,381
[SPEAKER_05]: The next piece we've got is Red Dot Trail.

163
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,562
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of my originals.

164
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:42,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's based on, well,

165
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,440
[SPEAKER_05]: The title comes from a trail going up to Mount Monadnock.

166
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,641
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually turns out it's Red Spot Trail.

167
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And I named this Red Dot Trail.

168
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:53,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody wrote me an email and said, you got the name wrong.

169
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:56,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But Red Spot sounds like something out of Hamlet.

170
00:45:57,843 --> 00:46:00,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So we left it as Red Dot Trail.

171
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:02,944
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's our original version of Red Dot Trail.

172
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:16,188
Bye!

173
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:38,645
I'm

174
00:51:13,123 --> 00:51:13,224

175
00:55:54,091 --> 00:55:54,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

176
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:58,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Mark Weisman on tenor, Jonathan Fagan on piano.

177
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:04,276
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have noticed we were missing a few beats in these measures here.

178
00:56:05,117 --> 00:56:05,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in seven.

179
00:56:06,878 --> 00:56:12,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now we've got a Thelonious Monk tune featuring our bass player Greg Toro.

180
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:14,862
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Ask Me Now.

181
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:52,620
do do

182
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:44,637
you

183
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,440
You

184
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:46,765

185
01:03:27,245 --> 01:03:28,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Greg Toro on bass.

186
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:30,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me sit down so you can see him.

187
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:30,467
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is.

188
01:03:38,812 --> 01:03:40,993
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got another one of my strange compositions.

189
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:43,234
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is called Monkfish.

190
01:03:44,595 --> 01:03:47,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, there's a restaurant called that.

191
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:49,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote this before that restaurant existed.

192
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:51,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But they haven't given me a gig yet.

193
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,020
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll keep working on it.

194
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we go, Monkfish.

195
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:15,822
[SPEAKER_04]: you

196
01:09:31,252 --> 01:09:35,376
[SPEAKER_05]: As soloists, we're Mark Weissman and me.

197
01:09:36,116 --> 01:09:43,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Jim Ripa, Bob Holfelder, Kathy Olson, Barry Litt, and Greg Toro.

198
01:09:45,124 --> 01:09:48,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we've got an arrangement by Bob Holfelder.

199
01:09:48,486 --> 01:09:52,129
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a summer breezy tune.

200
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It is summer breeze.

201
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:57,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Bob Holfelder's arrangement of Summer Breeze.

202
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:12,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody ready?

203
01:10:12,115 --> 01:10:12,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.

204
01:10:13,116 --> 01:10:14,798
Two words of three.

205
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:14,958
Ready?

206
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:17,001
One, two, three, two, two, three.

207
01:12:07,085 --> 01:12:07,246
You.

208
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:35,697
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Bob Hallfelder's arrangement, and that was Bob playing trombone on that.

209
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:45,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, another soloist was Phil Person, who's over there playing cornet and flugelhorn.

210
01:14:45,767 --> 01:14:46,908
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got his flugelhorn now.

211
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:49,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got a composition by Phil.

212
01:14:49,911 --> 01:14:51,193
[SPEAKER_05]: This is called First Love.

213
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:47,901
you

214
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:17,384
you

215
01:16:57,742 --> 01:16:57,904
Mm.

216
01:19:48,089 --> 01:19:53,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was Phil Person playing Flugelhorn, and his composition, First Love.

217
01:19:58,414 --> 01:20:00,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, we'll do Minha Sodaje.

218
01:20:01,475 --> 01:20:10,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next piece we've got is a Brazilian piece by Jao Donato, Minha Sodaje, it's our arrangement of that.

219
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it means something like my nostalgia.

220
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone speak Portuguese out there?

221
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Minha Sodaje.

222
01:20:37,807 --> 01:20:40,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Three choruses on this, right?

223
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:41,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Three people playing?

224
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:42,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

225
01:20:42,068 --> 01:20:45,409
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on at B?

226
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:50,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do alto, bari sax, and do piano?

227
01:20:52,872 --> 01:20:54,132
[SPEAKER_05]: The piano's at D, I think.

228
01:20:54,732 --> 01:20:55,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

229
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:59,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not do piano there.

230
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:02,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to play one song?

231
01:21:02,295 --> 01:21:02,355
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

232
01:21:02,475 --> 01:21:02,615
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

233
01:21:02,635 --> 01:21:06,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we do alto, trumpet, and bari?

234
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:06,856
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

235
01:21:07,366 --> 01:21:07,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

236
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:45,894

237
01:25:52,756 --> 01:25:58,364
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Phil Person on cornet, Kathy Olson on baritone sax.

238
01:26:03,717 --> 01:26:09,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got our arrangement of a Tom Harrell composition called Train Shuffle.

239
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:19,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is train as in the traveling thing, and not coal train.

240
01:26:19,282 --> 01:26:23,143
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of things called train in the jazz world are spelled T-R-A-N-E.

241
01:26:23,423 --> 01:26:24,044
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is not.

242
01:26:24,884 --> 01:26:29,125
[SPEAKER_05]: This is train, T-R-A-I-N, as in the thing you ride in.

243
01:26:29,525 --> 01:26:31,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is Train Shuffle by Tom Harrell.

257
01:33:59,326 --> 01:34:00,227
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.

258
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:03,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get away from them speakers before Abby kills me.

259
01:34:06,072 --> 01:34:07,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming out.

260
01:34:07,173 --> 01:34:08,474

01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,841
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're around, you're going to stay in the neighborhood.

01:34:23,465 --> 01:34:25,026
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got t-shirts for $25.

268
01:34:25,106 --> 01:34:32,130
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that beautiful Medford Jazz Festival logo on it, designed by Shayla.

269
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:37,093
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got drinks, water, and sparkling beverages.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we're happy to be hosting the Medford Jazz Festival at the West Medford Community Center.

275

Yeah.

276
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:09,695
Yeah.

277
01:39:59,714 --> 01:39:59,854
do

278
01:42:06,518 --> 01:42:06,699
you

279
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:30,152
you

280
01:45:34,093 --> 01:45:34,174
so

281
01:47:10,646 --> 01:47:10,766
do

282
01:48:35,091 --> 01:48:35,793
you

283
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:12,518
you

284
01:49:40,997 --> 01:49:41,641
Yeah.

285
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:15,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

286
01:53:49,905 --> 01:53:50,350
Yeah.

287
01:54:30,242 --> 01:54:30,484
you

288
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:08,714
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the best sounding horn mics I have ever heard.

289
01:58:08,814 --> 01:58:16,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Between that and the Warrior 121, which is a... How are they getting feedback on this kind of thing?

290
01:58:16,801 --> 01:58:18,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is... Wow, that is...

291
01:58:33,404 --> 01:58:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they make them in England.

292
01:58:35,325 --> 01:58:37,307
[SPEAKER_06]: They make them in England, yeah.

293
01:58:37,447 --> 01:58:40,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It took about six months for them to do it.

294
01:58:40,649 --> 01:58:45,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I ordered them in 2000 when everybody was doing it.

295
01:58:45,232 --> 01:58:47,073
But they have them at the end.

296
01:58:47,173 --> 01:58:48,354
I'll order them over there.

297
01:58:48,394 --> 01:58:49,355
They might not be that good.

298
01:58:49,375 --> 01:58:55,359
But there are some bakers that are making really good stuff.

299
01:58:55,399 --> 01:59:01,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a guy in London named Michael Barton.

300
01:59:15,646 --> 01:59:16,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a cold 40-30.

301
02:01:20,655 --> 02:01:24,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Batman, let's just do the A part.

302
02:02:06,571 --> 02:02:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two.

303
02:02:09,434 --> 02:02:10,435
One, two.

304
02:03:35,485 --> 02:03:35,607
uh

305
02:03:59,196 --> 02:04:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it works.

306
02:04:02,581 --> 02:04:03,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Say the same thing about us.

307
02:04:28,359 --> 02:04:29,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everybody.

308
02:04:30,061 --> 02:04:31,223
[SPEAKER_00]: We are so happy.

309
02:04:32,084 --> 02:04:37,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you have stayed, and we appreciate your continued patronage.

310
02:04:39,053 --> 02:04:41,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Reaper's group was fantastic.

311
02:04:42,578 --> 02:05:01,401
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely i mean nine pieces that's about as much as we've ever fit in this area musically and they had a real big band sound it was very very engaging um and we so appreciate them coming out and playing for us today and now we have with us we have

312
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:12,623
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm like really, really geeked up because world-class players, you know, don't come to West Medford all the time.

313
02:05:12,663 --> 02:05:15,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we birthed some world-class players.

314
02:05:16,317 --> 02:05:18,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry Lynn Carrington, hint, hint.

315
02:05:18,619 --> 02:05:22,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're fond of world-class players.

316
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:23,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.

317
02:05:23,662 --> 02:05:27,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston Jazz Society used to have meetings here in Medford.

318
02:05:28,165 --> 02:05:38,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the best jazz musicians in the world used to hang out here and play sets down at Sonny Carrington's house and over at Jimmy Williams' house on Monument Street.

319
02:05:38,251 --> 02:05:40,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're used to world-class players.

320
02:05:40,212 --> 02:05:40,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.

321
02:05:41,693 --> 02:05:52,982
[SPEAKER_00]: But in contemporary times, to have a Kevin Harris and a Jason Palmer come through is just not going to happen every day.

322
02:05:53,022 --> 02:05:55,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are so glad to have them here.

323
02:05:55,304 --> 02:06:08,074
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kevin Harris Project featuring Jason Palmer presents lines, colors, shapes, and spaces unfolding a collage of compositions composed by Kevin and Jason that invite the listener, that's y'all,

324
02:06:09,706 --> 02:06:14,449
[SPEAKER_00]: to explore the power and beauty of seeing the world from different perspectives.

325
02:06:14,489 --> 02:06:19,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've actually had a whole weekend starting over at ACM of different perspectives.

326
02:06:20,354 --> 02:06:26,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin and Jason et al are gonna continue that direction.

327
02:06:26,799 --> 02:06:34,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining Kevin and Jason for this musical expedition, Yoni Ben-Eri on acoustic bass.

328
02:06:38,633 --> 02:06:42,097
[SPEAKER_00]: and the esteemable Tyson Jackson on drums.

329
02:06:43,678 --> 02:06:44,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

330
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:50,185
[SPEAKER_00]: You are here live and in living color at the West Medford Community Center.

331
02:06:50,686 --> 02:06:56,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider yourself privileged and welcome the Kevin Harris Project.

332
02:08:45,819 --> 02:08:46,120
you

333
02:09:13,361 --> 02:09:13,702
so

334
02:10:03,382 --> 02:10:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh

335
02:16:04,551 --> 02:16:04,974
Music .

336
02:17:38,942 --> 02:17:39,504
do

337
02:21:49,689 --> 02:21:49,829
do

338
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:55,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Check, check.

339
02:22:57,532 --> 02:22:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so much.

340
02:23:01,354 --> 02:23:04,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It truly is a privilege to be here at this festival.

341
02:23:06,137 --> 02:23:19,806
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, as Terry was kind of saying earlier, we don't take for granted when it comes to playing live music, and I certainly don't take for granted when it comes to playing for audiences like yourself, and especially with musicians like these.

342
02:23:20,467 --> 02:23:21,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all please give it up.

343
02:23:21,368 --> 02:23:23,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Jason Palmer on the trumpet.

344
02:23:27,992 --> 02:23:30,334
[SPEAKER_02]: On the acoustic bass, that's Yoni Ben-Ari.

345
02:23:30,374 --> 02:23:31,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all give it up one more time.

346
02:23:35,277 --> 02:23:37,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And on drums, holding it down over there, that's Tyson Jackson.

347
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:43,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

348
02:23:44,163 --> 02:23:50,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the very special things about being able to play this music is the fellowship.

349
02:23:50,908 --> 02:23:53,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some history, definitely, that I'd like to share with you all.

350
02:23:55,772 --> 02:23:57,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We all kind of know each other.

351
02:23:58,072 --> 02:24:03,858
[SPEAKER_02]: from overlapping at a jazz club, historical institution in Boston called Wally's Jazz Club.

352
02:24:05,179 --> 02:24:10,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the history kind of starts with Jason playing.

353
02:24:10,043 --> 02:24:14,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason, what year did you start playing there, man?

354
02:24:14,688 --> 02:24:14,668
97.

355
02:24:14,708 --> 02:24:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: 97.

356
02:24:14,728 --> 02:24:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason started playing at Wally's Jazz Club in 1997.

357
02:24:20,053 --> 02:24:24,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at that time, both Jason and I were at the New England Conservatory.

358
02:24:25,556 --> 02:24:27,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was coming down to check the band out.

359
02:24:28,198 --> 02:24:32,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it was inspiring, so other times it's intimidating.

360
02:24:32,201 --> 02:24:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It was both at the same time a lot.

361
02:24:34,962 --> 02:24:41,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the opportunity to just eventually start playing a lot of the music with those musicians.

362
02:24:42,267 --> 02:24:46,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fast forward a few years, we started to play in Jason's band.

363
02:24:49,605 --> 02:24:58,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, after Jason stopped playing at Wally's, I started playing a lot with these guys also at Wally's.

364
02:24:58,927 --> 02:25:07,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of the, you're looking at that kind of Wally's tradition, that swinging tradition that we do not take for granted again.

365
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:15,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, the thought that I had in mind is that in playing this music, I wanted to feature

366
02:25:17,941 --> 02:25:22,785
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the music that Jason has written and also that I have written.

367
02:25:27,468 --> 02:25:31,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It being kind of called, you know, having to deal with lines and colors and spaces.

368
02:25:32,893 --> 02:25:39,918
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the beautiful things we do as human beings is we can accept certain shapes and colors as they're put in front of us.

369
02:25:40,458 --> 02:25:44,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But the beautiful thing about what we do as human beings, we can redefine those shapes and colors.

370
02:25:45,682 --> 02:25:50,824
[SPEAKER_02]: When people put it in front of us, when they tell us life is supposed to be this way, we can redefine it on our own.

371
02:25:51,684 --> 02:25:56,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I kind of put that idea past Jason, Jason already has plenty of tunes.

372
02:25:58,146 --> 02:26:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: He truly is a consummate composer in his own right.

373
02:26:01,908 --> 02:26:05,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But he just kind of said, hey, man, I got some tunes in the spirit of that vibe.

374
02:26:06,409 --> 02:26:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did, too.

375
02:26:07,069 --> 02:26:11,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tunes we're playing today are kind of in the spirit of redefining.

376
02:26:11,971 --> 02:26:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: The great Frederick Douglass kind of talks about that.

377
02:26:15,032 --> 02:26:21,417
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things he says, he considers us poets and prophets that kind of look at reality as it is.

378
02:26:22,117 --> 02:26:27,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And as artists, we get to show the world what it could be and the reflection of what it thinks it is.

379
02:26:28,322 --> 02:26:30,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how Frederick Douglass kind of puts it.

380
02:26:30,864 --> 02:26:32,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of playing in that spirit.

381
02:26:32,805 --> 02:26:34,506
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're going to be doing.

382
02:26:35,167 --> 02:26:36,067
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play another tune.

383
02:26:36,968 --> 02:26:41,571
[SPEAKER_02]: That first tune that we played is a composition of Jason's called Belmont Stakes.

384
02:26:42,873 --> 02:26:48,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to let Jason talk just a little bit about it, and then we're going to do a little bit more playing.

385
02:26:48,809 --> 02:26:50,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to introduce you to this special artist.

386
02:26:52,526 --> 02:26:53,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thanks, Kevin.

387
02:26:53,587 --> 02:26:55,908
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'll give you my 30-second pitch on that tune.

388
02:26:55,948 --> 02:26:56,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wrote it.

389
02:26:56,688 --> 02:27:00,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And I live in a small town about an hour and a half north of here in New Hampshire called Belmont.

390
02:27:01,531 --> 02:27:09,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a dream that I was having a cookout, and Dizzy and Freddie Hubbard were lost.

391
02:27:09,855 --> 02:27:11,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And they got lost, and they just happened upon my house.

392
02:27:12,377 --> 02:27:13,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were hungry.

393
02:27:14,338 --> 02:27:17,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was in the middle of cooking, and I was so

394
02:27:20,541 --> 02:27:21,822
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, surprised that they were there.

395
02:27:21,842 --> 02:27:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told them about my composition woes because I was having writer's block, and they said, okay, let's sit down, I'll help you write this tune.

396
02:27:29,708 --> 02:27:42,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I did is I took the bass line from Manteca, some of y'all probably recognize that, and I put it on this tune, and then there was a blues form that came from a Freddie Hubbard tune called For Spee's Sake, within the form of the improvisational section.

397
02:27:43,497 --> 02:27:46,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the name of the song, Belmont Stakes.

398
02:27:46,439 --> 02:27:47,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a play on words.

399
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:50,742
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing equestrian about it, but yeah, that's that.

400
02:28:35,442 --> 02:28:42,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play it.

401
02:29:09,369 --> 02:29:10,529
do do

402
02:29:38,933 --> 02:29:40,454
do do

403
02:31:52,085 --> 02:31:52,285
[SPEAKER_03]: do do

404
02:35:11,855 --> 02:35:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: do do

405
02:36:45,406 --> 02:36:45,586
So,

406
02:42:09,721 --> 02:42:10,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.

407
02:42:10,681 --> 02:42:13,783
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a composition of mine called The Lonely Strength.

408
02:42:14,543 --> 02:42:15,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lonely Strength.

409
02:42:20,565 --> 02:42:28,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me also say that it's also a privilege to play with Tyson and Yoni.

410
02:42:29,209 --> 02:42:32,810
[SPEAKER_02]: We played trio on a few different occasions.

411
02:42:34,711 --> 02:42:36,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I'm kind of used to.

412
02:42:37,603 --> 02:42:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you add Jason to the mix, it's like the amount of trouble, good trouble, good trouble.

413
02:42:44,690 --> 02:42:49,294
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of good trouble we can get into is just abundant.

414
02:42:49,555 --> 02:42:54,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's amazing that we get to do this as professionals.

415
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:56,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still get to call it play.

416
02:42:57,422 --> 02:42:59,624
[SPEAKER_02]: We still get to call it play.

417
02:42:59,884 --> 02:43:02,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely a privilege.

418
02:43:03,587 --> 02:43:09,433
[SPEAKER_02]: This next tune we're going to play is a composition of Jason's called, Do You Know Who You Are?

419
02:43:11,681 --> 02:43:13,765
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking of getting in trouble I wrote this song

420
02:43:21,303 --> 02:43:25,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too long ago, but it is inspired by an experience I had about 15 years ago.

421
02:43:25,924 --> 02:43:28,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I was walking down the street on Huntington Avenue in Boston.

422
02:43:28,605 --> 02:43:32,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going into a market called Thornton's over near the Christian Science Center.

423
02:43:33,586 --> 02:43:36,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I was walking in, I thought I heard somebody call my name.

424
02:43:36,587 --> 02:43:37,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I turned around.

425
02:43:37,447 --> 02:43:38,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see anybody.

426
02:43:38,187 --> 02:43:39,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So I continued in the store.

427
02:43:39,247 --> 02:43:40,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I bumped into somebody.

428
02:43:40,468 --> 02:43:40,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And I looked.

429
02:43:41,368 --> 02:43:42,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was Dr. Cornel West.

430
02:43:43,388 --> 02:43:44,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time, I was

431
02:43:45,569 --> 02:43:50,452
[SPEAKER_06]: really into his books and everything, and been checking out some speeches and everything.

432
02:43:50,472 --> 02:43:51,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So I looked at him, and I was starstruck.

433
02:43:51,893 --> 02:43:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And I looked at him with my mouth wide open.

434
02:43:53,754 --> 02:43:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, do you know who you are?

435
02:43:55,696 --> 02:44:00,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And he looked back at me, and with this big smile, he said, of course, my dear brother.

436
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:02,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But the question is, do you know who you are?

437
02:44:03,601 --> 02:44:07,383
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the name of the song, Do You Know Who You Are, a line for Dr. C. West.

438
02:44:07,403 --> 02:44:14,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on it, maybe?

439
02:44:56,424 --> 02:44:56,505
Bye!

440
02:46:21,675 --> 02:46:21,816
you

441
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:35,001
[SPEAKER_02]: This next tune we're going to play is a composition of mine called West Bend Prophecies.

442
02:55:35,662 --> 02:55:36,782
[SPEAKER_02]: West Bend is a

443
02:55:38,662 --> 02:55:40,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in Kentucky, West Bend, Kentucky.

444
02:55:41,023 --> 02:55:46,506
[SPEAKER_02]: This past weekend was my 160th family reunion.

445
02:55:48,147 --> 02:56:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go way back, and as you can imagine, just the amount of history, kind of the good, the bad, and the ugly that are told are kind of unsurmountable when it comes to kind of realizing where we come from.

446
02:56:07,978 --> 02:56:12,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the great Maya Angelou said, we've already been paid for.

447
02:56:14,044 --> 02:56:23,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And this song is dedicated to the spirit of the family that came before me and before us that allowed us to kind of be where we are right now.

448
02:56:23,973 --> 02:56:26,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is West Bend Prophecies.

449
02:56:26,114 --> 02:56:26,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you enjoy it.

450
03:01:16,119 --> 03:01:16,199
do

451
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:03,722
you

452
03:04:45,134 --> 03:04:45,174
do

453
03:08:22,797 --> 03:08:47,234
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, again, give it up for the Kevin Harris Project.

454
03:08:48,530 --> 03:08:49,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Palmer.

455
03:08:49,210 --> 03:08:51,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let these guys close it out in a second.

456
03:08:51,811 --> 03:08:56,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, just wanted to say another thank you to them, first of all, for coming and being here with us.

457
03:08:57,653 --> 03:09:00,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of knowing Kevin since I was in middle school.

458
03:09:00,674 --> 03:09:02,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin was actually my first jazz piano teacher.

459
03:09:03,615 --> 03:09:06,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't think of anybody better, really.

460
03:09:07,156 --> 03:09:08,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just continued to grow.

461
03:09:08,657 --> 03:09:11,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love seeing the projects that he puts together.

462
03:09:11,138 --> 03:09:12,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a real treat for me.

463
03:09:13,158 --> 03:09:14,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that I get to share it with you.

464
03:09:16,321 --> 03:09:21,428
[SPEAKER_01]: On another note, I also want to thank some organizational sponsors too who've made this possible.

465
03:09:21,488 --> 03:09:28,699
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the people behind the scenes, Galelle and Avi doing sound and Medford Community Media.

466
03:09:30,484 --> 03:09:30,964
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.

467
03:09:31,885 --> 03:09:43,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Terry Carter who's been doing a lot of work to host us here at the West Medford Community Center and also our executive director Lisa who is just wonderful.

468
03:09:45,011 --> 03:09:56,417
[SPEAKER_01]: To all of our volunteers who have helped us throughout the weekend and all of the organizations that have given us grant funding, Medford Arts Council, the Arts Alive Foundation, Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice,

469
03:09:57,077 --> 03:10:13,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Arts Collaborative Medford, which is where we were on Friday night, along with Morningside Music Studio and Members Plus Credit Union, Triangle Manor, which is another local t-shirt company that's done our t-shirts this year, and Nomen Copy and Print as well, who's helped us with these beautiful programs.

470
03:10:14,524 --> 03:10:20,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, if you enjoy what you see, consider donating to support live music and events like this.

471
03:10:20,609 --> 03:10:22,790
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have plenty more coming up in the fall.

472
03:10:24,051 --> 03:10:26,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And also be sure to sign up for our email list.

473
03:10:26,493 --> 03:10:32,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I will put you on there and probably bother you a little bit more than you'd like, but it's still worth it, I assure you.

474
03:10:32,697 --> 03:10:34,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll hand this back over to Kevin.

475
03:10:35,299 --> 03:10:36,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for coming.

476
03:10:36,580 --> 03:10:38,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, stay tuned for more.

477
03:10:48,971 --> 03:10:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all again for being such a wonderful, beautiful, sincere, intimate audience.

478
03:10:54,938 --> 03:10:57,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we all in the living room just kind of hanging out, playing some tunes.

479
03:10:58,962 --> 03:11:01,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's Tyson Jackson on drums.

480
03:11:01,666 --> 03:11:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all please give it up.

481
03:11:07,338 --> 03:11:10,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You all can catch many of Tyson's projects.

482
03:11:10,801 --> 03:11:12,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow him.

483
03:11:12,442 --> 03:11:13,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of be curious.

484
03:11:13,683 --> 03:11:17,246
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a lot of great projects that he's leading in his own right.

485
03:11:17,887 --> 03:11:23,171
[SPEAKER_02]: On the acoustic bass, now residing in New York, as of recent, that's Yoni Ben-Ari.

486
03:11:23,291 --> 03:11:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all give it up.

487
03:11:25,713 --> 03:11:25,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

488
03:11:30,505 --> 03:11:32,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all make sure y'all follow Yoni, too.

489
03:11:32,146 --> 03:11:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yoni's playing with a lot of great musicians and also a great composer in his own right, too.

490
03:11:37,669 --> 03:11:43,233
[SPEAKER_02]: This very special guest and brother of mine, y'all make sure y'all give it up for this wonderful trumpeter, Jason Palmer.

491
03:11:44,293 --> 03:11:44,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason Palmer.

492
03:11:50,069 --> 03:11:57,216
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep it short, it's nice to have had fellowship with somebody who just inspires you for so many years, man.

493
03:11:57,236 --> 03:11:59,258
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very special brother right here.

494
03:11:59,378 --> 03:12:00,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Very special.

495
03:12:00,800 --> 03:12:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Very.

496
03:12:01,981 --> 03:12:06,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to play one more tune for you, a composition of Jason Palmer's called Moonlighting.

497
03:12:08,326 --> 03:12:08,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

498
03:12:09,146 --> 03:12:11,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a 20-second elevator pitch on this one.

499
03:12:11,787 --> 03:12:16,227
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so this one harmonically is inspired by a Moonchild song called The Cure.

500
03:12:16,247 --> 03:12:17,728
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of my favorite R&B groups.

501
03:12:18,308 --> 03:12:23,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And my daughter, she said to me about a year ago, she said, Daddy, you know, you can read a book by Moonlight.

502
03:12:23,789 --> 03:12:24,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know that?

503
03:12:24,369 --> 03:12:26,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, I should try that.

504
03:12:26,569 --> 03:12:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And so yeah, I kind of put those ideas together and came up with this tune.

505
03:12:30,190 --> 03:12:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, thank you, Kevin.

506
03:12:31,630 --> 03:12:32,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody here.

507
03:12:32,890 --> 03:12:33,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We love you dearly.

508
03:12:33,651 --> 03:12:35,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it's been a pleasure.

509
03:12:36,551 --> 03:12:41,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Frank Kazira, my college roommates in the house, wonderful saxophone player and his wife.

510
03:12:42,136 --> 03:12:43,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, thank you.

511
03:12:43,677 --> 03:12:55,907

522
03:22:51,508 --> 03:22:55,231
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so did I lie when I said world class?

523
03:22:55,811 --> 03:22:56,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I lie?

524
03:22:57,252 --> 03:22:58,513
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right, all right.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yoni Ben-Ari on what I refer to as the big sexy.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.

529
03:23:12,722 --> 03:23:20,668
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tyson Jackson back here beating those drums like Mike Tyson used to beat up on cats back in the day.

530
03:23:24,014 --> 03:23:25,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was the heat up.

531
03:23:26,805 --> 03:23:28,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all can go home and cool down.

543
03:24:22,835 --> 03:24:33,039
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our third year doing it here at the Community Center, and every single time I meet so many great people, some of whom say they live so close by, and there's such world-class talent around here.

03:24:48,517 --> 03:24:51,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just such special work.

549
03:24:51,801 --> 03:24:52,402
[SPEAKER_01]: It reflects

551
03:24:58,274 --> 03:25:01,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just very inspiring for all of us.
