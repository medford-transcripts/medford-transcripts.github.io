    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=591.021s">All</a>  right, check, check. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=592.122s">Can</a>  everybody hear me, first of all? <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=593.782s">Yes,</a>  I think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=595.183s">Welcome</a>  to the 2024 Medford Jazz Festival finale, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=600.286s">This</a>  is our last of three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=604.228s">I'm</a>  just so excited to be here at the West Medford Community Center, which Terry's gonna tell you a little bit more about that, because it truly is a historic space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=611.852s">There's</a>  a lot of history here right on the Mystic River, and we've been doing this festival here for the last three years, though this is actually year five, hard to believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=620.476s">of</a>  this particular kind of configuration of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=624.479s">It</a>  started in 2020 as a virtual festival, and it's just grown a little bit every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=628.842s">And</a>  now there are a lot of people helping out behind the scenes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=631.904s">So</a>  I just, before we get into anything else, want to take a minute and thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=636.066s">Let's</a>  just go in order here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=639.308s">We</a>  have Galel and Avi Fagan doing the sound today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=645.987s">We</a>  have Medford Community Media and Kevin Harrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=651.631s">We're</a>  there, waving to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=653.192s">At</a>  the table, I've had a student, I've been very lucky this year to have a student volunteer helping out every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=660.557s">So</a>  today, one of my piano students, Alex Eckford, is at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=664.88s">So</a>  ask him for things if you need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=668.482s">And</a>  also, of course, to my partner, Shayla McDermott, who is responsible for the beautiful programs that are finally there this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=676.127s">Which</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=676.828s">So</a>  if you feel like you enjoy something about an artist that you hear, please just flip to that page in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=683.856s">It's</a>  got links to all of their websites and bios and other projects as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=690.164s">And</a>  most of all, I think thank you to Terry Carter, who is going to be kind of the master of ceremonies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=696.499s">This</a>  afternoon, he works over here at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=700.642s">You</a>  may have heard him yesterday as part of the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=703.343s">He's</a>  the former Poet Laureate of the city of Method, and has written six books, going on seven at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=711.209s">A</a>  lot of interesting material about everything from sports to social justice, and I'm sure he would be happy to talk more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=721.323s">Okay,</a>  and last, just to our organizational sponsors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=724.005s">First</a>  of all, to all the individuals who donated, Susan Klein, Steve Shulman, and Ken Krause this year, along with all of our longtime Patreon members. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=733.571s">Patreon</a>  is a subscription service, you know, we all have too many of them anyway, so what's one more? <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=740.255s">Just</a>  a couple dollars a month, it really does make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=743.217s">It</a>  allows us to put on our jam session series, which has been about once a month for the last couple of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=749.241s">It's</a>  a good opportunity for <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=751.061s">student</a>  musicians, to interact with professionals, and just to explore this space once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=756.785s">We're</a>  hoping this coming year to do some of them at Arts Collaborative Medford, which is a brand new gallery space that opened up on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=764.39s">So</a>  please check those out if you haven't, and consider donating to that page, because it really does sustain all of the stuff that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=772.095s">And</a>  last, to our organizational sponsors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=774.256s">Oh,</a>  and I should mention along those lines, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=776.858s">there</a>  is a conveniently placed donate link at the bottom of your program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=782.203s">One</a>  is to that Patreon page, and then also there is a one-time Venmo link as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=786.907s">So</a>  if you like what you hear, it is a free public event, but free events are not truly free, and so consider dropping a few dollars into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=796.349s">Lastly,</a>  though, to our organizational sponsors, first and foremost to the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=801.793s">This</a>  is an amazing space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=803.334s">They've</a>  been so lovely to work with and so aligned with our mission, and we hope that we can be even more aligned with theirs going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=811.138s">They're</a>  launching some really exciting campaigns coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=814.079s">Terry</a>  and Lisa can tell you way more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=818.14s">To</a>  the Medford Arts Council, which has been a huge supporter over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=822.602s">To</a>  the Arts Alive Medford Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=825.142s">To</a>  Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, who played yesterday, they were phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=831.424s">To</a>  the West, oh, to Arts Collaborative Medford, that space that I was just referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=836.426s">To</a>  Morningside Music Studio, who sent a student ensemble. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=840.307s">Audience</a>  Sound Company, over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=843.154s">to</a>  Members Plus Credit Union, to Triangle Manor, which is a really great t-shirt company in the city of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=848.616s">They</a>  made our t-shirts, and they have a lot of interesting stuff, to Nomen Copy and Print, and also to Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=856.199s">So</a>  it's been a true community effort to keep this thing going and to grow it a little bit every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=862.861s">So</a>  please check out all of your local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=867.163s">So</a>  with that, I'll hand it over to Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=868.804s">He's</a>  going to tell you a little bit about this group and just about the community center as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=876.721s">Thank</a>  you, Jonathan, and if you wanna give it up while you're doing it, Jonathan Fagan is the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=888.269s">We</a>  got together about five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=890.271s">He</a>  found me and was interested in that intersection between jazz and social justice and as a poet and him as a composer and arranger and pianist extraordinaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=903.52s">we</a>  were able to kind of figure out what we could do together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=907.762s">And</a>  so that's how the Ally Project got started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=911.665s">The</a>  big bass back there, that's Greg Toro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=914.666s">He's</a>  our bassist, and then John is the piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=917.548s">And</a>  John Dalton, a drummer from Arlington, is our rhythm guru. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=924.071s">So</a>  that band played yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=928.502s">It</a>  was hot, I'm just going to say it, if you missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=932.826s">There</a>  are CDs, as a matter of fact, on the back table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=935.369s">And</a>  if you're interested in the CD of our music, it's called the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=938.692s">We</a>  released it last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=941.114s">And</a>  it's hot, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=943.016s">But</a>  I'm going to get away from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=945.618s">In</a>  any case, this is the backyard of the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=950.823s">And</a>  this is an institution of West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=955.207s">Next</a>  year, we'll be celebrating our 90th year in existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=960.291s">Started</a>  as a little men's club in the late 30s and early 40s. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=965.096s">And</a>  in the mid 40s, some men from the community actually trucked over in old army barracks <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=971.061s">from</a>  Charlestown, laid a foundation, put the Quonset hut on top of the foundation, and that became the first community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=980.606s">This</a>  is the second building on the site, but in case you were unaware of it, West Medford is one of the oldest historic African American communities in the country, came into an existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=995.334s">in</a>  the 1890s and has a really, really amazing history of achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1001.576s">If</a>  you go into the building, there are two rows, an upper and a lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1005.838s">The</a>  upper portraits, there's 28 of them, that is the West Medford Elder Photo Project, and those were shakers and movers and builders of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1016.241s">And</a>  then on the lower portion is the West Method Afro-American Remembrance Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1022.107s">And</a>  that really traces the contemporary history of an amazing community of doers and builders. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1027.893s">So</a>  if you're interested in that history, and I hope you are, go in and have a look and <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1033.459s">If</a>  you have any questions, you can certainly hit me up or talk with Lisa Crossman. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1037.242s">Lisa</a>  Crossman back there in a white sweater, she is the executive director of the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1044.787s">And</a>  really through her leadership, we've really been able to rekindle a lot of wonderful programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1052.233s">Our</a>  young people's programs are kind of up and running through after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1057.516s">And</a>  I direct elder services, so the older folks, they come and see me three days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1063.922s">We</a>  have lunch, we tell stories, and we keep the history of the community alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1069.407s">So</a>  if you're interested in any of that, you can see either of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1073.79s">But</a>  you didn't come here to, you know, hear me chat, chat, chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1076.651s">So</a>  I want to get to the rat-tat-tat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1079.171s">That's</a>  the drummer, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1081.292s">That's</a>  a poet thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1082.152s">You</a>  know, we do that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1083.772s">In</a>  any case, Jim Repp has been at a couple of our events. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1089.073s">He's</a>  been at our jazz jams and, you know, he's been a fixture in the Medford Jazz Festival movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1097.095s">And</a>  he brought <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1098.295s">A</a>  no net, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1100.737s">That's</a>  not something that the fishermen don't get to throw in the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1105.179s">It's</a>  a real thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1107.721s">So</a>  there's nine folks back here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1110.123s">We</a>  didn't even think we'd be able to fit nine folks in this little area, but they're squeezed and scrunched in there pretty good together, and they sound just as good as they look. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1120.629s">So</a>  I'm going to let Jim introduce the members of the band because I don't have them all written down here and I don't want to do an injustice to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1129.894s">But</a>  in any case, it's going to be a great mixture of jazz classics and standards and new music and I'm sure you're going to enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1138.759s">So</a>  without further ado, the Jim Repa Nonet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1250.694s">do</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1331.733s">uh</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1528.617s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1530.437s">Thanks</a>  for coming, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1531.678s">Yeah,</a>  this is Arnonet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1534.259s">The</a>  soloists on that were Mark Weissman, who is not on your program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1539.781s">Yeah,</a>  this is Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1542.822s">Yeah,</a>  he's filling in for Ed Harlow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1544.143s">He's</a>  doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1545.284s">And</a>  Bob Hallfelder on trombone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1548.907s">And</a>  I'll announce the rest of the band later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1552.851s">If</a>  you've got the program, we're listed except Mark Weisman instead of Ed Harlow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1558.876s">And</a>  the next tune we're going to do was arranged by Bob Hallfelder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1563.4s">And</a>  this is The River Man. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1565.422s">This</a>  is our version of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1901.755s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1913.644s">That</a>  was Kathy Olson on the baritone sax solo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1918.085s">And</a>  she composed and arranged the next song we're playing, Tigert Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1925.75s">So</a>  it's funny how that works out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1927.671s">You</a>  play a solo and then we play your tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=1932.614s">Here</a>  we go, Tigert Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2330.129s">And</a>  that was Kathy Olson again on her composition, Tigert Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2344.723s">Also</a>  featured Jonathan Fagan on piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2352.151s">So</a>  we'd like to do a <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2354.154s">our</a>  arrangement of a Cedar Walton composition, Dear Ruth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2358.996s">So</a>  yeah, this features some flutes and things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2362.337s">And</a>  it actually features Jonathan again on piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2365.217s">So</a>  here's Dear Ruth by Cedar Walton. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2698.959s">Okay,</a>  again, that featured Jonathan Fagan on piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2701.822s">Hey,</a>  Jonathan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2703.964s">So,</a>  I haven't announced the rest of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2707.929s">Phil</a>  Person over on the end there, he was playing flugelhorn on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2715.261s">Brian</a>  Lewis on trumpet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2719.485s">I've</a>  mentioned Bob Howlfelder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2721.647s">Barry</a>  Litt on drums. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2724.65s">Hey,</a>  Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2727.532s">Greg</a>  Toro on bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2731.416s">And</a>  you've heard from this side of the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2734.819s">The</a>  next piece we've got is Red Dot Trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2737.401s">This</a>  is one of my originals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2740.424s">It's</a>  based on, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2742.679s">The</a>  title comes from a trail going up to Mount Monadnock. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2747.66s">It</a>  actually turns out it's Red Spot Trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2750.081s">And</a>  I named this Red Dot Trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2751.301s">Somebody</a>  wrote me an email and said, you got the name wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2753.462s">But</a>  Red Spot sounds like something out of Hamlet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2757.843s">So</a>  we left it as Red Dot Trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=2760.443s">So</a>  here's our original version of Red Dot Trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3354.091s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3354.611s">That</a>  was Mark Weisman on tenor, Jonathan Fagan on piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3360.414s">You</a>  may have noticed we were missing a few beats in these measures here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3365.117s">That</a>  was in seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3366.878s">Okay,</a>  now we've got a Thelonious Monk tune featuring our bass player Greg Toro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3373.601s">This</a>  is Ask Me Now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3807.245s">Hey,</a>  Greg Toro on bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3808.866s">Let</a>  me sit down so you can see him. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3810.107s">There</a>  he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3818.812s">We've</a>  got another one of my strange compositions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3821.213s">This</a>  one is called Monkfish. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3824.595s">And</a>  actually, there's a restaurant called that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3827.197s">I</a>  wrote this before that restaurant existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3829.738s">But</a>  they haven't given me a gig yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3831.959s">But</a>  I'll keep working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=3833.36s">So</a>  here we go, Monkfish.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8654.708s">97.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8654.728s">Jason</a>  started playing at Wally's Jazz Club in 1997. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8660.053s">And</a>  then at that time, both Jason and I were at the New England Conservatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8665.556s">And</a>  so I was coming down to check the band out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8668.198s">And</a>  sometimes it was inspiring, so other times it's intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8672.201s">It</a>  was both at the same time a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8674.962s">And</a>  I had the opportunity to just eventually start playing a lot of the music with those musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8682.267s">And</a>  then fast forward a few years, we started to play in Jason's band. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8689.605s">And</a>  then after that, after Jason stopped playing at Wally's, I started playing a lot with these guys also at Wally's. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8698.927s">So</a>  this is kind of the, you're looking at that kind of Wally's tradition, that swinging tradition that we do not take for granted again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8709.67s">Today,</a>  the thought that I had in mind is that in playing this music, I wanted to feature <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8717.941s">some</a>  of the music that Jason has written and also that I have written. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8727.468s">It</a>  being kind of called, you know, having to deal with lines and colors and spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8732.893s">One</a>  of the beautiful things we do as human beings is we can accept certain shapes and colors as they're put in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8740.458s">But</a>  the beautiful thing about what we do as human beings, we can redefine those shapes and colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8745.682s">When</a>  people put it in front of us, when they tell us life is supposed to be this way, we can redefine it on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8751.684s">And</a>  so when I kind of put that idea past Jason, Jason already has plenty of tunes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8758.146s">He</a>  truly is a consummate composer in his own right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8761.908s">But</a>  he just kind of said, hey, man, I got some tunes in the spirit of that vibe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8766.409s">And</a>  I did, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8767.069s">So</a>  the tunes we're playing today are kind of in the spirit of redefining. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8771.971s">The</a>  great Frederick Douglass kind of talks about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8775.032s">One</a>  of the things he says, he considers us poets and prophets that kind of look at reality as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8782.117s">And</a>  as artists, we get to show the world what it could be and the reflection of what it thinks it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8788.322s">That's</a>  how Frederick Douglass kind of puts it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8790.864s">So</a>  we're kind of playing in that spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8792.805s">That's</a>  what we're going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8795.167s">We'll</a>  play another tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8796.968s">That</a>  first tune that we played is a composition of Jason's called Belmont Stakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8802.873s">And</a>  I'm going to let Jason talk just a little bit about it, and then we're going to do a little bit more playing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8808.809s">I</a>  just want to introduce you to this special artist.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8812.526s">Oh,</a>  thanks, Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8813.587s">OK,</a>  I'll give you my 30-second pitch on that tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8815.948s">I</a>  just wrote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8816.688s">And</a>  I live in a small town about an hour and a half north of here in New Hampshire called Belmont. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8821.531s">And</a>  I had a dream that I was having a cookout, and Dizzy and Freddie Hubbard were lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8829.855s">And</a>  they got lost, and they just happened upon my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8832.377s">And</a>  they were hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8834.338s">And</a>  so I was in the middle of cooking, and I was so <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8840.541s">you</a>  know, surprised that they were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8841.842s">And</a>  I told them about my composition woes because I was having writer's block, and they said, okay, let's sit down, I'll help you write this tune. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8849.708s">And</a>  so what I did is I took the bass line from Manteca, some of y'all probably recognize that, and I put it on this tune, and then there was a blues form that came from a Freddie Hubbard tune called For Spee's Sake, within the form of the improvisational section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8863.497s">So</a>  that's the name of the song, Belmont Stakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8866.439s">So</a>  it's kind of a play on words. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8867.66s">There's</a>  nothing equestrian about it, but yeah, that's that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=8915.442s">I'm</a>  going to play it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9112.085s">do</a>  do</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9311.855s">do</a>  do</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9729.721s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9730.681s">That</a>  was a composition of mine called The Lonely Strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9734.543s">The</a>  Lonely Strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9740.565s">Let</a>  me also say that it's also a privilege to play with Tyson and Yoni. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9749.209s">We</a>  played trio on a few different occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9754.711s">So</a>  that I'm kind of used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9757.603s">But</a>  when you add Jason to the mix, it's like the amount of trouble, good trouble, good trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9764.69s">The</a>  amount of good trouble we can get into is just abundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9769.555s">So</a>  it's amazing that we get to do this as professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9775.34s">But</a>  we still get to call it play. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9777.422s">We</a>  still get to call it play. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9779.884s">So</a>  it's definitely a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9783.587s">This</a>  next tune we're going to play is a composition of Jason's called, Do You Know Who You Are?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9791.681s">speaking</a>  of getting in trouble I wrote this song <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9801.303s">Not</a>  too long ago, but it is inspired by an experience I had about 15 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9805.924s">I</a>  was walking down the street on Huntington Avenue in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9808.605s">I</a>  was going into a market called Thornton's over near the Christian Science Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9813.586s">And</a>  as I was walking in, I thought I heard somebody call my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9816.587s">And</a>  so I turned around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9817.447s">I</a>  didn't see anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9818.187s">So</a>  I continued in the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9819.247s">And</a>  then I bumped into somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9820.468s">And</a>  I looked. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9821.368s">And</a>  it was Dr. Cornel West. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9823.388s">And</a>  at the time, I was <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9825.569s">really</a>  into his books and everything, and been checking out some speeches and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9830.472s">So</a>  I looked at him, and I was starstruck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9831.893s">And</a>  I looked at him with my mouth wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9833.754s">I</a>  said, do you know who you are? <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9835.696s">And</a>  he looked back at me, and with this big smile, he said, of course, my dear brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9840.639s">But</a>  the question is, do you know who you are? <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9843.601s">So</a>  that's the name of the song, Do You Know Who You Are, a line for Dr. C. West. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=9847.403s">Right</a>  on it, maybe?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10530.26s">This</a>  next tune we're going to play is a composition of mine called West Bend Prophecies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10535.662s">West</a>  Bend is a <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10538.662s">It's</a>  in Kentucky, West Bend, Kentucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10541.023s">This</a>  past weekend was my 160th family reunion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10548.147s">So</a>  we go way back, and as you can imagine, just the amount of history, kind of the good, the bad, and the ugly that are told are kind of unsurmountable when it comes to kind of realizing where we come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10567.978s">And</a>  as the great Maya Angelou said, we've already been paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10574.044s">And</a>  this song is dedicated to the spirit of the family that came before me and before us that allowed us to kind of be where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10583.973s">So</a>  this is West Bend Prophecies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=10586.114s">Hope</a>  you enjoy it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11302.797s">All</a>  right, again, give it up for the Kevin Harris Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11328.53s">Jason</a>  Palmer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11329.21s">I'll</a>  let these guys close it out in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11331.811s">But</a>  first, just wanted to say another thank you to them, first of all, for coming and being here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11337.653s">I've</a>  had the pleasure of knowing Kevin since I was in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11340.674s">Kevin</a>  was actually my first jazz piano teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11343.615s">And</a>  I can't think of anybody better, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11347.156s">And</a>  he's just continued to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11348.657s">And</a>  I love seeing the projects that he puts together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11351.138s">So</a>  this is a real treat for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11353.158s">And</a>  I'm glad that I get to share it with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11356.321s">On</a>  another note, I also want to thank some organizational sponsors too who've made this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11361.488s">First</a>  of all, the people behind the scenes, Galelle and Avi doing sound and Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11370.484s">over</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11371.885s">We</a>  have Terry Carter who's been doing a lot of work to host us here at the West Medford Community Center and also our executive director Lisa who is just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11385.011s">To</a>  all of our volunteers who have helped us throughout the weekend and all of the organizations that have given us grant funding, Medford Arts Council, the Arts Alive Foundation, Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11397.077s">Arts</a>  Collaborative Medford, which is where we were on Friday night, along with Morningside Music Studio and Members Plus Credit Union, Triangle Manor, which is another local t-shirt company that's done our t-shirts this year, and Nomen Copy and Print as well, who's helped us with these beautiful programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11414.524s">So</a>  please, if you enjoy what you see, consider donating to support live music and events like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11420.609s">We</a>  should have plenty more coming up in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11424.051s">And</a>  also be sure to sign up for our email list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11426.493s">I</a>  will put you on there and probably bother you a little bit more than you'd like, but it's still worth it, I assure you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11432.697s">So</a>  I'll hand this back over to Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11435.299s">Thanks</a>  again for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ehZiab2mICE&t=11436.58s">And</a>  yeah, stay tuned for more.</p>
