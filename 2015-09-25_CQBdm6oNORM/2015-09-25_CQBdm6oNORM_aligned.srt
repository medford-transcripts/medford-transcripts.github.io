00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:21,072
The phone, the phone is ringing The phone will be right there The phone, the phone is ringing The phone, the phone is ringing

2
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:28,369
The report is here.

3
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:53,043
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan with Mustang News Channel 15 and we're here at the game opener for Medford Mustangs varsity football team and I'm here with my co-host Nick Kenniston.

4
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:54,643
Nick, how are they looking tonight?

5
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,924
Well, the Mustang team looks pretty good.

6
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,785
The offense has been working hard all through the summer.

7
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:07,868
I actually went to a couple of the practices and they learned a lot of new different stuff and it looks pretty good.

8
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:12,364
How do you think the offense will do tonight, although they didn't do that great in their last game?

9
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,805
Well, you know, I think it's all about execution.

10
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:22,808
You know, they worked on techniques all throughout practice this week, and I think that, you know, you can scheme all you want, but it's basically just about execution.

11
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:26,289
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan, and I'm here with Christian Gotti.

12
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:27,789
Christian, how are you feeling tonight?

13
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:28,710
Pretty good, Lydia.

14
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,570
Alright.

15
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,871
Why'd you come out tonight to the football game?

16
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,551
To support the team and watch the game.

17
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,892
Is there anyone in particular you're supporting tonight?

18
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,430
Well, I think Aaron Sealy's going to have a big game tonight.

19
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,190
Oh, he is.

20
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,031
I bet he is.

21
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,273
So did you hear about Corey's injury?

22
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,514
How do you feel about that?

23
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:45,536
Well, he's a really good player, so it might affect the team.

24
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:46,837
You think it will hurt the team?

25
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:47,397
It could.

26
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:49,979
How do you think Belmont's going to do tonight?

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,702
Well, I haven't heard very good things about them, so.

28
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:53,583
You don't know?

29
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,004
I don't know.

30
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:56,085
Let's hope for the best, though.

31
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:56,485
Yep.

32
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:57,065
All right.

33
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:57,946
Thank you, Christian.

34
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:58,226
Thanks.

35
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:00,989
And here they come.

36
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:04,432
Wow, looking marvelous, right through the banner.

37
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,847
Aaron Seeley, captain.

38
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:35,928
And Myles Oliver, wide receiver.

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,510
There's a kickoff and we are underway.

40
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:48,571
Taken by number three, Aaron Seeley.

41
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,052
And he's running, he's running.

42
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,112
Oh, he's going, he's going!

43
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,893
Oh, he's going, he's going!

44
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,613
He's going for the touchdown!

45
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:58,374
Touchdown!

46
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:05,916
Ben Antoine under center, takes a snap, read option left, double pass and it's dropped.

47
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,277
Incomplete, but tackled by number 31.

48
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:14,141
We still have the ball.

49
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:28,832
Oh, and he's running, number three, Aaron Seely, right through, oh he sprints to the middle, oh a fake, oh and he's down.

50
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:31,267
Because I have an idea for a video.

51
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:31,567
Go State!

52
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:31,747

Go State

123
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:04,509
Wow, catch made by Miles Oliver.

124
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,594
Wow, and another one for Medford which puts us in the lead 14 to 9 in the third.

125
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:14,477
Coach Nascimento is the head coach and he's one of the best coaches here.

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,641
Antoine back in the shotgun.

127
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,022
Goes back to pass.

128
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,583
Can't seem to find her.

129
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:48,126
Person runs right through and gets to the about 25th yard line.

130
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:57,614
I'm Cheyenne and I'm here with the Mustang Report and we are still here at the football game and I am here with... Andre, Pia Paul, Cotton's mom.

131
00:04:58,414 --> 00:04:59,855
So how do you think he's doing so far?

132
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:08,462
Oh great, I believe it's a great game and I'm looking forward for the game to end and we wish that we won this game.

133
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:10,319
So right now we're 14 to 9.

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,103
Do you think we're going to keep this lead?

135
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,526
Oh, we should.

136
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:17,711
We should go more than 14.

137
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,234
I think we should go like 29.

138
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,037
I agree.

139
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:21,718
That's a good number.

140
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,158
All right.

141
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:22,699
Thank you.

142
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:32,721
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan and we're here at halftime at the opener MHS varsity football game with MHS leading 14 to 9.

143
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:38,108
I'm here with Hallie Farrell and Lacey Ryan and Hallie is going to tell us the joke of the game.

144
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,150
Hallie, to you.

145
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,853
Well, since it's a football game, I thought I'd tell a football joke.

146
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:45,734
So, why did the football coach go to the bank?

147
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:46,535
Why?

148
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,016
To get his quarterback.

149
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:49,096
Oh, my God.

150
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,198
What a great football joke.

151
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,179
That is truly inspirational.

152
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,280
That was great.

153
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,461
And, Lacey, how do you feel about that joke?

154
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,361
Does that make you laugh?

155
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:57,922
Yeah.

156
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,512
Hi, I'm Hallie and I'm here with Aidan and Dominic.

157
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:03,974
What grade are you guys in?

158
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:04,755
Sixth.

159
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:06,296
Sixth grade.

160
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,078
What school do you guys go to?

161
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:08,879
Andrews.

162
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,200
Andrews Middle School.

163
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,002
Is this your first football game?

164
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:13,443
No.

165
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:15,225
Yeah, for high school.

166
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:16,847
Are you guys excited?

167
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:17,828
Yeah.

168
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:19,570
Do you think Medford will win?

169
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,411
Yeah.

170
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:20,971
I hope so.

171
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:22,373
I think they will too.

172
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,952
Are you guys going to come to any other games this season?

173
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,093
Probably.

174
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:27,993
Oh, you will?

175
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,234
Well, thank you.

176
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:32,476
I'm Hallie Powell.

177
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,757
Back in the shotgun where he's been all night.

178
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:40,240
With the ball running right through, makes a quick break to the right, running straight on the line.

179
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:41,761
Six Belmont guys on him.

180
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:42,482
Oh, my God.

181
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:46,544
And tackle down at the 8 yard line.

182
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:47,965
Ball.

183
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,039
We are still running it through.

184
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,580
Oh, toss to number 31 on the outside.

185
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,302
Oh, he dives into the end zone for a touchdown for Medford.

186
00:06:56,322 --> 00:07:00,925
Hi, I'm Gabby Martinez here for MHS TV.

187
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,866
And right now, I'm with... Scott Andrew.

188
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:04,967
Brandon Shaloney.

189
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:06,408
And Paul D'Orio.

190
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:10,090
So guys, how do you think the band's doing right now?

191
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,012
Well, as you know, the band's job is to get the crowd hyped up for the game.

192
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,514
And as you can see, we're pretty hyped up.

193
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,622
I gotta agree, I think they're improving more and more every day.

194
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:24,608
I think they're like the Drake and the Future album that's being released at midnight.

195
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,051
Yeah, I think the band's doing great.

196
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:28,533
They got great rhythm.

197
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:31,917
They're number one in the state and number one in all our hearts.

198
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,018
Oh yeah.

199
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,981
Okay, thank you guys.

200
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:37,003
Back to you.

201
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:46,481
Doing really good this game, hopefully they'll pull out a win.

202
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,764
Number 8, throw to number 9.

203
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,451
Well, she breaks a tackle.

204
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,192
Oh, he breaks.

205
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,613
Oh, he pushes through.

206
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,974
He pushes through.

207
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,035
And a touchdown by Medford!

208
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:01,018
Score of the game was 31-28 Belmont.

209
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:02,779
Nick, how did you feel about this game?

210
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,201
Well, it was pretty spectacular up until the end.

211
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:09,444
You know, both teams fought pretty hard and continued to play very well.

212
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,505
They definitely improved from last game.

213
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:15,368
And it was an intense and specular game from last time.

214
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,808
And it was so close all around.

215
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,029
But good job, Medford.

216
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:18,710
Good job.

217
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:21,237
I don't hear you, Jimmy.

218
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:13,385
What?

219
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,571
I just wanna celebrate I just wanna celebrate I just wanna celebrate I just wanna celebrate

220
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,544
Yeah, don't break it.

221
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:29,162
4 goals?
