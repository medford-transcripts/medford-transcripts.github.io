00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:03,759
Medford City Council, 11th regular meeting, May 28, 2024.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,600
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,641
Councilor Callahan.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,542
Councilor Callahan.

5
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:11,243
Thank you.

6
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:12,604
Vice President Collins.

00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:13,124

Present.

10
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:15,986
Councilor Lemming.

11
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:16,406
Present.

12
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:17,287
Councilor Scarpelli.

13
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:17,507
Present.

14
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:18,287
Councilor Sanzarro.

15
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:18,687
Present.

16
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:19,288
Councilor Ferris.

17
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:19,748
Present.

18
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:20,849
Seven present, none absent.

19
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:21,609
Meeting is called to order.

20
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:22,790
Please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance.

21
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,632
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

22
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:27,649
Thank you.

23
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,132
Before we start, we're going to give a citation based on a vote we took at a prior meeting.

24
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:33,973
I'm going to read out the citation.

25
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:54,573
The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to former Council President Richard F. Caraviello on the honor of being named the 2024 Medford Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year.

26
00:00:54,953 --> 00:01:02,858
Your long-time commitment to the City of Medford, the Medford City Council, our residents, and the local business community makes you an outstanding Citizen of the Year and a valued member of our community.

27
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:07,601
Respectfully offered by Zach Behrs, Council President, and George Scarpelli, City Councilor.

28
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:19,298
So I apologize.

29
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,839
Thank you, Council President.

30
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,420
This is a long time coming.

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,482
I think that it's funny.

32
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:31,486
I don't know if people know Councilor Carviello and what kind of a person he is.

33
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:35,209
Councilor Carviello ran for mayor, unfortunately.

34
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,391
In my view, he was a couple votes behind.

35
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,534
But you would think that someone who's spent so much time

36
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:46,868
in this chamber working for the Citizen Method, you'd think he'd be tired.

37
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,161
But last week, I think he spent over 60 hours helping an 88-year-old

38
00:01:55,973 --> 00:02:09,939
young lady that was being displaced from her apartment who was battling cancer, and he drove her all over the city to make sure that she was safe and her rights were protected.

39
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,640
So this is the type of person Rick Carviello is.

40
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:23,084
I've had the honor of working with Councilor Carviello as an elected official and as our

41
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:24,717
I think it was.

42
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:29,019
You know, being a past patriarch and someone that I mentored myself against, um.

43
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,940
To receive this award from the city.

44
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:31,981
I

45
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:41,390
miss you back here, but I know you're still working hard for the citizens of Medford.

46
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:53,958
We should all take a great look and understand how Rick Carvello lives his life, because if we had more Rick Carvello's in this world, I think Medford would be just a supreme place to live.

47
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:57,160
So congratulations, my friend, well earned.

48
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:08,981
Thank you.

49
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:21,166
Last week I was in City Hall for meetings and I bumped into Rick on his runs to help an elderly tenant stay in her home and help her find a place to live.

50
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:28,169
And I think that really exemplifies, even though you're not on this side of the rail, your service to the city is never ceasing.

51
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,571
And so I'm deeply, deeply grateful for your

52
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:44,417
for your service to Medford, for your commitment to our city and all of our residents, and for your mentorship during my first term on the city council when we were both sitting over there.

53
00:03:45,898 --> 00:04:00,565
We don't always agree on issues, but I honestly think that folks need to hear us talk about things because I think there's so much agreement that we have, so many values that we share, a vision for Medford that I think

54
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,568
folks need to know that we share.

55
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,456
And I'm so happy that you're staying involved in our city.

56
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:14,385
And again, a lot of respect, a lot of gratitude to the work that you've done for us.

57
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,635
Thank you, President Behrs.

58
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,256
I want to congratulate you again.

59
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,617
Rick, in my culture, we have a name for a person like you.

60
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:24,138
It's a mensch.

61
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:32,061
And, you know, this past week was, you know, we all talked about your service and making sure that this elderly tenant had a safe landing spot.

62
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,662
But I know that for you, this is just, you know, that was just a regular Tuesday.

63
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:38,584
And it's that kind of service that makes this honor so well earned.

64
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,704
So thank you for doing what you do all the time.

65
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:42,965
Thank you.

66
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,226
Would you like to say anything?

67
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:47,737
You can come up.

68
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:48,617
You can come up.

69
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:55,704
You might have to press the button.

70
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:56,585
A light should come on.

71
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:58,086
No?

72
00:04:58,106 --> 00:04:59,668
There we go.

73
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:00,208
There you go.

74
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:02,951
Rick Caravaggio, former member of this August board.

75
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,059
Welcome back.

76
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,199
Thank you.

77
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,500
Thank you for the citation.

78
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:14,265
I got to join a group of men and women who've done good things for the community since 1970.

79
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:17,287
And I'm proud to be in their company.

80
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:21,610
And we talked about, I saw people in City Hall last week.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,101
This is what I've always done for the last 30 years, is helping people.

82
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:30,042
And as an elected official, that's our job is to help people.

83
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:38,083
And even though I'm not here still, I'll still continue to, I live here, this is my home, I'm not moving.

84
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:43,444
I want a good community and I'll always be here for the residents of the community.

85
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:43,925
So thank you.

86
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:44,785
Thank you, Rick.

87
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,106
Take a picture.

88
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,295
Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:08,996
It's not true.

90
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:10,458
There you are.

91
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:10,819
Thank you.

92
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,208
I wouldn't think so.

93
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:46,875
It's so funny.

94
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:07,431
24-365 resolution to recognize and celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month.

95
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:11,094
Be it resolved that the City Council recognize and celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month.

96
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:12,615
Vice President Collins.

97
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:16,358
Thank you, President Behrs, for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.

98
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,159
Jewish American History Month.

99
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,093
Heritage Month, excuse me, is a relatively new commemoration.

100
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,294
It was first proclaimed in 2006.

101
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:32,538
It was a collaboration between the American federal government and Jewish museums throughout the nation.

102
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:40,103
And I think that this is a wonderful opportunity to thank Jewish culture bearers in Medford, not just for their contributions, but for continuing to

103
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,825
tell the stories of this community.

104
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:52,419
And it's a good reminder to thank all culture bearers of all communities within Medford for continuing to tell their stories and share their culture and their history with the entire community.

105
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,517
Councilor Sang.

106
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,301
Thank you, Vice President Collins, for introducing this resolution.

107
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:08,807
We all know that the last few years, it's beyond this last year.

108
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:17,854
Ever since 2016, anti-Semitism has been on the rise in our country due to extremist voices enabling

109
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,357
and normalizing rhetoric.

110
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:25,683
Now, I really want to thank Councillor Collins and your efforts to root out anti-Semitism in our community.

111
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:35,953
I remember one of the first resolutions you introduced as a city councillor was to get the mayor's office to properly address an anti-Semitic incident and to set up institutions to deal with that.

112
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,494
We've made some progress.

113
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:44,695
We haven't made all the progress we've wanted, but I think it shows, you know, your leadership on this issue that you've brought this to light.

114
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:58,418
Similarly, you were the first counselor on the scene when a anti-Semitic piece of graffiti was painted on one of our, you know, on the streets of Medford, very unfortunately.

115
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:02,519
And I want to commend you for your leadership, again,

116
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:07,754
for bringing that to light and for focusing on the injustices in our community.

117
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:09,395
Thank you, Councillor Seng.

118
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:16,099
On the motion of Vice President Collins seconded by Councillor Seng, any further discussion by members of the Council?

119
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,961
Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

120
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,382
Name and address for the record, please.

121
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:22,913
Thank you, Councilor.

122
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:25,694
Andrew Castaneda, East Medford, Massachusetts.

123
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:28,175
I want to thank the Council for putting this on the agenda.

124
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:34,078
It seems to me I've never seen this much anti-Semitism in my lifetime.

125
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:39,200
It probably goes back to the 30s and maybe 2030, besides.

126
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,821
This has been going on for more than 2,000 years.

127
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:50,685
You probably would not expect me to make this kind of a quote,

128
00:09:56,274 --> 00:10:00,316
I like to quote Genesis chapter 12, verse three.

129
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:09,819
I will bless thee that will bless thee, and curse him, her, or it that curses thee.

130
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,361
My translation is if you go against the Jews, you will perish.

131
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:24,025
So, I really appreciate you put this on the table, because we're in dire straits in this world.

132
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,045
Thank you for listening.

133
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:26,216
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

134
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,057
Any further discussion?

135
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:29,918
Seeing none, on the motion.

136
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:31,199
All those in favor?

137
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,580
Opposed?

138
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,360
Motion passes.

139
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,842
24368, offered by Councilor Sang.

140
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:40,124
Be it resolved that the City Council recognize and celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

141
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:41,498
Councilor Saik.

142
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:42,699
Thank you, President Behrs.

143
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,542
This month is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, AAPI Heritage Month for short.

144
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:57,765
This is one of the fastest growing communities in our country, let alone in our city.

145
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:05,148
I think we see it all around us, new restaurants and bubble tea shops and everything coming in.

146
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,289
Asian Americans are really

147
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:10,351
picking up a big part of our local economy.

148
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,933
They're contributing in our school system as we've seen in previous meetings.

149
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:21,357
And this is a month to celebrate that history, that heritage here in Medford and in our country.

150
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:27,200
We've taken a lot of strides towards equity in our city in the last few years.

151
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:31,023
I know I have a resolution later on in the agenda about

152
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:38,284
for asking for updates on efforts the city is taking to better include Asian Americans in the policymaking process.

153
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:42,765
But this resolution is just celebratory.

154
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:44,486
Yeah.

155
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:45,666
Thank you.

156
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:46,346
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

157
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:47,126
Any further discussion?

158
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,947
On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

159
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:51,608
All those in favor?

160
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:52,948
All opposed?

161
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:53,808
Motion passes.

162
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:56,309
Is there a motion to suspend the rules to take paper 24372?

163
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:04,952
on the motion of Councillor Sang to suspend the roll to take paper 24372, seconded by?

164
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:06,977
Seconded by Councillor Lemming.

165
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:07,698
All those in favour?

166
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:10,765
It's under suspension.

167
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:16,612

We have resolved that the City Council acknowledge our U.S.

172
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:30,524
military personnel who died while serving our country in recognition of Memorial Day and thank them for their ultimate sacrifice in protecting our country's freedoms.

173
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:31,325
Councillor Scarpelli.

174
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:32,946
Thank you, Councilor Beasley.

175
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:39,489
I think that I have to put this forward for one simple reason, that the acknowledgment.

176
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:46,872
I know that yesterday was a very special day, and I know that some of my fellow Councilors were there and showing their support to our veterans.

177
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:51,435
Unfortunately, my wife ran another half a marathon.

178
00:12:52,535 --> 00:13:12,281
I was there supporting her, but I wanted to make sure that this body recognized all of the sacrifices made for our military men and women, and really showed that respect yesterday, and understand where we are today is because of our veterans.

179
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:12,842
So thank you.

180
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,402
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

181
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,322
Any further discussion?

Councilor Sanders?

183
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,436
I want to thank Councillor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.

184
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:29,784
We owe our peaceful existence here to the sacrifices that have come decades.

185
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:34,860
before us and even today, to our military.

186
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:45,665
I'm deeply grateful for this resolution because I think it highlights our city council's dedication to the men and women who served our country.

187
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:57,129
And I think it highlights the work that we've been doing as a city council to tackle issues for veterans, to better serve them, and to tackle real social issues that veterans face.

188
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,272
you know, in terms of employment and housing in our city.

189
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:05,055
You know, these are issues that this council takes very seriously.

190
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:09,718
I know Councilor Lemming has been leading a lot of that work, so I want to thank him as well.

191
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:10,939
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

192
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:11,760
Any further discussion?

193
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:22,268
Seeing none, I want to thank Councilor Lemming for speaking on behalf of the council yesterday's Memorial Day Remembrances and thank everyone who participated.

Thank you.

216
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:45,693
So the resident services and public engagement subcommittee consisted of myself, Councillor Callahan and Councillor Singh.

217
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:59,947
Matt, we basically just discussed procedures for these listening sessions and divided the different groups that each subcommittee member would schedule.

218
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:04,673
listening sessions with over the next year or so.

219
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:09,459
And then we, that was pretty much it.

220
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:10,581

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:44,018
We drafted and approved the second newsletter of the Medford City Council, which is now available on the City Council web page.

229
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:50,324
If anybody is interested in checking out the final version, we also met to discuss the

230
00:16:52,526 --> 00:17:05,416
proposed ordinance change to allow the veteran services director to offer an incentive to landlords that are willing to rent out to qualified veterans and address the veterans homelessness issue.

231
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:12,181
There was a motion to send that to legal for review.

232
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,423
And that was, those were the items that were discussed.

233
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:15,764
Thank you.

234
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,744
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

235
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,806
And 24033, Planning and Permanent 2024, Vice President Collins.

236
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,965
We met again with the city council zoning consultant, and we reported out several items which are all on the city council agenda tonight.

237
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:49,460
The table of use and parking regulations, updating some definitions, updating just the digital version of the existing zoning map, and municipal exemptions, no substantive changes, just some tweaks to streamline the city's zoning procedures while we work with the zoning consultant on

238
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:51,176
more thematic changes.

239
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:51,896
Thank you.

240
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:53,697

All those in favour?

243
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,100
We'll go that way.

244
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,440
All those in favour?

245
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:08,441
Opposed?

246
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:09,301
Motion passes.

247
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:29,488
24370 offered by councilor saying City Council is under the refer to committee for further discussion resolution to create a residence guide to City Council position processes being resolved with the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, create and publish a short guide in English and commonly spoken non-English languages to the City Council for residents to understand the City Council, its procedures and its processes.

248
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,853
Councilor Sang on the motion to refer to resident services and public engagement, seconded by?

249
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,754
Seconded by Vice President Collins.

250
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:37,355
Do you want to give a short?

251
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:41,699
Yeah, I'll give a very short presentation or description.

252
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:52,387
So at our first meeting this term, I noted that one big thing that we would be working on big picture wise on this council would be transparency and reform.

253
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:53,548
And, you know,

254
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:10,823
meeting a few weeks ago, some residents suggested that we create a resident's guide to City Council to demystify some of the processes and to make it really clear what happens when a paper is introduced onto the agenda.

255
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:13,746
What do these committees mean?

256
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,067
How often do they meet?

257
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:17,649
A real simple user's guide.

258
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:20,451
And so in the spirit of

259
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,709
transparency, reform, and inclusion.

260
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:30,831
I think that this would move our city council forward and make our work much more accessible.

261
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,371
Thank you, Councillor Seng.

262
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:33,012

263
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:33,992

265
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:39,954
All those in favor?

266
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:40,434
Aye.

267
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:40,954
Opposed?

268
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:41,794
Motion passes.

269
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,336
Vice President Collins, and I would ask, please, if you're having private conversations, please take them out of the hallway.

270
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:48,656
Vice President Collins.

271
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,919
Motion to suspend the rules and take 24-366 out of order.

272
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,740

00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:02,085
On the motion to suspend the rules, take paper 24-366 out of order by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councillor Sang.

24366, request for appropriation, Community Preservation Committee.

00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:28,870
May 23rd, 2024, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts 02155, regarding Community Preservation Committee appropriation request.

279
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,798
On behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

280
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:44,702
requesting the appropriation of $5,000 from the CPA General Reserve to Trees Medford and the Department of Public Works Forestry Division to conduct an inventory of trees in city parks.

281
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,083
The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

282
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:49,824
The CPC recommendation letter is attached and incorporated.

283
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:55,387
CPC Chairperson, CPA Manager, Teresa Dupont and a manabon of Trees Medford will be in attendance to answer questions.

284
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:56,567
Thank you for your consideration.

285
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:58,568
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lungo-Kern, Mayor.

286
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:01,649
Good evening.

287
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:06,491
Thank you so very much, Mr. President, City Councilors, Mr. Clerk, Mr. Messenger, for having us here tonight.

288
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,193
I'm joined remotely by Amanda Bowen.

289
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:13,054
Unfortunately, Roberta Cameron had a triple booking, so she's unavailable.

290
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:16,416
But Amanda Bowen is joining me via Zoom, and she is with Trees Medford.

291
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:20,940
For those who don't know me again, Tracy DuPont, I'm the community preservation manager here for the city.

292
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,982
Before you tonight is an appropriation request in the amount of $5,000.

293
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:32,570
As President Behrs mentioned, this would be to conduct an inventory of existing trees that are in our public parks.

294
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:51,249
I don't want to steal any of Amanda's thunder, but this is part of an ongoing effort from Trees Medford, which is our local advocacy group here in the city, to create a holistic citywide inventory of all of our trees so that way we can make efforts to increase or capitalize on various different areas in the city.

295
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,732
I'm not sure if Amanda would like to chime in here.

296
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:57,055
I'll stop talking for a moment to give her a moment.

297
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,799
Amanda, if you could raise your hand on Zoom.

298
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:03,201
And once again, I please ask if you're having a private conversation, please take it out in the hallway.

299
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,663
Please, if you're gonna keep talking, thank you.

300
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:11,186
There's people talking in the back.

301
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:19,251
And if Amanda's unable to join or provide comment, I can field any questions that you may have.

302
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:20,637
I'm not seeing Amanda.

303
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:21,257
Okay.

304
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:26,161
But again, this is to conduct an inventory of trees that are existing in public parks.

305
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:30,745
Part of the comprehensive plan goals are to increase our tree canopy here in the city.

306
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:32,347
We are an urban environment.

307
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:33,348
We need more trees.

308
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:36,490
So that is the goal of this grant is to conduct that.

309
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,793
And I'm happy to read the funding recommendation letter if you'd like.

310
00:22:41,214 --> 00:22:43,696
Funding recommendation decision, May 14, 2024.

311
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,158
Applicant name, City of Medford Forestry Division.

312
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:47,660
Co-applicant name, Trees Medford.

313
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,111
public tree park inventory on May 14th, 2024.

314
00:22:51,191 --> 00:23:03,895
The City of Medford Community Preservation Committee, CPC, voted six to zero to zero to recommend to the City Council that Trees Medford and Medford's Forestry Division be awarded $5,000 to conduct a citywide inventory of all public trees in city-owned parks.

315
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:10,136
In reaching the decision, the CPC found that the project meets the CPA objective of preserving and restoring city-owned recreation spaces.

316
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,317
Any further questions by a member of the Council?

317
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:15,338
Councillor Scarbelli.

318
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:30,085
parks, open spaces, historical sites, and affordable housing?

319
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:30,645
Correct.

320
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:31,166
Right.

321
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:36,150
So I think that this falls, just it falls in with the process and it's something that's so needed.

322
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:45,799
I know that it's been working, the process has been working, I think, in the cemetery and other places around the city to make sure that we take care of our tree canopy.

323
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:46,340
So thank you.

324
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,481
Thank you.

325
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:48,802
Is there a motion on the floor?

326
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,910
On the motion approved by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

327
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,811
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

328
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:59,413
Councillor Callaghan?

329
00:23:59,593 --> 00:23:59,813
Yes.

330
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,134
Vice-President Collins?

331
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:01,454
Yes.

332
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:02,634
Councillor Lozano?

333
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:02,994
Yes.

334
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:04,195
Councillor Levin?

335
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:04,615
Yes.

336
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:05,696
Councillor Scarpelli?

337
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:06,096
Yes.

338
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:06,976
Councillor Sanz?

339
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:07,236
Yes.

340
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,217
President Fares?

341
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:08,477
Yes.

342
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,157
70 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

343
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:10,658
Thank you, Theresa.

344
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:12,939
Thank you, and on behalf of Theresa Medford, thank you very much.

345
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:13,719
Thank you.

346
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:19,872
24364, petition for a common victor's license, the Great American Beer Hall LLC.

347
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:33,102
On file, business certificate, petition received, letter of compliance received, state tax ID received, workers' compensation pending, treasurer, collector, building department and fire department pending final approval, police and traffic impact pending final approval.

348
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,143
and Health Department pending final approval.

349
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,984
We do have the petitioners before us, just a little context.

350
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:47,447
We are, I think the intent is to move forward here on a conditional common victualized license pending all of the approvals listed as well as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

351
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:52,589
And with that, I'm happy to turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli or the petitioners.

352
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:54,390
Yeah, thank you so much.

353
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,770
A quick update.

354
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,671
I think everybody's waiting.

355
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:00,012
So how's everything look?

356
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:01,075
Looks great.

357
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,896
Name and address for the restaurant.

358
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,237
Oh, sorry.

359
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,958
Brian's Arthur, 142 Mystic, Great American Beer Hall.

360
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:08,360
John Chase, 61 Pullen Road.

361
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,661
Great American Beer Hall, but anyways.

362
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:19,787
Over the weekend, they laid asphalt for the site, and we're going to start the beer garden and the outside landscaping and framing.

363
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,468
The bar is going up next week.

364
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:22,488
It's really exciting.

365
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:26,391
And we're set for a mid-July opening.

366
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,612
So yeah, we're moving along over there.

367
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,473
That's great news.

368
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:30,954
really exciting.

369
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:34,536
So I think that, uh, Mr President, I see that I know that we're waiting.

370
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,757
Everything right now is pending.

371
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:38,319
But as you said, this is provisional right now.

372
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,560
So we move forward.

373
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,562
I would move forward what we have in place right now.

374
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:42,162
Great.

375
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,163
Any further questions?

376
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:45,525
I remember the council for the applicant before we move ahead.

377
00:25:48,163 --> 00:26:00,306
Seeing none, I'll just say we also know we've received the application for a special permit that has to go through the advertising process, so likely there will be on the meeting of June 25th, we will have you back to talk about that.

378
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:13,150
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to approve the common victor's license conditional on the pending approvals listed here, as well as the occupancy permit, and do you also want to do a review?

379
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,272
Yeah, we always do a 30 60 30 60 day review upon opening, so we'll hear from everyone.

380
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,553
And if there's issues, we'll have you back to talk about it.

381
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:29,838
Um, so the motion is to approve conditional on the pending approvals as well as the occupancy permit and 30 and 60 day review upon opening.

382
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:30,498
Thanks.

383
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:35,480
Great on a motion by Councilors Carpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

384
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,561
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

385
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:40,323
Yes.

386
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:42,987
Vice President Collins.

387
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:43,268
Yes.

388
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:45,109
Councilor Lavarro.

389
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:45,409
Yes.

390
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:46,249
Councilor Levelle.

391
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:46,670
Yes.

392
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,490
Councilor Scartelli.

393
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:47,790
Yes.

394
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,431
Councilor San Buenaventura.

395
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:49,812
Yes.

396
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,333
70 affirmative, none negative.

397
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:52,033
The motion passes.

398
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:52,533
Thanks, you guys.

399
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:53,054
Thank you.

400
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,074
We'll see you in a couple weeks.

401
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:54,675
Thanks.

402
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:55,075
Good luck.

403
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:58,737
24359 offered by Vice President Collins.

404
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:01,439
Resolution to hear an update from the Brooks Park Tenant Associations.

405
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:08,363
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hear an update from representatives of the Brooks Park Tenant Association on the status of their tenancies and efforts to negotiate with their property owner.

406
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,484
Vice President Collins.

407
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,601
Thank you, President Behrs.

408
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:18,064
This council has for a long time been a forum for residents when they are in a time of need.

409
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:28,589
I think it's fitting that former Councillor Carabiello is here tonight because in my first term, you know, he was the liaison that bridge that made that connection with

410
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:46,881
a whole group of tenants that were in a time of need and I think early 2022 with the Bradley Road tenants and made sure that counselors were informed of what was happening in their building and could offer whatever support we could as they sought their next safe haven in Medford.

411
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,763
And I'm glad that this council can be a forum to hear from

412
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:53,625
residents in any occasion of need.

413
00:27:55,025 --> 00:28:09,189
Over the past several months, tenants at the Brooks Park apartments have been keeping counselors informed of their situation, which includes, you know, the property changing hands, and unfortunately, a wave of displacement and evictions.

414
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:18,772
I understand that they've been seeking to converse and discuss and negotiate with their property owners that they can remain in this community, and I am grateful to them for

415
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:24,995
appearing tonight so that we can hear an update directly from the source about the status of their tenancies.

416
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:26,376
Thank you for being here.

417
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:29,237
Thank you guys for having us.

418
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:30,258
Thank you.

419
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:31,719
Name and address for the record, please.

420
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,019
You're good.

421
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:36,043
Rachel Clinton, 8 Brooks Park, apartment 23.

422
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:42,286
Thank you, council members, for having us and acknowledging that this is such a serious issue, too.

423
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:49,669
Before I get started, I just want everyone from the Brooks Park Tenant Association that's here to stand up, please.

424
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:08,539
And the two wonderful people standing beside me are also a part of the Tenant Association.

425
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:12,940
I, so yeah, here's my testimony.

426
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
I've lived at Brooks Park for three years now.

427
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,041
We have a beautiful and diverse community.

428
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:20,482
It is multilingual and we take care of one another.

429
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:22,362
I want to continue to live here.

430
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:29,104
I was told my rent was going to be increased by $200 with a two weeks notice in January.

431
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:33,806
I was fortunately able to negotiate it down, but now my lease ends in August.

432
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:38,486
I do not have the money to move and will not find a place that is affordable near here.

433
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,368
I have built a community here.

434
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:46,292
I should add my current rent is nearly half of my income, which as you can imagine,

435
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:52,520
leaves little for food and all of the bills I must pay on top of it all.

436
00:29:53,341 --> 00:30:03,248
Being able to live much closer to work has made my commute time shorter and with the services I provide for Medford has made my connection and ability to do my job far better.

437
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:10,854
I support rent stabilization and believe we should continue to keep our community together instead of pushing people out who have made this place home.

438
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:14,357
Thank you.

439
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:15,678
Name and address for the record, please.

440
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:16,559
Is this?

441
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:17,720
Yeah, it's on.

442
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,759
I'm Julia Forster.

443
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,981
Thank you for meeting, letting us talk tonight.

444
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,902
Oh, at 8 Brooks Park, apartment 20.

445
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:32,864
I have lived at Brooks Park for 23 years.

446
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:35,724
It is a diverse and bilingual community.

447
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:37,085
It is my home.

448
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,326
Community is important to me.

449
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,926
It is stable and I feel safe.

450
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:46,408
It was sold to Jacob Grossman and now managed by Charles Gate.

451
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:52,529
They want to evict all residents so they can come in, renovate, and increase the rent.

452
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:54,110
We said no.

453
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,231
We will not move and became Brooks Park Tenant Association and joined with City Life Vita Urbana.

454
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:05,232
My lease ended on April 30th, 2024.

455
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:11,974
I have not received an eviction notice, but they did not cash two checks for rent in April, 2024.

456
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:16,491
Now I've learned I pay through my checking account.

457
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:19,815
Their intention was to evict me for nonpayment.

458
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:21,678
They were not successful.

459
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,867
I want Jacob Grossman, the owner, to sit down with Steve Meacham of City Life Vida Urbana.

460
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:35,049
I'm Joel Childers, spokesperson for the Tenant Association and all of its members.

461
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,890
Talk and negotiate.

462
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:50,173
I also want him to listen and fix immediately the concerns of tenants regarding noisy residence, leaking bathroom ceilings, and I hate to say mites.

463
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:51,594
Thank you very much.

464
00:31:52,174 --> 00:31:52,414
Thank you.

465
00:31:55,538 --> 00:32:02,927
My name is Alexis Fondacaro at Brooks Park Building 6, apartment 31.

466
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,196
I've also been dealing with a lot of the same thing that my

467
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:18,882
The people who spoke previously were stating where they're trying to evict all of us and do these renovations and raise the rent.

468
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:25,005
They're still trying to evict me despite the fact that I've gotten caught up on my rent there.

469
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:26,366
They still haven't.

470
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:34,110
processed the raft payment that was given to them several months ago.

471
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:43,594
And now I have to go back to court again in September to argue with them on whether I paid the rent or not, despite the fact I have my receipts.

472
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:49,256
I like living at the Brooks Parks apartments because all my neighbors are nice, they're kind.

473
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:54,959
We've kind of gotten to know each other now that we have this tenant association and quite frankly,

474
00:32:56,439 --> 00:33:00,641
Trying to move anywhere else right now is impossible.

475
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:04,923
Last year, I tried to look for somewhere else to live that would have more space.

476
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,325
I can't find an apartment for under 1,700.

477
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,087
I can't afford that.

478
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:13,927
My take home every month is about 16.

479
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:21,571
I would also like to share a poem that I wrote about kind of living in this community.

480
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:27,196
Let me just pull it up real fast.

481
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:38,264
Sorry, hold on.

482
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,892
They say home is where the heart is, but it's not just behind your door.

483
00:33:49,392 --> 00:34:06,959
It's outside in the community with friends and neighbors, even the places we become regulars at the restaurants, the grocery stores, the little place you get cheap snacks before bed, especially the donkeys that always somehow gets part of your drink order wrong, but you go there anyway because they know you and you know them.

484
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:20,028
being forced out of that inclusion, that community is jarring, shocking, scary, having to move into a new place to call home, a new place to get settled like a hermit crab without its shell lost amongst the waves.

485
00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:21,469
This is our home.

486
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:22,629
This is where we live.

487
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,010
This is our community.

488
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,832
We will not let these corporations walk all over us.

489
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:28,814
We are not roaches to be squashed.

490
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,596
You can send all the threatening letters and people you want.

491
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:33,277
We will not be moved.

492
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:33,917
Thank you.

493
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:34,618
Thank you.

494
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,426
Good evening, Mr. President, City Council.

495
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,627
My name is João.

496
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:43,949
I'm from Brazil.

497
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:47,491
I've been living in this building since 2015.

498
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:53,496
So I moved to another place for three years, but I was facing the same problem that I'm facing right now.

499
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:57,099
The landlord kept increasing the rent, like 20%, 30%, 40%.

500
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,363
And at the end, I was paying almost $3,000, me and my ex-husband.

501
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,393
So I moved back to this building.

502
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,117
I love this community.

503
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,082
It's a very diverse community.

504
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:14,210
There are like Spanish speakers, Portuguese speakers.

505
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:21,435
Anyway, a lot of people that are my family there, like I have a lot of friends in this building.

506
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:33,504
But now, I see myself in the same situation, because I don't know how people can afford to pay rent, utilities, food, with the salaries that we have right here.

507
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:35,225
I'm a lawyer in my country here.

508
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:37,787
I work as an immigration paralegal.

509
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:44,452
And during summer, I need to work with construction, because I can't pay my bills with this market salaries.

510
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:56,862
So, I was the landlord and Charles Gatework were here, but unfortunately, I don't think they didn't come.

511
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,643
I invited them.

512
00:35:58,743 --> 00:35:59,704
They did not respond.

513
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:01,445
Yeah, to talk with them.

514
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:04,067
We have been trying for like months.

515
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,789
We are having meetings every Saturday.

516
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,290
We send two letters to them.

517
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,372
They didn't even have a conversation.

518
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:11,853
Yeah.

519
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:18,599
So I'm here with my friends, and I hope we can have a response from them soon.

520
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:19,539
Thank you.

521
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,179
Thank you so much.

522
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:20,920
Thank you.

523
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:28,624
And I work with City Light Vida Urbana, 284 Amory Street in Boston.

524
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,066
And I really appreciate you inviting us to come tonight.

525
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,067
It's a really important thing for us.

526
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:48,440
We work with tenant associations all over the metropolitan area, and it's my honor to be involved with supporting the Brooks Park Tenant Association, which is, in their weekly meetings, are a great example of a stable and beautiful community.

527
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:59,457
As you've heard, Brooks Park was sold to a real estate company, and that real estate company wanted to have everybody leave by the end of April.

528
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:10,003
And in response to that, people organized a tenant association, and 21 members of that tenant association immediately sent a letter to the landlord, simply asking for negotiations.

529
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:15,326
I wanna emphasize that, simply asking for negotiations, and they've never responded.

530
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:18,708
Two other letters have gone out since then, and they never responded.

531
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,912
Really at the core of this dispute is a moral question.

532
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:37,420
Should a real estate corporation be allowed to come in, buy a building with a business plan that requires mass eviction and rent decreases?

533
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,562
That's the moral question.

534
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:48,468
And real estate corporations are buying buildings and exacting enormous social costs from people who live there.

535
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,120
and just to make more profit.

536
00:37:52,662 --> 00:38:03,010
So in response to that, we also support lots of community protection legislation like rent control and tenant opportunity to purchase act or transfer.

537
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:11,938
But for this purpose, I just wanna emphasize the art and goal of collective bargaining.

538
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:20,403
You know, a union, a labor union, doesn't say that the market wage is the fair wage.

539
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:24,967
They say the fair wage is determined by legislation or by collective bargaining.

540
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:30,652
And similarly, tenant associations want to negotiate with a landlord to achieve a fair rent.

541
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,855
And that seemed like a pretty minimal thing to ask.

542
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:37,518
So,

543
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:48,451
I think I just end by saying that we think that people should be organizing like the Brooks Park Tenant Association has in the city of Medford and beyond.

544
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,932
And we will be there to support them.

545
00:38:51,932 --> 00:39:04,337
But I just want to emphasize too that, you know, during the foreclosure crisis, City Life was one of the primary organizations fighting for homeowners, fighting for small landlords to keep their homes.

546
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:15,129
And it reflects the fact that in our view, small homeowners and small landlords have a lot more in common with tenants than either does with big real estate corporations.

547
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:23,411
So I want to kind of leave on that note, there's that understanding that we have, there's some common ground that we can pursue if only negotiations will happen.

548
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:27,392
And we urge the city council to help us establish those negotiations.

549
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:28,292
Thank you.

550
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:35,758
Can you name an address for the record, please?

551
00:39:35,778 --> 00:39:38,959
Yes, Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, Medford, Mass.

552
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,283
I didn't come here for this issue, but I was speaking to people outside City Hall in the car, and I feel terrible for them.

553
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:56,369
And it occurred to me, if Medford were more proactive, that perhaps the city of Medford could have bought the building.

554
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:05,272
had the vocational school come in, do the wiring, fixing things up, painting and so forth.

555
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:16,396
So I would urge not necessarily the city council, but the city government to look at places where if people are going to be displaced, that maybe the city could

556
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:22,300
take over the building, they'd still be charging rent, it would be a reasonable rent.

557
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,503
But I mean, I don't know where these folks are going to go.

558
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,504
I feel very sorry for them.

559
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:39,754
People going in the real estate market, buying condos and then charging if it's a three bedroom charging $4,500 for a three bedroom apartment.

560
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:41,355
Nobody that's

561
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,687
Working hard can afford something like that.

562
00:40:45,147 --> 00:41:08,498
And I'm not saying I'm giving up my rights as a property owner, I'm not for rent control, but there are some ways that situations like this could have been avoided if the people who are at the top of our government did a little more careful thinking about the residents of Medford instead of whatever they're thinking about, which doesn't seem to be very much these days.

563
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:08,878
Thank you.

564
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:11,367
Thank you.

565
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:22,277
Yes, just if I could give some context, we were working intensely to try to have an affordable housing nonprofit purchase this property instead of the for profit developer.

566
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:29,643
Sadly, the city does not have available funds in an affordable housing trust, which we just created this past year.

567
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,205
But you know,

568
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:45,918
If there had been those funds available to make the difference between the offer from this for-profit developer who wants to kick everyone out versus the affordable housing nonprofit that wanted to work with everyone so they could stay, that's one of the efforts that we've put under.

569
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:54,383
If the for-profit developer happened to be charged a transfer fee and the affordable housing developer was exempt from that, maybe that would have been the difference.

570
00:41:54,803 --> 00:42:10,910
And of course, this council has proposed several items related that have been discussed around addressing this issue of these large corporations buying buildings and apartments that people live in and call their home and kicking them out and turning it into a profit center.

571
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:13,392
So we will continue those efforts.

572
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:15,633
because it's important.

573
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:16,713
This isn't the first time we've seen it.

574
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,173
This isn't the first tenant association.

575
00:42:18,214 --> 00:42:25,176
I see a friend right here to talk about their experience with another tenant association in another building where this happened.

576
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:25,796
It's not the first.

577
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:26,637
It won't be the last.

578
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:29,318
And the people it hurts are our neighbors and our friends.

579
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:31,979
So we're working on it.

580
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:35,140
We need more resources, and we need more policy tools.

581
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,622
We need the state to give them to us, and we need more funds to make the city a real actor in this field.

582
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:43,203
So just wanted to put that out there.

583
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:44,204
Thank you.

584
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:45,428
A name and address for the record, please.

585
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:48,456
Amanda Welliver, 26 Bradley Road.

586
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:56,071
My wife and I are here in support of the Brooks Park Tenant Association, because we know what it's like to be in their shoes.

587
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:58,853
And I'm basically here to say what President Zack just said.

588
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:03,236
Just watching them tell their story is like looking in a mirror.

589
00:43:03,696 --> 00:43:12,022
We were here two years ago because our building was sold, and with no protections against no-fault evictions, large rent increases, a lot of tenants were forced to leave.

590
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,744
And we've lived here for 16 years.

591
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:15,765
We've called Medford our home.

592
00:43:16,465 --> 00:43:22,288
but our time's up, we're probably gonna have to leave because the rents are too high and we need a strong rent control policy in the city.

593
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:23,729
Thank you.

594
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:24,990
Just wanted to put my two cents in.

595
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:25,450
Thank you.

596
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:25,830
Thank you.

597
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:38,377
Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street, where I've been lucky enough to live for 22 years now.

598
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm really ashamed that this is happening in Medford.

599
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:52,555
and I really appreciate all the things that the city councilors are doing to try and address the affordable housing situation in Medford.

600
00:43:53,696 --> 00:44:03,083
We do need some kind of rent control and we do need to fund the affordable housing bank so that when a building comes up, there's money to buy it.

601
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:08,447
And just wanna thank you all for the work you're doing in that direction.

602
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,895
Any further comments from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

603
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:25,529
Hi, I'm Katie McCann, address 91 Rossmore Road in Jamaica Plain.

604
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:37,378
I'm here in solidarity with the Brooks Park Tenant Association, and thank you, Councillor Collins and all the Councillors who have been supporting.

605
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:47,306
And I just want to express, yeah, the need for collective bargaining and also the need for strong rent control.

606
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:51,907
policies or rent stabilization policies in order to prevent this from happening.

607
00:44:52,887 --> 00:45:06,871
I worked closely with Kristen and Amanda and their neighbors at Bradley Road and with many other tenants in Medford facing really large rent increases and no fault evictions.

608
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,512
And we really need to put pressure on corporate landlords

609
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:31,599
to come to the table to negotiate, but even when we do win these collective bargaining agreements like we have one with many corporate landlords, many of those corporate landlords continue to displace neighbors in other buildings as we've seen in Malden, for example, where we won a strong agreement in three buildings owned by United Properties.

610
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:44,830
So that's why we're here really in strong support of rent control as well as in strong support of this tenant association and all tenant associations organizing to stay in their homes and stay in Medford.

611
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:45,991
Thank you all so much.

612
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:46,752
Thank you.

613
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,461
I'm just here to echo what my wife Amanda said.

614
00:45:55,481 --> 00:46:02,248
We were in this situation a few years ago, we're still, you know, we were still dealing with it.

615
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:06,252
So we totally understand and we definitely need back control because.

616
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:13,777
Like she said, 16 years in Renford and same thing, we have to leave our community.

617
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:19,140
So yes, we definitely need rent control because this cannot keep happening.

618
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:26,424
I keep hearing, every other day we hear about somewhere else, somewhere this is happening and it just needs to stop.

619
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:27,764
So thank you.

620
00:46:31,144 --> 00:46:32,244
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

621
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:35,785
I'm Eduardo Palacios, community organizer with City Life Vida Urbana.

622
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:38,265
I don't live in Medford, but I have organized out here.

623
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:48,907
And I'd say that amongst you guys, there exists that want, the desire to help our communities, to help bring stability to our homes and to our families.

624
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,047
And I think that is great.

625
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:59,849
And I ask that you build on that desire to help because what has happened here, starting with 26 Bradley to what's going on at Brooks Tenant Association,

626
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:04,132
There's only a mirror of what's going on across the lake, right?

627
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:16,241
Other cities nearby, where it's even worse, where this is a constant thing now, where every other week, more and more tenants are coming to us, saying, I'm being priced out, I'm being forced out, I have nowhere to go.

628
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:23,166
And I think here lays the power that can help prevent that, because the desire is there.

629
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:26,789
So I just hope that you don't just have the desire and let it burn out.

630
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,311
Medford has always been home for our peoples.

631
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:36,074
And I think I was surprised when I had to come here for the first time to help organize our tenant association.

632
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:41,037
But it's like he said earlier, you know, it's not the first, it's not going to be the last.

633
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,738
Corporate greed does not end.

634
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:51,703
And we just ask that you please remember, you know, rent control is what our peoples need, that what our communities need is home stability and that although the market

635
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:56,088
looks fun for real estate, we are more than just profit.

636
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:57,530
So thank you guys.

637
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:58,351
Good evening.

638
00:47:58,772 --> 00:47:59,132
Thank you.

639
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,736
Please take private conversations out in the hall.

640
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,940
There's just kind of some whispers and conversations happening.

641
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,406
If you're going to talk, please take it out in the hall and respect the people who are speaking and respect this public meeting.

642
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:09,826
Thank you.

643
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:12,628
Name and address for the record, please.

644
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:14,070
My name is Tom Conwood.

645
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,451
I'm not from Medford.

646
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:17,092
So you just have to come a little closer to the microphone.

647
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:17,372
Sorry.

648
00:48:17,573 --> 00:48:18,914
My name is Thomas Conwood.

649
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,135
I'm not from Medford.

650
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:21,536
I'm with City Life.

651
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,800
But I'm very familiar with Medford, Cambridge, and Boston.

652
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,603
And what's going on today has to stop.

653
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:34,848
I mean, people are getting kicked out for stupid reasons these days.

654
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:39,970
And you people are politicians, and you know what's going on.

655
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:47,054
And it don't make no sense to see the way these people are being abused because they don't have money.

656
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:49,555
They can't afford these rents.

657
00:48:49,675 --> 00:48:51,356
These rents are astronomical now.

658
00:48:51,956 --> 00:48:58,440
You got all these people coming in from copy beggars, coming in from all over to make a profit.

659
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,481
And people are in the streets.

660
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:05,510
from this city, to Cambridge, to Boston, to the state of Massachusetts.

661
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:07,932
And it's just wrong.

662
00:49:08,952 --> 00:49:12,995
And this rent control has to pass.

663
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:16,557
This society is not going to be elected.

664
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:17,337
It won't last.

665
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:19,258
That's all I got to say.

666
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:19,599
Thank you.

667
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:20,379
Thank you.

668
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:24,882
We're going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

669
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:29,104
Oh, I'm not a co-host.

670
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:34,310
Somebody ask Eileen to unmute.

671
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:34,891
Hi Esther.

672
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:35,812
Yeah, I'm here.

673
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:37,033
Great.

674
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:38,575
Name and address for the record, please, Eileen.

675
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:43,740
My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, Mass.

676
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:50,708
And I just find this whole situation heartbreaking and infuriating.

677
00:49:53,345 --> 00:50:01,971
I just want to let all the tenants know that there are people in this city just like me who want to stand with them.

678
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:18,902
And I think one thing that the city council might consider doing is ensuring that if these developers decide that they want to get the police to have these folks evicted, that

679
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:24,562
The city council prevents the police department from aiding them in any way.

680
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:36,655
Because I don't think they're going to stop trying to evict this people and looking into the future, they might decide to just forcibly evict them.

681
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:41,660
So maybe the city could control the police and not allow that to happen.

682
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,462
Maybe that's one thing that can go on.

683
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:49,784
But I also want to say I definitely am for rent control.

684
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:51,124
I'm from New York.

685
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:54,406
New York has had rent control for many, many years.

686
00:50:54,966 --> 00:51:03,249
It worked very well and it helped older people stay in their apartments and not be evicted because they were poor.

687
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:07,190
It helped all kinds of people and it's still helping them.

688
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,152
And people are used to it and they don't complain about it that much.

689
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,773
much that I know of, you know.

690
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:25,598
And I'm also for the transfer fee and other methods of keeping people in our community, because

691
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:33,025
Pretty soon, we're going to see tents in the streets and homeless people on the corners.

692
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:34,345
It's coming.

693
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,386
It's it's in other cities and it's going to come come here.

694
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:41,066
And if we don't do something, you know.

695
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:49,648
These people will be abandoned and we can't abandon members of our community.

696
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,268
We have to get together and support them.

697
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,649
So that's all I have to say.

698
00:51:58,203 --> 00:51:58,803
Thank you, Eileen.

699
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,285
Vice President Collins.

700
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:08,645
Thank you, President Behrs.

701
00:52:09,786 --> 00:52:22,448
I want to thank again everybody who's spoken so far, everybody who's spoken as a member of the Tenants Association, and to the people who have come here to stand in solidarity with them, or the people who found themselves here and are supporting them nonetheless.

702
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:24,069
I think that

703
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:32,117
That seems like a really Medford thing to me to say, you're my neighbor and I want you to be able to stay here and I want you to stay a part of this community.

704
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:42,747
I wanted to keep it brief at the beginning to pass the mic to the folks who are really going through this, but I just want to give a little bit more context about how I came to know about this issue that these tenants are facing.

705
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:49,332
I think it's been almost a year since I heard about the sale of the Brooks Park Apartments for the first time.

706
00:52:49,392 --> 00:53:01,461
It was actually somebody who lived, who owns a condo up the road who first reached out to me and said they had seen the for sale sign and they were really worried because they knew that this was naturally occurring affordable housing and they were worried about what would happen to the tenants after it was sold.

707
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:22,859
It was shortly after that that myself and President Beers, together with the planning department, started spending a few days just on the phone, all the time talking to an interested affordable housing developer and trying to see what we could do to make sure that this building would be competitive to sell to an affordable housing developer instead of to a for-profit housing developer.

708
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,821
And that didn't happen, unfortunately.

709
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:29,944
The offer just wasn't competitive with what the corporate property owner could offer.

710
00:53:31,566 --> 00:53:34,009
And I remember thinking, it's going to happen again.

711
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,472
What happened on Bradley Road is just going to happen again.

712
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,134
And we're just waiting for it to happen.

713
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:42,319
You know, and then several months later, it happened.

714
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:47,586
And we saw that wave of notice to quit notices go out to these two, we're hearing about that wave of evictions.

715
00:53:51,488 --> 00:53:56,752
And you know that just it, it breaks my heart as a representative of neighbors in this community.

716
00:53:57,472 --> 00:54:03,556
When people from up the street or people who are going through this come to me as a city councilor and say, what are you doing about this?

717
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:05,538
How can you stop this?

718
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,140
How can you how can you keep these people in our community?

719
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,761
How can you help me to stay in this community?

720
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:12,603
And it breaks my heart because

721
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:14,991
There's not a lot we can do.

722
00:54:15,011 --> 00:54:32,643
We had this conversation when Bradley Road was happening, we said we can stand with you, we can support you, and we can platform what you're going through, we can platform your testimony, we can stand with you when you rally outside the building, when you try and try and try to get your property owner just to talk with you, just to try and recognize you as a

723
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,965
a group of residents that are trying to collectively bargain.

724
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:44,308
But the state doesn't give us any other tools for keeping our residents who want to stay here in our community.

725
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:46,789
We don't have those tools that other states have.

726
00:54:48,870 --> 00:55:00,355
You know, I think that I'm so glad that we're talking about what it will take to put the city in a position where we can in the future buy a building like this and say,

727
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,840
We got this.

728
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:03,161
We'll protect you.

729
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:04,582
That building's up for sale.

730
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:08,844
We're going to buy it so that Medford residents can stay there in perpetuity.

731
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:10,885
We're not at that place.

732
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:12,906
I think they're growing an affordable housing trust fund.

733
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,628
The analogy that comes to mind is it's like planting a tree.

734
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:18,409
Right now we're planting that tree.

735
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:19,570
That sapling is in the ground.

736
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,791
It's been in the ground for three months.

737
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:26,614
It's going to be decades before we can turn that into

738
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:33,096
purchasing buildings that will be affordable housing for members of this community, unless we start planting immediate.

739
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:34,698
And that's what's so sad.

740
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:35,739
We're behind the eight ball.

741
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:40,943
So we need to be thinking about growing that forest so that this doesn't keep happening again in the future.

742
00:55:41,624 --> 00:55:49,171
But in the short term, we need more tools to help people like the tenants that are before us this evening, whose problem is right here and right now.

743
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:50,552
I can't wait 20 years.

744
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:53,210
So I want to thank you so much for being here.

745
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:59,555
And every time that a tenant speaks out for themselves and their neighbors, they're speaking out for all tenants who don't want to be moved around the region like pawns.

746
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:06,100
They want to stay here in their community where they work and have friends and have family and have invested and want to keep investing.

747
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:07,721
Thank you.

748
00:56:15,745 --> 00:56:16,085
Thank you.

749
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:21,128
I'd also like to add that in addition to my colleagues' efforts on this.

750
00:56:21,188 --> 00:56:28,893
So I talked to legal about what options city council has in helping the tenants.

751
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:36,437
And honestly, as we've been hinting, there isn't really a whole lot that we can do given the current tools that we have.

752
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:44,802
There's a lot that we could have done if different choices were made 30 years ago, if the city had decided to plant that tree 30 years ago.

753
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,325
We could have put up the money to do that, but we can't right now.

754
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:57,350
But right now, this city council is asking, trying to ask the state to give us the tools to prevent that.

755
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:15,022
And not only are we seeing these real estate management companies not respond to their own tenants, not sit down to negotiate, but we're also seeing them actively fight tooth and nail to prevent cities from having those tools in the first place because they're making so much money from this.

756
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:34,741
What they're spending their time doing, and I'm sure that a lot of people in this room have received those mailers, is put out information, mass text robocalls that are scaring average homeowners, average residents into thinking that these initiatives that this city council is pursuing is going to hurt them.

757
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:35,802
It's not.

758
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:39,285
It is going to prevent your neighbors from being driven out of the city.

759
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:52,739
Okay, that's what we're seeing is a very small number of bad actors put out propaganda to prevent the city from having even the minimum amount of tools necessary to prevent this from happening in the future.

760
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:03,727
So I know that, you know, people come here and they don't like to see it when their neighbors get kicked out because right now these problems have a face to them.

761
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:09,371
They have the face of your neighbor saying that we're going to have to leave because a big company is telling us to leave.

762
00:58:11,043 --> 00:58:11,925
And then it feels bad.

763
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:19,756
But when people say, Oh, you know, somebody should have done something about this 30 years ago, somebody should have done something about this before.

764
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:23,041
That's because every every time anybody's tried to do anything about it.

765
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:32,522
big money interest will come in and prevent it from happening through these sorts of opposition campaigns, which we're seeing in Medford right now.

766
00:58:33,282 --> 00:58:38,045
So I'd like to point that out, that that's an important piece of context.

767
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:40,847
The Charles Gate Realty Group is not giving silence.

768
00:58:41,327 --> 00:58:50,473
What they're doing is giving large donations to state senators, state representatives, telling them to nix these initiatives at the state level.

769
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:51,534
That's what's happening right now.

770
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:55,455
Councilor.

771
00:58:58,057 --> 00:58:58,417
Thank you.

772
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:07,822
So I, I too feel, um, that we, we owe a certain amount of protection to our, our, our, uh, our residents.

773
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:12,324
And I think that we have tools in place that we're just not taking advantage of here in Medford.

774
00:59:13,005 --> 00:59:21,009
Um, this council really can't do much for you, but what we can do, we can work with the CPA like the city of Cambridge and

775
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:26,893
put CPA funding to keep a mediation company on retainer.

776
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,974
So when these issues happen, you're not scrambling.

777
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:35,095
There's an avenue that you can come right here to City Hall to make sure that you're protected.

778
00:59:35,735 --> 00:59:37,695
And I think that that's the beginning of it.

779
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:47,777
I know that my fellow council feels that what we're talking about right now, we have a group of people that are in dire need, that are afraid.

780
00:59:47,857 --> 00:59:49,878
And I feel sympathy and I understand that.

781
00:59:50,646 --> 01:00:03,196
But with, now, say no different, no different than Brooks family feels than the residents that reach out to me saying, George, I'm 78 years old.

782
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:05,098
I lived in a fixed income.

783
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:06,078
I own my home.

784
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:17,748
And the process that this, that society has given us has, by success, has driven the cost of my home up.

785
01:00:18,885 --> 01:00:20,126
Now they live in a fixed income.

786
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:24,589
So now what you hear, you hear a council that says, let's have rent control.

787
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:25,930
Let's do a tenure.

788
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,571
Let's do a transfer tax.

789
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,752
Let's do a registration fee.

790
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,353
Let's do an override.

791
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:32,834
Let's do that's frightening.

792
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:35,231
So I think we're on the same boat.

793
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:38,192
I think you have homeowners, and this is the problem.

794
01:00:38,613 --> 01:00:45,535
It's very, it's difficult when you have some counselors trying to divide the community by calling things fear tactics.

795
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:46,335
They're not.

796
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:48,696
People are scared because it's the truth.

797
01:00:49,935 --> 01:01:08,060
If you own that home and you live there, and you didn't expect your $18,000 home you bought 35 years ago, that is now a million dollars, because some people behind this real feel like, because that house is worth a million dollars, that person that owns that house and that has to live there every day, that that's a wealthy person.

798
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,171
No, it's the same person that's sitting back here.

799
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,851
It's the same person with the same fears.

800
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,652
So let's not divide.

801
01:01:17,232 --> 01:01:19,832
Let's try to find options like the CPA.

802
01:01:20,873 --> 01:01:24,733
Let's look at the CPA for mediation.

803
01:01:25,093 --> 01:01:26,534
Let's look at our CPA tax.

804
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:29,774
We had Council Marks has been preaching for years.

805
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:36,616
Look at the space that we have, that Medford owns, that we can sell.

806
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:49,834
We can allow building use on those small parcels that you could take that money and put it in to the affordable trust fund that, by the way, we haven't even established yet.

807
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:50,875
It's not even up.

808
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:55,718
But imagine that funding coming in, that the Brooks family comes to us and says, what?

809
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:57,859
We're being pushed out.

810
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,242
Yeah, we could plant the seed.

811
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:07,686
But listen, I can also go get an oak and bring it right here and plop it right down the middle of this forum.

812
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:09,892
So there are avenues.

813
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,195
So don't don't let's let's be honest.

814
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:18,782
I fear and I will work as hard as I can for this organization because I hate to see people leaving.

815
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:20,262
It's not fair.

816
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:25,184
But at the same time, you can't look at the other side and say, it's all your fault.

817
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:29,525
So we're gonna move you out so everybody's in that boat.

818
01:02:29,885 --> 01:02:38,248
We need to find the common ground that we can all work together to make sure that we all want affordable housing, that people aren't scared to leave.

819
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:45,070
Sure, listen, I think that one thing we should focus on is look at the developers that are coming into the community.

820
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:56,636
find a way that we have legislation behind us that would protect owners that or renters that live in their home that are being pushed out for for total gain.

821
01:02:57,536 --> 01:03:00,678
So I agree, I'm going to support you 1000%.

822
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:09,923
But I'm going to make the motion that we ask us a CPA organization to fund a mediation retainer right away.

823
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:14,766
Because again, as much as we all have good intentions back here, we don't have the power

824
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:16,466
to do what needs to be done.

825
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:19,627
You know, we had Councilor Carviello come here today.

826
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:25,949
He worked all last week on an 88-year-old woman that was being displaced, who has cancer.

827
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,650
And he came up to City Hall to ask for help.

828
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,951
And do you know what happened?

829
01:03:30,611 --> 01:03:32,531
Nothing, because nobody answered the call.

830
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:38,973
It's a City Councilor that's worked his tail off to make sure he's protecting a resident of the city.

831
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:40,274
So we all understand.

832
01:03:41,974 --> 01:03:47,619
But this is where the unity comes in instead of saying that, oh, this is this and this is that.

833
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:51,502
We need to figure out a way to make sure affordable housing is done correctly.

834
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:54,164
And we use the avenues that we already have in place here.

835
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:55,686
We just haven't tapped into it.

836
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:56,767
Thank you.

837
01:03:57,554 --> 01:03:57,814
Thank you.

838
01:03:57,854 --> 01:03:59,316
I just want to put out a couple of things.

839
01:03:59,376 --> 01:04:03,181
I think if we're talking about unity, we're talking about all agreeing, but we're also talking about misinformation.

840
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:14,877
The proposals that have been put forward when we talk about the someone in their home, they're on a fixed income, they're scared, they live in their home, they live in a single family or two family or three family that they're afraid of these proposals that we're proposing.

841
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:20,725
The next sentence out of everybody's mouth needs to be, all of these proposals exclude your house.

842
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:23,126
We're not going after one, two, and three families.

843
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:24,687
We're not going after owner occupied.

844
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:28,569
So when we talk about misinformation, that's the misinformation.

845
01:04:28,629 --> 01:04:29,389
So point of information.

846
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:30,450
No, no point of information.

847
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,370
No, no, it's point of information.

848
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:32,531
I have the right to point of information.

849
01:04:32,571 --> 01:04:33,451
When I'm done, thank you.

850
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:35,112
So that's the facts.

851
01:04:35,152 --> 01:04:35,772
Those are the facts.

852
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,133
So we're all talking about unity here.

853
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:43,336
We're talking about we agree that large corporations shouldn't come in and buy large multi-unit buildings and pick everybody up.

854
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:50,179
Great, so you support the proposals that we have on the table around the rent stabilization that says that and the transfer fee that says that?

855
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:50,899
Because that's what you all say.

856
01:04:50,919 --> 01:04:52,900
When you're ready, when you're ready, point of information.

857
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,040
That's what you all say, sir.

858
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,081
So that's the information.

859
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,701
With the gavel today, I see where it's coming.

860
01:04:56,902 --> 01:05:04,225
But a point of information, I will tell you, the misinformation that's going out there was a letter signed by two of the leaders in this body.

861
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:05,825
No, we've answered that question.

862
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:07,146
We've answered that question.

863
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,266
That's exactly what's scaring people.

864
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:08,767
It's not.

865
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:12,449
Because it's actually actions not it's not words.

866
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:20,516
It's actions and your actions were something totally opposite false information Well, then why haven't we had the meeting on the tenure on the transfer tax then?

867
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:25,841
Why haven't we have committee on the transfer tax so we can point out and pick out what you just said?

868
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:34,728
Because if you came out and we sat as a community and said this is what we need Let's not let's not hurt the homeowners like you said in that in that context.

869
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:36,510
I'm for you a thousand percent, right?

870
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,871
But we haven't done that have you?

871
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:38,931
that we have.

872
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:41,932
That's every email response to every email I've received.

873
01:05:42,312 --> 01:05:46,473
The demands are shifting, sir, because the demands were don't move it at all.

874
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:47,593
You're moving too fast.

875
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:49,133
And now the demands are we're moving too slow?

876
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:50,613
I can't count.

877
01:05:50,753 --> 01:05:53,474
I can't count which demands to meet.

878
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,514
Councilor Lemming, thank you.

879
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:59,055
I just want to note that I think we've gotten pretty far off of the topic of the resolution.

880
01:05:59,075 --> 01:06:04,336
I would like to respond to the misinformative spin put on

881
01:06:06,098 --> 01:06:06,939
actions that I've made.

882
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:13,564
However, I'd prefer that we get back on topic and get on with the meeting because talking about the transfer fee was not on the agenda for tonight.

883
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:14,305
Thank you.

884
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:15,306
Sure.

885
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:15,666
Thank you.

886
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:30,565
I'd also like to just, the CPA seems to come up a lot here, but something like $2.4 million is already going to affordable housing initiatives to rebuild Waukline Court.

887
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:32,446
It's one project.

888
01:06:32,566 --> 01:06:34,307
It's one project.

889
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,950
Please, please, please do not speak the truth.

890
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,451
You want to talk about not speaking the truth?

891
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:40,471
That's affordable.

892
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:43,894
The CPA is not phasing that out for one project.

893
01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:47,235
Councilor Scarpelli, one project.

894
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:52,938
I sat on the CPA prior to being elected to this council.

895
01:06:52,998 --> 01:07:00,962
Now, affordable housing projects that involve building do come along less frequently than open space and historic preservation projects.

896
01:07:01,002 --> 01:07:05,404
And so typically a larger portion of funding needs to be dedicated to those.

897
01:07:05,744 --> 01:07:10,066
One project, because the CPA has not really been around all that long.

898
01:07:10,546 --> 01:07:11,647
Now, funding,

899
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:18,272
a mediator, I suppose, is not a solution to these problems.

900
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:23,176
They're trying to find mediation.

901
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:25,258
They've said that they're trying to find mediation.

902
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:34,126
So putting more money towards somebody else that's also trying to find mediation is not a long-term sustainable solution to this

903
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:36,528
to this problem.

904
01:07:36,588 --> 01:07:39,990
Now, I agree with what Vice President Collins just said.

905
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:47,536
This has gotten off topic, but I hear so much misinformation about the CPA being thrown around these chambers that I did feel like addressing that.

906
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:47,937
Thank you.

907
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:50,058
Thank you.

908
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,682
Any further discussion by members of the council?

909
01:07:58,305 --> 01:07:58,745
Seeing none.

910
01:07:58,765 --> 01:08:01,247
Name and address for the record, please.

911
01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:02,128
Good evening.

912
01:08:02,188 --> 01:08:03,309
Matthew Page Lieberman.

913
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:14,382
Yes, regarding what Councilor Scarpelli said, I don't know if it'd be a bit too strong to say misinformation, but perhaps there were a few things that were said without the best of judgment.

914
01:08:16,803 --> 01:08:21,245
When you, when, through the chair, through the chair, yes, apologies.

915
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:30,991
When a member of this body says that everybody's in the same boat, you know, whether it's people being evicted who don't know where they're gonna live in a few weeks,

916
01:08:31,553 --> 01:08:35,136
or people that are upset that they have to pay higher property taxes.

917
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:39,198
I start to wonder, are these things really equivalent?

918
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,640
Are these things really equivalent?

919
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:48,805
Because I don't have any record of anybody being kicked out of their house because of property taxes.

920
01:08:49,986 --> 01:08:52,307
Now, I know that there's a program for deferments.

921
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:58,552
Does anybody here know if anybody's been kicked out of their house because of property taxes?

922
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:04,068
direct your comments to the chair.

923
01:09:04,468 --> 01:09:07,911
There are people who, when they don't pay their property taxes, they're foreclosed upon.

924
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:08,972
That is something that happens.

925
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:12,836
There's a program in the city for people to defer their taxes.

926
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,277
Nobody's taking that up.

927
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:19,421
Instead, we're asking for the taxes to be forgiven until they could sell their house and then pay them.

928
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:26,868
You're saying this is all an act, so people in the city are actually, they're given the option to defer their taxes.

929
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:27,609
Is that correct?

930
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:31,315
There is an option for property tax deferments, yes.

931
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:37,016
And yet, even with that policy existing, they're getting kicked out of their house in the city.

932
01:09:37,236 --> 01:09:37,656
It depends.

933
01:09:37,676 --> 01:09:44,038
I mean, if they're not taking that policy out, and then they're not paying their taxes, all people are who do not pay their property tax.

934
01:09:44,058 --> 01:09:44,618
They are.

935
01:09:45,058 --> 01:09:46,558
What are you saying?

936
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,739
There's hundreds of people a month.

937
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,240
Are people getting evicted?

938
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,800
Yes, they are.

939
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,021
It's not an eviction, it's a foreclosure, so we want to be factual.

940
01:09:57,381 --> 01:10:03,483
So people with, as you said, you said they paid what $18,000, and it goes up to a million dollars in their port, right?

941
01:10:03,803 --> 01:10:05,044
And we're not having pity for them.

942
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:06,204
We're not having sympathy for them.

943
01:10:06,524 --> 01:10:08,265
It's called cash powerhouse rich.

944
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:16,588
And you're telling me that there are people with you know, $800,000, a million dollars, and they're not taking advantage of the deferment thing, and they're losing their homes.

945
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:20,093
And that happens, there are cases where that happens.

946
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:21,174
Okay, in Medford.

947
01:10:21,435 --> 01:10:21,615
Yes.

948
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:24,778
And we think that that's equivalent to people that can't pay $1,600.

949
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:27,140
I don't think anyone's saying that it's equivalent, but I don't think this is.

950
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,201
Well, I heard it, it's all in the same book.

951
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:29,222
We're not gonna engage in dialogue.

952
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:30,904
Finish your comment, and we're gonna move on.

953
01:10:32,878 --> 01:10:34,359
Okay, that, all right, fine.

954
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:35,719
Thank you for the clarity.

955
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,622
There was one other thing that was pitched, which is the idea of selling off city land.

956
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:45,545
I know that this, there's a lot of times people have pitched this in the past.

957
01:10:45,985 --> 01:10:53,509
I work behind the scenes to cancel any of these ideas to sell off city land, especially when we're talking about things that happened 30 years ago with no foresight.

958
01:10:54,289 --> 01:11:02,211
and we're talking about developers coming in and raising the rent, selling off the city land to a for-profit developer is not gonna solve this problem.

959
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:08,053
And I'm gonna fight against this constantly and work with everybody here to fight against selling off the city land.

960
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,393
Thank you for your comment.

961
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:14,075
Point of information, just to be clear, I'll give you an example.

962
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:15,595
Today, I talked to a homeowner.

963
01:11:15,655 --> 01:11:16,976
I talked to a homeowner today that has about

964
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,051
18 feet that the city owns.

965
01:11:24,431 --> 01:11:30,674
They're willing to come in and pay that 18 feet to build an addition for the senior citizen parent to move in with them.

966
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:35,336
So I know it sounds nice and it sounds powerful to say developers.

967
01:11:35,576 --> 01:11:36,757
It's not all developers.

968
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:48,282
You have small parcels of land that homeowners that are bought these properties that will gladly pay, that would feed our trust to help communities like we have here at the Brooks.

969
01:11:48,742 --> 01:11:49,583
Thank you, Mr. President.

970
01:11:50,342 --> 01:11:52,984
Yeah, I don't get this theory of mine.

971
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:55,806
Today, you can't respond, Matthew, please.

972
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:56,567
I'm not gonna stop.

973
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:57,808
I want to say something.

974
01:11:57,828 --> 01:11:58,389
Please sit down.

975
01:11:59,049 --> 01:11:59,449
Thank you.

976
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:02,732
We're gonna go to Munir Germanus on zoom.

977
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:04,413
Name and address for the record, please.

978
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,257
My name is Munir Germanus.

979
01:12:09,498 --> 01:12:11,299
I live at three summit road.

980
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,022
I've lived in Medford for about 40 years.

981
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:26,035
Our house actually is a two-family house that we rent and I'm happy with the person renting the apartment.

982
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:31,259
I haven't increased the rent for the past seven years except once.

983
01:12:32,751 --> 01:12:49,680
And I'm really appreciate the efforts of this city council in addressing the shortcomings that we have in our income to the city to address problems such as what we're discussing right now.

984
01:12:50,961 --> 01:12:56,544
I am receiving a lot of emails from so-called homeowners associations.

985
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:04,752
a lot of misinformation that I don't appreciate, and I try to just delete it and ignore it.

986
01:13:05,592 --> 01:13:17,918
But I'm here to support the efforts of the Brooks Parks Tenant Association, and also to give my full support for the work of this city council.

987
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:34,729
And I know it's difficult for the city council to solve the problems of the world, but I also appreciate their stance on asking our federal government to stop spending billions of dollars on armaments and then

988
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:47,334
use some of this money where it really, really is needed in our schools, in our tenants associations, in supporting affordable housing.

989
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:50,077
Thank you very much for listening to me.

990
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:51,598
Thank you.

991
01:13:51,618 --> 01:13:56,023
I'm going to go to Susan Duran on zoom name and address for the record, please.

992
01:13:57,944 --> 01:14:00,628
Susan Girard, 26, Farragut Ave.

993
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:14,486
I just wanted to say, I wanted to say that I really appreciate what Steve Meacham said when he spoke about there not being a contradiction between

994
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:19,990
small homeowners and renters, which I think we've heard a little bit too much of.

995
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:24,513
Nobody is trying to harm small homeowners.

996
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:31,558
I don't think anybody here thinks that people who own their own home that have gone up tremendously in value is a rich person.

997
01:14:31,578 --> 01:14:44,486
And I don't think anybody, any small homeowner is harmed by having tenants that are renters in the city protected from

998
01:14:45,487 --> 01:14:49,971
these large realtors that come in and drastically raise the rents.

999
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:52,213
I think that's what we're really talking.

1000
01:14:52,253 --> 01:15:01,361
I mean, even a small landlord like Mounir Jumanis, they can raise their rents if there's things that need to be fixed in their house.

1001
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:03,123
I don't think anybody is opposing that.

1002
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:08,728
I also want to say that there are small businesses that are suffering in Medford from having their rents raised.

1003
01:15:08,768 --> 01:15:17,376
I just want to comment, I live in East Medford and my hairdresser who lives practically across the street has had his rent raised by $500 a month, which as a small

1004
01:15:19,858 --> 01:15:29,382
operation, not only he, but a lot of the businesses along Salem Street have had their rents raised, and it's difficult for them because they're not large businesses.

1005
01:15:29,422 --> 01:15:30,402
They're really struggling.

1006
01:15:31,142 --> 01:15:34,984
And so I think what we're talking about here is corporate greed.

1007
01:15:35,124 --> 01:15:40,506
We're talking about the large landlords that come in, raise rents dramatically, and evict people.

1008
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:43,067
And I did want to say, I believe that

1009
01:15:44,747 --> 01:15:56,909
that City Councilor Scarpelli talked about, people who might want to take a small piece of property and build an accessory dwelling unit on it for a family member or someone else.

1010
01:15:57,449 --> 01:16:01,050
And I believe that's supported by most of us here as a good thing.

1011
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:04,951
If someone wants to be able to do that, that should be allowed to be done.

1012
01:16:05,331 --> 01:16:09,732
And the final thing I want to say is that the CPA does not have that much money, actually.

1013
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:20,718
It would be lovely if they did to be able to buy buildings or seriously help renters, but they don't have that much money.

1014
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:25,162
So I think the issue is, you know, how do we help everybody in the city?

1015
01:16:25,462 --> 01:16:35,229
How do we think about everybody and protect them from large, greedy people who are going to come in here, raise rents dramatically and evict people?

1016
01:16:35,269 --> 01:16:37,931
And I think that's the nub of this whole matter right now.

1017
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:45,056
So I just want to be clear that it doesn't have to be a fight between small homeowners and renters.

1018
01:16:45,496 --> 01:16:46,196
Thank you very much.

1019
01:16:46,216 --> 01:16:49,699
Thank you.

1020
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,582
Go to Mr. Castaneda on Zoom.

1021
01:16:55,022 --> 01:16:56,163
Name and address for the record, please.

1022
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,245
Hi, Councilors.

1023
01:17:00,086 --> 01:17:02,087
Also, I'm from East Medford also.

1024
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,629
I'm Castaneda Andrew.

1025
01:17:06,013 --> 01:17:11,097
I'll agree that inflation is out of control I Swear I'm not on CNN.

1026
01:17:11,117 --> 01:17:13,439
I don't do that kind of work.

1027
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:17,381
I Just stopped the video That's fine that advertises

1028
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:41,029
20 years ago, we would have a big TV three argument about that.

1029
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:48,794
Mr. Cassidy, we will allow you to speak but your video is off.

1030
01:17:49,515 --> 01:17:52,577
And I appreciate that because I'm camera shy.

1031
01:17:58,121 --> 01:18:00,263
Okay, can we start again?

1032
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:03,826
Go ahead.

1033
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:08,667
Okay, I'll agree inflation is out of control for all.

1034
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:10,607
Welcome to Bidenomics.

1035
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:18,969
I told you once and I told you twice, but you never listened to my advice.

1036
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:32,411
I said it before that comes with listen, the best solution for the housing situation is to form an apartment cooperative ownership buildings in Medford.

1037
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:46,272
The person that gets into the apartment will own up just like a condo and that would be with a 67% savings from today's condo prices in Medford.

1038
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:49,193
So instead of a million, you probably get into it for like 350,000 PS.

1039
01:18:53,388 --> 01:18:55,709
rent control failed in the city of Boston.

1040
01:18:55,729 --> 01:19:00,931
My uncle Joe Castanetti brothers, you know, in nine buildings in the north end but not by the expressway.

1041
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:05,632
He ended up selling them all and rent control did feel good night.

1042
01:19:05,652 --> 01:19:13,895
Name and address for the record, please.

1043
01:19:15,071 --> 01:19:17,053
Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street.

1044
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:29,683
I just want to say that I think the idea of having a city mediator is a really great idea, and I applaud Councilor Scarpelli for bringing that forward.

1045
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:32,325
That is a band-aid solution.

1046
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:42,132
We need some band-aids, but we also need the more long-term solutions, and I just feel that if we could focus on all the good ideas

1047
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:51,693
instead of putting some in the bad category and some in the good category, I think we all really want the same thing.

1048
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:56,275
And if we could just go in with that attitude, I think we can get the job done.

1049
01:19:56,575 --> 01:19:56,976
Thank you.

1050
01:19:57,416 --> 01:19:58,116
Thank you.

1051
01:19:58,136 --> 01:19:59,957
Name and address for the record, please.

1052
01:20:02,281 --> 01:20:06,523
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1053
01:20:07,043 --> 01:20:14,266
I just wanna say that I think that some form of rent control is a plausibly good idea, likely a good idea rather.

1054
01:20:15,027 --> 01:20:20,049
It doesn't mean that it has to be the worst one you're imagining if you're a landlord.

1055
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:26,852
It doesn't mean that it has to be the worst one you're imagining

1056
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:30,450
Sorry, I lost my train of thought with that noise there.

1057
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:37,395
It doesn't have to be, basically there are many options that would have helped these tenants.

1058
01:20:37,435 --> 01:20:39,836
It doesn't have to be the most, you can't raise the rent at all.

1059
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:42,418
You can only raise a half a percent or something like that, right?

1060
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:48,883
There are lots of different policies in between and we need some level of stability for everybody.

1061
01:20:48,903 --> 01:20:53,666
And I just wanna, that's the point that I had forgotten was that,

1062
01:20:55,875 --> 01:21:03,538
Homeowners have certain policies, as Mr. Page Lieberman mentioned, that are intended to give them some stability.

1063
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,599
If they're a senior, they can take a deferment.

1064
01:21:05,799 --> 01:21:10,681
We also have, that's why we have this process for raising property taxes.

1065
01:21:11,081 --> 01:21:13,162
You guys can't raise them willy-nilly.

1066
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:16,403
It's a prop two and a half process.

1067
01:21:16,463 --> 01:21:17,664
We had to all vote on it.

1068
01:21:17,724 --> 01:21:19,025
It's a really big deal.

1069
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:24,148
And that was put in place to give some homeowners a level of stability.

1070
01:21:24,448 --> 01:21:27,589
So we should be doing something along those lines for tenants too.

1071
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,070
Some level of stability.

1072
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:39,356
Doesn't mean infinite stability, but some, just as we offer some stability to homeowners through prop two and a half, deferment schemes, et cetera.

1073
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:41,777
So that's the point I want to make there.

1074
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:43,058
Thank you.

1075
01:21:44,224 --> 01:21:44,704
Thank you.

1076
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:48,545
Any further discussion by members of the public?

1077
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:51,906
Any further discussion by members of the council?

1078
01:21:53,566 --> 01:22:00,608
Seeing none, I'm just going to add one other thing, which is we could, and this was an initiative of, oh, I'll go to you, Mr. Merritt.

1079
01:22:01,028 --> 01:22:02,188
Name and address for the record, please.

1080
01:22:02,448 --> 01:22:04,209
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1081
01:22:04,929 --> 01:22:08,230
I do want to just do a shout out for someone I saw some

1082
01:22:09,246 --> 01:22:11,047
you know, bad blood going on between here.

1083
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:12,047
Some spirited discussion.

1084
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:14,068
It's my kid's first birthday today.

1085
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:17,029
I was at home actually, you know, having cake and ice cream.

1086
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:23,192
And my wife went out to go get a balloon for him earlier today at Wegmans and the wind took the balloon away.

1087
01:22:23,993 --> 01:22:36,478
And a really wonderful, I don't know where she's from, but this woman saw my toddler actually crying his head off and went inside and bought a replacement balloon to make my toddler happy, my three-year-old happy.

1088
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,079
So I thought that was actually really cool.

1089
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,180
I know it has nothing to do with, you know, the topic at hand.

1090
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,022
But at the same time, you know, there are good people out there.

1091
01:22:44,662 --> 01:22:47,543
And I just had to acknowledge that, you know, that was really, really awesome.

1092
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,304
That person did not have to do that at all.

1093
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:51,285
So hopefully a little more levity here.

1094
01:22:52,485 --> 01:22:54,446
That said, I know we are talking about some serious things.

1095
01:22:56,327 --> 01:23:02,708
I think people need to understand that Proposition 2.5 overrides don't just affect homeowners, it affects all property owners.

1096
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,208
Is that correct?

1097
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:05,129
Commercial as well as residential?

1098
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:06,449
All taxable property.

1099
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:07,649
All taxable property.

1100
01:23:08,309 --> 01:23:15,610
Another thing that is, as far as I know is true, is it's not just property taxes that you don't pay, like if you don't pay them right and there are plans.

1101
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,791
If I don't pay my water bill, can the city put a lien on my property?

1102
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:20,511
Yes.

1103
01:23:21,151 --> 01:23:22,171
And they can own my property.

1104
01:23:23,752 --> 01:23:25,212
If you don't pay your bills, what happens?

1105
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:33,005
can put a lien on your property and then they sell it and they keep the entire property in some cases.

1106
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:33,865
That has happened.

1107
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:37,807
It's been ruled illegal and it's something that this council is working very diligently.

1108
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:42,730
But right now, the state of the law is that they can take the entire property, not just the amount that they owe to the city.

1109
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,131
Yeah, and that's not a good law.

1110
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:49,192
Okay, so just this misnomer that number one, you have commercial businesses here.

1111
01:23:49,893 --> 01:23:55,514
And I think one of the things I've seen over the years, we live around the corner from the Locust Street project, right?

1112
01:23:56,414 --> 01:24:00,596
And everyone was hot to trot, we're gonna build, build, build, build more residential properties.

1113
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:01,236
Okay, great.

1114
01:24:01,756 --> 01:24:04,217
So you have a giant megaplex, I'm sure people there are happy.

1115
01:24:05,057 --> 01:24:05,817
Where do they go to work?

1116
01:24:07,718 --> 01:24:08,478
It's a danger, right?

1117
01:24:08,498 --> 01:24:11,719
We need more, we need more places for people to live, but where do they go to work?

1118
01:24:13,046 --> 01:24:16,808
people don't live in the city and work in the city anymore, right?

1119
01:24:16,848 --> 01:24:18,228
That that model's kind of changed.

1120
01:24:18,968 --> 01:24:23,470
I work in New Hampshire, I got to drive back and forth to New Hampshire to go to work now.

1121
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:25,271
And that's how I can afford to pay my bills.

1122
01:24:26,872 --> 01:24:29,753
You know, and I sit back and I hear that, you know, there's this

1123
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,572
It's kind of this bad blood of people demonizing people who are fortunate to own property.

1124
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,613
I gave my pennies a lot.

1125
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:42,254
I bought a tiny little house in Medford.

1126
01:24:42,314 --> 01:24:45,035
This was not my first choice of places to live 10 years ago.

1127
01:24:45,615 --> 01:24:50,217
Since I moved in, I had someone drive through my front yard, take out my house, the fence on my property.

1128
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:52,098
Councilor Scarpelli, you were here for that.

1129
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:55,779
That was my first appearance at a city council saying, what the crap?

1130
01:24:58,143 --> 01:25:02,485
And since then, my street is still a disaster, and nothing has happened, right?

1131
01:25:02,525 --> 01:25:05,426
Riverside is an abomination.

1132
01:25:06,486 --> 01:25:10,588
And the city hasn't been able to afford to pay back for a decade to actually fix that road.

1133
01:25:11,508 --> 01:25:12,709
And I don't see a good plan.

1134
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:21,372
So if we sit there long term, right, we're gonna go develop Mystic out, we're just gonna develop, make everything residential, get rid of it, make it all residential, make it all affordable housing.

1135
01:25:22,433 --> 01:25:22,933
Who's gonna pay?

1136
01:25:25,267 --> 01:25:27,099
Who came in and built the locus street project?

1137
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,469
That was a real estate developer.

1138
01:25:29,983 --> 01:25:34,604
And this city government, not you specifically on the council, you guys weren't here, you were here.

1139
01:25:35,025 --> 01:25:40,626
And actually the city council tried to fight that because there was a whole debacle of how that went down.

1140
01:25:40,646 --> 01:25:42,387
There was open meeting law violations.

1141
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:53,210
The city council couldn't actually use the city solicitor because the mayor, Mayor Burke at the time had the city solicitor working for the city to actually push that project through.

1142
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:55,691
But how does the city make money?

1143
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,804
The city makes money off of permits and fees.

1144
01:25:58,844 --> 01:26:04,268
And every time there's a building built, they want people to pay, developers to pay.

1145
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:06,789
So the city wants these big buildings.

1146
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:09,051
But now you're saying, I don't want big buildings.

1147
01:26:09,091 --> 01:26:11,112
I don't want big companies to come in.

1148
01:26:12,353 --> 01:26:13,214
Well, what are they going to build?

1149
01:26:13,274 --> 01:26:16,876
Are they going to build another 10, 56 square foot house like mine?

1150
01:26:17,176 --> 01:26:22,600
You think any developer is going to come in and pay all the fees and the fines that this city levies on to build anything?

1151
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,381
You think it's worth their time?

1152
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:29,359
I just got a quote for new siding on my house, cedar siding.

1153
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:29,880
Okay.

1154
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:36,167
Just the materials alone for white cedar, not even the good cedar.

1155
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,568
Okay.

1156
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,593
Good cedar, Western red cedar is $2,500 for a hundred square feet.

1157
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:43,997
The crappy stuff is 1700.

1158
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:46,380
And that's what I'm looking at to fix my house.

1159
01:26:47,947 --> 01:26:49,468
And there are things I'd rather be doing.

1160
01:26:50,028 --> 01:26:51,408
I'd rather buy my kids toys.

1161
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:54,070
I'd rather be spending time with them than being here.

1162
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:55,650
But I have to make tough choices.

1163
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,211
And the city's got some tough choices to make.

1164
01:26:59,272 --> 01:27:03,333
So before I keep hearing this demonization of property owners and this and that, you know what?

1165
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:06,215
Nobody said you had to live in Medford.

1166
01:27:06,595 --> 01:27:08,135
Nobody says I have to live in Medford.

1167
01:27:10,176 --> 01:27:11,517
I'm not from Medford.

1168
01:27:12,317 --> 01:27:13,258
I'm from Western Mass.

1169
01:27:14,511 --> 01:27:17,333
First place I moved to to get a job was in upstate New York.

1170
01:27:17,353 --> 01:27:18,614
You wanna know where there's plenty of land?

1171
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:20,435
Western Mass in upstate New York.

1172
01:27:21,676 --> 01:27:22,777
You don't have to live here.

1173
01:27:22,797 --> 01:27:24,898
Nobody deserves to live here necessarily.

1174
01:27:24,918 --> 01:27:26,680
It's not a, you gotta work for it.

1175
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:30,242
Yes, I wish we could sit there and wave and run and be like, everyone can have a house.

1176
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:33,284
I work, I go to work, I'd rather not.

1177
01:27:33,324 --> 01:27:34,985
My wife goes to work, she'd rather not.

1178
01:27:35,366 --> 01:27:36,286
We pay for daycare.

1179
01:27:36,326 --> 01:27:38,968
So instead I can, you know, I can go to work to pay for daycare.

1180
01:27:39,308 --> 01:27:40,629
It's almost like a break even song.

1181
01:27:41,633 --> 01:27:43,794
I mean, these are real expenses that homeowners have.

1182
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:49,275
So every time I hear, oh, we're just gonna pass prop two and a half, because we need, no, I haven't seen it for years.

1183
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:51,956
I think we really need to take a look at where the expenses are too.

1184
01:27:52,216 --> 01:27:57,357
And Councilor Behrs, no offense, but you and I have gone around before and you said, I will not make cuts to the school.

1185
01:27:57,717 --> 01:27:58,278
I will not.

1186
01:27:58,418 --> 01:28:00,198
Some things are absolutely off the table.

1187
01:28:01,358 --> 01:28:02,839
Then the same argument back at you.

1188
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:04,879
Prop two and a half, absolutely off the table.

1189
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,120
And then nothing gets done.

1190
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,821
And we're at an impasse and the roads are still crap.

1191
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:14,389
But I don't see a plan, even if you do the prop two and a half, it's an impulse of money.

1192
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:16,450
You're gonna fix the damn streets?

1193
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:21,292
There's no plan, you can't possibly afford to fix the streets in this city.

1194
01:28:21,332 --> 01:28:23,993
Councilor Marks mentioned that like six years ago.

1195
01:28:25,874 --> 01:28:29,615
The city doesn't generate enough revenue to do it, so what's the plan?

1196
01:28:29,935 --> 01:28:31,416
And it's not build more houses.

1197
01:28:32,176 --> 01:28:36,798
And this affordable housing thing that you're all talking about, great, so a young person wants to go buy a house.

1198
01:28:38,499 --> 01:28:43,326
Okay, what are they going to apply to the city and get $100,000 free from the city?

1199
01:28:43,746 --> 01:28:44,988
Where's it coming from?

1200
01:28:45,148 --> 01:28:47,732
We've we've entertained a very long comment here.

1201
01:28:48,152 --> 01:28:50,616
Would you like to continue close up a wrapping up point?

1202
01:28:51,169 --> 01:28:54,553
Sure, because I have nothing else better to do tonight besides be here, counselor.

1203
01:28:54,613 --> 01:28:56,555
No offense, but I have other things to do too.

1204
01:28:57,576 --> 01:28:59,018
But this is a long brewing thing.

1205
01:28:59,058 --> 01:29:06,666
When I hear terms of misinformation, and I see the keyboard warriors on Reddit coming after people like me that are homeowners, I got to wonder what's going on.

1206
01:29:06,706 --> 01:29:08,849
And I don't see any comments from you all defending us.

1207
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,921
I think we've been very clear about our position.

1208
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:16,844
You know what's going on on Reddit, because especially you, Councilor Landry, I see you on Reddit all the time.

1209
01:29:16,864 --> 01:29:18,245
I'm sure you're very, very aware.

1210
01:29:18,305 --> 01:29:20,607
We're not going to have a debate about who comments what on Reddit.

1211
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:21,567
We're just not going to do that.

1212
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:23,668
No, but demonizing homeowners is not okay either.

1213
01:29:23,688 --> 01:29:24,509
Who's demonizing homeowners?

1214
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:26,610
You're inferring something that no one is saying.

1215
01:29:27,731 --> 01:29:27,851
Really?

1216
01:29:27,871 --> 01:29:29,172
You're inferring something that no one is saying.

1217
01:29:29,232 --> 01:29:30,212
They are saying it on Reddit.

1218
01:29:30,733 --> 01:29:33,635
No, people are interpreting things because they're being misinformed.

1219
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:36,696
So what's the misinformation that you're not considering Prop 2.5?

1220
01:29:37,847 --> 01:29:42,128
We are considering, you just said it, the city does not generate enough revenue to fix what it needs to fix.

1221
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:44,069
We are considering generating revenue to fix what needs to be fixed.

1222
01:29:44,089 --> 01:29:46,470
No, it's not a case of revenue, it's revenue minus expenses.

1223
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:49,311
So right now in the current state of expenses.

1224
01:29:49,991 --> 01:29:51,912
What would you cut, Mr. Mayor?

1225
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:52,392
What would you cut?

1226
01:29:52,412 --> 01:29:53,952
10 teachers, 10 firefighters?

1227
01:29:54,232 --> 01:29:56,133
Oh, it's real easy to sit there and fire it up.

1228
01:29:56,873 --> 01:30:03,455
or maybe we gotta really get a handle on what our expenses are, and for the years that I've been here, the city council has never had a good handle on the city budget.

1229
01:30:03,475 --> 01:30:03,835
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1230
01:30:03,855 --> 01:30:04,335
Thank you for your time.

1231
01:30:04,355 --> 01:30:05,715
So maybe take a look at that first before raising revenue.

1232
01:30:05,735 --> 01:30:06,095
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1233
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:06,575
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1234
01:30:06,595 --> 01:30:06,955
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1235
01:30:06,975 --> 01:30:07,355
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1236
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:07,796
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1237
01:30:07,816 --> 01:30:08,256
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1238
01:30:08,276 --> 01:30:08,656
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1239
01:30:08,676 --> 01:30:09,056
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1240
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:09,436
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1241
01:30:09,456 --> 01:30:09,816
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1242
01:30:09,836 --> 01:30:16,477
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1243
01:30:16,497 --> 01:30:16,858
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1244
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:17,258
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1245
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:17,638
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1246
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:18,018
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1247
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:18,518
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1248
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:18,938
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1249
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:19,398
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1250
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,458
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1251
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:21,999
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1252
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:22,379
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1253
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:22,779
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1254
01:30:22,799 --> 01:30:23,219
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1255
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,961
and then I'm gonna make a motion.

1256
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:26,001
Actually, I'll make the motion first.

1257
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:30,204
The motion is to receive and place on file, I guess.

1258
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:39,150
I would suggest, I can't make a motion, would anyone like to make a motion to request that Charlesgate and the property owner negotiate with the tenants?

1259
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,271
Yeah, that's a better idea.

1260
01:30:42,191 --> 01:30:50,116
On the motion of Councilor Lemming to send a letter to Charlesgate and the property owner to request that they negotiate with the Tenants Association.

1261
01:30:51,317 --> 01:30:52,538
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1262
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:58,612
If we can, just if we can, what is the reasoning for that?

1263
01:30:58,652 --> 01:30:59,473
So I can understand that.

1264
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:01,715
Yeah.

1265
01:31:02,315 --> 01:31:04,697
The request is from the tenants association.

1266
01:31:04,737 --> 01:31:06,419
They would like to open negotiations.

1267
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:12,644
So I think we can send a letter on behalf of the council that we would request that the property owner respond to their tenants and enter negotiations.

1268
01:31:12,924 --> 01:31:18,408
Yeah, I would follow up that the mayor and it would be great if we had a city solicitor.

1269
01:31:18,788 --> 01:31:21,190
I would really focus on the city solicitor really

1270
01:31:21,971 --> 01:31:22,911
that we can do to assist this organization.

1271
01:31:22,931 --> 01:31:25,813
We're just paving away for this organization so they can have a point person in the city.

1272
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:29,254
They could talk to not a city council that really we can't do much.

1273
01:31:29,354 --> 01:31:33,756
So if we can just also request that the mayor, um.

1274
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:41,639
Get involved and use her, um, executive power to see what we can do to assist this organization.

1275
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:46,281
Thank you on the further amendment of Councilor Scarpelli to request that the mayor

1276
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,100
there.

1277
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:02,383
Did you want to this this mediation thing to be an amendment?

1278
01:32:02,423 --> 01:32:03,204
Yes, please.

1279
01:32:03,224 --> 01:32:09,449
Please investigate, maybe send the subcommittee that we can look at, you know, a request.

1280
01:32:10,269 --> 01:32:10,890
Here's what I have.

1281
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:15,654
I have the I have you offering an amendment asking the CPA to fund the mediation retainer right away.

1282
01:32:15,854 --> 01:32:31,559
OK, so maybe we change that just that we look to send this to subcommittee, that we invite the CPA in to see what that would entail, to make that a piece of the puzzle that one of our residents did say that put another tool in the toolbox with that.

1283
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:41,762
So let's make that a B paper to refer a new paper to committee to request a discussion about funding a mediation service.

1284
01:32:49,702 --> 01:32:51,143
On the B paper, all those in favor?

1285
01:32:51,923 --> 01:32:52,263
Opposed?

1286
01:32:52,303 --> 01:32:53,064
Motion passes.

1287
01:32:53,984 --> 01:32:55,185
Oh, is there a second on the B paper?

1288
01:32:56,285 --> 01:32:57,125
Seconded by Councilor Galliano.

1289
01:32:57,326 --> 01:32:57,946
All those in favor?

1290
01:32:58,646 --> 01:32:58,946
Opposed?

1291
01:32:58,986 --> 01:32:59,647
Motion passes.

1292
01:32:59,847 --> 01:33:11,292
On the motion to send a letter to the property manager and property owner, request they enter negotiations with the tenant association and to request that the mayor use her executive authority.

1293
01:33:12,693 --> 01:33:13,293
All those in favor?

1294
01:33:14,093 --> 01:33:14,413
Opposed?

1295
01:33:14,473 --> 01:33:15,294
Motion passes.

1296
01:33:22,995 --> 01:33:27,919
24-367 Zoning Update Project Proposed Amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance Package 1.

1297
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:36,767
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we refer the following recommendations for amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance to the Community Development Board as reported out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.

1298
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:36,767
1.

1299
01:33:37,287 --> 01:33:43,473
Amending the format of the table of use and parking regulations to replace the parking and loading code columns with specific parking and loading requirements.

1300
01:33:44,373 --> 01:33:49,977
2.

1301
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:49,977
Amending Section 94-12 definitions to add new defined terms and revise existing definitions.

1302
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:49,977
3.

1303
01:33:50,497 --> 01:33:52,598
Adopt a new GIS-based digital zoning map.

1304
01:33:52,658 --> 01:34:02,645
Adoption of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to the zoning of any parcels within the City, but is intended to be applicable to the City regarding the existing zoning designation for all properties in the City.

1305
01:34:02,665 --> 01:34:02,645
4.

1306
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:07,848
Exempt municipal uses from certain requirements of the Table of Use and Parking Regulations and the Table of Dimensional Requirements.

1307
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:19,743
The recommended changes are attached and can be referred to informally as Package 1 of recommendations from the City Council and Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability's Zoning Update Projects with Innis Associates, Council Paper 24033.

1308
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:20,884
Vice President Collins.

1309
01:34:25,046 --> 01:34:25,867
Thank you, President bears.

1310
01:34:25,987 --> 01:34:36,617
This is the first package small package of updates to come out of the planning and permitting committee and its work with the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the beginning of this term.

1311
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:38,739
So we're starting it off with.

1312
01:34:40,160 --> 01:35:04,374
some proposals that I think will be, you know, relatively minor procedural compared to the scope of work that we will be continuing on for the rest of this term, which will be, you know, kind of encountering those bigger questions that constituents have been coming to us with for years around residential development and commercial development and mixed use development and incorporating the goals and themes of our comprehensive plan, climate plan, housing production plan.

1313
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:07,603
These are less sexy.

1314
01:35:08,886 --> 01:35:13,855
We've been working with the zoning consultant and planning staff and the new building commissioner to make

1315
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:34,385
What's the word I'm looking for kind of some like formatting changes to the table of use and parking regulations, so that all of the relevant information is on the same page and updated so that it's more readable, so that when city staff and potential developers are looking for this information, they don't have to go flipping through our very low court ordinances to find it.

1316
01:35:36,107 --> 01:35:46,632
We have also added and made some adjustments to the definitions in the zoning code to bring that up to best practice and to include some definitions that we might need to include later when we do tweak the zoning.

1317
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:52,755
We would like to adopt the new digital GIS zoning map.

1318
01:35:52,775 --> 01:35:55,657
There's been no material changes to the zoning map proposed.

1319
01:35:55,717 --> 01:36:03,641
We'd just like to move away from the literally colored pencil version and have the official version be the digital version instead, which I think is a great step.

1320
01:36:04,601 --> 01:36:18,603
And finally, the proposal also includes certain municipal exemptions from the zoning code ordinances so that major city projects, for example, a new fire headquarters will be able to proceed in a more efficient, streamlined manner.

1321
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:25,325
So procedurally, this has to be referred to the Community Development Board before this council can take a vote to codify it.

1322
01:36:25,705 --> 01:36:27,045
So I'd motion to send it to the CDB.

1323
01:36:27,445 --> 01:36:31,866
On the motion of Vice President Collins to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1324
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:32,926
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1325
01:36:40,228 --> 01:36:40,428
Yes.

1326
01:36:40,909 --> 01:36:41,689
Yes.

1327
01:36:41,769 --> 01:36:41,989
Yes.

1328
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:43,470
Yes.

1329
01:36:44,551 --> 01:36:44,811
Yes.

1330
01:36:46,032 --> 01:36:47,452
Yes.

1331
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:47,773
Yes.

1332
01:36:48,373 --> 01:36:57,318
I mean, from another negative emotion passes 24369 resolution request an update on the creation of a community liaison position for the Asian American community.

1333
01:36:57,847 --> 01:37:07,057
Be it resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration for updates on plans or possibilities to create a community liaison position for the Asian American community in Medford, and ask how the Council can support these efforts.

1334
01:37:07,457 --> 01:37:08,078
Councillor Sang.

1335
01:37:08,098 --> 01:37:08,699
Thank you.

1336
01:37:09,139 --> 01:37:17,769
Months ago, I was talking to City staff, and they informed me of efforts to find grant funding to create an Asian American community liaison position.

1337
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:21,992
The community liaison program is a point of pride for our city.

1338
01:37:22,792 --> 01:37:35,100
It's something that other municipalities look at Medford as inspiration, and they look to us for our leadership on this issue on engaging communities that have been traditionally cut out and left out of the

1339
01:37:36,181 --> 01:37:36,942
political process.

1340
01:37:37,882 --> 01:37:45,868
You know, a lot of this stuff is just about improving city communications with folks who might not know how to interact with city institutions.

1341
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:53,052
The update that I got back then was that we've put in paperwork, we've put in applications for grant funding.

1342
01:37:54,253 --> 01:38:04,660
We haven't heard, at least I haven't heard as a counselor much since, but given that it is Asian American Heritage Month, I thought that this would be a great opportunity to bring this back to the spotlight.

1343
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:19,991
Asian Americans do make up 13% of our city's population, it makes up the largest minority group in the city, and we need to find a way to better involve everyone in the decision-making process.

1344
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:21,372
Again, we've been making strides.

1345
01:38:21,953 --> 01:38:35,123
We're far past the days of stop Asian hate and the cases being reported on elder violence, but there's still a lot of work to be done to engage our BIPOC communities here.

1346
01:38:38,713 --> 01:38:39,654
Any further discussion?

1347
01:38:39,674 --> 01:38:40,595
Councilor Zaro.

1348
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:53,708
I just want to voice my support for this as one of the faster growing minority groups in town, and I just think it's overdue, and I'm eager for this community liaison position to be created.

1349
01:38:53,909 --> 01:38:55,310
So thank you for bringing this to us.

1350
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:56,391
Thank you.

1351
01:38:56,471 --> 01:38:58,053
Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1352
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:04,043
On the motion of Councillor saying to approve seconded by Councillor Callahan all those in favour.

1353
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:04,524
Aye.

1354
01:39:04,944 --> 01:39:14,987
Opposed motion passes 24 371 be resolved the city council review options and supporting the school committee budget for the resolve the city council review the mayor's presentation of budget needs.

1355
01:39:15,846 --> 01:39:22,835
I'm going to ask Councillor Scarpelli, if you have an amendment to make this significantly more specific right now, I will certainly entertain it.

1356
01:39:23,636 --> 01:39:29,423
If not, I think we're running afoul of a couple Massachusetts general laws here and entertaining the discussion of the paper.

1357
01:39:29,524 --> 01:39:31,406
So if you could outline what

1358
01:39:32,447 --> 01:39:41,049
all options in supporting the budget means, as in the form of an amendment, and if you could outline, review the mayor's presentation in the form of an amendment.

1359
01:39:41,329 --> 01:39:43,709
After I hear the amendment, I'll decide whether or not to vote on it.

1360
01:39:43,729 --> 01:39:55,691
Sure, my amendment would be that, now again, this would be the whole presentation, so this is a little odd and a little bothersome to me as a city council, but I will tell you what we can.

1361
01:39:56,091 --> 01:39:58,632
The amendment will be that I would look for the,

1362
01:40:00,552 --> 01:40:07,016
the city council to ask the mayor make sure we get it right.

1363
01:40:08,217 --> 01:40:21,685
I would like to make sure that we make a motion for the mayor to appropriate $5 to $7 million needed to level the school budget through the free cash

1364
01:40:23,346 --> 01:40:39,980
through free cash and by the process that we first take that, make that as an appropriation before free cash is certified and we announce for what that is used for.

1365
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,543
And now if I can, Mr. President, is that efficient?

1366
01:40:44,143 --> 01:40:47,865
is just on the second phrase, review the presentation.

1367
01:40:47,926 --> 01:40:48,586
Is there any specific?

1368
01:40:48,606 --> 01:41:11,100
I'll tell you what, Mr. President, don't appreciate it, but I will tell you, the question that we had was the, Mia's process and how she brought this forward and the irresponsible process that she moved forward on social media and then in city council and school committee meetings, where she talked about,

1369
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,543
the option of free cash being used.

1370
01:41:15,123 --> 01:41:18,326
$2 million is committed to fire trucks.

1371
01:41:18,586 --> 01:41:24,652
$2.3 million is committed to an OPM design for the new high school.

1372
01:41:24,932 --> 01:41:28,716
$1.2 million for OPM for the HVAC system issues at the schools.

1373
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,998
We have to rebuild Freedom Way for $10 million.

1374
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:35,841
We have to fix HVAC systems in the schools for $15 million.

1375
01:41:36,302 --> 01:41:37,623
Estimates for middle school alone.

1376
01:41:38,003 --> 01:41:40,805
We have to put more money on water and soil infrastructure.

1377
01:41:40,825 --> 01:41:41,806
Is that good, Mr. President?

1378
01:41:41,826 --> 01:41:42,426
So can I proceed?

1379
01:41:43,047 --> 01:41:47,651
Just, I want to define the amendment for counselors, and then we can adopt the amended resolution, then we can consider it.

1380
01:41:48,471 --> 01:42:01,994
So the amendment is to amend this resolution to be a specific requesting that the council request that the mayor appropriate 5 to 7 million in free cash as an appropriation before free cash is certified to fund the schools.

1381
01:42:02,394 --> 01:42:09,536
And then also is it a motion to request the plan that outlined how she intends to spend the free cash reserves that she outlined on social media?

1382
01:42:09,736 --> 01:42:12,616
Well, I would present something and explain it to you and that'll get that.

1383
01:42:12,977 --> 01:42:14,277
That'll explain it, Mr. President.

1384
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:21,238
the first part is fine.

1385
01:42:21,438 --> 01:42:23,620
So we can talk talk top line numbers.

1386
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:26,363
We can talk line item numbers for city departments.

1387
01:42:26,943 --> 01:42:37,813
Um, except that it runs a call of mass general, uh, chapter 71 section 34 to talk about line items first in the school's budget before formal, um.

1388
01:42:39,514 --> 01:42:48,617
before a formal budget is presented to us because we are impeding on the authority of the school committee to determine expenditures within the total appropriation.

1389
01:42:48,657 --> 01:42:50,057
And that's quote from the law.

1390
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:58,300
So not if it's time sensitive to ask a motion to entertain this before the certified, the free cash is certified.

1391
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:06,983
Sounds like the free cash thing is re-amendable to having the discussion of the motion as amended, which is to request the mayor appropriate five to seven million in free cash.

1392
01:43:07,623 --> 01:43:07,803
Okay.

1393
01:43:08,577 --> 01:43:08,837
All right.

1394
01:43:10,218 --> 01:43:13,760
On the amendment, are there any objections to the amendment?

1395
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:31,768
I would motion to table this until the next regular meeting, because I would, like, that wasn't in the text that I received at all, and I would like to actually read over what Councilor Scarpelli just said in order to study it and process it a little bit more.

1396
01:43:32,008 --> 01:43:34,450
On the motion of Councilor Lemming to table, is there a second?

1397
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:36,611
It's called,

1398
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:38,810
shutting it down.

1399
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:42,651
It's used, it's an episode used to do that.

1400
01:44:09,053 --> 01:44:09,513
Excuse me?

1401
01:44:09,633 --> 01:44:09,833
Yeah.

1402
01:44:11,014 --> 01:44:11,755
Vice President Collins.

1403
01:44:13,496 --> 01:44:13,716
Yes.

1404
01:44:15,357 --> 01:44:16,157
Councilor Lozaro.

1405
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:18,359
Yes.

1406
01:44:18,379 --> 01:44:21,020
Councilor Levin.

1407
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:21,581
Yes.

1408
01:44:21,641 --> 01:44:24,282
Councilor Scarpelli.

1409
01:44:24,302 --> 01:44:24,682
No.

1410
01:44:25,923 --> 01:44:26,424
Councilor Sanders.

1411
01:44:26,644 --> 01:44:26,844
No.

1412
01:44:27,704 --> 01:44:28,325
President Pierce.

1413
01:44:29,105 --> 01:44:29,425
No.

1414
01:44:30,186 --> 01:44:31,767
Three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

1415
01:44:31,867 --> 01:44:33,408
Councilor Lozaro.

1416
01:44:33,528 --> 01:44:35,069
When is free cash certified?

1417
01:44:36,784 --> 01:44:38,745
We don't have the answer when you guys are certified.

1418
01:44:39,025 --> 01:44:42,327
Once the end of the fiscal year happens, we have to wait for it to be certified.

1419
01:44:42,447 --> 01:44:44,648
So it could be as three to nine months.

1420
01:44:44,668 --> 01:44:52,111
So it would be certified between September, October, as late as April or May of next year.

1421
01:44:53,752 --> 01:45:04,057
So, but the impression I'm getting is that the Councilor Scarpelli is concerned that there may be a deadline here about

1422
01:45:05,353 --> 01:45:05,833
Free cash.

1423
01:45:05,853 --> 01:45:09,534
I'm confused about the time.

1424
01:45:09,574 --> 01:45:14,956
If an appropriation of free cash is not made by June 30th, it cannot be made until free cash is then certified.

1425
01:45:15,036 --> 01:45:19,177
If it's not done before June 30th, it cannot then be made until up to?

1426
01:45:19,537 --> 01:45:21,157
Up until certification, correct.

1427
01:45:21,177 --> 01:45:21,437
Got it.

1428
01:45:23,698 --> 01:45:24,518
Further discussion?

1429
01:45:26,179 --> 01:45:27,019
Councilor Stark-Bailey.

1430
01:45:27,159 --> 01:45:28,800
Thank you.

1431
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,420
So again, this is,

1432
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:37,773
I appreciate for my fellow colleagues to help me express what I've been hearing.

1433
01:45:38,153 --> 01:45:44,096
And I'm not going to get into what was said earlier, because I think that that's why we're here.

1434
01:45:44,717 --> 01:45:50,860
Because the communications that I received from residents with the residents

1435
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:58,425
you know, the discussions of rent control and the, you know, the 2% tax.

1436
01:45:58,465 --> 01:46:02,367
They're talking about, you know, the registry.

1437
01:46:02,788 --> 01:46:05,249
Then we're talking about what the mayor has presented.

1438
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:12,834
What she said was a 2.5% override, which by the way, publicly, I will tell you, I'm not opposed to that.

1439
01:46:13,335 --> 01:46:14,776
She talked about debt exclusions.

1440
01:46:15,396 --> 01:46:16,337
I'm not opposed to that.

1441
01:46:17,077 --> 01:46:18,118
I publicly say that.

1442
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:23,722
I was one of the only counselors that brought a debt exclusion to this body that they've never done it before.

1443
01:46:24,823 --> 01:46:25,744
And it was voted down.

1444
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:29,047
So I understand this process we need to follow.

1445
01:46:29,887 --> 01:46:35,612
But what comes to mind is I've said it over and over again.

1446
01:46:35,632 --> 01:46:37,113
And we heard it tonight.

1447
01:46:37,874 --> 01:46:39,014
Until we exhaust

1448
01:46:39,932 --> 01:46:52,951
until we exhaust everything in our pockets that we can show that we're not making mistakes and just being reactionary on taxation.

1449
01:46:54,059 --> 01:46:58,263
because I've identified many, many different options that the mayor hasn't.

1450
01:46:58,363 --> 01:46:59,624
I've met with the building department.

1451
01:46:59,964 --> 01:47:02,266
There are no permits out there for any sort of development.

1452
01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:06,349
And when I say development, I speak of the development that everybody talks about.

1453
01:47:06,369 --> 01:47:09,131
We just had a conversation about it, about affordable housing.

1454
01:47:09,832 --> 01:47:12,614
The mayor lost 600 affordable housing units.

1455
01:47:13,395 --> 01:47:17,138
But more importantly, she lost a huge tax bracket.

1456
01:47:17,498 --> 01:47:22,042
She lost a huge, between three to 5 million just in one building.

1457
01:47:23,925 --> 01:47:27,826
for permits and fees, one building, and look who we are.

1458
01:47:28,046 --> 01:47:29,987
Look at the problems we're having right now.

1459
01:47:30,907 --> 01:47:36,989
So this tactic by the mayor, by putting this out there, is something quick and easy for us.

1460
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:38,669
She's done nothing for five years, honestly.

1461
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,930
The bear haul is her claim to fame.

1462
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:43,411
We really haven't moved the city forward at all.

1463
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:45,591
And we're not bringing new revenue at all.

1464
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:54,922
Okay, so now what I'm getting to my point very simply is this, I didn't, I wouldn't support a rainy day account.

1465
01:47:56,763 --> 01:48:04,466
But as I look at the options now, and the options I see have to be really expressed and understood.

1466
01:48:05,806 --> 01:48:12,529
Because a lot of people that have come to me, they're not against working together for an override.

1467
01:48:12,809 --> 01:48:15,870
They're not against working together for debt exclusion.

1468
01:48:16,906 --> 01:48:19,307
but they want the data to prove it.

1469
01:48:20,068 --> 01:48:22,129
They wanna see, are we doing it right?

1470
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:28,112
You don't just put out a tax, just a tax, just to cover your keystone, because that's what she's doing.

1471
01:48:28,973 --> 01:48:39,839
And I know that's your agenda, because you've told us this, but the bottom line is, let's listen to what that last caller said, Councilor Villescaz, the other night, because I think that's what brought this forward in my mind.

1472
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:41,320
She asked you,

1473
01:48:43,086 --> 01:48:48,148
She asked you, Mr. President, what if the override doesn't pass?

1474
01:48:49,528 --> 01:48:50,188
What if it doesn't?

1475
01:48:50,348 --> 01:48:54,090
And you said, right, it's going to devastate our school department.

1476
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:55,910
The vote is in November.

1477
01:48:56,710 --> 01:49:00,332
If it feels, it affects our kids.

1478
01:49:01,252 --> 01:49:02,432
It affects our teachers.

1479
01:49:03,132 --> 01:49:04,153
It affects our community.

1480
01:49:05,322 --> 01:49:13,637
And even if it's a 1% chance that that override would fail, are we willing to gamble our students' educational process for this?

1481
01:49:16,297 --> 01:49:35,254
Like I said, we can look at, as a council, bringing forth the rainy day account that the mayor asked for, we appropriate it correctly, we earmark that money, and everything goes level funding to schools, and maybe she can't do the Freedom Way for another year.

1482
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:48,162
But at least that now brings two groups, and that's what it is right now, the people that don't want Proposition 2.5 override, and people that do want the Proposition override.

1483
01:49:48,822 --> 01:49:59,607
But what we can do is take that time to sit together and probably, because I know Councilor Beall said it, there's a finance group that's been working since last April, I believe he said.

1484
01:50:00,546 --> 01:50:15,132
with the mayor, September, I'm sorry, September, the mayor, the chief of staff, Councilor Beers, Council President Beers, Council Vice President Collins, and school kid member, Jenny Graham, Vice Chair Graham, excuse me, Vice Chair Graham.

1485
01:50:15,152 --> 01:50:17,172
So the five of them have been working on this.

1486
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:20,974
And the question that everybody's been saying is, well,

1487
01:50:22,162 --> 01:50:23,523
What have they worked on?

1488
01:50:23,543 --> 01:50:27,267
And I know Councilor Beall said, when it's time, they'll put everything out.

1489
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:30,410
But for right now, we don't have that time to wait and put it out there.

1490
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:43,602
Because right now, are we willing to gamble our students' future next year on a possibility of this divide not making it happen?

1491
01:50:44,855 --> 01:50:50,860
Because I know I got people emailing me saying that something went out on a social media site and shame on you, George Scott Pelley.

1492
01:50:51,621 --> 01:50:52,362
I'm one person.

1493
01:50:53,983 --> 01:50:54,744
I'm one person.

1494
01:50:55,985 --> 01:51:02,911
But as I read it, the question was, is this a fair tactic by the school committee and the mayor?

1495
01:51:03,292 --> 01:51:03,932
Of course it is.

1496
01:51:05,213 --> 01:51:05,894
Of course it is.

1497
01:51:06,414 --> 01:51:08,736
Because there were no other avenue presented.

1498
01:51:09,551 --> 01:51:10,931
There was only one avenue.

1499
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,512
We did nothing for five years.

1500
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:22,215
On June 20th of 2023, the budget meeting, I sat here and said, you're going to destroy our community.

1501
01:51:22,515 --> 01:51:28,077
We are going to be in financial ruins if you pass this budget just because you want to get elected.

1502
01:51:28,857 --> 01:51:33,718
You're going to use ARPA money, which by the way, which by the way, I use ARPA money.

1503
01:51:34,058 --> 01:51:35,299
And we're told specifically,

1504
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:39,212
do not use opera money unless it's sustainable.

1505
01:51:39,712 --> 01:51:48,957
Well, our mayor took that money and the ESSA money, and the school committee did, and they've level funded a budget just to get elected because she didn't want a black guy.

1506
01:51:48,977 --> 01:51:49,698
Let's say what it is.

1507
01:51:50,618 --> 01:51:56,241
But here we are today now, here we are today ready to gamble on our children's future.

1508
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:59,984
So that's not a scare tactic, that's legitimate.

1509
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:02,185
If the override does not pass,

1510
01:52:03,783 --> 01:52:09,590
then quote unquote, our schools will be devastated with layoffs.

1511
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:14,776
And we're gonna hurt teachers, we're gonna hurt children, and we're gonna destroy this community.

1512
01:52:15,657 --> 01:52:17,739
So I implore my fellow counselors to please.

1513
01:52:19,312 --> 01:52:20,713
follow.

1514
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:35,509
Let's put the motion through that we ask the mayor to bring through a rainy day account that we appropriate the funds needed to level fund the school budget and make sure that everybody is whole because that was another question.

1515
01:52:35,869 --> 01:52:39,273
I got a phone call from school committees where they were astonished the other day that

1516
01:52:39,793 --> 01:52:44,778
that the chair, I think, was astonished because her answer was, no, everything goes back to the same.

1517
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:51,284
And the superintendent sat in front of us the other day, and I've got calls from teachers, I've got calls, that's not true, they said.

1518
01:52:52,105 --> 01:52:54,988
So again, it's manipulating for what they should do.

1519
01:52:55,869 --> 01:52:57,530
They're not being transparent enough.

1520
01:52:58,251 --> 01:53:02,735
So I please, I implore you to let's, let's

1521
01:53:03,874 --> 01:53:17,537
Let's focus on free cash, level fund this budget, let's build on our children's future, and then work on if we really need an override and debt exclusions, and then work together as a community to make sure it passes.

1522
01:53:17,898 --> 01:53:18,738
Thank you, Mr. President.

1523
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:19,078
Thank you.

1524
01:53:19,098 --> 01:53:20,238
So we all agree.

1525
01:53:21,959 --> 01:53:25,119
We all agree that the schools need five to seven more million dollars.

1526
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,180
So we talk about the facts.

1527
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:27,920
Those are the facts.

1528
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,520
We all agree.

1529
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,881
Now we appropriate them for free cash.

1530
01:53:31,954 --> 01:53:33,255
It's just delaying the inevitable.

1531
01:53:34,136 --> 01:53:35,317
We won't have any next year.

1532
01:53:35,537 --> 01:53:46,105
We're just postponing the devastation until June 30th, 2020, doing exactly what we said we don't want to do, which is use one-time funds to, for whatever reason, have the thing.

1533
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:47,726
So we're having the same argument here.

1534
01:53:47,746 --> 01:53:49,828
We agree that the schools need $5 to $7 million.

1535
01:53:50,288 --> 01:53:53,611
If we appropriate free cash, then we postpone the discussion for a year.

1536
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:57,114
If we actually raise the money, then we have it in perpetuity.

1537
01:53:58,228 --> 01:53:58,909
I have the right to

1538
01:54:28,288 --> 01:54:36,475
You're willing to gamble on kids' future on an override instead of looking at real money that our residents, that the mayor mismanaged and left out.

1539
01:54:36,495 --> 01:54:37,896
Is there a motion to recess?

1540
01:54:38,296 --> 01:54:38,856
Bottom line.

1541
01:54:40,037 --> 01:54:40,978
Is there a motion to recess?

1542
01:54:41,018 --> 01:54:41,919
Motion to recess.

1543
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:42,740
Motion to recess.

1544
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,241
Councilor Laming seconded by Councilor Sanger.

1545
01:54:44,261 --> 01:54:44,861
All those in favor?

1546
01:54:45,101 --> 01:54:47,183
Opposed?

1547
01:54:47,263 --> 01:54:47,904
15 minute recess.

1548
01:54:55,962 --> 01:54:58,484
On the motion of Councilor Collins to reconvene, seconded by?

1549
01:54:58,504 --> 01:54:58,984
Second.

1550
01:54:59,264 --> 01:55:00,185
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1551
01:55:00,225 --> 01:55:00,966
All those in favor?

1552
01:55:01,286 --> 01:55:01,406
Aye.

1553
01:55:01,626 --> 01:55:02,126
Opposed?

1554
01:55:02,206 --> 01:55:03,147
Motion passes.

1555
01:55:03,287 --> 01:55:04,028
President Behrs.

1556
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:08,871
Councilor Lemming, then Vice President Collins.

1557
01:55:09,532 --> 01:55:14,975
President Behrs, I'd like to, because the amendment made it very clear this is a financial paper, I'd like to invoke Rule 21.

1558
01:55:17,097 --> 01:55:24,122
Councilor Lemming has invoked Rule 21 of the Medford City Council, which gives any city council the right to table any financial paper until the next regular meeting.

1559
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:27,902
paper is stable.

1560
01:55:30,424 --> 01:55:32,505
Oh, participation to participate out of zoom.

1561
01:55:32,545 --> 01:55:33,986
Please email a hair to be set.

1562
01:55:34,347 --> 01:55:37,089
Yeah.

1563
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:44,375
So we can't, we can't move forward and discuss it and the mayor can't move forward to look at the process.

1564
01:55:44,975 --> 01:55:46,696
So this is a rule 21.

1565
01:55:46,837 --> 01:55:51,921
Any financial paper placed before the council has to move on the table for until the next meeting.

1566
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:52,221
Thank you.

1567
01:55:53,254 --> 01:55:53,634
Thank you.

1568
01:55:53,654 --> 01:55:54,855
Public participation.

1569
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:58,698
To participate outside of Zoom, please email ahertabase at medfordma.gov.

1570
01:55:58,818 --> 01:55:59,879
Name and address for the record, please.

1571
01:56:02,681 --> 01:56:03,321
Is the microphone on?

1572
01:56:06,043 --> 01:56:06,303
Hello?

1573
01:56:06,483 --> 01:56:06,944
There you go.

1574
01:56:06,964 --> 01:56:07,264
Perfect.

1575
01:56:07,284 --> 01:56:08,245
Thank you, Mr. President.

1576
01:56:08,865 --> 01:56:10,526
Gaston Fiori, 61 Stignero.

1577
01:56:11,147 --> 01:56:16,831
I just would like to manifest my opposition to any initiative for the Proposition 2.5 override.

1578
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:28,883
When the government increases taxes, it ultimately takes money away from individuals who could spend or invest it more efficiently.

1579
01:56:29,443 --> 01:56:31,004
This is a fundamental principle.

1580
01:56:31,564 --> 01:56:36,206
Individuals can make better decisions with their money than a central authority can.

1581
01:56:36,986 --> 01:56:40,087
First, consider the impact on property owners.

1582
01:56:40,707 --> 01:56:49,571
Higher taxes could drive people away, particularly those on fixed incomes or with limited means, reducing the overall attractiveness of the city.

1583
01:56:50,899 --> 01:56:58,842
This can lead to reduction in property values and a smaller tax base over time, the very opposite of what the government hopes to achieve.

1584
01:56:59,743 --> 01:57:06,926
Second, the argument is often made that projects such as new schools and infrastructure are essential for public welfare.

1585
01:57:07,386 --> 01:57:12,889
This is true, but one must ask whether raising taxes is the optimal solution.

1586
01:57:13,829 --> 01:57:28,583
Alternative methods such as public-private partnerships, leveraging private investments, and utilizing existing resources more effectively might achieve the same goals without imposing higher taxes on residents.

1587
01:57:29,571 --> 01:57:33,195
The core issue here is one of economic freedom and efficiency.

1588
01:57:33,955 --> 01:57:41,403
By significantly raising real estate taxes, the government imposes a burden on its residents and potentially stifles economic activity.

1589
01:57:42,043 --> 01:57:46,908
There's no assurance that the benefits of any infrastructure projects will outweigh these costs.

1590
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:53,115
Therefore, the government should consider more innovative and less burdensome ways to fund these initiatives.

1591
01:57:54,491 --> 01:58:02,376
Some alternatives that the city government should consider instead of raising real estate taxes are one, economic growth.

1592
01:58:03,137 --> 01:58:11,282
Implement a multifaceted campaign to stimulate economic growth, thereby expanding the tax base and increasing overall revenue.

1593
01:58:11,783 --> 01:58:14,385
Two, public-private partnerships.

1594
01:58:14,965 --> 01:58:22,250
Collaborate with private companies to fund and manage infrastructure projects, sharing both risks and benefits.

1595
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:23,050
Three,

1596
01:58:24,332 --> 01:58:24,932
User fees.

1597
01:58:25,693 --> 01:58:38,078
Introduce or increase fees for specific services, such as water and sewer, waste management, parking, or recreational facilities, ensuring that users directly pay for the services they consume.

1598
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:48,721
Municipal bonds, issue bonds to raise capital for infrastructure projects, spreading the cost over time and across current and future beneficiaries.

1599
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:59,284
Five, prioritizing spending, reallocate funds from less critical areas, tightening the budget can free up resources to pay for infrastructure projects.

1600
01:58:59,904 --> 01:59:07,627
Six, improving efficiency, streamline government operations to cut costs, reallocating savings to our infrastructure needs.

1601
01:59:08,108 --> 01:59:17,111
Seven, selling city assets, evaluate and sell underutilized public assets, such as land or buildings to generate revenue.

1602
01:59:18,892 --> 01:59:24,477
lease revenues, lease public assets, or increase their efficiency to generate additional income streams.

1603
01:59:25,238 --> 01:59:34,026
The message just described can mitigate the need for a Proposition 2.5 override in order to maintain and enhance city infrastructure and services.

1604
01:59:34,187 --> 01:59:35,388
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1605
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,391
Name and address record, please.

1606
01:59:41,825 --> 01:59:44,866
I'm Anthony Guillen, 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Levenster, Massachusetts.

1607
01:59:44,886 --> 01:59:46,967
I'm the president of the Medford Teachers Association.

1608
01:59:47,988 --> 02:00:01,253
I'm here to speak on the use of the $6 million, wherever it may come from, be it free cash or be it from other revenue streams that you all are aware of that I'm not.

1609
02:00:02,054 --> 02:00:04,495
I just wanted to push the need for expediency on this.

1610
02:00:07,495 --> 02:00:15,542
As we are getting to the end of the school year, as our seniors are getting ready to walk this week, I have a lot of members coming to me and asking if they should look for new jobs.

1611
02:00:16,465 --> 02:00:24,648
And I have to tell them that we're in a holding pattern at the moment, and that they have to do what's best for themselves and their families.

1612
02:00:24,928 --> 02:00:29,250
And that breaks my heart, because what I want to tell them is, no, stay, build with us.

1613
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:31,851
The city has a lot of hope.

1614
02:00:32,371 --> 02:00:35,372
This school system has a lot of hope, and that hope comes from the teachers.

1615
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:41,554
I think we spent a lot of time at the last school committee meeting celebrating a lot of great things at these schools.

1616
02:00:41,654 --> 02:00:43,215
But as I said at that school committee meeting,

1617
02:00:43,815 --> 02:00:49,798
a lot of those things come from teachers either taking small stipends to do them or not taking anything to do them.

1618
02:00:50,038 --> 02:00:56,742
And I think looking at these cuts, looking at the loss of the teachers that are willing to do this is going to have a huge effect.

1619
02:00:57,042 --> 02:01:00,244
So I would ask that again, we know the number.

1620
02:01:01,553 --> 02:01:04,894
whatever avenue needs to go down to get this number is what's needed.

1621
02:01:05,054 --> 02:01:21,020
And I want to remind everybody, this isn't to progress, this isn't to build anything new, this is to steady on and to make sure that students and teachers and admin and secretaries and nurses know what's happening in school year 24 and 25 because

1622
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:29,505
It's a short window and it's a scary prospect to have to go into June, not understanding what our schools are gonna look like next year.

1623
02:01:29,846 --> 02:01:37,491
So I ask you all come together to work as best you can to use your collective knowledge and to get that money for our schools.

1624
02:01:38,112 --> 02:01:38,912
Thank you.

1625
02:01:40,554 --> 02:01:46,918
And I just wanna say, Mr. Gaten, for myself and Vice President Collins as well,

1626
02:01:47,881 --> 02:01:48,501
We know the number.

1627
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:53,362
We're trying to find the short-term solution and the long-term sustainable solution.

1628
02:01:53,382 --> 02:01:56,523
We're trying to get that as quickly as possible.

1629
02:01:56,603 --> 02:02:01,384
We're working with the person who gets to make that decision, and that that's what is taking time right now.

1630
02:02:02,725 --> 02:02:04,545
Our goal is to get it to as quickly as possible.

1631
02:02:05,005 --> 02:02:12,007
My hopes are that the city, the public, the council, the teachers unit, and everybody will have a budget presented to them by the end of this week.

1632
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:15,668
And then we'll know more about what that means in the short-term and the long-term.

1633
02:02:16,331 --> 02:02:22,248
That's my understanding of the timeline right now, but we are working diligently to try to get these funds to stabilize the school funding.

1634
02:02:23,143 --> 02:02:25,044
I appreciate that, and I appreciate all of you.

1635
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:28,385
I know no one here has stood up and objected to level funding this school.

1636
02:02:29,066 --> 02:02:32,527
And I've not heard anyone step up and say, we don't need to level fund the school.

1637
02:02:33,148 --> 02:02:35,269
It is a necessity, it is a bare minimum.

1638
02:02:35,549 --> 02:02:45,814
And as I said, I employ you from all of my members, my over 500 members to, like I said, as expedient as possible so we can understand where we stand.

1639
02:02:46,314 --> 02:02:46,674
Thank you all.

1640
02:02:46,694 --> 02:02:50,576
Name and address for the record, please.

1641
02:02:52,028 --> 02:02:57,129
Yes, Matthew Page, Lieberman and 15 Canal Street.

1642
02:02:57,149 --> 02:02:59,210
I'm really apologizing right now.

1643
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:03,571
I just want to clarify, is this really open public comment or are we still on resolution?

1644
02:03:03,631 --> 02:03:04,652
This is open public comment.

1645
02:03:04,932 --> 02:03:06,252
Very good, thank you.

1646
02:03:06,832 --> 02:03:15,995
The first thing is, earlier tonight when Rick Garaviello received his award, I think it would have been nice if there were an opportunity for people to come up here and also thank him.

1647
02:03:17,635 --> 02:03:19,316
I know that maybe about a decade ago,

1648
02:03:20,443 --> 02:03:23,447
Rick called me up back at like 930 at night.

1649
02:03:23,907 --> 02:03:25,349
I may have called him like in the afternoon.

1650
02:03:25,369 --> 02:03:26,951
I extremely appreciated that.

1651
02:03:27,732 --> 02:03:30,375
That's the kind of stuff that really does not happen a lot.

1652
02:03:30,775 --> 02:03:34,079
There are some people I've emailed through the years I've never gotten a response from.

1653
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:36,441
But Rick did is exceptional.

1654
02:03:37,402 --> 02:03:51,507
The other thing is I heard earlier from someone in the public the idea of selling public property again, and I just want to let it be known anytime anybody introduces that noxious idea, I'll be up here again saying it's not going to happen.

1655
02:03:51,548 --> 02:03:52,468
Thank you.

1656
02:03:52,488 --> 02:03:52,848
Thank you.

1657
02:03:52,868 --> 02:03:54,929
Name and address for the record, please.

1658
02:03:56,322 --> 02:03:57,843
William Navarro 108 Medford Street.

1659
02:03:58,324 --> 02:04:07,411
I also wanted to speak on that last point, selling public property was one of the suggestions, leasing public property was another suggestion.

1660
02:04:07,431 --> 02:04:17,698
I want to point out those are very different, because as our city grows, as it gets richer, think about over the last 20 years, how much more desirable living in the city has become.

1661
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:21,621
As we invest to make our squares better,

1662
02:04:22,803 --> 02:04:28,139
As we hopefully fix the tea, somebody fixes the tea, etc.

1663
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:29,061
Living.

1664
02:04:31,967 --> 02:04:39,371
near our squares, in our central areas, near those parking lots there, is going to get more and more valuable.

1665
02:04:39,951 --> 02:04:44,414
So I'll use that as an example.

1666
02:04:44,974 --> 02:04:58,300
You lease that land, okay, you get money now, and then we do all these investments, hopefully we solve a lot of problems in the next 60 years, and then the city gets the land again, and can start all over again.

1667
02:04:58,741 --> 02:04:59,441
You sell that,

1668
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:08,203
somebody else is going to profit off of the hard work of making our squares, the T, our town better, our city better.

1669
02:05:08,643 --> 02:05:13,304
So I wanna make that very clear, there's a really big distinction.

1670
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:18,626
Leasing is very, very good idea, less enthusiastic about selling.

1671
02:05:19,046 --> 02:05:19,486
Thanks a lot.

1672
02:05:20,406 --> 02:05:20,986
Thank you.

1673
02:05:22,767 --> 02:05:24,627
Gonna go to Mr. Castaneda on Zoom.

1674
02:05:24,707 --> 02:05:26,628
Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record, please.

1675
02:05:31,294 --> 02:05:33,035
Mr. Castaneda, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

1676
02:05:33,135 --> 02:05:34,675
Name and address for the record, please.

1677
02:05:35,896 --> 02:05:37,197
I'm unmuted, I think.

1678
02:05:37,937 --> 02:05:38,257
Yes.

1679
02:05:39,237 --> 02:05:42,059
Okay, thank you, Council President.

1680
02:05:42,079 --> 02:05:57,585
I wanted to thank and commend whoever is responsible to get the Crystal Campbell Boston Marathon Fountain up and running in front of the Senior Citizen Center on Riverside Ave.

1681
02:05:58,026 --> 02:06:00,607
It was a pleasant surprise after many years.

1682
02:06:01,989 --> 02:06:06,191
My question is, how come it's not pumping water today?

1683
02:06:08,412 --> 02:06:12,633
I don't have an answer to that question, but we can look into it.

1684
02:06:12,653 --> 02:06:19,716
That would be nice, because it hasn't been pumping water for many, many, many days.

1685
02:06:19,736 --> 02:06:21,677
Okay, thank you.

1686
02:06:22,638 --> 02:06:23,178
You're welcome.

1687
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,841
Any further discussion by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1688
02:06:32,506 --> 02:06:33,728
Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

1689
02:06:36,112 --> 02:06:39,557
On the motion to adjourn by Councillor SANG, seconded by Councillor CUMMING.

1690
02:06:39,597 --> 02:06:40,238
All those in favour?

1691
02:06:40,819 --> 02:06:41,180
Opposed?

1692
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:42,502
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
