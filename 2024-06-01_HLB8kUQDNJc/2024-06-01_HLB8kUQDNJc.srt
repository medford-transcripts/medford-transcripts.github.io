00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Before we start, we're going to give a citation based on a vote we took at a prior meeting.

24
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:33,973
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to read out the citation.

25
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:54,573
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to former Council President Richard F. Caraviello on the honor of being named the 2024 Medford Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year.

26
00:00:54,953 --> 00:01:02,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Your long-time commitment to the City of Medford, the Medford City Council, our residents, and the local business community makes you an outstanding Citizen of the Year and a valued member of our community.

27
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:07,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Respectfully offered by Zach Bears, Council President, and George Scarpelli, City Councilor.

28
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:19,298
[SPEAKER_21]: So I apologize.

29
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Council President.

30
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,420
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a long time coming.

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,482
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that it's funny.

32
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:31,486
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if people know Councilor Caraviello and what kind of a person he is.

33
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:35,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caraviello ran for mayor, unfortunately.

34
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,391
[SPEAKER_21]: In my view, he was a couple votes behind.

35
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,534
[SPEAKER_21]: But you would think that someone who's spent so much time

36
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:46,868
[SPEAKER_21]: in this chamber working for the Citizens of Medford, you'd think he'd be tired.

37
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,161
[SPEAKER_21]: But last week, I think he spent over 60 hours helping an 88-year-old

38
00:01:55,973 --> 00:02:09,939
[SPEAKER_21]: young lady that was being displaced from her apartment who was battling cancer, and he drove her all over the city to make sure that she was safe and her rights were protected.

39
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,640
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is the type of person Rick Caraviello is.

40
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:23,084
[SPEAKER_21]: I've had the honor of working with Councilor Caraviello as an elected official and as our 

42
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:29,019
[SPEAKER_21]: past patriarch and someone that I mentored myself against, um.

43
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,940
[SPEAKER_21]: To receive this award from the city.

44
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:31,981
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's perfectly fitting. And I

45
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:41,390
[SPEAKER_21]: miss you back here, but I know you're still working hard for the citizens of Medford.

46
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:53,958
[SPEAKER_21]: We should all take a great look and understand how Rick Caraviello lives his life, because if we had more Rick Caraviellos in this world, I think Medford would be just a supreme place to live.

47
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:57,160
[SPEAKER_21]: So congratulations, my friend, well earned.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Tseng?

48
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:08,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

49
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:21,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week I was in City Hall for meetings and I bumped into Rick on his runs to help an elderly tenant stay in her home and help her find a place to live.

50
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:28,169
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that really exemplifies, even though you're not on this side of the rail, your service to the city is never ceasing.

51
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,571
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm deeply, deeply grateful for your

52
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:44,417
[SPEAKER_17]: for your service to Medford, for your commitment to our city and all of our residents, and for your mentorship during my first term on the city council when we were both sitting over there.

53
00:03:45,898 --> 00:04:00,565
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't always agree on issues, but I honestly think that folks need to hear us talk about things because I think there's so much agreement that we have, so many values that we share, a vision for Medford that I think

54
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,568
[SPEAKER_17]: folks need to know that we share.

55
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,456
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm so happy that you're staying involved in our city.

56
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:14,385
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, a lot of respect, a lot of gratitude to the work that you've done for us.

56
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Councilor Tseng. Councilor Collins?

57
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bears.

58
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to congratulate you again.

59
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Rick, in my culture, we have a name for a person like you.

60
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:24,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mensch.

61
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:32,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this past week was, you know, we all talked about your service and making sure that this elderly tenant had a safe landing spot.

62
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know that for you, this is just, you know, that was just a regular Tuesday.

63
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's that kind of service that makes this honor so well earned.

64
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for doing what you do all the time.

65
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:42,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

66
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to say anything?

67
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:47,737
[SPEAKER_16]: You can come up.

68
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:48,617
[SPEAKER_16]: You can come up.

69
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:55,704
[SPEAKER_16]: You might have to press the button.

70
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:56,585
[SPEAKER_16]: A light should come on.

71
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:58,086
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

72
00:04:58,106 --> 00:04:59,668
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

73
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:00,208
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

74
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:02,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Rick Caraviello, former member of this August body.

75
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back.

76
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

77
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the citation.

78
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:14,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to join a group of men and women who've done good things for the community since 1970.

79
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:17,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm proud to be in their company.

80
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:21,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talked about, I saw people in City Hall last week.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,101
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I've always done for the last 30 years, is helping people.

82
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:30,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And as an elected official, that's our job is to help people.

83
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:38,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though I'm not here still, I'll still continue to, I live here, this is my home, I'm not moving.

84
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:43,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a good community and I'll always be here for the residents of the community.

85
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:43,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

86
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:44,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Rick.

87
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Take a picture.

94
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:07,431
[SPEAKER_16]: 24-365 resolution to recognize and celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month.

95
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:11,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the City Council recognize and celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month.

96
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:12,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins.

97
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:16,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bears, for co-sponsoring this resolution with me.

98
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Jewish American History Month.

99
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Heritage Month, excuse me, is a relatively new commemoration.

100
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was first proclaimed in 2006.

101
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:32,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a collaboration between the American federal government and Jewish museums throughout the nation.

102
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this is a wonderful opportunity to thank Jewish culture bearers in Medford, not just for their contributions, but for continuing to

103
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,825
[SPEAKER_03]: tell the stories of this community.

104
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:52,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a good reminder to thank all culture bearers of all communities within Medford for continuing to tell their stories and share their culture and their history with the entire community.

105
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Tseng?

106
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for introducing this resolution.

107
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:08,807
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know that the last few years, it's beyond this last year.

108
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:17,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Ever since 2016, anti-Semitism has been on the rise in our country due to extremist voices enabling

109
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,357
[SPEAKER_17]: and normalizing rhetoric.

110
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:25,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I really want to thank Councilor Collins and your efforts to root out anti-Semitism in our community.

111
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:35,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember one of the first resolutions you introduced as a city councilor was to get the mayor's office to properly address an anti-Semitic incident and to set up institutions to deal with that.

112
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,494
[SPEAKER_17]: We've made some progress.

113
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:44,695
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't made all the progress we've wanted, but I think it shows, you know, your leadership on this issue that you've brought this to light.

114
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:58,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Similarly, you were the first Councilor on the scene when a anti-Semitic piece of graffiti was painted on one of our, you know, on the streets of Medford, very unfortunately.

115
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:02,519
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to commend you for your leadership, again,

116
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:07,754
[SPEAKER_17]: for bringing that to light and for focusing on the injustices in our community.

117
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:09,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

118
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:16,099
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor Tseng, any further discussion by members of the Council?

119
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

120
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

121
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:22,913
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

122
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:25,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford, Massachusetts.

123
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:28,175
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank the Council for putting this on the agenda.

124
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:34,078
[SPEAKER_22]: It seems to me I've never seen this much anti-Semitism in my lifetime.

125
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:39,200
[SPEAKER_22]: It probably goes back to the 30s and maybe 2030, besides.

126
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,821
[SPEAKER_22]: This has been going on for more than 2,000 years.

127
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:50,685
[SPEAKER_22]: You probably would not expect me to make this kind of a quote, but

128
00:09:56,274 --> 00:10:00,316
[SPEAKER_22]: I like to quote Genesis chapter 12, verse three.

129
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:09,819
[SPEAKER_22]: I will bless thee that will bless thee, and curse him, her, or it that curses thee.

130
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,361
[SPEAKER_22]: My translation is if you go against the Jews, you will perish.

131
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:24,025
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I really appreciate you put this on the table, because we're in dire straits in this world.

132
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for listening.

133
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:26,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

134
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion?

135
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:29,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, on the motion.

136
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:31,199
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

137
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

138
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

139
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,842
[SPEAKER_16]: 24-368, offered by Councilor Tseng.

140
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:40,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the City Council recognize and celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

141
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:41,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Tseng.

142
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:42,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

143
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,542
[SPEAKER_17]: This month is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, AAPI Heritage Month for short.

144
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:57,765
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one of the fastest growing communities in our country, let alone in our city.

145
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:05,148
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we see it all around us, new restaurants and bubble tea shops and everything coming in.

146
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Asian Americans are really

147
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:10,351
[SPEAKER_17]: picking up a big part of our local economy.

148
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,933
[SPEAKER_17]: They're contributing in our school system as we've seen in previous meetings.

149
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:21,357
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a month to celebrate that history, that heritage here in Medford and in our country.

150
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:27,200
[SPEAKER_17]: We've taken a lot of strides towards equity in our city in the last few years.

151
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:31,023

[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to steal any of Amanda's thunder, but this is part of an ongoing effort from Trees Medford, which is our local advocacy group here in the city, to create a holistic citywide inventory of all of our trees so that way we can make efforts to increase or capitalize on various different areas in the city.

295
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if Amanda would like to chime in here.

296
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:57,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll stop talking for a moment to give her a moment.

297
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Amanda, if you could raise your hand on Zoom.

298
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:03,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And once again, I please ask if you're having a private conversation, please take it out in the hallway.

299
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:06,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, if you're gonna keep talking, thank you.

300
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:11,186
[SPEAKER_16]: There's people talking in the back.

301
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:19,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And if Amanda's unable to join or provide comment, I can field any questions that you may have.

302
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:20,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not seeing Amanda.

303
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:21,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

304
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:26,161
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, this is to conduct an inventory of trees that are existing in public parks.

305
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:30,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the comprehensive plan goals are to increase our tree canopy here in the city.

306
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:32,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We are an urban environment.

307
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:33,348
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more trees.

308
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:36,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is the goal of this grant is to conduct that.

309
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,793
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm happy to read the funding recommendation letter if you'd like.

310
00:22:41,214 --> 00:22:43,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Funding recommendation decision, May 14, 2024.

311
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Applicant name, City of Medford Forestry Division.

312
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:47,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Co-applicant name, Trees Medford.

313
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Public tree park inventory on May 14th, 2024.

314
00:22:51,191 --> 00:23:03,895
[SPEAKER_16]: The City of Medford Community Preservation Committee, CPC, voted six to zero to zero to recommend to the City Council that Trees Medford and Medford's Forestry Division be awarded $5,000 to conduct a citywide inventory of all public trees in city-owned parks.

315
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:10,136
[SPEAKER_16]: In reaching the decision, the CPC found that the project meets the CPA objective of preserving and restoring city-owned recreation spaces.

316
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further questions by a member of the Council?

317
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:15,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

318
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:30,085
[SPEAKER_21]: parks, open spaces, historical sites, and affordable housing?

319
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:30,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

320
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:31,166
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

321
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:36,150
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that this falls, just it falls in with the process and it's something that's so needed.

322
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:45,799
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that it's been working, the process has been working, I think, in the cemetery and other places around the city to make sure that we take care of our tree canopy.

323
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:46,340
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

324
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

325
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:48,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion on the floor?

326
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,910
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion approved by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Callaghan.

00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:08,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

342
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,157
[SPEAKER_16]: 7 in the affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

343
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:10,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Theresa.

00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,984
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have the petitioners before us, just a little context.

350
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:47,447
[SPEAKER_16]: We are, I think the intent is to move forward here on a conditional common victualler license pending all of the approvals listed as well as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

351
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:52,589
[SPEAKER_16]: And with that, I'm happy to turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli or the petitioners.

[SPEAKER_36]: John Chase, 61 Pullen Road.

361
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Great American Beer Hall, but anyways.

362
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:19,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the weekend, they laid asphalt for the site, and we're going to start the beer garden and the outside landscaping and framing.

363
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,468
[SPEAKER_13]: The bar is going up next week.

364
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:22,488
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really exciting.

365
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:26,391
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're set for a mid-July opening.

366
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,612
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, we're moving along over there.

367
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,473
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great news.

368
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:30,954
[SPEAKER_21]: really exciting.

369
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:34,536
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that, uh, Mr. President, I see that I know that we're waiting.

370
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything right now is pending.

371
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:38,319
[SPEAKER_21]: But as you said, this is provisional right now.

372
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,560
[SPEAKER_21]: So we move forward.

373
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,562
[SPEAKER_21]: I would move forward what we have in place right now.

374
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:42,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

375
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further questions?

376
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:45,525
[SPEAKER_16]: by members of the council for the applicant before we move ahead.

377
00:25:48,163 --> 00:26:00,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, I'll just say we also know we've received the application for a special permit that has to go through the advertising process, so likely there will be on the meeting of June 25th, we will have you back to talk about that.

378
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:13,150
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve the common victualler's license conditional on the pending approvals listed here, as well as the occupancy permit, and do you also want to do a review?

379
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we always do a 30 60 day review ... 

379
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,272
[SPEAKER_16]: A 30 60 day review upon opening, so we'll hear from everyone.

380
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's issues, we'll have you back to talk about it.

381
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:29,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so the motion is to approve conditional on the pending approvals as well as the occupancy permit and 30 and 60 day review upon opening.

382
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:30,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

383
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:35,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Great. On that motion by Councilors Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

384

00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:46,249

[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

393
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:47,790

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

396
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,333
[SPEAKER_16]: 7 in the affirmative, none negative.

397
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:52,033
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

398
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:52,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, you guys.

399
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:53,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

400
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,074
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see you in a couple weeks.

401
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:54,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

402
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:55,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck.

403
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:58,737
[SPEAKER_16]: 24-359 offered by Vice President Collins.

404
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:01,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Resolution to hear an update from the Brooks Park Tenant Associations.

405
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:08,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hear an update from representatives of the Brooks Park Tenant Association on the status of their tenancies and efforts to negotiate with their property owner.

406
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins.

407
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bears.

408
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:18,064
[SPEAKER_03]: This council has for a long time been a forum for residents when they are in a time of need.

409
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:28,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fitting that former Councilor Caraviello is here tonight because in my first term, you know, he was the liaison that bridge that made that connection with

410
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:46,881
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole group of tenants that were in a time of need and I think early 2022 with the Bradley Road tenants and made sure that Councilors were informed of what was happening in their building and could offer whatever support we could as they sought their next safe haven in Medford.

411
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad that this council can be a forum to hear from

412
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:53,625
[SPEAKER_03]: residents in any occasion of need.

413
00:27:55,025 --> 00:28:09,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the past several months, tenants at the Brooks Park apartments have been keeping councilors informed of their situation, which includes, you know, the property changing hands, and unfortunately, a wave of displacement and evictions.

414
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:18,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that they've been seeking to converse and discuss and negotiate with their property owners that they can remain in this community, and I am grateful to them for

415
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:24,995
[SPEAKER_03]: appearing tonight so that we can hear an update directly from the source about the status of their tenancies.

416
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:26,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

417
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:29,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for having us.

418
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:30,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

419
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:31,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

420
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,019
[SPEAKER_16]: You're good.

421
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:36,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Rachel Clinton, 8 Brooks Park, apartment 23.

422
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:42,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, council members, for having us and acknowledging that this is such a serious issue, too.

423
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:49,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I get started, I just want everyone from the Brooks Park Tenant Association that's here to stand up, please.

424
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:08,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And the two wonderful people standing beside me are also a part of the Tenant Association.

425
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:12,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I, so yeah, here's my testimony.

426
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived at Brooks Park for three years now.

427
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,041
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a beautiful and diverse community.

428
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:20,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It is multilingual and we take care of one another.

429
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:22,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to continue to live here.

430
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:29,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told my rent was going to be increased by $200 with a two weeks notice in January.

431
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:33,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I was fortunately able to negotiate it down, but now my lease ends in August.

432
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:38,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not have the money to move and will not find a place that is affordable near here.

433
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I have built a community here.

434
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:46,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I should add my current rent is nearly half of my income, which as you can imagine,

435
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:52,520
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves little for food and all of the bills I must pay on top of it all.

436
00:29:53,341 --> 00:30:03,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to live much closer to work has made my commute time shorter and with the services I provide for Medford has made my connection and ability to do my job far better.

437
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:10,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I support rent stabilization and believe we should continue to keep our community together instead of pushing people out who have made this place home.

438
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:14,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

439
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:15,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

440
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:16,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this?

441
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:17,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's on.

442
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Julia Forster.

443
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for meeting, letting us talk tonight.

444
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, at 8 Brooks Park, apartment 20.

445
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:32,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I have lived at Brooks Park for 23 years.

446
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:35,724
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a diverse and bilingual community.

447
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:37,085
[SPEAKER_12]: It is my home.

448
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Community is important to me.

449
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,926
[SPEAKER_12]: It is stable and I feel safe.

450
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:46,408
[SPEAKER_12]: It was sold to Jacob Grossman and now managed by Charles Gate.

451
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:52,529
[SPEAKER_12]: They want to evict all residents so they can come in, renovate, and increase the rent.

452
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:54,110
[SPEAKER_12]: We said no.

453
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,231
[SPEAKER_12]: We will not move and became Brooks Park Tenant Association and joined with City Life Vita Urbana.

454
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:05,232
[SPEAKER_12]: My lease ended on April 30th, 2024.

455
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:11,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not received an eviction notice, but they did not cash two checks for rent in April, 2024.

456
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:16,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I've learned I pay through my checking account.

457
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:19,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Their intention was to evict me for nonpayment.

458
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:21,678
[SPEAKER_12]: They were not successful.

459
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I want Jacob Grossman, the owner, to sit down with Steve Meacham of City Life Vida Urbana,

460
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:35,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Joel Childers, spokesperson for the Tenant Association and all of its members.

461
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk and negotiate.

462
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:50,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want him to listen and fix immediately the concerns of tenants regarding noisy residents, leaking bathroom ceilings, and I hate to say, mice.

463
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:51,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

464
00:31:52,174 --> 00:31:52,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

465
00:31:55,538 --> 00:32:02,927
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Alexis Fondacaro at Brooks Park Building 6, apartment 31.

466
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been dealing with a lot of the same thing that my

467
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who spoke previously were stating where they're trying to evict all of us and do these renovations and raise the rent.

468
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still trying to evict me despite the fact that I've gotten caught up on my rent there.

469
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:26,366
[SPEAKER_02]: They still haven't.

470
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:34,110
[SPEAKER_02]: processed the raft payment that was given to them several months ago.

471
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:43,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have to go back to court again in September to argue with them on whether I paid the rent or not, despite the fact I have my receipts.

472
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I like living at the Brooks Parks apartments because all my neighbors are nice, they're kind.

473
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of gotten to know each other now that we have this tenant association and quite frankly,

474
00:32:56,439 --> 00:33:00,641
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to move anywhere else right now is impossible.

475
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:04,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, I tried to look for somewhere else to live that would have more space.

476
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find an apartment for under $1,700.

477
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't afford that.

478
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: My take home every month is about $1,600.

479
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:21,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also like to share a poem that I wrote about kind of living in this community.

480
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:27,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just pull it up real fast.

481
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:38,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, hold on.

482
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,892
[SPEAKER_02]: They say home is where the heart is, but it's not just behind your door.

483
00:33:49,392 --> 00:34:06,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It's outside, in the community with friends and neighbors, even the places we become regulars at. The restaurants, the grocery stores, the little place you get cheap snacks before bed, especially the donkeys that always somehow gets part of your drink order wrong, but you go there anyway because they know you and you know them.

484
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:20,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Being forced out of that inclusion, that community is jarring, shocking, scary, having to move into a new place to call home, a new place to get settled like a hermit crab without its shell lost amongst the waves.

485
00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:21,469
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our home.

486
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we live.

487
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,010
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our community.

488
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not let these corporations walk all over us.

489
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:28,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not roaches to be squashed.

490
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send all the threatening letters and people you want.

491
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:33,277
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not be moved.

492
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:33,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

493
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:34,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

494
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mr. President, City Council.

495
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,627
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is João.

496
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:43,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Brazil.

497
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:47,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been living in this building since 2015.

498
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:53,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So I moved to another place for three years, but I was facing the same problem that I'm facing right now.

499
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:57,099
[SPEAKER_05]: The landlord kept increasing the rent, like 20%, 30%, 40%.

500
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end, I was paying almost $3,000, me and my ex-husband.

501
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So I moved back to this building.

502
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this community.

503
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very diverse community.

504
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:14,210
[SPEAKER_05]: There are like Spanish speakers, Portuguese speakers.

505
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:21,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, a lot of people that are my family there, like I have a lot of friends in this building.

506
00:35:22,216 --> 00:35:33,504
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, I see myself in the same situation, because I don't know how people can afford to pay rent, utilities, food, with the salaries that we have right here.

507
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:35,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a lawyer in my country here.

508
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:37,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I work as an immigration paralegal.

509
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:44,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And during summer, I need to work with construction, because I can't pay my bills with this market salaries.

510
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:56,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I wish the landlord and Charles Gatework were here, but unfortunately, I don't think they didn't come.

511
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,643
[SPEAKER_16]: I invited them.

512
00:35:58,743 --> 00:35:59,704
[SPEAKER_16]: They did not respond.

513
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:01,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, to talk with them.

514
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:04,067
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been trying for like months.

515
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,789
[SPEAKER_05]: We are having meetings every Saturday.

516
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,290
[SPEAKER_05]: We send two letters to them.

517
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,372
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't even have a conversation.

518
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:11,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

519
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:18,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here with my friends, and I hope we can have a response from them soon.

520
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:19,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

521
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

522
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:20,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

523
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:28,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And I work with City Light Vida Urbana, 284 Amory Street in Boston.

524
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really appreciate you inviting us to come tonight.

525
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really important thing for us.

526
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:48,440
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with tenant associations all over the metropolitan area, and it's my honor to be involved with supporting the Brooks Park Tenant Association, which is, in their weekly meetings, are a great example of a stable and beautiful community.

527
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:59,457
[SPEAKER_04]: As you've heard, Brooks Park was sold to a real estate company, and that real estate company wanted to have everybody leave by the end of April.

528
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:10,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And in response to that, people organized a tenant association, and 21 members of that tenant association immediately sent a letter to the landlord, simply asking for negotiations.

529
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:15,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna emphasize that, simply asking for negotiations, and they've never responded.

530
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:18,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Two other letters have gone out since then, and they never responded.

531
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Really at the core of this dispute is a moral question.

532
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:37,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Should a real estate corporation be allowed to come in, buy a building with a business plan that requires mass eviction and rent increases?

533
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the moral question.

534
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:48,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And real estate corporations are buying buildings and exacting enormous social costs from people who live there.

535
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,120
[SPEAKER_04]: and just to make more profit.

536
00:37:52,662 --> 00:38:03,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So in response to that, we also support lots of community protection legislation like rent control and tenant opportunity to purchase act or transfer.

537
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:11,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But for this purpose, I just wanna emphasize the art and goal of collective bargaining.

538
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:20,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a union, a labor union, doesn't say that the market wage is the fair wage.

539
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:24,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They say the fair wage is determined by legislation or by collective bargaining.

540
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:30,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly, tenant associations want to negotiate with a landlord to achieve a fair rent.

541
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And that seemed like a pretty minimal thing to ask.

542
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:37,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

543
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:48,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just end by saying that we think that people should be organizing like the Brooks Park Tenant Association has in the city of Method and beyond.

544
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be there to support them.

545
00:38:51,932 --> 00:39:04,337
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to emphasize too that, you know, during the foreclosure crisis, City Life was one of the primary organizations fighting for homeowners, fighting for small landlords to keep their homes.

546
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:15,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And it reflects the fact that in our view, small homeowners and small landlords have a lot more in common with tenants than either does with big real estate corporations.

547
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:23,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to kind of leave on that note, there's that understanding that we have, there's some common ground that we can pursue if only negotiations will happen.

548
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:27,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And we urge the city council to help us establish those negotiations.

549
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:28,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

550
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:35,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Name an address for the record, please?

551
00:39:35,778 --> 00:39:38,959
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, Medford, Mass.

552
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,283
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't come here for this issue, but I was speaking to people outside City Hall in the car, and I feel terrible for them.

553
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:56,369
[SPEAKER_28]: And it occurred to me, if Medford were more proactive, that perhaps the city of Method could have bought the building.

554
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:05,272
[SPEAKER_28]: had the vocational school come in, do the wiring, fixing things up, painting and so forth.

555
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:16,396
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would urge not necessarily the city council, but the city government to look at places where if people are going to be displaced, that maybe the city could

556
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:22,300
[SPEAKER_28]: take over the building, they'd still be charging rent, it would be a reasonable rent.

557
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,503
[SPEAKER_28]: But I mean, I don't know where these folks are going to go.

558
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,504
[SPEAKER_28]: I feel very sorry for them.

559
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:39,754
[SPEAKER_28]: People going in the real estate market, buying condos and then charging if it's a three bedroom charging $4,500 for a three bedroom apartment.

560
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:41,355
[SPEAKER_28]: Nobody that's

561
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,687
[SPEAKER_28]: working hard can afford something like that.

562
00:40:45,147 --> 00:41:08,498
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm not saying I'm giving up my rights as a property owner, I'm not for rent control, but there are some ways that situations like this could have been avoided if the people who are at the top of our government did a little more careful thinking about the residents of Medford instead of whatever they're thinking about, which doesn't seem to be very much these days.

563
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:08,878
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

564
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:11,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

565
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:22,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, just if I could give some context, we were working intensely to try to have an affordable housing nonprofit purchase this property instead of the for profit developer.

566
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:29,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Sadly, the city does not have available funds in an affordable housing trust, which we just created this past year.

567
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,205
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know,

568
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:45,918
[SPEAKER_16]: If there had been those funds available to make the difference between the offer from this for-profit developer who wants to kick everyone out versus the affordable housing nonprofit that wanted to work with everyone so they could stay, that's one of the efforts that we've put under.

569
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:54,383
[SPEAKER_16]: If the for-profit developer happened to be charged a transfer fee and the affordable housing developer was exempt from that, maybe that would have been the difference.

570
00:41:54,803 --> 00:42:10,910
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, this council has proposed several items related that have been discussed around addressing this issue of these large corporations buying buildings and apartments that people live in and call their home and kicking them out and turning it into a profit center.

571
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:13,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So we will continue those efforts

572
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:15,633
[SPEAKER_16]: because it's important.

573
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:16,713
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't the first time we've seen it.

574
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,173
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't the first tenant association.

575
00:42:18,214 --> 00:42:25,176
[SPEAKER_16]: I see a friend right here to talk about their experience with another tenant association in another building where this happened.

576
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:25,796
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the first.

577
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:26,637
[SPEAKER_16]: It won't be the last.

578
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:29,318
[SPEAKER_16]: And the people it hurts are our neighbors and our friends.

579
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:31,979
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're working on it.

580
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:35,140
[SPEAKER_16]: We need more resources, and we need more policy tools.

581
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,622
[SPEAKER_16]: We need the state to give them to us, and we need more funds to make the city a real actor in this field.

582
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:43,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So just wanted to put that out there.

583
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:44,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

584
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:45,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

585
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:48,456
[SPEAKER_35]: Amanda Welliver, 26 Bradley Road.

586
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:56,071
[SPEAKER_35]: My wife and I are here in support of the Brooks Park Tenant Association, because we know what it's like to be in their shoes.

587
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:58,853
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'm basically here to say what President Zac just said.

588
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:03,236
[SPEAKER_35]: Just watching them tell their story is like looking in a mirror.

589
00:43:03,696 --> 00:43:12,022
[SPEAKER_35]: We were here two years ago because our building was sold, and with no protections against no-fault evictions, large rent increases, a lot of tenants were forced to leave.

590
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,744
[SPEAKER_35]: And we've lived here for 16 years.

591
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:15,765
[SPEAKER_35]: We've called Medford our home.

592
00:43:16,465 --> 00:43:22,288
[SPEAKER_35]: but our time's up, we're probably gonna have to leave because the rents are too high and we need a strong rent control policy in the city.

593
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:23,729
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

594
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:24,990
[SPEAKER_35]: Just wanted to put my two cents in.

595
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:25,450
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

596
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:25,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

597
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:38,377
[SPEAKER_29]: Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street, where I've been lucky enough to live for 22 years now.

598
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:42,480
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm really ashamed that this is happening in Medford.

599
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:52,555
[SPEAKER_29]: and I really appreciate all the things that the city councilors are doing to try and address the affordable housing situation in Medford.

600
00:43:53,696 --> 00:44:03,083
[SPEAKER_29]: We do need some kind of rent control and we do need to fund the affordable housing bank so that when a building comes up, there's money to buy it.

601
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:08,447
[SPEAKER_29]: And just wanna thank you all for the work you're doing in that direction.

602
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further comments from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

603
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:25,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Katie McCann, address 91 Rossmore Road in Jamaica Plain.

604
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:37,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in solidarity with the Brooks Park Tenant Association, and thank you, Councilor Collins and all the Councilors who have been supporting.

605
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:47,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to express, yeah, the need for collective bargaining and also the need for strong rent control

606
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:51,907
[SPEAKER_00]: policies or rent stabilization policies in order to prevent this from happening.

607
00:44:52,887 --> 00:45:06,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked closely with Kristen and Amanda and their neighbors at Bradley Road and with many other tenants in Medford facing really large rent increases and no fault evictions.

608
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really need to put pressure on corporate landlords

609
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:31,599
[SPEAKER_00]: to come to the table to negotiate, but even when we do win these collective bargaining agreements like we have won with many corporate landlords, many of those corporate landlords continue to displace neighbors in other buildings as we've seen in Malden, for example, where we won a strong agreement in three buildings owned by United Properties.

610
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:44,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're here really in strong support of rent control as well as in strong support of this tenant association and all tenant associations organizing to stay in their homes and stay in Medford.

611
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:45,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much.

612
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:46,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

613
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,461
[SPEAKER_33]: Kristen Rover, 26 Bradley Road. I'm just here to echo what my wife Amanda said.

614
00:45:55,481 --> 00:46:02,248
[SPEAKER_33]: We were in this situation a few years ago, we're still, you know, we were still dealing with it.

615
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:06,252
[SPEAKER_33]: So we totally understand and we definitely need back control because,

616
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:13,777
[SPEAKER_33]: like she said, 16 years in Medford and same thing, we have to leave our community.

617
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:19,140
[SPEAKER_33]: So yes, we definitely need rent control because this cannot keep happening.

618
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:26,424
[SPEAKER_33]: I keep hearing, every other day we hear about somewhere else, somewhere this is happening and it just needs to stop.

619
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:27,764
[SPEAKER_33]: So thank you.

620
00:46:31,144 --> 00:46:32,244
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

621
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:35,785
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm Eduardo Palacios, community organizer with City Life Vida Urbana.

622
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:38,265
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't live in Medford, but I have organized out here.

623
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:48,907
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'd say that amongst you guys, there exists that want, the desire to help our communities, to help bring stability to our homes and to our families.

624
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,047
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that is great.

625
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:59,849
[SPEAKER_31]: And I ask that you build on that desire to help because what has happened here, starting with 26 Bradley to what's going on at Brooks Tenant Association,

626
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:04,132
[SPEAKER_31]: there's only a mirror of what's going on across the lake, right?

627
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:16,241
[SPEAKER_31]: Other cities nearby, where it's even worse, where this is a constant thing now, where every other week, more and more tenants are coming to us, saying, I'm being priced out, I'm being forced out, I have nowhere to go.

628
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:23,166
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think here lays the power that can help prevent that, because the desire is there.

629
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:26,789
[SPEAKER_31]: So I just hope that you don't just have the desire and let it burn out.

630
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,311
[SPEAKER_31]: Medford has always been home for our peoples.

631
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:36,074
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think I was surprised when I had to come here for the first time to help organize our tenant association.

632
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:41,037
[SPEAKER_31]: But it's like he said earlier, you know, it's not the first, it's not going to be the last.

633
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,738
[SPEAKER_31]: Corporate greed does not end.

634
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:51,703
[SPEAKER_31]: And we just ask that you please remember, you know, rent control is what our peoples need, that what our communities need is home stability and that although the market

635
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:56,088
[SPEAKER_31]: looks fun for real estate, we are more than just profit.

636
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:57,530
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you guys.

637
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:58,351
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

638
00:47:58,772 --> 00:47:59,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

639
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Please take private conversations out in the hall.

640
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,940
[SPEAKER_16]: There's just kind of some whispers and conversations happening.

641
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,406
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're going to talk, please take it out in the hall and respect the people who are speaking and respect this public meeting.

642
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:09,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

643
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:12,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

644
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:14,070
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Tom Conwood.

645
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,451
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not from Medford.

646
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:17,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So you just have to come a little closer to the microphone.

647
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:17,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

648
00:48:17,573 --> 00:48:18,914
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Thomas Conwood.

649
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,135
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not from Medford.

650
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:21,536
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm with City Life.

651
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,800
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm very familiar with Medford, Cambridge, and Boston.

652
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,603
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's going on today has to stop.

653
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:34,848
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, people are getting kicked out for stupid reasons these days.

654
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:39,970
[SPEAKER_20]: And you people are politicians, and you know what's going on.

655
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:47,054
[SPEAKER_20]: And it don't make no sense to see the way these people are being abused because they don't have money.

656
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:49,555
[SPEAKER_20]: They can't afford these rents.

657
00:48:49,675 --> 00:48:51,356
[SPEAKER_20]: These rents are astronomical now.

658
00:48:51,956 --> 00:48:58,440
[SPEAKER_20]: You got all these people coming in from copy beggars, coming in from all over to make a profit.

659
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,481
[SPEAKER_20]: And people are in the streets.

660
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:05,510
[SPEAKER_20]: from this city, to Cambridge, to Boston, to the state of Massachusetts.

661
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:07,932
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just wrong.

662
00:49:08,952 --> 00:49:12,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And this rent control has to pass.

663
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:16,557
[SPEAKER_20]: This society is not going to be elected.

664
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:17,337
[SPEAKER_20]: It won't last.

665
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:19,258
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I got to say.

666
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:19,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

667
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:20,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

668
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:24,882
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

669
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:29,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm not a co-host.

670
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:34,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody ask Eileen to unmute.

671
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:34,891
[SPEAKER_26]: I asked her.

672
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:35,812
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'm here.

673
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:37,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

674
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:38,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please, Eileen.

675
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:43,740
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, Mass.

676
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:50,708
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just find this whole situation heartbreaking and infuriating.

677
00:49:53,345 --> 00:50:01,971
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to let all the tenants know that there are people in this city just like me who want to stand with them.

678
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:18,902
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think one thing that the city council might consider doing is ensuring that if these developers decide that they want to get the police to have these folks evicted, that

679
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:24,562
[SPEAKER_32]: the city council prevents the police department from aiding them in any way.

680
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:36,655
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I don't think they're going to stop trying to evict this people and looking into the future, they might decide to just forcibly evict them.

681
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:41,660
[SPEAKER_32]: So maybe the city could control the police and not allow that to happen.

682
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,462
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe that's one thing that can go on.

683
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:49,784
[SPEAKER_32]: But I also want to say I definitely am for rent control.

684
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:51,124
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm from New York.

685
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:54,406
[SPEAKER_32]: New York has had rent control for many, many years.

686
00:50:54,966 --> 00:51:03,249
[SPEAKER_32]: It worked very well and it helped older people stay in their apartments and not be evicted because they were poor.

687
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:07,190
[SPEAKER_32]: It helped all kinds of people and it's still helping them.

688
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:11,152
[SPEAKER_32]: And people are used to it and they don't complain about it that much.

689
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,773
[SPEAKER_32]: much that I know of, you know.

690
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:25,598
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm also for the transfer fee and other methods of keeping people in our community, because

691
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:33,025
[SPEAKER_32]: pretty soon, we're going to see tents in the streets and homeless people on the corners.

692
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:34,345
[SPEAKER_32]: It's coming.

693
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,386
[SPEAKER_32]: It's in other cities and it's going to come here.

694
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:41,066
[SPEAKER_32]: And if we don't do something, you know.

695
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:49,648
[SPEAKER_32]: These people will be abandoned and we can't abandon members of our community.

696
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,268
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to get together and support them.

697
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,649
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's all I have to say.

698
00:51:58,203 --> 00:51:58,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Eileen.

699
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins.

700
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:08,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bears.

701
00:52:09,786 --> 00:52:22,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank again everybody who's spoken so far, everybody who's spoken as a member of the Tenants Association, and to the people who have come here to stand in solidarity with them, or the people who found themselves here and are supporting them nonetheless.

702
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:24,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that

703
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:32,117
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like a really Medford thing to me to say, you're my neighbor and I want you to be able to stay here and I want you to stay a part of this community.

704
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:42,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to keep it brief at the beginning to pass the mic to the folks who are really going through this, but I just want to give a little bit more context about how I came to know about this issue that these tenants are facing.

705
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:49,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's been almost a year since I heard about the sale of the Brooks Park Apartments for the first time.

706
00:52:49,392 --> 00:53:01,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually somebody who lived, who owns a condo up the road who first reached out to me and said they had seen the for sale sign and they were really worried because they knew that this was naturally occurring affordable housing and they were worried about what would happen to the tenants after it was sold.

707
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:22,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It was shortly after that that myself and President Bears, together with the planning department, started spending a few days just on the phone, all the time talking to an interested affordable housing developer and trying to see what we could do to make sure that this building would be competitive to sell to an affordable housing developer instead of to a for-profit housing developer.

708
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And that didn't happen, unfortunately.

709
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The offer just wasn't competitive with what the corporate property owner could offer.

710
00:53:31,566 --> 00:53:34,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember thinking, it's going to happen again.

711
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,472
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened on Bradley Road is just going to happen again.

712
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just waiting for it to happen.

713
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:42,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then several months later, it happened.

714
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:47,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw that wave of notice to quit notices go out to these two, we're hearing about that wave of evictions.

715
00:53:51,488 --> 00:53:56,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know that just it, it breaks my heart as a representative of neighbors in this community.

716
00:53:57,472 --> 00:54:03,556
[SPEAKER_03]: When people from up the street or people who are going through this come to me as a city councilor and say, what are you doing about this?

717
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:05,538
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you stop this?

718
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,140
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you how can you keep these people in our community?

719
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,761
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you help me to stay in this community?

720
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:12,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And it breaks my heart because

721
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:14,991
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot we can do.

722
00:54:15,011 --> 00:54:32,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We had this conversation when Bradley Road was happening, we said we can stand with you, we can support you, and we can platform what you're going through, we can platform your testimony, we can stand with you when you rally outside the building, when you try and try and try to get your property owner just to talk with you, just to try and recognize you as a

723
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,965
[SPEAKER_03]: a group of residents that are trying to collectively bargain.

724
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:44,308
[SPEAKER_03]: But the state doesn't give us any other tools for keeping our residents who want to stay here in our community.

725
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:46,789
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have those tools that other states have.

726
00:54:48,870 --> 00:55:00,355
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that I'm so glad that we're talking about what it will take to put the city in a position where we can in the future buy a building like this and say,

727
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We got this.

728
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:03,161
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll protect you.

729
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:04,582
[SPEAKER_03]: That building's up for sale.

730
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:08,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to buy it so that Medford residents can stay there in perpetuity.

731
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:10,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not at that place.

732
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're growing an affordable housing trust fund.

733
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,628
[SPEAKER_03]: The analogy that comes to mind is it's like planting a tree.

734
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:18,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we're planting that tree.

735
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:19,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That sapling is in the ground.

736
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,791
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in the ground for three months.

737
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be decades before we can turn that into

738
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:33,096
[SPEAKER_03]: purchasing buildings that will be affordable housing for members of this community, unless we start planting immediately.

739
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:34,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so sad.

740
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:35,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We're behind the eight ball.

741
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:40,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to be thinking about growing that forest so that this doesn't keep happening again in the future.

742
00:55:41,624 --> 00:55:49,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the short term, we need more tools to help people like the tenants that are before us this evening, whose problem is right here and right now.

743
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:50,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't wait 20 years.

744
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank you so much for being here.

745
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time that a tenant speaks out for themselves and their neighbors, they're speaking out for all tenants who don't want to be moved around the region like pawns.

746
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:06,100
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to stay here in their community where they work and have friends and have family and have invested and want to keep investing.

747
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:07,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

748
00:56:15,745 --> 00:56:16,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Vice President Collins. Councilor Lemingng?

749
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:21,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd also like to add that in addition to my colleagues' efforts on this.

750
00:56:21,188 --> 00:56:28,893
[SPEAKER_19]: So I talked to legal about what options city council has in helping the tenants.

751
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:36,437
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, as we've been hinting, there isn't really a whole lot that we can do given the current tools that we have.

752
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:44,802
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot that we could have done if different choices were made 30 years ago, if the city had decided to plant that tree 30 years ago.

753
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,325
[SPEAKER_19]: We could have put up the money to do that, but we can't right now.

754
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:57,350
[SPEAKER_19]: But right now, this city council is asking, trying to ask the state to give us the tools to prevent that.

755
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:15,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And not only are we seeing these real estate management companies not respond to their own tenants, not sit down to negotiate, but we're also seeing them actively fight tooth and nail to prevent cities from having those tools in the first place because they're making so much money from this.

756
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:34,741
[SPEAKER_19]: What they're spending their time doing, and I'm sure that a lot of people in this room have received those mailers, is put out information, mass text robocalls that are scaring average homeowners, average residents into thinking that these initiatives that this city council is pursuing is going to hurt them.

757
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:35,802
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not.

758
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:39,285
[SPEAKER_19]: It is going to prevent your neighbors from being driven out of the city.

759
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:52,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay? That's what we're seeing, is a very small number of bad actors put out propaganda to prevent the city from having even the minimum amount of tools necessary to prevent this from happening in the future.

760
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:03,727
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know that, you know, people come here and they don't like to see it when their neighbors get kicked out because right now these problems have a face to them.

761
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:09,371
[SPEAKER_19]: They have the face of your neighbor saying that we're going to have to leave because a big company is telling us to leave.

762
00:58:11,043 --> 00:58:11,925
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it feels bad.

763
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:19,756
[SPEAKER_19]: But when people say, Oh, you know, somebody should have done something about this 30 years ago, somebody should have done something about this before.

764
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:23,041
[SPEAKER_19]: That's because everytime anybody's tried to do anything about it,

765
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:32,522
[SPEAKER_19]: big money interest will come in and prevent it from happening through these sorts of opposition campaigns, which we're seeing in Medford right now.

766
00:58:33,282 --> 00:58:38,045
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to point that out, that that's an important piece of context.

767
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:40,847
[SPEAKER_19]: The Charles Gate Realty Group is not giving silence.

768
00:58:41,327 --> 00:58:50,473
[SPEAKER_19]: What they're doing is giving large donations to state senators, state representatives, telling them to nix these initiatives at the state level.

769
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:51,534
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what's happening right now.

770
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:55,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Councilor Lemingng. Councilor Scarpelli?

771
00:58:58,057 --> 00:58:58,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

772
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:07,822
[SPEAKER_21]: So I, I too feel, um, that we, we owe a certain amount of protection to our, our, our, uh, our residents.

773
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:12,324
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that we have tools in place that we're just not taking advantage of here in Medford.

774
00:59:13,005 --> 00:59:21,009
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, this council really can't do much for you, but what we can do, we can work with the CPA like the city of Cambridge and

775
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:26,893
[SPEAKER_21]: put CPA funding to keep a mediation company on retainer.

776
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,974
[SPEAKER_21]: So when these issues happen, you're not scrambling.

777
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:35,095
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an avenue that you can come right here to City Hall to make sure that you're protected.

778
00:59:35,735 --> 00:59:37,695
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that that's the beginning of it.

779
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:47,777
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that my fellow councilor feels that what we're talking about right now, we have a group of people that are in dire need, that are afraid.

780
00:59:47,857 --> 00:59:49,878
[SPEAKER_21]: And I feel sympathy and I understand that.

781
00:59:50,646 --> 01:00:03,196
[SPEAKER_21]: But with, now, say no different, no different than Brooks family feels than the residents that reach out to me saying, George, I'm 78 years old.

782
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:05,098
[SPEAKER_21]: I lived in a fixed income.

783
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:06,078
[SPEAKER_21]: I own my home.

784
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:17,748
[SPEAKER_21]: And the process that this, that society has given us has, by success, has driven the cost of my home up.

785
01:00:18,885 --> 01:00:20,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they live in a fixed income.

786
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:24,589
[SPEAKER_21]: So now what you hear, you hear a council that says, let's have rent control.

787
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:25,930
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do a tenure.

788
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do a transfer tax.

789
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do a registration fee.

790
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do an override.

791
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:32,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do... that's frightening.

792
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:35,231
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we're on the same boat.

793
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:38,192
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you have homeowners, and this is the problem.

794
01:00:38,613 --> 01:00:45,535
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very, it's difficult when you have some Councilors trying to divide the community by calling things fear tactics.

795
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:46,335
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not.

796
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:48,696
[SPEAKER_21]: People are scared because it's the truth.

797
01:00:49,935 --> 01:01:08,060
[SPEAKER_21]: If you own that home and you live there, and you didn't expect your $18,000 home you bought 35 years ago, that is now a million dollars, because some people behind this real feel like, because that house is worth a million dollars, that person that owns that house and that has to live there every day, that that's a wealthy person.

798
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,171
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's the same person that's sitting back here.

799
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,851
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the same person with the same fears.

800
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,652
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's not divide.

801
01:01:17,232 --> 01:01:19,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's try to find options like the CPA.

802
01:01:20,873 --> 01:01:24,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's look at the CPA for mediation.

803
01:01:25,093 --> 01:01:26,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's look at our CPA tax.

804
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:29,774
[SPEAKER_21]: We had Councilor Marks has been preaching for years.

805
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:36,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at the space that we have, that Medford owns, that we can sell.

806
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:49,834
[SPEAKER_21]: We can allow building use on those small parcels that you could take that money and put it in to the affordable trust fund that, by the way, we haven't even established yet.

807
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:50,875
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not even up.

808
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:55,718
[SPEAKER_21]: But imagine that funding coming in, that the Brooks family comes to us and says, what?

809
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:57,859
[SPEAKER_21]: We're being pushed out.

810
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we could plant the seed.

811
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:07,686
[SPEAKER_21]: But listen, I can also go get an oak and bring it right here and plop it right down the middle of this forum.

812
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:09,892
[SPEAKER_21]: So there are avenues.

813
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,195
[SPEAKER_21]: So don't don't let's let's be honest.

814
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:18,782
[SPEAKER_21]: I fear and I will work as hard as I can for this organization because I hate to see people leaving.

815
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:20,262
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fair.

816
01:02:21,002 --> 01:02:25,184
[SPEAKER_21]: But at the same time, you can't look at the other side and say, it's all your fault.

817
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:29,525
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're gonna move you out so everybody's in that boat.

818
01:02:29,885 --> 01:02:38,248
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to find the common ground that we can all work together to make sure that we all want affordable housing, that people aren't scared to leave.

819
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:45,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, listen, I think that one thing we should focus on is look at the developers that are coming into the community.

820
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:56,636
[SPEAKER_21]: find a way that we have legislation behind us that would protect owners that or renters that live in their home that are being pushed out for for total gain.

821
01:02:57,536 --> 01:03:00,678
[SPEAKER_21]: So I agree, I'm going to support you 1000%.

822
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:09,923
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm going to make the motion that we ask us a CPA organization to fund a mediation retainer right away.

823
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:14,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Because again, as much as we all have good intentions back here, we don't have the power

824
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:16,466
[SPEAKER_21]: to do what needs to be done.

825
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:19,627
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we had Councilor Caraviello come here today.

826
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:25,949
[SPEAKER_21]: He worked all last week on an 88-year-old woman that was being displaced, who has cancer.

827
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,650
[SPEAKER_21]: And he came up to City Hall to ask for help.

828
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,951
[SPEAKER_21]: And do you know what happened?

829
01:03:30,611 --> 01:03:32,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing, because nobody answered the call.

830
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:38,973
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a City Councilor that's worked his tail off to make sure he's protecting a resident of the city.

831
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:40,274
[SPEAKER_21]: So we all understand.

832
01:03:41,974 --> 01:03:47,619
[SPEAKER_21]: But this is where the unity comes in instead of saying that, oh, this is this and this is that.

833
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:51,502
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to figure out a way to make sure affordable housing is done correctly.

834
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:54,164
[SPEAKER_21]: And we use the avenues that we already have in place here.

835
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:55,686
[SPEAKER_21]: We just haven't tapped into it.

836
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:56,767
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

837
01:03:57,554 --> 01:03:57,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

838
01:03:57,854 --> 01:03:59,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to put out a couple of things.

839
01:03:59,376 --> 01:04:03,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I think if we're talking about unity, we're talking about all agreeing, but we're also talking about misinformation.

840
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:14,877
[SPEAKER_16]: The proposals that have been put forward when we talk about the someone in their home, they're on a fixed income, they're scared, they live in their home, they live in a single family or two family or three family that they're afraid of these proposals that we're proposing.

841
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:20,725
[SPEAKER_16]: The next sentence out of everybody's mouth needs to be, all of these proposals exclude your house.

842
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:23,126
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going after one, two, and three families.

843
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:24,687
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going after owner occupied.

844
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:28,569
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we talk about misinformation, that's the misinformation.

845
01:04:28,629 --> 01:04:29,389
[SPEAKER_21]: So point of information.

846
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:30,450
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no point of information.

847
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,370
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, it's point of information.

848
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:32,531
[SPEAKER_21]: I have the right to point of information.

849
01:04:32,571 --> 01:04:33,451
[SPEAKER_16]: When I'm done, thank you.

850
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:35,112
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the facts.

851
01:04:35,152 --> 01:04:35,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the facts.

852
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,133
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're all talking about unity here.

853
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:43,336
[SPEAKER_16]: We're talking about we agree that large corporations shouldn't come in and buy large multi-unit buildings and kick everybody out.

854
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:50,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, so you support the proposals that we have on the table around the rent stabilization that says that and the transfer fee that says that?

855
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:50,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that's what you all say.

856
01:04:50,919 --> 01:04:52,900
[SPEAKER_21]: When you're ready, when you're ready, point of information.

857
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,040
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what you all say, sir.

858
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,081
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the information.

859
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,701
[SPEAKER_21]: With the gavel today, I see where it's coming.

860
01:04:56,902 --> 01:05:04,225
[SPEAKER_21]: But a point of information, I will tell you, the misinformation that's going out there was a letter signed by two of the leaders in this body.

861
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:05,825
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we've answered that question.

862
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:07,146
[SPEAKER_16]: We've answered that question.

863
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,266
[SPEAKER_21]: That's exactly what's scaring people.

864
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:08,767
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not.

865
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:12,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's actually actions not it's not words.

866
01:05:12,449 --> 01:05:16,000
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actions and your actions were something totally opposite 

866
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Just false information.

866
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, then why haven't we had the meeting on the tenure on the transfer tax then?

867
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:25,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Why haven't we have committee on the transfer tax so we can point out and pick out what you just said, Councilor Bears?

868
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:34,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Because if you came out and we sat as a community and said this is what we need. Let's not let's not hurt the homeowners like you said in that in that context.

869
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:36,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm for you a thousand percent.

869
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:36,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

870
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,871
[SPEAKER_21]: But we haven't done that, have you?

871
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:38,931
[SPEAKER_16]: We have.

872
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:41,932
[SPEAKER_16]: That's every email response to every email I've received.

873
01:05:42,312 --> 01:05:46,473
[SPEAKER_16]: The demands are shifting, sir, because the demands were don't move it at all.

874
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:47,593
[SPEAKER_16]: You're moving too fast.

875
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:49,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And now the demands are we're moving too slow?

875
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:49,333
[SPEAKER_03]: President Bears?

876
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:50,613
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't count.

877
01:05:50,753 --> 01:05:53,474
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't count which demands to meet.

878
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lemingng, thank you.

879
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:59,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to note that I think we've gotten pretty far off of the topic of the resolution.

880
01:05:59,075 --> 01:06:04,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to respond to the misinformative spin put on

881
01:06:06,098 --> 01:06:06,939
[SPEAKER_03]: actions that I've made.

882
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:13,564
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'd prefer that we get back on topic and get on with the meeting because talking about the transfer fee was not on the agenda for tonight.

883
01:06:13,985 --> 01:06:14,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

884
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:15,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

885
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:15,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you. Councilor Lemingng?

886
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:30,565
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd also like to just, the CPA seems to come up a lot here, but something like $2.4 million is already going to affordable housing initiatives to rebuild Walkling Court.

887
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:32,446
[SPEAKER_21]: It's one project.

888
01:06:32,566 --> 01:06:34,307
[SPEAKER_21]: It's one project.

889
01:06:34,307 --> 01:06:36,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, please, please do not... 

890
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Speak the truth.

890
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,451
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to talk about not speaking the truth?

891
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:40,471
[SPEAKER_21]: That's affordable.

892
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:43,894
[SPEAKER_21]: The CPA is not phasing that out for one project.

893
01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:47,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Please do not interrupt. Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli,

894
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:52,938
[SPEAKER_19]: I sat on the CPA prior to being elected to this council.

895
01:06:52,998 --> 01:07:00,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, affordable housing projects that involve building do come along less frequently than open space and historic preservation projects.

896
01:07:01,002 --> 01:07:05,404
[SPEAKER_19]: And so typically a larger portion of funding needs to be dedicated to those.

897
01:07:05,744 --> 01:07:10,066
[SPEAKER_19]: One project, because the CPA has not really been around all that long.

898
01:07:10,546 --> 01:07:11,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, funding,

899
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:18,272
[SPEAKER_19]: a mediator, I suppose, is not a solution to these problems.

900
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:23,176
[SPEAKER_19]: They're trying... Councilor Scarpelli, they're trying to find mediation.

901
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:25,258
[SPEAKER_19]: They've said that they're trying to find mediation.

902
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:34,126
[SPEAKER_19]: So putting more money towards somebody else that's also trying to find mediation is not a long-term sustainable solution to this

903
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:36,528
[SPEAKER_19]: to this problem.

904
01:07:36,588 --> 01:07:39,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I agree with what Vice President Collins just said.

905
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:47,536
[SPEAKER_19]: This has gotten off topic, but I hear so much misinformation about the CPA being thrown around these chambers that I did feel like addressing that.

906
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:47,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

907
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:50,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

908
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

909
01:07:58,305 --> 01:07:58,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none.

910
01:07:58,765 --> 01:08:01,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

911
01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:02,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

912
01:08:02,188 --> 01:08:03,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Matthew Page Lieberman.

913
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:14,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, regarding what Councilor Scarpelli said, I don't know if it'd be a bit too strong to say misinformation, but perhaps there were a few things that were said without the best of judgment.

914
01:08:16,803 --> 01:08:21,245
[SPEAKER_18]: When you, when, through the chair, through the chair, yes, apologies.

915
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:30,991
[SPEAKER_18]: When a member of this body says that everybody's in the same boat, you know, whether it's people being evicted who don't know where they're gonna live in a few weeks,

916
01:08:31,553 --> 01:08:35,136
[SPEAKER_18]: or people that are upset that they have to pay higher property taxes.

917
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:39,198
[SPEAKER_18]: I start to wonder, are these things really equivalent?

918
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Are these things really equivalent?

919
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:48,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't have any record of anybody being kicked out of their house because of property taxes.

920
01:08:49,986 --> 01:08:52,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I know that there's a program for deferments.

921
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:58,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Does anybody here know if anybody's been kicked out of their house because of property taxes?

922
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:04,068
[SPEAKER_16]: direct your comments to the chair.

923
01:09:04,468 --> 01:09:07,911
[SPEAKER_16]: There are people who, when they don't pay their property taxes, they're foreclosed upon.

924
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:08,972
[SPEAKER_16]: That is something that happens.

925
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:12,836
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a program in the city for people to defer their taxes.

926
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody's taking that up.

927
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:19,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead, we're asking for the taxes to be forgiven until they could sell their house and then pay them.

928
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:26,868
[SPEAKER_18]: You're saying this is all an act, so people in the city are actually, they're given the option to defer their taxes.

929
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:27,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that correct?

930
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:31,315
[SPEAKER_16]: There is an option for property tax deferments, yes.

931
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:37,016
[SPEAKER_18]: And yet, even with that policy existing, they're getting kicked out of their house in the city.

932
01:09:37,236 --> 01:09:37,656
[SPEAKER_16]: It depends.

933
01:09:37,676 --> 01:09:44,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if they're not taking that policy out, and then they're not paying their taxes, all people are who do not pay their property taxes...

934
01:09:44,058 --> 01:09:44,618
[SPEAKER_21]: They are.

935
01:09:45,058 --> 01:09:46,558
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you saying? It's a rampant problem?

936
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,739
[SPEAKER_16]: There's hundreds of people a month?

937
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Are people getting evicted?

938
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, they are.

939
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,021
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not an eviction, it's a foreclosure, so we want to be factual.

940
01:09:57,381 --> 01:10:03,483
[SPEAKER_18]: So people with, as you said, you said they paid what $18,000, and it goes up to a million dollars in they're poor, right?

941
01:10:03,803 --> 01:10:05,044
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're not having pity for them.

942
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:06,204
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not having sympathy for them.

943
01:10:06,524 --> 01:10:08,265
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called cash poor, house rich.

944
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:16,588
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're telling me that there are people with you know, $800,000, a million dollars, and they're not taking advantage of the deferment thing, and they're losing their homes.

945
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:20,093
[SPEAKER_16]: And that happens, there are cases where that happens.

946
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:21,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, in Medford?

947
01:10:21,435 --> 01:10:21,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

948
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:24,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And we think that that's equivalent to people that can't pay $1,600.

949
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:27,140
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anyone's saying that it's equivalent, but I don't think this is.

950
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I heard it, it's all in the same boat.

951
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:29,222
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not gonna engage in dialogue.

952
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:30,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Finish your comment, and we're gonna move on.

953
01:10:32,878 --> 01:10:34,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that... all right, fine.

954
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:35,719
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the clarity.

955
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,622
[SPEAKER_18]: There was one other thing that was pitched, which is the idea of selling off city land.

956
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:45,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that this, there's a lot of times people have pitched this in the past.

957
01:10:45,985 --> 01:10:53,509
[SPEAKER_18]: I work behind the scenes to cancel any of these ideas to sell off city land, especially when we're talking about things that happened 30 years ago with no foresight.

958
01:10:54,289 --> 01:11:02,211
[SPEAKER_18]: and we're talking about developers coming in and raising the rent, selling off the city land to a for-profit developer is not gonna solve this problem.

959
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:08,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm gonna fight against this constantly and work with everybody here to fight against selling off the city land.

960
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your comment.

961
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:14,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, just to be clear, I'll give you an example.

962
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:15,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Today, I talked to a homeowner.

963
01:11:15,655 --> 01:11:16,976
[SPEAKER_21]: I talked to a homeowner today that has about

964
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,051
[SPEAKER_21]: 18 feet that the city owns.

965
01:11:24,431 --> 01:11:30,674
[SPEAKER_21]: They're willing to come in and pay that 18 feet to build an addition for the senior citizen parent to move in with them.

966
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:35,336
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know it sounds nice and it sounds powerful to say developers.

967
01:11:35,576 --> 01:11:36,757
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not all developers.

968
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:48,282
[SPEAKER_21]: You have small parcels of land that homeowners that are bought these properties that will gladly pay, that would feed our trust to help communities like we have here at the Brooks.

969
01:11:48,742 --> 01:11:49,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

970
01:11:50,342 --> 01:11:52,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I don't get this theory of mine...

971
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:55,806
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't respond, Matthew, please.

972
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:56,567
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not gonna stop.

973
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:57,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to say something.

974
01:11:57,828 --> 01:11:58,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Please sit down.

975
01:11:59,049 --> 01:11:59,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

976
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:02,732
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna go to Munir Germanus on zoom.

977
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:04,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

978
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,257
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Munir Germanus.

979
01:12:09,498 --> 01:12:11,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at three summit road.

980
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived in Medford for about 40 years.

981
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:26,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Our house actually is a two-family house that we rent and I'm happy with the person renting the apartment.

982
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:31,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't increased the rent for the past seven years except once.

983
01:12:32,751 --> 01:12:49,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really appreciate the efforts of this city council in addressing the shortcomings that we have in our income to the city to address problems such as what we're discussing right now.

984
01:12:50,961 --> 01:12:56,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I am receiving a lot of emails from so-called homeowners associations.

985
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:04,752
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of misinformation that I don't appreciate, and I try to just delete it and ignore it.

986
01:13:05,592 --> 01:13:17,918
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm here to support the efforts of the Brooks Parks Tenant Association, and also to give my full support for the work of this city council.

987
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:34,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's difficult for the city council to solve the problems of the world, but I also appreciate their stance on asking our federal government to stop spending billions of dollars on armaments and then

988
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:47,334
[SPEAKER_01]: use some of this money where it really, really is needed in our schools, in our tenants associations, in supporting affordable housing.

989
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:50,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for listening to me.

990
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:51,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

991
01:13:51,618 --> 01:13:56,023
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go to Susan Girard on zoom name and address for the record, please.

992
01:13:57,944 --> 01:14:00,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Susan Girard, 26, Farragut Ave.

993
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:14,486
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to say, I wanted to say that I really appreciate what Steve Meacham said when he spoke about there not being a contradiction between

994
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:19,990
[SPEAKER_23]: small homeowners and renters, which I think we've heard a little bit too much of.

995
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:24,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Nobody is trying to harm small homeowners.

996
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:31,558
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think anybody here thinks that people who own their own home that have gone up tremendously in value is a rich person.

997
01:14:31,578 --> 01:14:44,486
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't think anybody, any small homeowner is harmed by having tenants that are renters in the city protected from

998
01:14:45,487 --> 01:14:49,971
[SPEAKER_23]: these large realtors that come in and drastically raise the rents.

999
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:52,213
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's what we're really talking.

1000
01:14:52,253 --> 01:15:01,361
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, even a small landlord like Munir Germanus, they can raise their rents if there's things that need to be fixed in their house.

1001
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:03,123
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think anybody is opposing that.

1002
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:08,728
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to say that there are small businesses that are suffering in Medford from having their rents raised.

1003
01:15:08,768 --> 01:15:17,376
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to comment, I live in East Medford and my hairdresser who lives practically across the street has had his rent raised by $500 a month, which as a small

1004
01:15:19,858 --> 01:15:29,382
[SPEAKER_23]: operation, not only he, but a lot of the businesses along Salem Street have had their rents raised, and it's difficult for them because they're not large businesses.

1005
01:15:29,422 --> 01:15:30,402
[SPEAKER_23]: They're really struggling.

1006
01:15:31,142 --> 01:15:34,984
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I think what we're talking about here is corporate greed.

1007
01:15:35,124 --> 01:15:40,506
[SPEAKER_23]: We're talking about the large landlords that come in, raise rents dramatically, and evict people.

1008
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:43,067
[SPEAKER_23]: And I did want to say, I believe that

1009
01:15:44,747 --> 01:15:56,909
[SPEAKER_23]: that City Councilor Scarpelli talked about, people who might want to take a small piece of property and build an accessory dwelling unit on it for a family member or someone else.

1010
01:15:57,449 --> 01:16:01,050
[SPEAKER_23]: And I believe that's supported by most of us here as a good thing.

1011
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:04,951
[SPEAKER_23]: If someone wants to be able to do that, that should be allowed to be done.

1012
01:16:05,331 --> 01:16:09,732
[SPEAKER_23]: And the final thing I want to say is that the CPA does not have that much money, actually.

1013
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:20,718
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be lovely if they did to be able to buy buildings or seriously help renters, but they don't have that much money.

1014
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:25,162
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think the issue is, you know, how do we help everybody in the city?

1015
01:16:25,462 --> 01:16:35,229
[SPEAKER_23]: How do we think about everybody and protect them from large, greedy people who are going to come in here, raise rents dramatically and evict people?

1016
01:16:35,269 --> 01:16:37,931
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's the nub of this whole matter right now.

1017
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:45,056
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to be clear that it doesn't have to be a fight between small homeowners and renters.

1018
01:16:45,496 --> 01:16:46,196
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1019
01:16:46,216 --> 01:16:49,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1020
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1021
01:16:55,022 --> 01:16:56,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1022
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Councilor Bears.

1023
01:17:00,086 --> 01:17:02,087
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I'm from East Medford also.

1024
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm Castagnetti Andrew.

1025
01:17:06,013 --> 01:17:11,097
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll agree that inflation is out of control... for all, and...

1025
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew, please point your camera up.

1026
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
[SPEAKER_24]: I swear I'm not on CNN. I don't do that kind of work.

1027
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
[SPEAKER_19]: I just stopped the video 

1027
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
[SPEAKER_24]: That's fine.

1028
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:41,029
[SPEAKER_16]: 20 years ago, we would have a big TV3 argument about that.

1029
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:48,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Castagnetti, we will allow you to speak but your video is off. And staying off.

1030
01:17:49,515 --> 01:17:52,577
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate that because I'm camera shy.

1031
01:17:58,121 --> 01:18:00,263
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, can we start again?

1032
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:03,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.

1033
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:08,667
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I'll agree inflation is out of control for all.

1034
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:10,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome to Bidenomics.

1035
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:18,969
[SPEAKER_24]: I told you once and I told you twice, but you never listened to my advice.

1036
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:32,411
[SPEAKER_24]: I said it before that comes with listen, the best solution for the housing situation is to form an apartment cooperative ownership buildings in Medford.

1037
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:46,272
[SPEAKER_24]: The person that gets into the apartment will own up just like a condo and that would be with a 67% savings from today's condo prices in Medford.

1038
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:49,193
[SPEAKER_24]: So instead of a million, you probably get into it for like 350,000 PS:

1039
01:18:53,388 --> 01:18:55,709
[SPEAKER_24]: rent control failed in the city of Boston.

1040
01:18:55,729 --> 01:19:00,931
[SPEAKER_24]: My uncle Joe Castagnetti brothers, you know, owned nine buildings in the north end but not by the expressway.

1041
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:05,632
[SPEAKER_24]: He ended up selling them all and rent control failed. Good night.

1042
01:19:05,652 --> 01:19:13,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1043
01:19:15,071 --> 01:19:17,053
[SPEAKER_29]: Ellen Epstein, 15 Grove Street.

1044
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:29,683
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to say that I think the idea of having a city mediator is a really great idea, and I applaud Councilor Scarpelli for bringing that forward.

1045
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:32,325
[SPEAKER_29]: That is a band-aid solution.

1046
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:42,132
[SPEAKER_29]: We need some band-aids, but we also need the more long-term solutions, and I just feel that if we could focus on all the good ideas

1047
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:51,693
[SPEAKER_29]: instead of putting some in the bad category and some in the good category, I think we all really want the same thing.

1048
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:56,275
[SPEAKER_29]: And if we could just go in with that attitude, I think we can get the job done.

1049
01:19:56,575 --> 01:19:56,976
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1050
01:19:57,416 --> 01:19:58,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1051
01:19:58,136 --> 01:19:59,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1052
01:20:02,281 --> 01:20:06,523
[SPEAKER_07]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1053
01:20:07,043 --> 01:20:14,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanna say that I think that some form of rent control is a plausibly good idea, likely a good idea rather.

1054
01:20:15,027 --> 01:20:20,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean that it has to be the worst one you're imagining if you're a landlord.

1055
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:26,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean that it has to be the worst one you're imagining

1056
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:30,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I lost my train of thought with that noise there.

1057
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:37,395
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be, basically there are many options that would have helped these tenants.

1058
01:20:37,435 --> 01:20:39,836
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be the most, you can't raise the rent at all.

1059
01:20:39,856 --> 01:20:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only raise a half a percent or something like that, right?

1060
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: There are lots of different policies in between and we need some level of stability for everybody.

1061
01:20:48,903 --> 01:20:53,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanna, that's the point that I had forgotten was that,

1062
01:20:55,875 --> 01:21:03,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Homeowners have certain policies, as Mr. Page Lieberman mentioned, that are intended to give them some stability.

1063
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,599
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're a senior, they can take a deferment.

1064
01:21:05,799 --> 01:21:10,681
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have, that's why we have this process for raising property taxes.

1065
01:21:11,081 --> 01:21:13,162
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can't raise them willy-nilly.

1066
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:16,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a prop two and a half process.

1067
01:21:16,463 --> 01:21:17,664
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to all vote on it.

1068
01:21:17,724 --> 01:21:19,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really big deal.

1069
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:24,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was put in place to give some homeowners a level of stability.

1070
01:21:24,448 --> 01:21:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So we should be doing something along those lines for tenants too.

1071
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Some level of stability.

1072
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:39,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't mean infinite stability, but some, just as we offer some stability to homeowners through prop two and a half, deferment schemes, et cetera.

1073
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:41,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the point I want to make there.

1074
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1075
01:21:44,224 --> 01:21:44,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1076
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:48,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion by members of the public?

1077
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:51,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

1078
01:21:53,566 --> 01:22:00,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, I'm just going to add one other thing, which is we could, and this was an initiative of, oh, I'll go to you, Mr. Merritt.

1079
01:22:01,028 --> 01:22:02,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1080
01:22:02,448 --> 01:22:04,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1081
01:22:04,929 --> 01:22:08,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to just do a shout out for someone I saw some

1082
01:22:09,246 --> 01:22:11,047
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, bad blood going on between here.

1083
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:12,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Some spirited discussion.

1084
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:14,068
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my kid's first birthday today.

1085
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:17,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I was at home actually, you know, having cake and ice cream.

1086
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:23,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And my wife went out to go get a balloon for him earlier today at Wegmans and the wind took the balloon away.

1087
01:22:23,993 --> 01:22:36,478
[SPEAKER_14]: And a really wonderful, I don't know where she's from, but this woman saw my toddler actually crying his head off and went inside and bought a replacement balloon to make my toddler happy, my three-year-old happy.

1088
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,079
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought that was actually really cool.

1089
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it has nothing to do with, you know, the topic at hand.

1090
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,022
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, you know, there are good people out there.

1091
01:22:44,662 --> 01:22:47,543
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just had to acknowledge that, you know, that was really, really awesome.

1092
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,304
[SPEAKER_14]: That person did not have to do that at all.

1093
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:51,285
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully a little more levity here.

1094
01:22:52,485 --> 01:22:54,446
[SPEAKER_14]: That said, I know we are talking about some serious things.

1095
01:22:56,327 --> 01:23:02,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I think people need to understand that Proposition 2.5 overrides don't just affect homeowners, it affects all property owners.

1096
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

1097
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:05,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Commercial as well as residential?

1098
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:06,449
[SPEAKER_16]: All taxable property.

1099
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:07,649
[SPEAKER_14]: All taxable property.

1100
01:23:08,309 --> 01:23:15,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing that is, as far as I know is true, is it's not just property taxes that you don't pay, like if you don't pay them right and there are plans.

1101
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,791
[SPEAKER_14]: If I don't pay my water bill, can the city put a lien on my property?

1102
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:20,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1103
01:23:21,151 --> 01:23:22,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And they can own my property.

1104
01:23:23,752 --> 01:23:25,212
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't pay your bills, what happens?

1105
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:33,005
[SPEAKER_14]: They can put a lien on your property and then they sell it and they keep the entire property in some cases.

1106
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:33,865
[SPEAKER_16]: That has happened.

1107
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:37,807
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been ruled illegal and it's something that this council is working very diligently.

1108
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:42,730
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, the state of the law is that they can take the entire property, not just the amount that they owe to the city.

1109
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and that's not a good law.

1110
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:49,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so just this misnomer that number one, you have commercial businesses here.

1111
01:23:49,893 --> 01:23:55,514
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think one of the things I've seen over the years, we live around the corner from the Locust Street project, right?

1112
01:23:56,414 --> 01:24:00,596
[SPEAKER_14]: And everyone was hot to trot, we're gonna build, build, build, build more residential properties.

1113
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:01,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

1114
01:24:01,756 --> 01:24:04,217
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have a giant megaplex, I'm sure people there are happy.

1115
01:24:05,057 --> 01:24:05,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do they go to work?

1116
01:24:07,718 --> 01:24:08,478
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a danger, right?

1117
01:24:08,498 --> 01:24:11,719
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more, we need more places for people to live, but where do they go to work?

1118
01:24:13,046 --> 01:24:16,808
[SPEAKER_14]: people don't live in the city and work in the city anymore, right?

1119
01:24:16,848 --> 01:24:18,228
[SPEAKER_14]: That that model's kind of changed.

1120
01:24:18,968 --> 01:24:23,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I work in New Hampshire, I got to drive back and forth to New Hampshire to go to work now.

1121
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:25,271
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's how I can afford to pay my bills.

1122
01:24:26,872 --> 01:24:29,753
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and I sit back and I hear that, you know, there's this

1123
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,572
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of this bad blood of people demonizing people who are fortunate to own property.

1124
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,613
[SPEAKER_14]: I gave my pennies a lot.

1125
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:42,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought a tiny little house in Medford.

1126
01:24:42,314 --> 01:24:45,035
[SPEAKER_14]: This was not my first choice of places to live 10 years ago.

1127
01:24:45,615 --> 01:24:50,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Since I moved in, I had someone drive through my front yard, take out my house, the fence on my property.

1128
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:52,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, you were here for that.

1129
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:55,779
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my first appearance at a city council saying, what the crap?

1130
01:24:58,143 --> 01:25:02,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And since then, my street is still a disaster, and nothing has happened, right?

1131
01:25:02,525 --> 01:25:05,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Riverside is an abomination.

1132
01:25:06,486 --> 01:25:10,588
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city hasn't been able to afford to pay back for a decade to actually fix that road.

1133
01:25:11,508 --> 01:25:12,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't see a good plan.

1134
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:21,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we sit there long term, right, we're gonna go develop Mystic Ave, we're just gonna develop, make everything residential, get rid of it, make it all residential, make it all affordable housing.

1135
01:25:22,433 --> 01:25:22,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's gonna pay?

1136
01:25:25,267 --> 01:25:27,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Who came in and built the locus street project?

1137
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,469
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a real estate developer.

1138
01:25:29,983 --> 01:25:34,604
[SPEAKER_14]: And this city government, not you specifically on the council, you guys weren't here. You were here.

1139
01:25:35,025 --> 01:25:40,626
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually the city council tried to fight that because there was a whole debacle of how that went down.

1140
01:25:40,646 --> 01:25:42,387
[SPEAKER_14]: There was open meeting law violations.

1141
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:53,210
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council couldn't actually use the city solicitor because the mayor, Mayor Burke at the time, had the city solicitor working for the city to actually push that project through.

1142
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:55,691
[SPEAKER_14]: But how does the city make money?

1143
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,804
[SPEAKER_14]: The city makes money off of permits and fees.

1144
01:25:58,844 --> 01:26:04,268
[SPEAKER_14]: And every time there's a building built, they want people to pay, developers to pay.

1145
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:06,789
[SPEAKER_14]: So the city wants these big buildings.

1146
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:09,051
[SPEAKER_14]: But now you're saying, I don't want big buildings.

1147
01:26:09,091 --> 01:26:11,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want big companies to come in.

1148
01:26:12,353 --> 01:26:13,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what are they going to build?

1149
01:26:13,274 --> 01:26:16,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they going to build another 10, 56 square foot house like mine?

1150
01:26:17,176 --> 01:26:22,600
[SPEAKER_14]: You think any developer is going to come in and pay all the fees and the fines that this city levies on to build anything?

1151
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,381
[SPEAKER_14]: You think it's worth their time?

1152
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:29,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got a quote for new siding on my house, cedar siding.

1153
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:29,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1154
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:36,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Just the materials alone for white cedar, not even the good cedar.

1155
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1156
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Good cedar, Western red cedar is $2,500 for a hundred square feet.

1157
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:43,997
[SPEAKER_14]: The crappy stuff is $1,700.

1158
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:46,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I'm looking at to fix my house.

1159
01:26:47,947 --> 01:26:49,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are things I'd rather be doing.

1160
01:26:50,028 --> 01:26:51,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather buy my kids toys.

1161
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:54,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather be spending time with them than being here.

1162
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:55,650
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have to make tough choices.

1163
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,211
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city's got some tough choices to make.

1164
01:26:59,272 --> 01:27:03,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So before I keep hearing this demonization of property owners and this and that, you know what?

1165
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:06,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody said you had to live in Medford.

1166
01:27:06,595 --> 01:27:08,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody says I have to live in Medford.

1167
01:27:10,176 --> 01:27:11,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not from Medford.

1168
01:27:12,317 --> 01:27:13,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm from Western Mass.

1169
01:27:14,511 --> 01:27:17,333
[SPEAKER_14]: First place I moved to, to get a job was in upstate New York.

1170
01:27:17,353 --> 01:27:18,614
[SPEAKER_14]: You wanna know where there's plenty of land?

1171
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:20,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Western Mass in upstate New York.

1172
01:27:21,676 --> 01:27:22,777
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to live here.

1173
01:27:22,797 --> 01:27:24,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody deserves to live here necessarily.

1174
01:27:24,918 --> 01:27:26,680
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a, you gotta work for it.

1175
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:30,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I wish we could sit there and wave and run and be like, everyone can have a house.

1176
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:33,284
[SPEAKER_14]: I work, I go to work, I'd rather not.

1177
01:27:33,324 --> 01:27:34,985
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife goes to work, she'd rather not.

1178
01:27:35,366 --> 01:27:36,286
[SPEAKER_14]: We pay for daycare.

1179
01:27:36,326 --> 01:27:38,968
[SPEAKER_14]: So instead I can, you know, I can go to work to pay for daycare.

1180
01:27:39,308 --> 01:27:40,629
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost like a break even song.

1181
01:27:41,633 --> 01:27:43,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, these are real expenses that homeowners have.

1182
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:49,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So every time I hear, oh, we're just gonna pass prop two and a half, because we need, no, I haven't seen it for years.

1183
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:51,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we really need to take a look at where the expenses are too.

1184
01:27:52,216 --> 01:27:57,357
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilor Bears, no offense, but you and I have gone around before and you said, I will not make cuts to the school.

1185
01:27:57,717 --> 01:27:58,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I will not.

1186
01:27:58,418 --> 01:28:00,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Some things are absolutely off the table.

1187
01:28:01,358 --> 01:28:02,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Then the same argument back at you.

1188
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:04,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Prop two and a half, absolutely off the table.

1189
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And then nothing gets done.

1190
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're at an impasse and the roads are still crap.

1191
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:14,389
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't see a plan, even if you do the prop two and a half, it's an impulse of money.

1192
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:16,450
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna fix the damn streets?

1193
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:21,292
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no plan, you can't possibly afford to fix the streets in this city.

1194
01:28:21,332 --> 01:28:23,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks mentioned that like six years ago.

1195
01:28:25,874 --> 01:28:29,615
[SPEAKER_14]: The city doesn't generate enough revenue to do it, so what's the plan?

1196
01:28:29,935 --> 01:28:31,416
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not build more houses.

1197
01:28:32,176 --> 01:28:36,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And this affordable housing thing that you're all talking about, great, so a young person wants to go buy a house.

1198
01:28:38,499 --> 01:28:43,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what are they going to apply to the city and get $100,000 free from the city?

1199
01:28:43,746 --> 01:28:44,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's it coming from?

1200
01:28:45,148 --> 01:28:47,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Merritt, we've entertained a very long comment here.

1201
01:28:48,152 --> 01:28:50,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to continue close up a wrapping up point?

1202
01:28:51,169 --> 01:28:54,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, because I have nothing else better to do tonight besides be here, councilor.

1203
01:28:54,613 --> 01:28:56,555
[SPEAKER_14]: No offense, but I have other things to do too.

1204
01:28:57,576 --> 01:28:59,018
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is a long brewing thing.

1205
01:28:59,058 --> 01:29:06,666
[SPEAKER_14]: When I hear terms of misinformation, and I see the keyboard warriors on Reddit coming after people like me that are homeowners, I got to wonder what's going on.

1206
01:29:06,706 --> 01:29:08,849
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't see any comments from you all defending us.

1207
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,921
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we've been very clear about our position.

1208
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:16,844
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's going on on Reddit, because especially you, Councilor Lemingng, I see you on Reddit all the time.

1209
01:29:16,864 --> 01:29:18,245
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure you're very, very aware.

1210
01:29:18,305 --> 01:29:20,607
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to have a debate about who comments what on Reddit.

1211
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:21,567
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just not going to do that.

1212
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:23,668
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but demonizing homeowners is not okay either.

1213
01:29:23,688 --> 01:29:24,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's demonizing homeowners?

1214
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:26,610
[SPEAKER_16]: You're inferring something that no one is saying.

1215
01:29:27,731 --> 01:29:27,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

1216
01:29:27,871 --> 01:29:29,172
[SPEAKER_16]: You're inferring something that no one is saying.

1217
01:29:29,232 --> 01:29:30,212
[SPEAKER_14]: They are saying it on Reddit.

1218
01:29:30,733 --> 01:29:33,635
[SPEAKER_16]: No, people are interpreting things because they're being misinformed.

1219
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:36,696
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's the misinformation that you're not considering Prop 2.5?

1220
01:29:37,847 --> 01:29:42,128
[SPEAKER_16]: We are considering, you just said it, the city does not generate enough revenue to fix what it needs to fix.

1221
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:44,069
[SPEAKER_16]: We are considering generating revenue to fix what needs to be fixed.

1222
01:29:44,089 --> 01:29:46,470
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's not a case of revenue, it's revenue minus expenses.

1223
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:49,311
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now in the current state of expenses...

1224
01:29:49,991 --> 01:29:51,912
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you cut, Mr. Merritt?

1225
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:52,392
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you cut?

1226
01:29:52,412 --> 01:29:53,952
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 teachers, 10 firefighters?

1227
01:29:54,232 --> 01:29:56,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's real easy to sit there and fire it up.

1228
01:29:56,873 --> 01:30:03,455
[SPEAKER_14]: or maybe we gotta really get a handle on what our expenses are, and for the years that I've been here, the city council has never had a good handle on the city budget.

1229
01:30:03,475 --> 01:30:03,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Merritt.

1230
01:30:03,855 --> 01:30:04,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your time.

1231
01:30:04,355 --> 01:30:05,715
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe take a look at that first before raising revenue.

1232
01:30:05,735 --> 01:30:06,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Merritt.

1255
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna make a quick comment, and then I'm gonna make a motion.

1256
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:26,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'll make the motion first.

1257
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:30,204
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is to receive and place on file, I guess.

1258
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:39,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I would suggest, I can't make a motion, would anyone like to make a motion to request that Charlesgate and the property owner negotiate with the tenants?

1259
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a better idea.

1260
01:30:42,191 --> 01:30:50,116
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng to send a letter to Charlesgate and the property owner to request that they negotiate with the Tenants Association.

1261
01:30:51,317 --> 01:30:52,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan. Councilor Scarpelli?

1262
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:58,612
[SPEAKER_21]: If we can, just if we can, what is the reasoning for that?

1263
01:30:58,652 --> 01:30:59,473
[SPEAKER_21]: So I can understand that.

1264
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:01,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1265
01:31:02,315 --> 01:31:04,697
[SPEAKER_16]: The request is from the tenants association.

1266
01:31:04,737 --> 01:31:06,419
[SPEAKER_16]: They would like to open negotiations.

1267
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:12,644
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we can send a letter on behalf of the council that we would request that the property owner respond to their tenants and enter negotiations.

1268
01:31:12,924 --> 01:31:18,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I would follow up that the mayor and it would be great if we had a city solicitor.

1269
01:31:18,788 --> 01:31:21,190
[SPEAKER_21]: I would really focus on the city solicitor really

1270
01:31:21,971 --> 01:31:25,813
[SPEAKER_21]: paving a way for this organization so they can have a point person in the city

1272
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:29,254
[SPEAKER_21]: they could talk, not a city council that really we can't do much.

1273
01:31:29,354 --> 01:31:33,756
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we can just also request that the mayor, um.

1274
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:41,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Get involved and use her, um, executive power to see what we can do to assist this organization. Thank you.

1275
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:48,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you on the further amendment of Councilor Scarpelli to request that the mayor use her executive power to assist these tenants?

1276
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Please.

1277
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:02,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you want to this this mediation thing to be an amendment?

1278
01:32:02,423 --> 01:32:03,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, please.

1279
01:32:03,224 --> 01:32:09,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to at least investigate, maybe send the subcommittee that we can look at, you know, a request.

1280
01:32:10,269 --> 01:32:10,890
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's what I have.

1281
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:15,654
[SPEAKER_26]: I have the I have you offering an amendment asking the CPA to fund the mediation retainer right away.

1282
01:32:15,854 --> 01:32:31,559
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, so maybe we change that just that we look to send this to subcommittee, that we invite the CPA in to see what that would entail, to make that a piece of the puzzle that one of our residents did say that put another tool in the toolbox with that.

1283
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:41,762
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's make that a B paper to refer a new paper to committee to request a discussion about funding a mediation service.

1284
01:32:49,702 --> 01:32:51,143
[SPEAKER_16]: On the B paper, all those in favor?

1285
01:32:51,923 --> 01:32:52,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1286
01:32:52,303 --> 01:32:53,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1287
01:32:53,984 --> 01:32:55,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, is there a second on the B paper?

1288
01:32:56,285 --> 01:32:57,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1289
01:32:57,326 --> 01:32:57,946
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1290
01:32:58,646 --> 01:32:58,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1291
01:32:58,986 --> 01:32:59,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1292
01:32:59,847 --> 01:33:11,292
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion to send a letter to the property manager and property owner, request they enter negotiations with the tenant association and to request that the mayor use her executive authority.

1293
01:33:12,693 --> 01:33:13,293
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1294
01:33:14,093 --> 01:33:14,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1295
01:33:14,473 --> 01:33:15,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1296
01:33:22,995 --> 01:33:27,919
[SPEAKER_16]: 24-367 Zoning Update Project Proposed Amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance Package 1.

1297
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:36,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we refer the following recommendations for amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance to the Community Development Board as reported out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.

1298
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:36,767
[SPEAKER_16]: 1.

1299
01:33:37,287 --> 01:33:43,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Amending the format of the table of use and parking regulations to replace the parking and loading code columns with specific parking and loading requirements.

1300
01:33:44,373 --> 01:33:49,977
[SPEAKER_16]: 2.

1301
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:49,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Amending Section 94-12 definitions to add new defined terms and revise existing definitions.

1302
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:49,977
[SPEAKER_16]: 3.

1303
01:33:50,497 --> 01:33:52,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Adopt a new GIS-based digital zoning map.

1304
01:33:52,658 --> 01:34:02,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Adoption of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to the zoning of any parcels within the City, but is intended to be applicable to the City regarding the existing zoning designation for all properties in the City.

1305
01:34:02,665 --> 01:34:02,645
[SPEAKER_16]: 4.

1306
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:07,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Exempt municipal uses from certain requirements of the Table of Use and Parking Regulations and the Table of Dimensional Requirements.

1307
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:19,743
[SPEAKER_16]: The recommended changes are attached and can be referred to informally as Package 1 of recommendations from the City Council and Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability's Zoning Update Projects with Innis Associates, Council Paper 24-033.

1308
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:20,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins.

1309
01:34:25,046 --> 01:34:25,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Bears.

1310
01:34:25,987 --> 01:34:36,617
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first package small package of updates to come out of the planning and permitting committee and its work with the zoning consultant that the city council hired at the beginning of this term.

1311
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:38,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting it off with.

1312
01:34:40,160 --> 01:35:04,374
[SPEAKER_03]: some proposals that I think will be, you know, relatively minor procedural compared to the scope of work that we will be continuing on for the rest of this term, which will be, you know, kind of encountering those bigger questions that constituents have been coming to us with for years around residential development and commercial development and mixed use development and incorporating the goals and themes of our comprehensive plan, climate plan, housing production plan.

1313
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:07,603
[SPEAKER_03]: These are less sexy.

1314
01:35:08,886 --> 01:35:13,855
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working with the zoning consultant and planning staff and the new building commissioner to make

1315
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:34,385
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the word I'm looking for kind of some like formatting changes to the table of use and parking regulations, so that all of the relevant information is on the same page and updated so that it's more readable, so that when city staff and potential developers are looking for this information, they don't have to go flipping through our very low court ordinances to find it.

1316
01:35:36,107 --> 01:35:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We have also added and made some adjustments to the definitions in the zoning code to bring that up to best practice and to include some definitions that we might need to include later when we do tweak the zoning.

1317
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:52,755
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to adopt the new digital GIS zoning map.

1318
01:35:52,775 --> 01:35:55,657
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been no material changes to the zoning map proposed.

1319
01:35:55,717 --> 01:36:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd just like to move away from the literally colored pencil version and have the official version be the digital version instead, which I think is a great step.

1320
01:36:04,601 --> 01:36:18,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, the proposal also includes certain municipal exemptions from the zoning code ordinances so that major city projects, for example, a new fire headquarters will be able to proceed in a more efficient, streamlined manner.

1321
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:25,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So procedurally, this has to be referred to the Community Development Board before this council can take a vote to codify it.

1322
01:36:25,705 --> 01:36:27,045
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd motion to send it to the CDB.

1323
01:36:27,445 --> 01:36:31,866
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1324
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:32,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1325
01:36:40,228 --> 01:36:40,428
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan?

1325
01:36:40,228 --> 01:36:40,428
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1326
01:36:40,909 --> 01:36:41,689
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins?

1326
01:36:40,909 --> 01:36:41,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1327
01:36:41,769 --> 01:36:41,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1327
01:36:41,769 --> 01:36:41,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1328
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:43,470
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lemingng?

1328
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:43,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1329
01:36:44,551 --> 01:36:44,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1329
01:36:44,551 --> 01:36:44,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1330
01:36:46,032 --> 01:36:47,452
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Tseng?

1330
01:36:46,032 --> 01:36:47,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1331
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:47,773
[SPEAKER_26]: President Bears?

1331
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:47,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1332
01:36:48,373 --> 01:36:57,318
[SPEAKER_16]: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative. Motion passes. 24-369 resolution request an update on the creation of a community liaison position for the Asian American community.

1333
01:36:57,847 --> 01:37:07,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration for updates on plans or possibilities to create a community liaison position for the Asian American community in Medford, and ask how the Council can support these efforts.

1334
01:37:07,457 --> 01:37:08,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Tseng.

1335
01:37:08,098 --> 01:37:08,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1336
01:37:09,139 --> 01:37:17,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Months ago, I was talking to City staff, and they informed me of efforts to find grant funding to create an Asian American community liaison position.

1337
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:21,992
[SPEAKER_17]: The community liaison program is a point of pride for our city.

1338
01:37:22,792 --> 01:37:35,100
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something that other municipalities look at Medford as inspiration, and they look to us for our leadership on this issue on engaging communities that have been traditionally cut out and left out of the

1339
01:37:36,181 --> 01:37:36,942
[SPEAKER_17]: political process.

1340
01:37:37,882 --> 01:37:45,868
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, a lot of this stuff is just about improving city communications with folks who might not know how to interact with city institutions.

1341
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:53,052
[SPEAKER_17]: The update that I got back then was that we've put in paperwork, we've put in applications for grant funding.

1342
01:37:54,253 --> 01:38:04,660
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't heard, at least I haven't heard as a Councilor much since, but given that it is Asian American Heritage Month, I thought that this would be a great opportunity to bring this back to the spotlight.

1343
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:19,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Asian Americans do make up 13% of our city's population, it makes up the largest minority group in the city, and we need to find a way to better involve everyone in the decision-making process.

1344
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:21,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, we've been making strides.

1345
01:38:21,953 --> 01:38:35,123
[SPEAKER_17]: We're far past the days of stop Asian hate and the cases being reported on elder violence, but there's still a lot of work to be done to engage our BIPOC communities here.

1346
01:38:38,713 --> 01:38:39,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Councilor Tseng. Any further discussion?

1347
01:38:39,674 --> 01:38:40,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1348
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:53,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to voice my support for this as one of the faster growing minority groups in town, and I just think it's overdue, and I'm eager for this community liaison position to be created.

1349
01:38:53,909 --> 01:38:55,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for bringing this to us.

1350
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:56,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1351
01:38:56,471 --> 01:38:58,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1352
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:04,043
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve seconded by Councilor Callahan all those in favor.

1353
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:04,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1354
01:39:04,944 --> 01:39:14,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed? Motion passes. 24-371 be resolved the city council review options and supporting the school committee budget for the resolve the city council review the mayor's presentation of budget needs.

1355
01:39:15,846 --> 01:39:22,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to ask Councilor Scarpelli, if you have an amendment to make this significantly more specific right now, I will certainly entertain it.

1356
01:39:23,636 --> 01:39:29,423
[SPEAKER_16]: If not, I think we're running afoul of a couple Massachusetts general laws here and entertaining the discussion of the paper.

1357
01:39:29,524 --> 01:39:31,406
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could outline what

1358
01:39:32,447 --> 01:39:41,049
[SPEAKER_16]: all options in supporting the budget means, as in the form of an amendment, and if you could outline, review the mayor's presentation in the form of an amendment.

1359
01:39:41,329 --> 01:39:43,709
[SPEAKER_16]: After I hear the amendment, I'll decide whether or not to vote on it.

1360
01:39:43,729 --> 01:39:55,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, my amendment would be that, now again, this would be the whole presentation, so this is a little odd and a little bothersome to me as a city council, but I will tell you what we can.

1361
01:39:56,091 --> 01:39:58,632
[SPEAKER_21]: The amendment will be that I would look for the,

1362
01:40:00,552 --> 01:40:07,016
[SPEAKER_21]: the city council to ask the mayor make sure we get it right.

1363
01:40:08,217 --> 01:40:21,685
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to make sure that we make a motion for the mayor to appropriate $5 to $7 million needed to level the school budget through the free cash

1364
01:40:23,346 --> 01:40:39,980
[SPEAKER_21]: through free cash and by the process that we first take that, make that as an appropriation before free cash is certified and we announce for what that is used for.

1365
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,543
[SPEAKER_21]: And now if I can, Mr. President, is that efficient?

1366
01:40:44,143 --> 01:40:47,865
[SPEAKER_16]: is just on the second phrase, review the presentation.

1367
01:40:47,926 --> 01:40:48,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any specific?

1368
01:40:48,606 --> 01:41:11,100
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll tell you what, Mr. President, don't appreciate it, but I will tell you, the question that we had was the, Mia's process and how she brought this forward and the irresponsible process that she moved forward on social media and then in city council and school committee meetings, where she talked about,

1369
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,543
[SPEAKER_21]: the option of free cash being used.

1370
01:41:15,123 --> 01:41:18,326
[SPEAKER_21]: $2 million is committed to fire trucks.

1371
01:41:18,586 --> 01:41:24,652
[SPEAKER_21]: $2.3 million is committed to an OPM design for the new high school.

1372
01:41:24,932 --> 01:41:28,716
[SPEAKER_21]: $1.2 million for OPM for the HVAC system issues at the schools.

1373
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,998
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to rebuild Freedom Way for $10 million.

1374
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:35,841
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to fix HVAC systems in the schools for $15 million.

1375
01:41:36,302 --> 01:41:37,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Estimates for middle school alone.

1376
01:41:38,003 --> 01:41:40,805
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to put more money on water and soil infrastructure.

1377
01:41:40,825 --> 01:41:41,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that good, Mr. President?

1378
01:41:41,826 --> 01:41:42,426
[SPEAKER_21]: So can I proceed?

1379
01:41:43,047 --> 01:41:47,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, I want to define the amendment for Councilors, and then we can adopt the amended resolution, then we can consider it.

1380
01:41:48,471 --> 01:42:01,994
[SPEAKER_16]: So the amendment is to amend this resolution to be a specific requesting that the council request that the mayor appropriate 5 to 7 million in free cash as an appropriation before free cash is certified to fund the schools.

1381
01:42:02,394 --> 01:42:09,536
[SPEAKER_16]: And then also is it a motion to request the plan that outlined how she intends to spend the free cash reserves that she outlined on social media?

1382
01:42:09,736 --> 01:42:12,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I would present something and explain it to you and that'll get that.

1383
01:42:12,977 --> 01:42:14,277
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll explain it, Mr. President.

1384
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:21,238
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my understanding that under Mass general law, the first part is fine.

1385
01:42:21,438 --> 01:42:23,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can talk top line numbers.

1386
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:26,363
[SPEAKER_17]: We can talk line item numbers for city departments.

1387
01:42:26,943 --> 01:42:37,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, except that it runs afowl of mass general, uh, chapter 71 section 34 to talk about line items first in the school's budget before formal, um.

1388
01:42:39,514 --> 01:42:48,617
[SPEAKER_17]: before a formal budget is presented to us because we are impeding on the authority of the school committee to determine expenditures within the total appropriation.

1389
01:42:48,657 --> 01:42:50,057
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's quote from the law.

1390
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:58,300
[SPEAKER_21]: So not if it's time sensitive to ask a motion to entertain this before the certified, the free cash is certified.

1391
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:06,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds like the free cash thing is re-amendable to having the discussion of the motion as amended, which is to request the mayor appropriate five to seven million in free cash.

1392
01:43:07,623 --> 01:43:07,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1393
01:43:08,577 --> 01:43:08,837
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1394
01:43:10,218 --> 01:43:13,760
[SPEAKER_16]: On the amendment, are there any objections to the amendment?

1395
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:31,768
[SPEAKER_19]: I would motion to table this until the next regular meeting, because I would, like, that wasn't in the text that I received at all, and I would like to actually read over what Councilor Scarpelli just said in order to study it and process it a little bit more.

1396
01:43:32,008 --> 01:43:34,450
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng to table, is there a second?

1397
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:36,611
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called,

1398
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:38,810
[SPEAKER_21]: shutting it down.

1399
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:42,651
[SPEAKER_21]: It's used, 

1399
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli...

1399
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
[SPEAKER_21]: it's an episode used to do that. Shame on you.

1399
01:43:47,000 --> 01:44:00,000
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng to table, is there a second? Is there a second? I need a second, and it's undebatable. Second by Councilor Collins. Mr. Clerk, please call the role on the motion to table.

1399
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Callahan?

1399
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
[SPEAKER_37]: No

1400
01:44:09,053 --> 01:44:09,513
[SPEAKER_26]: Excuse me?

1401
01:44:09,633 --> 01:44:09,833
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1402
01:44:11,014 --> 01:44:11,755
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Collins.

1403
01:44:13,496 --> 01:44:13,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1404
01:44:15,357 --> 01:44:16,157
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1405
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:18,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1406
01:44:18,379 --> 01:44:21,020
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lemingng.

1407
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:21,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1408
01:44:21,641 --> 01:44:24,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1409
01:44:24,302 --> 01:44:24,682
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1410
01:44:25,923 --> 01:44:26,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Tseng.

1411
01:44:26,644 --> 01:44:26,844
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1412
01:44:27,704 --> 01:44:28,325
[SPEAKER_26]: President Bears.

1413
01:44:29,105 --> 01:44:29,425
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1414
01:44:30,186 --> 01:44:31,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

1415
01:44:31,867 --> 01:44:33,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lazzaro.

1416
01:44:33,528 --> 01:44:35,069
[SPEAKER_11]: When is free cash certified?

1417
01:44:36,784 --> 01:44:38,745
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the answer when you free cash is certified.

1418
01:44:39,025 --> 01:44:42,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Once the end of the fiscal year happens, we have to wait for it to be certified.

1419
01:44:42,447 --> 01:44:44,648
[SPEAKER_16]: So it could be as three to nine months.

1420
01:44:44,668 --> 01:44:52,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would be certified between September, October, as late as April or May of next year.

1421
01:44:53,752 --> 01:45:04,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but the impression I'm getting is that Councilor Scarpelli is concerned that there may be a deadline here about

1422
01:45:05,353 --> 01:45:05,833
[SPEAKER_11]: free cash.

1423
01:45:05,853 --> 01:45:09,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm confused about the time.

1424
01:45:09,574 --> 01:45:14,956
[SPEAKER_16]: If an appropriation of free cash is not made by June 30th, it cannot be made until free cash is then certified.

1425
01:45:15,036 --> 01:45:19,177
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not done before June 30th, it cannot then be made until up to?

1426
01:45:19,537 --> 01:45:21,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Up until certification, correct.

1427
01:45:21,177 --> 01:45:21,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

1428
01:45:23,698 --> 01:45:24,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Further discussion?

1429
01:45:26,179 --> 01:45:27,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1430
01:45:27,159 --> 01:45:28,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1431
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,420
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, this is,

1432
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:37,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate for my fellow colleagues to help me express what I've been hearing.

1433
01:45:38,153 --> 01:45:44,096
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not going to get into what was said earlier, because I think that that's why we're here.

1434
01:45:44,717 --> 01:45:50,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the communications that I received from residents with the

1435
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:58,425
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, the discussions of rent control and the, you know, the 2% tax.

1436
01:45:58,465 --> 01:46:02,367
[SPEAKER_21]: They're talking about, you know, the registry.

1437
01:46:02,788 --> 01:46:05,249
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we're talking about what the mayor has presented.

1438
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:12,834
[SPEAKER_21]: What she said was a 2.5% override, which by the way, publicly, I will tell you, I'm not opposed to that.

1439
01:46:13,335 --> 01:46:14,776
[SPEAKER_21]: She talked about debt exclusions.

1440
01:46:15,396 --> 01:46:16,337
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not opposed to that.

1441
01:46:17,077 --> 01:46:18,118
[SPEAKER_21]: I publicly say that.

1442
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:23,722
[SPEAKER_21]: I was one of the only Councilors that brought a debt exclusion to this body that they've never done it before.

1443
01:46:24,823 --> 01:46:25,744
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was voted down.

1444
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:29,047
[SPEAKER_21]: So I understand this process we need to follow.

1445
01:46:29,887 --> 01:46:35,612
[SPEAKER_21]: But what comes to mind is I've said it over and over again.

1446
01:46:35,632 --> 01:46:37,113
[SPEAKER_21]: And we heard it tonight.

1447
01:46:37,874 --> 01:46:39,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Until we exhaust

1448
01:46:39,932 --> 01:46:52,951
[SPEAKER_21]: until we exhaust everything in our pockets that we can show that we're not making mistakes and just being reactionary on taxation.

1449
01:46:54,059 --> 01:46:58,263
[SPEAKER_21]: because I've identified many, many different options that the mayor hasn't.

1450
01:46:58,363 --> 01:46:59,624
[SPEAKER_21]: I've met with the building department.

1451
01:46:59,964 --> 01:47:02,266
[SPEAKER_21]: There are no permits out there for any sort of development.

1452
01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:06,349
[SPEAKER_21]: And when I say development, I speak of the development that everybody talks about.

1453
01:47:06,369 --> 01:47:09,131
[SPEAKER_21]: We just had a conversation about it, about affordable housing.

1454
01:47:09,832 --> 01:47:12,614
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor lost 600 affordable housing units.

1455
01:47:13,395 --> 01:47:17,138
[SPEAKER_21]: But more importantly, she lost a huge tax bracket.

1456
01:47:17,498 --> 01:47:22,042
[SPEAKER_21]: She lost a huge, between 3 to 5 million, just in one building.

1457
01:47:23,925 --> 01:47:27,826
[SPEAKER_21]: for permits and fees, one building, and look who we are.

1458
01:47:28,046 --> 01:47:29,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Look at the problems we're having right now.

1459
01:47:30,907 --> 01:47:36,989
[SPEAKER_21]: So this tactic by the mayor, by putting this out there, is something quick and easy for us.

1460
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:38,669
[SPEAKER_21]: She's done nothing for five years, honestly.

1461
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,930
[SPEAKER_21]: The Beer Hall is her claim to fame.

1462
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:43,411
[SPEAKER_21]: We really haven't moved the city forward at all.

1463
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:45,591
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're not bringing new revenue at all.

1464
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:54,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so now what I'm getting to my point very simply is this, I didn't, I wouldn't support a rainy day account.

1465
01:47:56,763 --> 01:48:04,466
[SPEAKER_21]: But as I look at the options now, and the options I see have to be really expressed and understood.

1466
01:48:05,806 --> 01:48:12,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Because a lot of people that have come to me, they're not against working together for an override.

1467
01:48:12,809 --> 01:48:15,870
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not against working together for a debt exclusion.

1468
01:48:16,906 --> 01:48:19,307
[SPEAKER_21]: but they want the data to prove it.

1469
01:48:20,068 --> 01:48:22,129
[SPEAKER_21]: They wanna see, are we doing it right?

1470
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:28,112
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't just put out a tax, just a tax, just to cover your keister, because that's what she's doing.

1471
01:48:28,973 --> 01:48:39,839
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that's your agenda, because you've told us this, but the bottom line is, let's listen to what that last caller said, Councilor Bears, the other night, because I think that's what brought this forward in my mind.

1472
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:41,320
[SPEAKER_21]: She asked you,

1473
01:48:43,086 --> 01:48:48,148
[SPEAKER_21]: She asked you, Mr. President, what if the override doesn't pass?

1474
01:48:49,528 --> 01:48:50,188
[SPEAKER_21]: What if it doesn't?

1475
01:48:50,348 --> 01:48:54,090
[SPEAKER_21]: And you said, right, it's going to devastate our school department.

1476
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:55,910
[SPEAKER_21]: The vote is in November.

1477
01:48:56,710 --> 01:49:00,332
[SPEAKER_21]: If it feels, it affects our kids.

1478
01:49:01,252 --> 01:49:02,432
[SPEAKER_21]: It affects our teachers.

1479
01:49:03,132 --> 01:49:04,153
[SPEAKER_21]: It affects our community.

1480
01:49:05,322 --> 01:49:13,637
[SPEAKER_21]: And even if it's a 1% chance that that override would fail, are we willing to gamble our students' educational process for this?

1481
01:49:16,297 --> 01:49:35,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, we can look at, as a council, bringing forth the rainy day account that the mayor asked for, we appropriate it correctly, we earmark that money, and everything goes level funding to schools, and maybe she can't do the Freedom Way for another year.

1482
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:48,162
[SPEAKER_21]: But at least that now brings two groups, and that's what it is right now, the people that don't want Proposition 2.5 override, and people that do want the Proposition override.

1483
01:49:48,822 --> 01:49:59,607
[SPEAKER_21]: But what we can do is take that time to sit together and probably, because I know Councilor Bears said it, there's a finance group that's been working since last April, I believe he said.

1484
01:50:00,546 --> 01:50:15,132
[SPEAKER_21]: with the mayor, I'm sorry, September, the mayor, the chief of staff, Councilor Bears, Council President Bears, Council Vice President Collins, and school committee member, Jenny Graham, excuse me, Vice Chair Graham.

1485
01:50:15,152 --> 01:50:17,172
[SPEAKER_21]: So the five of them have been working on this.

1486
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:20,974
[SPEAKER_21]: And the question that everybody's been saying is, well,

1487
01:50:22,162 --> 01:50:23,523
[SPEAKER_21]: What have they worked on?

1488
01:50:23,543 --> 01:50:27,267
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know Councilor Bears said, when it's time, they'll put everything out.

1489
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:30,410
[SPEAKER_21]: But for right now, we don't have that time to wait and put it out there.

1490
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:43,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Because right now, are we willing to gamble our students' future next year on a possibility of this divide not making it happen?

1491
01:50:44,855 --> 01:50:50,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I know I got people emailing me saying that something went out on a social media site and shame on you, George Scarpelli.

1492
01:50:51,621 --> 01:50:52,362
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm one person.

1493
01:50:53,983 --> 01:50:54,744
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm one person.

1494
01:50:55,985 --> 01:51:02,911
[SPEAKER_21]: But as I read it, the question was, is this a fair tactic by the school committee and the mayor?

1495
01:51:03,292 --> 01:51:03,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course it is.

1496
01:51:05,213 --> 01:51:05,894
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course it is.

1497
01:51:06,414 --> 01:51:08,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there were no other avenue presented.

1498
01:51:09,551 --> 01:51:10,931
[SPEAKER_21]: There was only one avenue.

1499
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,512
[SPEAKER_21]: We did nothing for five years.

1500
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:22,215
[SPEAKER_21]: On June 20th of 2023, the budget meeting, I sat here and said, you're going to destroy our community.

1501
01:51:22,515 --> 01:51:28,077
[SPEAKER_21]: We are going to be in financial ruins if you pass this budget just because you want to get elected.

1502
01:51:28,857 --> 01:51:33,718
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to use ARPA money, which by the way, which by the way, I use ARPA money.

1503
01:51:34,058 --> 01:51:35,299
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're told specifically,

1504
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:39,212
[SPEAKER_21]: do not use ARPA money unless it's sustainable.

1505
01:51:39,712 --> 01:51:48,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, our mayor took that money and the ESSA money, and the school committee did, and they've level funded a budget just to get elected because she didn't want a black eye.

1506
01:51:48,977 --> 01:51:49,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's say what it is.

1507
01:51:50,618 --> 01:51:56,241
[SPEAKER_21]: But here we are today now, here we are today ready to gamble on our children's future.

1508
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:59,984
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's not a scare tactic, that's legitimate.

1509
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:02,185
[SPEAKER_21]: If the override does not pass,

1510
01:52:03,783 --> 01:52:09,590
[SPEAKER_21]: then quote unquote, our schools will be devastated with layoffs.

1511
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:14,776
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're gonna hurt teachers, we're gonna hurt children, and we're gonna destroy this community.

1512
01:52:15,657 --> 01:52:17,739
[SPEAKER_21]: So I implore my fellow Councilors to please.

1513
01:52:19,312 --> 01:52:20,713
[SPEAKER_21]: follow.

1514
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:35,509
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's put the motion through that we ask the mayor to bring through a rainy day account that we appropriate the funds needed to level fund the school budget and make sure that everybody is whole because that was another question.

1515
01:52:35,869 --> 01:52:39,273
[SPEAKER_21]: I got a phone call from school committees where they were astonished the other day that

1516
01:52:39,793 --> 01:52:44,778
[SPEAKER_21]: that the chair, I think, was astonished because her answer was, no, everything goes back to the same.

1517
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:51,284
[SPEAKER_21]: And the superintendent sat in front of us the other day, and I've got calls from teachers, I've got calls, that's not true, they said.

1518
01:52:52,105 --> 01:52:54,988
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, it's manipulating for what they should do.

1519
01:52:55,869 --> 01:52:57,530
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not being transparent enough.

1520
01:52:58,251 --> 01:53:02,735
[SPEAKER_21]: So I please, I implore you to let's, let's

1521
01:53:03,874 --> 01:53:17,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's focus on free cash, level fund this budget, let's build on our children's future, and then work on if we really need an override and debt exclusions, and then work together as a community to make sure it passes.

1522
01:53:17,898 --> 01:53:18,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1523
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:19,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1524
01:53:19,098 --> 01:53:20,238
[SPEAKER_16]: So we all agree.

1525
01:53:21,959 --> 01:53:25,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We all agree that the schools need five to seven more million dollars.

1526
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,180
[SPEAKER_16]: So we talk about the facts.

1527
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:27,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the facts.

1528
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,520
[SPEAKER_16]: We all agree.

1529
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we appropriate them for free cash.

1530
01:53:31,954 --> 01:53:33,255
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just delaying the inevitable.

1531
01:53:34,136 --> 01:53:35,317
[SPEAKER_16]: We won't have any next year.

1532
01:53:35,537 --> 01:53:46,105
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just postponing the devastation until June 30th, 2020, doing exactly what we said we don't want to do, which is use one-time funds to, for whatever reason, have the thing.

1533
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:47,726
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're having the same argument here.

1534
01:53:47,746 --> 01:53:49,828
[SPEAKER_16]: We agree that the schools need $5 to $7 million.

1535
01:53:50,288 --> 01:53:53,611
[SPEAKER_16]: If we appropriate free cash, then we postpone the discussion for a year.

1536
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:57,114
[SPEAKER_16]: If we actually raise the money, then we have it in perpetuity.

1536
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:04,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Collins. Vice President Collins. Thank you. Vice President Collins. I recognize Vice President Collins. 

1536
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let George go and then I'll speak.

1536
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
[SPEAKER_16]: I recognize Vice President Collins. Vice President Collins. 

1536
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Shame on you. Shame on you. You're just a bully with a gavel. You're a bully with a gavel. You're out of line.

1536
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not true sir. You are literally... you're lying to the public.

1537
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
[SPEAKER_21]: You let me answer. I have the right to point of information. 

1537
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,000
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't. There's nothing. Order. Order.

1538
01:54:28,288 --> 01:54:36,475
[SPEAKER_21]: You're willing to gamble on kids' future on an override instead of looking at real money that our residents, that the mayor mismanaged and left out.

1537
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually not.

1539
01:54:36,495 --> 01:54:37,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to recess?

1540
01:54:38,296 --> 01:54:38,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Bottom line.

1541
01:54:40,037 --> 01:54:40,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to recess?

1542
01:54:41,018 --> 01:54:41,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to recess.

1543
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:42,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to recess.

1544
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lemingng, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1545
01:54:44,261 --> 01:54:44,861
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1546
01:54:45,101 --> 01:54:47,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1547
01:54:47,263 --> 01:54:47,904
[SPEAKER_16]: 15 minute recess.

1548
01:54:55,962 --> 01:54:58,484
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to reconvene, seconded by?

1549
01:54:58,504 --> 01:54:58,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1550
01:54:59,264 --> 01:55:00,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Lemingng.

1551
01:55:00,225 --> 01:55:00,966
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1552
01:55:01,286 --> 01:55:01,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1553
01:55:01,626 --> 01:55:02,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1554
01:55:02,206 --> 01:55:03,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1555
01:55:03,287 --> 01:55:04,028
[SPEAKER_16]: President Bears.

1556
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:08,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lemingng, then Vice President Collins.

1557
01:55:09,532 --> 01:55:14,975
[SPEAKER_19]: President Bears, I'd like to, because the amendment made it very clear this is a financial paper, I'd like to invoke Rule 21.

1558
01:55:17,097 --> 01:55:24,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lemingng has invoked Rule 21 of the Medford City Council, which gives any city council the right to table any financial paper until the next regular meeting.

1559
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:27,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper is tabled.

1560
01:55:30,424 --> 01:55:32,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Public participation. To participate out of zoom.

1561
01:55:32,545 --> 01:55:33,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Please email ahurtubise...

1562
01:55:34,347 --> 01:55:37,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1563
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:44,375
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can't, we can't move forward and discuss it and the mayor can't move forward to look at the process.

1564
01:55:44,975 --> 01:55:46,696
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a rule 21.

1565
01:55:46,837 --> 01:55:51,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Any financial paper placed before the council has to move on the table for until the next meeting.

1566
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:52,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1567
01:55:53,254 --> 01:55:53,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1568
01:55:53,654 --> 01:55:54,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Public participation.

1569
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:58,698
[SPEAKER_16]: To participate outside of Zoom, please email ahurtubise@medfordma.gov.

1570
01:55:58,818 --> 01:55:59,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1571
01:56:02,681 --> 01:56:03,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the microphone on?

1572
01:56:06,043 --> 01:56:06,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1573
01:56:06,483 --> 01:56:06,944
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

1574
01:56:06,964 --> 01:56:07,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

1575
01:56:07,284 --> 01:56:08,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1576
01:56:08,865 --> 01:56:10,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaston Fiori, 61 Stignero.

1577
01:56:11,147 --> 01:56:16,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I just would like to manifest my opposition to any initiative for the Proposition 2.5 override.

1578
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:28,883
[SPEAKER_09]: When the government increases taxes, it ultimately takes money away from individuals who could spend or invest it more efficiently.

1579
01:56:29,443 --> 01:56:31,004
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a fundamental principle.

1580
01:56:31,564 --> 01:56:36,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Individuals can make better decisions with their money than a central authority can.

1581
01:56:36,986 --> 01:56:40,087
[SPEAKER_09]: First, consider the impact on property owners.

1582
01:56:40,707 --> 01:56:49,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Higher taxes could drive people away, particularly those on fixed incomes or with limited means, reducing the overall attractiveness of the city.

1583
01:56:50,899 --> 01:56:58,842
[SPEAKER_09]: This can lead to reduction in property values and a smaller tax base over time, the very opposite of what the government hopes to achieve.

1584
01:56:59,743 --> 01:57:06,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, the argument is often made that projects such as new schools and infrastructure are essential for public welfare.

1585
01:57:07,386 --> 01:57:12,889
[SPEAKER_09]: This is true, but one must ask whether raising taxes is the optimal solution.

1586
01:57:13,829 --> 01:57:28,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Alternative methods such as public-private partnerships, leveraging private investments, and utilizing existing resources more effectively might achieve the same goals without imposing higher taxes on residents.

1587
01:57:29,571 --> 01:57:33,195
[SPEAKER_09]: The core issue here is one of economic freedom and efficiency.

1588
01:57:33,955 --> 01:57:41,403
[SPEAKER_09]: By significantly raising real estate taxes, the government imposes a burden on its residents and potentially stifles economic activity.

1589
01:57:42,043 --> 01:57:46,908
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no assurance that the benefits of any infrastructure projects will outweigh these costs.

1590
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:53,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, the government should consider more innovative and less burdensome ways to fund these initiatives.

1591
01:57:54,491 --> 01:58:02,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Some alternatives that the city government should consider instead of raising real estate taxes are one, economic growth.

1592
01:58:03,137 --> 01:58:11,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Implement a multifaceted campaign to stimulate economic growth, thereby expanding the tax base and increasing overall revenue.

1593
01:58:11,783 --> 01:58:14,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, public-private partnerships.

1594
01:58:14,965 --> 01:58:22,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Collaborate with private companies to fund and manage infrastructure projects, sharing both risks and benefits.

1595
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Three,

1596
01:58:24,332 --> 01:58:24,932
[SPEAKER_09]: User fees.

1597
01:58:25,693 --> 01:58:38,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Introduce or increase fees for specific services, such as water and sewer, waste management, parking, or recreational facilities, ensuring that users directly pay for the services they consume.

1598
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:48,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, municipal bonds, issue bonds to raise capital for infrastructure projects, spreading the cost over time and across current and future beneficiaries.

1599
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:59,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Five, prioritizing spending, reallocate funds from less critical areas, tightening the budget can free up resources to pay for infrastructure projects.

1600
01:58:59,904 --> 01:59:07,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Six, improving efficiency, streamline government operations to cut costs, reallocating savings to our infrastructure needs.

1601
01:59:08,108 --> 01:59:17,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven, selling city assets, evaluate and sell underutilized public assets, such as land or buildings to generate revenue.

1602
01:59:18,892 --> 01:59:24,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight, lease revenues, lease public assets, or increase their efficiency to generate additional income streams.

1603
01:59:25,238 --> 01:59:34,026
[SPEAKER_09]: The message just described can mitigate the need for a Proposition 2.5 override in order to maintain and enhance city infrastructure and services.

1604
01:59:34,187 --> 01:59:35,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1605
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address record, please.

1606
01:59:41,825 --> 01:59:44,866
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm Anthony Geehan, 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Levenster, Massachusetts.

1607
01:59:44,886 --> 01:59:46,967
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm the president of the Medford Teachers Association.

1608
01:59:47,988 --> 02:00:01,253
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm here to speak on the use of the $6 million, wherever it may come from, be it free cash or be it from other revenue streams that you all are aware of that I'm not.

1609
02:00:02,054 --> 02:00:04,495
[SPEAKER_34]: I just wanted to push the need for expediency on this.

1610
02:00:07,495 --> 02:00:15,542
[SPEAKER_34]: As we are getting to the end of the school year, as our seniors are getting ready to walk this week, I have a lot of members coming to me and asking if they should look for new jobs.

1611
02:00:16,465 --> 02:00:24,648
[SPEAKER_34]: And I have to tell them that we're in a holding pattern at the moment, and that they have to do what's best for themselves and their families.

1612
02:00:24,928 --> 02:00:29,250
[SPEAKER_34]: And that breaks my heart, because what I want to tell them is, no, stay, build with us.

1613
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:31,851
[SPEAKER_34]: The city has a lot of hope.

1614
02:00:32,371 --> 02:00:35,372
[SPEAKER_34]: This school system has a lot of hope, and that hope comes from the teachers.

1615
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:41,554
[SPEAKER_34]: I think we spent a lot of time at the last school committee meeting celebrating a lot of great things at these schools.

1616
02:00:41,654 --> 02:00:43,215
[SPEAKER_34]: But as I said at that school committee meeting,

1617
02:00:43,815 --> 02:00:49,798
[SPEAKER_34]: a lot of those things come from teachers either taking small stipends to do them or not taking anything to do them.

1618
02:00:50,038 --> 02:00:56,742
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think looking at these cuts, looking at the loss of the teachers that are willing to do this is going to have a huge effect.

1619
02:00:57,042 --> 02:01:00,244
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would ask that again, we know the number.

1620
02:01:01,553 --> 02:01:04,894
[SPEAKER_34]: whatever avenue needs to go down to get this number is what's needed.

1621
02:01:05,054 --> 02:01:21,020
[SPEAKER_34]: And I want to remind everybody, this isn't to progress, this isn't to build anything new, this is to steady on and to make sure that students and teachers and admin and secretaries and nurses know what's happening in school year 24 and 25 because

1622
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:29,505
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a short window and it's a scary prospect to have to go into June, not understanding what our schools are gonna look like next year.

1623
02:01:29,846 --> 02:01:37,491
[SPEAKER_34]: So I ask you all come together to work as best you can to use your collective knowledge and to get that money for our schools.

1624
02:01:38,112 --> 02:01:38,912
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1625
02:01:40,554 --> 02:01:46,918
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just wanna say, Mr. Geehan, for myself and Vice President Collins as well,

1626
02:01:47,881 --> 02:01:48,501
[SPEAKER_16]: We know the number.

1627
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:53,362
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to find the short-term solution and the long-term sustainable solution.

1628
02:01:53,382 --> 02:01:56,523
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to get that as quickly as possible.

1629
02:01:56,603 --> 02:02:01,384
[SPEAKER_16]: We're working with the person who gets to make that decision, and that that's what is taking time right now.

1630
02:02:02,725 --> 02:02:04,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Our goal is to get it to as quickly as possible.

1631
02:02:05,005 --> 02:02:12,007
[SPEAKER_16]: My hopes are that the city, the public, the council, the teachers unit, and everybody will have a budget presented to them by the end of this week.

1632
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:15,668
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we'll know more about what that means in the short-term and the long-term.

1633
02:02:16,331 --> 02:02:22,248
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my understanding of the timeline right now, but we are working diligently to try to get these funds to stabilize the school funding.

1634
02:02:23,143 --> 02:02:25,044
[SPEAKER_34]: I appreciate that, and I appreciate all of you.

1635
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:28,385
[SPEAKER_34]: I know no one here has stood up and objected to level funding this school.

1636
02:02:29,066 --> 02:02:32,527
[SPEAKER_34]: And I've not heard anyone step up and say, we don't need to level fund the school.

1637
02:02:33,148 --> 02:02:35,269
[SPEAKER_34]: It is a necessity, it is a bare minimum.

1638
02:02:35,549 --> 02:02:45,814
[SPEAKER_34]: And as I said, I employ you from all of my members, my over 500 members to, like I said, as expedient as possible so we can understand where we stand.

1639
02:02:46,314 --> 02:02:46,674
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you all.

1640
02:02:46,694 --> 02:02:50,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1641
02:02:52,028 --> 02:02:57,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Matthew Page, Lieberman and 15 Canal Street.

1642
02:02:57,149 --> 02:02:59,210
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really apologizing right now.

1643
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:03,571
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to clarify, is this really open public comment or are we still on resolution?

1644
02:03:03,631 --> 02:03:04,652
[SPEAKER_16]: This is open public comment.

1645
02:03:04,932 --> 02:03:06,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good, thank you.

1646
02:03:06,832 --> 02:03:15,995
[SPEAKER_18]: The first thing is, earlier tonight when Rick Caraviello received his award, I think it would have been nice if there were an opportunity for people to come up here and also thank him.

1647
02:03:17,635 --> 02:03:19,316
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that maybe about a decade ago,

1648
02:03:20,443 --> 02:03:23,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Rick called me up back at like 9:30 at night.

1649
02:03:23,907 --> 02:03:25,349
[SPEAKER_18]: I may have called him like in the afternoon.

1650
02:03:25,369 --> 02:03:26,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I extremely appreciated that.

1651
02:03:27,732 --> 02:03:30,375
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the kind of stuff that really does not happen a lot.

1652
02:03:30,775 --> 02:03:34,079
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some people I've emailed through the years I've never gotten a response from.

1653
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:36,441
[SPEAKER_18]: What Rick did is exceptional.

1654
02:03:37,402 --> 02:03:51,507
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing is I heard earlier from someone in the public the idea of selling public property again, and I just want to let it be known anytime anybody introduces that noxious idea, I'll be up here again saying it's not going to happen.

1655
02:03:51,548 --> 02:03:52,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1656
02:03:52,488 --> 02:03:52,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1657
02:03:52,868 --> 02:03:54,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1658
02:03:56,322 --> 02:03:57,843
[SPEAKER_07]: William Navarre 108 Medford Street.

1659
02:03:58,324 --> 02:04:07,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I also wanted to speak on that last point, selling public property was one of the suggestions, leasing public property was another suggestion.

1660
02:04:07,431 --> 02:04:17,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to point out those are very different, because as our city grows, as it gets richer, think about over the last 20 years, how much more desirable living in the city has become.

1661
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:21,621
[SPEAKER_07]: As we invest to make our squares better,

1662
02:04:22,803 --> 02:04:28,139
[SPEAKER_07]: As we hopefully fix the T, somebody fixes the T, etc.

1663
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:29,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Living.

1664
02:04:31,967 --> 02:04:39,371
[SPEAKER_07]: near our squares, in our central areas, near those parking lots there, is going to get more and more valuable.

1665
02:04:39,951 --> 02:04:44,414
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll use that as an example.

1666
02:04:44,974 --> 02:04:58,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You lease that land, okay, you get money now, and then we do all these investments, hopefully we solve a lot of problems in the next 60 years, and then the city gets the land again, and can start all over again.

1667
02:04:58,741 --> 02:04:59,441
[SPEAKER_07]: You sell that,

1668
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:08,203
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody else is going to profit off of the hard work of making our squares, the T, our town better, our city better.

1669
02:05:08,643 --> 02:05:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna make that very clear, there's a really big distinction.

1670
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:18,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Leasing is very, very good idea, less enthusiastic about selling.

1671
02:05:19,046 --> 02:05:19,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks a lot.

1672
02:05:20,406 --> 02:05:20,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1673
02:05:22,767 --> 02:05:24,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Gonna go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1674
02:05:24,707 --> 02:05:26,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

1675
02:05:31,294 --> 02:05:33,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Castagnetti, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

1676
02:05:33,135 --> 02:05:34,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1677
02:05:35,896 --> 02:05:37,197
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm unmuted, I think.

1678
02:05:37,937 --> 02:05:38,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1679
02:05:39,237 --> 02:05:42,059
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you, Council President.

1680
02:05:42,079 --> 02:05:57,585
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to thank and commend whoever is responsible to get the Crystal Campbell Boston Marathon Fountain up and running in front of the Senior Citizen Center on Riverside Ave.

1681
02:05:58,026 --> 02:06:00,607
[SPEAKER_24]: It was a pleasant surprise after many years.

1682
02:06:01,989 --> 02:06:06,191
[SPEAKER_24]: My question is, how come it's not pumping water today?

1683
02:06:08,412 --> 02:06:12,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have an answer to that question, but we can look into it.

1684
02:06:12,653 --> 02:06:19,716
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be nice, because it hasn't been pumping water for many, many, many days.

1685
02:06:19,736 --> 02:06:21,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1686
02:06:22,638 --> 02:06:23,178
[SPEAKER_24]: You're welcome.

1687
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1688
02:06:32,506 --> 02:06:33,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

1689
02:06:36,112 --> 02:06:39,557
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1690
02:06:39,597 --> 02:06:40,238
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1691
02:06:40,819 --> 02:06:41,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1692
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:42,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
