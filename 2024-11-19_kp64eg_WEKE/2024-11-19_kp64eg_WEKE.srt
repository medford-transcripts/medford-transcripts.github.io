[SPEAKER_16]: Paulette, you've always been

[SPEAKER_16]: that person that sets us straight.

92
00:04:56,008 --> 00:05:03,911

[SPEAKER_16]: And she was always, you were always the most calm person in the room and someone we always admired and looked to for guidance when it came to your experience.

[SPEAKER_23]: And I remember when we first came on.

101
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:11,782

00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:45,572
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we can, Paula, can you come on up and accept this plaque on behalf of the city council?

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,502
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to tell you, I'm not here to receive a plaque tonight.

112
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:15,327
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, what I'm here is to commend my fellow elected officials who are leaving their posts.

113
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:18,996
[SPEAKER_22]: very shortly, Michael Marks and John Falco.

114
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:23,858
[SPEAKER_22]: I've had the opportunity over the years to work with many fine individuals.

115
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,880
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know, sometimes we agreed and sometimes we didn't.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,582
[SPEAKER_22]: But we always had found some place to have common ground.

117
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:33,304
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's so important in today's world.

118
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:37,486
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to thank you, Michael, for the years that I served with you.

119
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:38,827
[SPEAKER_22]: You were such a kid then.

120
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:40,877
[SPEAKER_22]: were.

121
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:53,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And john, it was such a pleasure to serve with you for the years to watch you both go on to the city council, and we're going to miss you very very much so thank you so much, and my.

122
00:07:53,866 --> 00:08:01,671
[SPEAKER_22]: The one thing that I think every elected official, whether we agree or disagree, there is a common bond between us, because of the years we've learned.

123
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:08,633
[SPEAKER_22]: to go out to campaign every two years and to put your families through that.

124
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,333
[SPEAKER_22]: And you both have such wonderful, wonderful families.

125
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:22,395
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was really pleasure of mine to watch, to know when they were born and to watch them grow, to graduate from high school, to go on to college.

126
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,215
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's really been a pleasure.

127
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:25,796
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you both.

128
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,556
[SPEAKER_22]: And George, thank you for your kind words.

129
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:28,856
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you.

130
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:29,936
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate it.

131
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,997
[SPEAKER_22]: And I appreciate my fellow Councilors.

132
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:46,553
[SPEAKER_13]: President, Councilor Marks.

133
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

134
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:56,315
[SPEAKER_15]: It was an honor and a privilege to serve with Paulette Vander Kloof for the six years I was on the school committee.

135
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Paulette, don't go anywhere.

136
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:09,058
[SPEAKER_15]: During that period of time, Mr. President, the school committee ushered in what we refer to still after 20 something years, the brand new schools in Medford.

137
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:15,026
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was a very trying time as a member of Vanderkloot remembers.

138
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,648
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a lot of time and effort put into that.

139
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:29,497
[SPEAKER_15]: And the one thing, Mr. President, I do remember is Paulette Vanderkloot gave birth to her daughter on election day.

140
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:30,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that not correct?

141
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:37,523
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, being a politician, I wanted to try to outdo Paulette.

142
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:41,609
[SPEAKER_15]: And I missed it by about six hours.

143
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,812
[SPEAKER_15]: My wife gave birth to our twins the night before the election.

144
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:48,373
[SPEAKER_15]: And I still resent that, Paul.

145
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how you held off.

146
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:54,196
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what food you were eating, but you did a great job holding off.

147
00:09:54,576 --> 00:10:01,920
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other point I have to mention, Mr. President, that I still resent to this day, is that Paulette Van der Kloot stole

148
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,602
[SPEAKER_15]: George Scarpelli's slogan.

149
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Give a hoot vote, Scarpelli was the original slogan.

150
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was stolen by Paulette.

151
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,769
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope someday she recognizes that, Mr. President.

152
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:19,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

153
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:23,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

154
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator, Denato has a citation for you also.

155
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd like to come back up here?

156
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:34,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, see?

157
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:38,239
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all the ones you missed last night.

158
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President and members of the council.

159
00:10:45,925 --> 00:11:00,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Paulette, on behalf of the delegation, state delegation, state representative Farber, I believe who's your state representative in your district, and he regrets that he was not able to be here tonight because of another engagement.

160
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me thank, well, we know each other personally.

161
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,246
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent many of the Fourth of July together.

162
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:18,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dismay of this community is going to be that we don't have a Paulette Vanderkoop.

163
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:32,370
[SPEAKER_02]: With her knowledge of what was going on in the public school systems from the stages of the beginning of what this school was all about, and all the new schools that were there, Paulette Vanderkoop was in the forefront.

164
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,040
[SPEAKER_02]: of making it happen.

165
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:41,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And slogan that you have, you know, give a hoot and both of, I don't believe it was his.

166
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:47,726
[SPEAKER_22]: No, give a hoot was so popular, he tried to take it over.

167
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:53,089
[SPEAKER_02]: But on behalf of the state delegation, I present you a citation.

168
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna read it, because you're giving it 1,400 of those away.

169
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's from our heart for all of the work that you did as a member of the school committee,

170
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:11,151
[SPEAKER_02]: a dedicated member of the school committee, one who made a major mark in education in our community, and you'll never be forgotten for it.

171
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:11,712
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless you.

172
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:12,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

173
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much.

174
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:19,878
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the problems with masks is nobody can see me smile, and I just want you to know I'm printing ear to ear, so thank you very much.

175
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:27,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Representative.

176
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:32,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And Paula, with age comes wisdom.

177
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:36,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've brought a lot of wisdom to the city council over the years.

178
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank you for your years of service to the city.

179
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:46,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I may just, I was grateful to be able to be here last night.

180
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:53,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's some from so many of the folks that you served with and worked with over your years.

181
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:58,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was able to say to you last night, but I think it's worth saying to the public,

182
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:05,933
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was able to grow up and go to schools that you built and the school system that you built.

183
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:11,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never known a Medford that didn't have a Paulette Van der Kloot on the school committee.

184
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:23,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just incredibly grateful for the service that you provided and for the education that I was able to receive, I think with a big portion of credit going to you.

185
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:24,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

186
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:25,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

187
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:26,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

188
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:29,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and through you to Mr. Van der Kloot.

189
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Paulette, thank you very much for your service.

190
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to your family for allowing us the opportunity to have you for all these years.

191
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:43,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You've done a great job, and you know, the proof is in the pudding, the results are there.

192
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:56,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really want to wish you the best of luck in your retirement, and we hope to see you around the community as a very active participant engaged in the ongoings of what's happening in Medford moving forward.

193
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember you being the first progressive.

194
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:10,771
[SPEAKER_04]: As a young kid getting involved in politics Paulette was considered the first progressive and mentioned if I remember correctly, and I wish you all the best of luck Paulette so thank you very much for all you've done for us.

195
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:12,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

196
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:13,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

197
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:13,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

198
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:16,212
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could just briefly, I just want to say a few words.

199
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:32,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting on a baby myself and mine does not have the impeccable timing of other elected officials.

200
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:43,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person, Paulette, but I just wanted to thank you for your advocacy, your advice, the time that you've given me personally, and of course the city and just everything you've done.

201
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:49,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they say life is what 90% showing up and showing up for 32 years, that's dedication and service to the city.

202
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:52,518
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to add my thanks and congratulations.

203
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:56,420
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy your time not being in the chambers, all of the time.

204
00:14:59,463 --> 00:14:59,804

00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:25,599

249
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:36,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Just as some initial comments, I believe we obviously have discussed these positions at two prior meetings.

250
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,888
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe we share a common vision and goal.

251
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:49,914
[SPEAKER_21]: That is to develop a comprehensive ARPA spending plan which is built on a solid foundation so that the city can maximize its federal and state aid opportunities.

252
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:58,837
[SPEAKER_21]: We see that solid foundation being inclusive of the City Council's input, the community's input, and the input of key positions within the city.

253
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,227
[SPEAKER_21]: The positions before the City Council this evening are the bare minimum positions that are necessary to begin that planning effort in a sustainable way.

254
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:11,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Without these key positions, we will be under-resourced when it comes

255
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:15,658
[SPEAKER_21]: to reaching for more resources and opportunities at the federal and state level.

256
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:22,626
[SPEAKER_21]: There were several questions, in fact, several statements made at the Committee of the Whole meeting last week on the subject.

257
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:30,475
[SPEAKER_21]: We did take those comments to heart and are prepared to provide further information to the degree we are able to at this early stage on each.

258
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:49,350
[SPEAKER_21]: We sincerely ask for your support this evening as anything short of approval will have a negative impact on the city's ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic surge we're currently experiencing and will negatively impact the city's ability to maximize funding in this pandemic when resources are the biggest constraining factor.

259
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,051
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your consideration.

260
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

261
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:56,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion on this before we take a vote?

262
00:18:58,195 --> 00:18:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

263
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:09,041
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of how we're going to do this, Mr. President, what will we be doing will be going through each amendment will go for each one each member separate, are we going to discuss these amendments or just go.

264
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:14,729
[SPEAKER_07]: We discussed them, I think we discussed them last week in Committee of the Whole meeting.

265
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,931
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's any discussion on them, we'll entertain that just as we get to each one.

266
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:32,337
[SPEAKER_04]: The only concern I have is which positions are presently filled, which positions are filled and will be expiring for kids, after the Kids Act funding expires, which positions will go unfunded.

267
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:34,698
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, is amendment not funded?

268
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a concern?

269
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:51,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'd be happy to, Mr. President, and through you to Vice President Knight, I also would ask that the Health Director, Marianne O'Connor, jump in if I miss anyone.

270
00:19:52,213 --> 00:20:00,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment G, I'm sorry, Amendment F, the Economic Development Planner, I believe

271
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:16,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Planning Development Sustainability Director Alicia Hunt, who's online this evening, mentioned at one of the prior meetings that this position was quasi-filled, so to speak, that we're looking to, we have an existing employee who we would like to transition into this position.

272
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, moving on quickly.

273
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:23,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Amendment K, administrative support for COVID-19.

274
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Way of evasion, Councilor Falco.

275
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:33,596
[SPEAKER_23]: Nina, if I may, you said quasi-filled.

277
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,857
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it filled or is it not filled?

278
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,359
[SPEAKER_21]: The cleanest answer is it's not filled.

279
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,020
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not filled.

280
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:45,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, to be- Let's stick to the clean answers just to get through this.

281
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:47,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we just discuss each amendment?

282
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:54,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we have that question answered as we go through the amendments instead of doing it all at once and then going back?

283
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:55,850
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll start with amendment F.

284
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:02,974
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, the economic development plan, do we have a motion on the table for the economic development plan?

285
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to table, Mr. President.

286
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:09,435
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion by Councilor Bears to table the economic development plan, seconded by?

287
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,677
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by?

288
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to table amendment F. We have no, you don't have a second to table that, Councilor Bears.

289
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

290
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair awaits the motion.

291
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:33,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

292
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:34,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

293
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

294
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:40,917
[SPEAKER_07]: On amendment O. We're on amendment F, Councilor Marks.

295
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:41,858
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start with the top.

296
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:42,559
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go right down.

297
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:45,161
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to start at F and we're going to go right to the end.

298
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:48,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll discuss each one as we get to them.

299
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:50,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, but we had a committee of the whole meeting.

300
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:50,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

301
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:53,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Which questions were asked of the administration.

302
00:21:54,591 --> 00:22:00,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we should at least get those questions answered before we go through the whole process again.

303
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:05,299
[SPEAKER_15]: But I had one question regarding frontline workers and first responders.

304
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:18,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were told by the city administration that there may be a salary limitation for those workers to receive APA money.

305
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,731
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was wondering if that question has been answered, Mr. President.

306
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,808
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

307
00:22:25,848 --> 00:22:26,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

308
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:38,633
[SPEAKER_21]: I did look further into this information that's this question that was raised at the committee of the whole meeting, and I had seemed to recall a number and there's actually a lot of guidance.

309
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:45,116
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I'm just going to read very quickly unfortunately there is no straightforward answer as I mentioned, these rules have.

310
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:50,019
[SPEAKER_21]: a tremendous amount of data and information behind them, but I'll make it as quick as possible.

311
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, per the interim final rule issued by the federal government.

312
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:58,645
[SPEAKER_21]: If premium pay would increase a worker's total above 150% of their residing states annual

313
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:17,522
[SPEAKER_21]: average annual wage for all occupants as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, or their residing country's average annual wage as defined by the same Bureau, whichever is higher on an annual basis, and then it goes on.

314
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:25,450
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's calculations that need to occur to determine that so-called minimum that we discussed, Councilor Marks, at the last meeting.

315
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:34,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I'm happy to look further into this as we review again, premium pay and we review all the different categories with the federal funds manager.

316
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:36,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

317
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:45,387
[SPEAKER_15]: So from what I'm hearing tonight, that would not be a reason that frontline workers and first responders would not be able to attain some upper money

318
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:51,696
[SPEAKER_15]: for being on the front lines during the past 22 months of COVID.

319
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,536
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's encouraging to hear.

320
00:23:53,596 --> 00:24:00,658
[SPEAKER_15]: I just hope the administration falls through, Mr. President, taking care of those workers, as I mentioned during the Committee of the Whole meeting.

321
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:05,040
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about workers that work at a convenience store.

322
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,381
[SPEAKER_15]: that were in the front line, Mr. President.

323
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,361
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about workers at stop and shop.

324
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:12,982
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about workers that worked in a doctor's office.

325
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:15,723
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about postal workers.

326
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:19,284
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about police, fire, EMTs.

327
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:34,128
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just hope, Mr. President, with this $49 million the city's receiving from the federal government, that we put our money where our mouth is and take care of those workers, Mr. President, that put their life on the line.

328
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:41,764
[SPEAKER_15]: and put their family's life on the line to make sure we could function as a community and as a society.

329
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:45,725
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would hope the administration steps forward on that, Mr. President.

330
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:53,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Amendment O, as I mentioned, Mr. President, it says that this is a CAF 12, which is the federal funds manager.

331
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:57,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe that it's a CAF 12.

332
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say that's more of a CAF

333
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,448
[SPEAKER_15]: 15, Mr. President, based on that salary.

334
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:14,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know if that's an error that was made by the administration, but if they can also talk to that, Mr. President, I'd be curious.

335
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Nina, can you answer that question?

336
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely, Mr. President.

337
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Marks for the question.

338
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:26,611
[SPEAKER_21]: This actually came to my attention that there may be an error on this item on Monday morning.

339
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:32,772
[SPEAKER_21]: I wrote back to the clerk who was copied on the email

340
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,773
[SPEAKER_21]: It was brought to my attention by the director of veteran services.

341
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,854
[SPEAKER_21]: And I wrote back to the city clerk on this matter.

342
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:46,898
[SPEAKER_21]: I copied the city council president and the city council vice president on this, noting that there was a Scrivener's error indicating that it is a CAF 15.

343
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,800
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is an error that we're being asked to vote on, Mr. President.

344
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we'll change it.

345
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:55,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

346
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,942
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's an important change, Mr. President.

347
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:20,133
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last point, Mr. President, I would like to bring up, and I brought this up during the Committee of the Whole meeting, so I've been very consistent on bringing up this issue, is the fact that we still have department heads in this community, non-union department heads, who for the past 22 months have not received a step raise.

348
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:28,275
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the question was offered by Vice President Knight about whether that's contractual or not and so forth.

349
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:40,125
[SPEAKER_15]: But here we have a number of upper positions, Mr. President, at salaries that far exceed some of our department heads, existing department heads.

350
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:58,781
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a tough pill to swallow when we're asking to bring in new positions, Mr. President, at a higher salary range while existing employees, existing department heads did not get their step raise.

351
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And we heard money was tight, Mr. President.

352
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,184
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we have $49 million of federal funding.

353
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:18,615
[SPEAKER_15]: and we have commitments out there to every non-union department head that they should receive their step raise.

354
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:36,942
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have a real tough time, Mr. President, voting for new positions for ARPA at a higher salary range without taking care of existing employees in this building that have been in here every day fighting through the pandemic.

355
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,804
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's an important distinction, Mr. President.

356
00:27:42,064 --> 00:27:44,506
[SPEAKER_15]: We should take care of the workers we currently have.

357
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:57,093
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I stated at the community hall meeting, if we don't address frontline workers, first responders, as part of this ARPA funding,

358
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:04,097
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we don't take care of city employees, current city employees, I will not support this paper.

359
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:07,078
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care how critical the administration says it is.

360
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:10,980
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been sitting on this paper for the past four months, Mr. President.

361
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,381
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't even have a federal funds manager, someone to oversee all of this.

362
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:20,503
[SPEAKER_15]: They could have put a federal funds manager, the first position on several months back.

363
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we're being told this is critical.

364
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:28,089
[SPEAKER_11]: It's critical because they dropped the ball.

365
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:29,510
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it's critical.

366
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:33,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

367
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:34,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

368
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:35,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

369
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:47,153
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I motion to table amendment F is that there are several positions in here I think many in public health that are currently filled and using cares act funding.

370
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:57,023
[SPEAKER_03]: My preference tonight would be that the council approved those positions so that those those continue to be funded we're moving from one federal funding source the cares act to the another one the ARPA.

371
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the federal funds manager is very important.

372
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:16,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, interested to hear the discussion and get questions answered but that's kind of where I'm coming from on this tonight, you know, we can have further discussion on positions that aren't filled but if there's stuff currently filled using cares act funding, and it's moving over to ARPA, I think we should move forward with that tonight.

373
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:18,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

374
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:19,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

375
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:26,820
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate everybody's hard work on presenting this but, again, I think Council marks brings out some valid points.

376
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:36,007
[SPEAKER_16]: And the first point that I think that business area and has has expressed the beginning and that our community whole meetings is.

377
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:38,034
[SPEAKER_16]: is really a plan.

378
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:52,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm finding this bothersome that we talked about this with traffic and parking, that when we're talking about money and different departments and really not having a plan in place yet and still having a focus group, but that was passed.

379
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:56,285
[SPEAKER_16]: But as this comes through our process here, again, without having

380
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:09,457
[SPEAKER_16]: these positions, and with the shared vision.

381
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:19,650
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how we can support until we know what this this ARPA money is going to encompass, because one of the things that was very clear last week.

382
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:29,138
[SPEAKER_16]: that other department heads weren't involved in these discussions, not to say that these positions right now aren't important.

383
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:35,901
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would tend to maybe agree with Councilor Bears with continuing some of these positions.

384
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:44,385
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think right now, I think Councilor Marks brought it up last week, that this position, Amendment O,

385
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:46,586
[SPEAKER_16]: That should have been presented.

386
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:52,811
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that tonight would probably be the only position that I would even entertain for the fact that we really don't have a plan.

387
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:58,396
[SPEAKER_16]: And this person for this position is the person to help us with that plan.

388
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:10,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, I don't, until we bring everybody to the table and really share a vision, you know, I'm lucky that I work in a community that the city council works with the administration and

389
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:15,784
[SPEAKER_16]: they share each other's visions to get the product to the community.

390
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:20,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not seeing this here and I'm very disappointed, really disheartened actually.

391
00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:24,950
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a lot of money that can do a lot of great things for our community.

392
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:32,915
[SPEAKER_16]: And right now, it seems like what we're getting now with traffic and parking now this paper is

393
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:35,925
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just gonna add things and spend.

394
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:42,407
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when we come down to some important pieces that we all feel that are important, we're gonna be told what?

395
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, we spent all of our ARPA funding.

396
00:31:45,608 --> 00:31:47,688
[SPEAKER_16]: And without a plan, I can't support this.

397
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:48,608
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

398
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

399
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bacow.

400
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:51,669
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

401
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:54,950
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanna share, I agree with my colleagues.

402
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,290
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a major concern.

403
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:03,612
[SPEAKER_23]: I know myself, I've been talking about this for months on end, and that there is absolutely no plan

404
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:10,395
[SPEAKER_23]: at all with regard to ARPA from the administration, none $48 million in no plan.

405
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:15,677
[SPEAKER_23]: We have had, we have not had a CFO for six months.

406
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:27,794
[SPEAKER_23]: Six months we have $191 million budget we have no CFO $48 million in ARPA funding no CFO, and no one right now is currently managing.

407
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:37,278
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't even think they're discussing opera in the finance office because I think they're basically trying to just do the day to day activities that that that occur on a daily basis.

408
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:38,559
[SPEAKER_23]: This is unacceptable.

409
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:42,687
[SPEAKER_23]: And then they throw it on us to say, oh, we need all these positions.

410
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,008
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no planning.

411
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,510
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a complete lack of planning when it comes to this.

412
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:47,911
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's unacceptable.

413
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:56,319
[SPEAKER_23]: I definitely could vote on the federal funds manager because I think that kicks us all off with regard to planning.

414
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:59,261
[SPEAKER_23]: Eventually we're gonna have to plan to do something with this money.

415
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:02,104
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unfortunate that the discussion has not happened yet.

416
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:05,307
[SPEAKER_23]: And if I may,

417
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Cat 15 Can you give us the range please.

418
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:21,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President, through you to Councilor Marks.

419
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:24,488
[SPEAKER_21]: I have 8542 62 to 94,000 to 3532.

420
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:33,973
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so that is the actual cat 15, but it was just listed as cap 12 on the original document.

421
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:36,834
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Councilor my that's a scrivener's error.

422
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,798
[SPEAKER_21]: On my end, I made that error.

423
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:43,201
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

424
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:47,445
[SPEAKER_23]: And who actually helps determine the actual caps?

425
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,606
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that the chief people officer?

426
00:33:50,587 --> 00:34:04,418
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a process to review similar positions in other communities, similar positions within our organization, level of obviously work responsibility, level of training and education,

427
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:11,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, it is essentially the human resources department that chief people officer becomes responsible to make recommendations.

428
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:13,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

429
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

430
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the concern of my fellow Councilors.

431
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:26,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very focused on the number of positions in this in the public health department.

432
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:34,520
[SPEAKER_01]: As we are, you know, entering a surge, unlike we've seen before, our testing sites, you know, they're incredible weights around

433
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,021
[SPEAKER_01]: the Commonwealth, and I have people reaching out to me, Medford residents reaching out to me and saying, why isn't Medford testing?

434
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't they doing X, Y, or Z?

435
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:51,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk to people in the Department of Public Health and they say, we don't have the bandwidth and we need these positions to respond to the crisis we're in right now.

436
00:34:51,984 --> 00:34:55,105
[SPEAKER_01]: These are something that I absolutely will vote for tonight.

437
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:56,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to vote for.

438
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:58,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the concerns about the plan.

439
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:02,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the same concerns, but we're in the middle of a surge.

440
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: We're facing a major issue right now.

441
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:08,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are positions we need to respond to the challenges we're facing right now.

442
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'll support them.

443
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

444
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

445
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:22,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we in the process of, I thought we were in the process of reviewing everybody's salary.

446
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:25,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that something we were doing?

447
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:35,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that I believe it was something that the mayor brought up that they were going to look at every position and look at each individual salary.

448
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this still happening or this wasn't part of that?

449
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:40,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President?

450
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:42,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

451
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:43,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

452
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:45,128
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Scalapelli.

453
00:35:45,168 --> 00:35:46,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that is accurate.

454
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:52,835
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a classification and compensation study that's going to be launching very soon.

455
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:55,577
[SPEAKER_21]: The city has received a grant for that.

456
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:59,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and essentially that process takes several months.

457
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:12,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it's, it's, it's a process that will, uh, basically go on for much longer than the time period in which we need to get moving on many of these positions, but absolutely.

458
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:22,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, these would be reviewed, um, to the degree, you know, each position, um, essentially the process has a cost per position.

459
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,580
[SPEAKER_21]: So.

460
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:37,370
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we'd have to do the math as we enter to add positions to this organization, but we would absolutely review including these and all of, first and foremost, the existing positions we have.

461
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:41,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Last question, I'm sorry.

462
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:48,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, how many of our units, are we whole now with every unit right now?

463
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any negotiations for contracts?

464
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,449
[SPEAKER_16]: A teacher's union, I believe is done.

465
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:59,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Are the other unions, as we move forward through these money papers, is everything complete?

466
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:06,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any big outstanding raises coming up or negotiations still out there?

467
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:10,128
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions.

468
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:12,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I would advise that the City Council.

469
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,514
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, I'm happy to answer the questions.

470
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:18,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I would not be the body.

471
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,018
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not anybody.

472
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:24,843
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are the body, um, as to who is responsible for the open meeting law.

473
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:29,428
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm happy to answer the questions, but Contracts, um,

474
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Other other issues relating to Mr. President are not items that are on the agenda this evening.

475
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:43,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I'm happy to answer the question I'm just advising and cautioning the city council as to the open meeting

476
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:55,276
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the question I'm presenting is on behalf of a money paper that we're voting on about money that this city has to spend.

477
00:37:55,897 --> 00:38:01,800
[SPEAKER_16]: So as we make our decisions, I think it's important that we know if there are outstanding negotiations.

478
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,921
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not, you could say yes or no.

479
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:04,861
[SPEAKER_16]: You could say that.

480
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,802
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not asking for any money.

481
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:13,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not asking for anything that would interfere with any sort of negotiations, union negotiations.

482
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:15,647
[SPEAKER_16]: The question I have in front of you is very simple.

483
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:24,345
[SPEAKER_16]: is that are there any outstanding negotiations still with any major union in the city as you move forward to vote on a money paper?

484
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:30,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that has nothing to do with the violation of meeting law, because it's a money paper that's in front of us.

485
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,830
[SPEAKER_16]: We're voting on money.

486
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:35,754
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, again, I'm happy to answer the question.

487
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:43,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, it's not on the agenda, but the answer is yes, there are collective bargaining agreements that have not been settled.

488
00:38:44,492 --> 00:38:46,875
[SPEAKER_21]: prior to this administration, which had not been settled.

489
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:54,303
[SPEAKER_21]: And I will add, Mr. President, that those are not able to use ARPA funding to subsidize them.

490
00:38:54,363 --> 00:38:56,226
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, that's the reason I was cautioning.

491
00:38:56,306 --> 00:39:00,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I was not intending, Councilor Scarapelli, to avoid the question.

492
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:03,454
[SPEAKER_21]: By any means, I'm just trying to provide some guidance.

493
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:07,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so that would have been my next question.

494
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:17,034
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you answer the question, the simple question, because it seemed like it was avoidance, just so our chief of staff could understand what it looks like, at least to this council.

495
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:17,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

496
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:18,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

497
00:39:18,995 --> 00:39:20,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further questions?

498
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:22,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, just a point of information.

499
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:28,437
[SPEAKER_15]: The fire department has been without a contract, I believe, for close to two years now.

500
00:39:28,897 --> 00:39:29,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

501
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:33,238
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so get back to amendment F.

502
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:38,467
[SPEAKER_07]: has been a motion before by Councilor Bears to table the economic development planner.

503
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Morell.

504
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:43,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

505
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,672
[SPEAKER_07]: The table, the table.

506
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:56,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, Mr. President, this is not a position that's that's in place, correct?

507
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:58,157
[SPEAKER_16]: That is correct.

508
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:06,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, can we just ask if the committee, in case I got it wrong, I'd just like to ask the Planning Development and Sustainability Director to speak on that.

509
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,702
[SPEAKER_21]: I know she wanted to speak earlier.

510
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:09,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a yes or no question.

511
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:10,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the position vacant?

512
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:13,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to go into- Is the position vacant?

513
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,405
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the question.

514
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:18,967
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe the answer is yes, but I'm just looking for confirmation from my colleague.

515
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:24,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we have a motion on the floor by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Morell.

00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Amendment K, administrative support for COVID-19.

580
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:51,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that position currently filled?

581
00:42:52,615 --> 00:43:03,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, there's a person serving in a capacity to support that office if this position didn't move forward, we would need to essentially ask that person to come back, or maybe they would find a position in the meantime.

582
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:11,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve the motion by council best to approve seconded by second.

00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:29,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you call the roll, I'd like to go on record, Mr. President, stating that I will not be supporting this position until we find out about other city employees that have not received their step raises, Mr. President.

588
00:43:29,415 --> 00:43:29,775

[SPEAKER_14]: For the first reading.

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

594
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:45,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

595
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:47,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Feliciano.

596
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:47,990
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

597
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

598
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:52,813
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

599
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:54,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

600
00:43:54,254 --> 00:43:54,474
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

601
00:43:56,015 --> 00:43:56,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

602
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:57,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

603
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

604
00:43:59,197 --> 00:43:59,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

605
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:01,338
[SPEAKER_07]: President Caraviello.

606
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:01,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

607
00:44:02,279 --> 00:44:05,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

608
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Amendment L. Data analysts, community liaison, and contract tracer.

609
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:12,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither of these are currently filled positions.

610
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:16,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that contact tracer is presently being utilized.

611
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:18,430
[SPEAKER_20]: I defer to- I'm sorry.

612
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:19,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me, Nina.

613
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,113
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

614
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:23,995
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the data analyst is currently filled.

615
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:31,342
[SPEAKER_19]: The contact tracer is certainly someone we're looking to add on since we've had 650 cases since December 1st.

616
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:39,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So the data analyst is filled and the community liaison and the contact tracers are not filled, correct?

617
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

618
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:41,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

619
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:42,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

620
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:47,849
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point three full time employee.

621
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:53,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary and the council is asking you to point three full time employees.

622
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:57,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, she basically works about 10 hours a week and supporting us.

623
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,801
[SPEAKER_19]: 10 to 12.

624
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:01,762
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

625
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:02,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

626
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:07,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, and director O'Connor Did you say the community liaison we don't currently have that filled.

627
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:14,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct those are currently filled under grant positions but those grant positions will be expiring in June.

628
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:21,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it's the data analysts the liaison are filled in the contact tracer would be additional.

629
00:45:22,162 --> 00:45:22,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

630
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:23,743
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

631
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:24,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I would move approval.

632
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:31,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, three on all three I mean, yeah, we're in a motion by concept is seconded by Council morale.

633
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:39,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

634
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:42,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not be voting on this position as well.

635
00:45:43,338 --> 00:46:03,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I just find it ironic, Mr. President, that when these positions were put forth for spending of ARPA money to assist in COVID needs in the community, that the administration was at the table, the Office of Community Development was at the table, and the Board of Health was at the table.

636
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:12,947
[SPEAKER_15]: who was not at the table, Mr. President, that would equally have needs for COVID spending, the Council on Aging was not at the table.

637
00:46:13,908 --> 00:46:20,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Police and fire, first responders in this community were not at the table to seek what their needs are.

638
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:28,660
[SPEAKER_15]: The building department, DPW, the Office of Diversity, Mr. President, was not at the table.

639
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:40,064
[SPEAKER_15]: So in a sense of fairness, Mr. President, when we talk about not having a plan, as Councilor Falco mentions, he's absolutely right.

640
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:44,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, here we are going forward without a plan.

641
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:46,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm having deja vu.

642
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:55,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Two weeks ago, they asked us to vote to extend contracts so the city administration could take parking enforcement in-house.

643
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:04,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And this council said, what's the plan that you have to take over this program January 5th of next year?

644
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:07,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And the administration says, we don't have a plan.

645
00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:12,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we are again, voting on things without a plan.

646
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:19,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know where this council's going, Mr. President.

647
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:23,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand there's a need for this.

648
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:27,335
[SPEAKER_15]: but there's also a need to follow a process.

649
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:34,256
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also a need to include all stakeholders, Mr. President, and that's currently not being done.

650
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:43,419
[SPEAKER_15]: When you have three department heads sitting around a table and omitting the other 10 department heads that have similar needs, I have a concern with that.

651
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:51,621
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're bringing in people off the street at a higher salary, Mr. President, then counting workers, I have a problem with that.

652
00:47:52,787 --> 00:48:01,010
[SPEAKER_15]: When people aren't getting step raises and this council votes to bring people off the street at a higher salary, I have a problem with that.

653
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,971
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can always put things off.

654
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:08,072
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I hear people fighting for people and people fight for this and that.

655
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:12,474
[SPEAKER_15]: When push comes to shove, they bury their head in the sand.

656
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:20,760
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the exact issue right now when we talk about first responders and we talk about frontline workers.

657
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:29,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we allow the administration to go off without a plan, and we refuse, Mr. President, to address the current needs.

658
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:34,005
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a sad state of affairs.

659
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me tell you, Mr. President.

660
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:36,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

661
00:48:36,345 --> 00:48:36,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

662
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:43,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Vice President Knight, could Director O'Connor please clarify again when the grant expires on these greenfield positions?

663
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:46,526
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, certainly.

664
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:49,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, Mr. President.

665
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:53,692
[SPEAKER_19]: For the community liaisons, the grant will expire in June.

666
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And for data analysts?

667
00:48:59,217 --> 00:48:59,898
[SPEAKER_19]: The CARES Act.

668
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:04,342
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a currently filled position by CARES Act, which is no longer available.

669
00:49:04,362 --> 00:49:05,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

670
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:08,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further questions?

671
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:09,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

672
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:10,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Belli.

673
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:15,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, looking at the positions I agree with Council marks wholeheartedly.

674
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:19,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe I said that my first statement that we're doing this.

675
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:32,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We're doing this piecemeal, and it's not fair, but at the same time, I'm also looking at the positions that are there that are upholding that these positions to the coven.

676
00:49:34,216 --> 00:49:40,739
[SPEAKER_16]: pandemic and looking to make sure that those positions are still moving forward.

677
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:53,845
[SPEAKER_16]: So as of right now, again, just for clarification, because maybe I'm not that quick, but the data analysis person is in place, but ends in June.

678
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:56,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Data analysis is paid under the CARES Act.

679
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:58,327
[SPEAKER_16]: CARES Act that ends in June.

680
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:04,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So the liaison is on a grant that's here till June.

681
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:10,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to sever data analysts from the other two positions.

682
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:15,347
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion by Councilor Bears to sever the data analyst position from the other two positions.

683
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:16,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Vice President Knight.

684
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:17,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

685
00:50:29,117 --> 00:50:30,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, several council bears.

686
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:32,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Council Falcon.

687
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Vice President night.

688
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:36,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilmarks No.

689
00:50:39,486 --> 00:50:40,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Morell.

690
00:50:40,527 --> 00:50:42,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes.

691
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:43,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, President Caraviello.

692
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 60 affirmative on the negative.

693
00:50:46,312 --> 00:50:52,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes listen to approve the data analyst position on the motion by Councilor.

694
00:50:52,857 --> 00:50:53,938
[SPEAKER_23]: If I may just quickly.

695
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,909
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a 0.3, so this is 10 hours a week.

696
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:05,013
[SPEAKER_23]: And Marianne, did you say there's 600 people just in the month of December?

697
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:11,077
[SPEAKER_19]: So the data analyst position is basically 10 to 12 hours a week, and that helps us set up our clinics.

698
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:23,766
[SPEAKER_19]: It helps us convey information to the community on where we're at, where our stats at, helping with the graphs and charts every week, and also doing the back end of the multi-resource

699
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:31,358
[SPEAKER_19]: multilingual resource line and keeping track of the information coming in there as well.

700
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:42,448
[SPEAKER_19]: The contact tracing position, as you may or may not be aware, the state ended its contact tracing program as of December 31.

701
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:47,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, they stopped taking cases December 1, just as the surge blew up.

702
00:51:49,515 --> 00:52:09,222
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have a grant that we're currently in regionally with Somerville and Arlington, which has given us additional capability, but no way able to keep up with 650 cases from Medford alone since December 1st, which is why that contact tracing position right now is critical.

703
00:52:10,783 --> 00:52:12,244
[SPEAKER_23]: So shouldn't it be more than a 0.5?

704
00:52:14,324 --> 00:52:15,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, when I wrote this,

705
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,061
[SPEAKER_19]: It was pre search, and we had hoped that point five would would do what we needed.

706
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:33,884
[SPEAKER_19]: But again with with the additional help from the grant that we have with metric with some of all knowledge and obviously, you know, it's not what we expected to happen back.

707
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:38,525
[SPEAKER_19]: So, it's point five was what was written a month or so ago.

708
00:52:41,446 --> 00:52:45,687
[SPEAKER_23]: So, we know we're going into this really not being staffed correctly.

709
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

710
00:52:49,524 --> 00:52:52,808
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why all of those positions are there.

711
00:52:53,008 --> 00:52:55,091
[SPEAKER_19]: We cannot, we are hurting.

712
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:57,954
[SPEAKER_19]: We need these positions.

713
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:03,461
[SPEAKER_19]: We've lost staff due to COVID fatigue, basically.

714
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,664
[SPEAKER_19]: The emergency response coordinator

715
00:53:06,158 --> 00:53:14,060
[SPEAKER_19]: we were being able to pay through CARES funding, that person left, our food security person left, basically burnout.

716
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:33,165
[SPEAKER_19]: We are in need here in the Board of Health, and we have been doing our best, but I sorely hope that you consider us being able to continue to protect and inform the residents of Medford to the best of our ability, if not,

717
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:41,816
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to be able to keep up the vaccination clinics, the testing, the data, the contact tracing.

718
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:46,598
[SPEAKER_19]: We're on the edge.

719
00:53:46,898 --> 00:53:48,959
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't disagree that you need the positions.

720
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:52,660
[SPEAKER_23]: I think one of the big concerns is the process.

721
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:58,423
[SPEAKER_23]: And that is that we've been talking about a pandemic for two years.

722
00:53:58,543 --> 00:53:59,523
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not going away.

900
01:02:19,162 --> 01:02:20,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Amendment end.

901
01:02:21,642 --> 01:02:24,183
[SPEAKER_07]: COVID-19 public information officer.

902
01:02:26,203 --> 01:02:27,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, yes, this position is filled.

903
01:02:29,824 --> 01:02:30,584
[SPEAKER_07]: That is filled, correct?

904
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:32,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

905
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:35,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Nina, did you say that was a filled position?

906
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:36,262
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Mr. President.

907
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:37,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

908
01:02:37,643 --> 01:02:41,706
[SPEAKER_23]: If I may, Mr. President, this is the Steve Smerdy role, am I correct?

909
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:42,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you are correct.

910
01:02:43,808 --> 01:02:44,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Nina, is this the position?

911
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:45,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Mr. President.

912
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Councilor Felkel.

913
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:55,477
[SPEAKER_23]: So currently, is he straddling two roles as the COVID person and is he the interim communications director?

914
01:02:56,438 --> 01:02:58,260
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, through you, yes, he is.

915
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,882
[SPEAKER_21]: We are seeking an intern to support

916
01:03:01,306 --> 01:03:14,649
[SPEAKER_21]: that role because it is obviously something that requires both the director of communications as well as the COVID-19 information officer, but he is presently doing both jobs.

917
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:29,393
[SPEAKER_23]: This person is going to be doing just COVID-related, he's going to be the COVID-19 public information officer and he'll be only doing COVID-related activities, correct?

918
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:34,186
[SPEAKER_21]: when he is not no longer acting director of communications that's correct.

919
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:35,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

920
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:37,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

921
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:40,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Nina is this currently funded through the cares act.

922
01:03:41,269 --> 01:03:41,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

923
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:43,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President through you.

924
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:48,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

925
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:52,753

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

933
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:13,885

01:04:16,006 --> 01:04:16,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

935
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:17,026

936
01:04:18,907 --> 01:04:19,487

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one of the negative motion passes for Texas first reading.

941
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Amendment O, federal funds manager.

942
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:41,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, this position is not filled at this time, but as stated at one of the prior meetings.

943
01:04:42,363 --> 01:04:43,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by.

944
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:53,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Additional positions may be added to the existing comments that the paragraph.

945
01:04:55,042 --> 01:05:03,846
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Council night to strike the last paragraph, second by second by Council Scott belly, Mr. President, Council marks.

946
01:05:04,486 --> 01:05:12,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President, as I stated from the outset, this is the truly the only one position Mr. President, the federal funds manager.

947
01:05:13,431 --> 01:05:14,852
[SPEAKER_15]: that should have been put on first.

948
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:24,838
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how you get the ball rolling to then have your public meetings and input from stakeholders to then establish what you wanna do in the community.

949
01:05:25,879 --> 01:05:30,302
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're kind of putting the horse before the cart by doing this after the fact.

950
01:05:30,362 --> 01:05:34,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So I support this one position, Mr. President, getting the ball rolling.

951
01:05:36,425 --> 01:05:40,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I still find it troubling that tonight,

952
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:52,533
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the Board of Health Director, who's the highest health official in the city, saying, I need a laundry list of positions because we're concerned about the increase in COVID.

953
01:05:53,593 --> 01:06:08,945
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have members of this council tonight picking and choosing from the Board of Health Director saying, I need these positions, they're vital, choosing only to put on positions that currently have someone in that position.

954
01:06:10,188 --> 01:06:16,473
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's no one in the position, Mr. President, members of this council are saying, we're tabling it for now.

955
01:06:17,814 --> 01:06:20,757
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the health director saying, no, I need this position.

956
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:24,034
[SPEAKER_15]: So it makes no sense, Mr. President.

957
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:35,404
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what happens when you do piecemeal, like Councilor Scarpelli said, when you don't have a plan, you make decisions, Mr. President, not based on anything other than knee-jerk reactions.

958
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:40,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what this council's doing now, knee-jerk reactions, Mr. President.

959
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

960
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:41,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

961
01:06:42,591 --> 01:06:45,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion for the federal, excuse me,

962
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:55,906

[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions on the easement?

1004
01:08:53,315 --> 01:08:57,095
[SPEAKER_07]: We have somebody from the DCR here, am I correct, Mr. Steller?

1005
01:08:57,115 --> 01:08:57,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, hang on.

1006
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions for the DCR or Alicia Hunt on this?

1007
01:09:08,696 --> 01:09:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, Vice President Knight, this project's been something that's been going on for what seems like now three administrations.

1008
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:17,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen some progress be made.

1009
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:22,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any indication as to how far along we are, what phase we're in, in terms of seeing this

1010
01:09:23,562 --> 01:09:25,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Trail comes to reality, number one.

1011
01:09:25,923 --> 01:09:31,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, I know we've expended some money for remediation in the area due to some soil contamination.

1012
01:09:31,886 --> 01:09:38,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was also been some concerns relative to the abutters that needed to be addressed as the planning stages were going on.

1013
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:46,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if the director of that office with way too many words can tell us exactly what's going on with this project and where we stand.

1014
01:09:46,532 --> 01:09:46,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1015
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:52,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Sons, do you have an answer for Councilor Knight's question?

1016

[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, I thank you very much this evening.

1017
01:09:56,904 --> 01:10:04,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that the remediation that's in the area where the path itself is going to be put has been completed and Ms.

1018
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:15,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Lensing, Stella Lensing is the project manager and she is with us this evening and she could give us an update on the timing as this project is to be constructed by the state DCR.

1019
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:17,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe she may need to be unmuted again.

1020
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1021
01:10:22,325 --> 01:10:26,486

01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:31,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we are... I beg your pardon?

1024
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,629
[SPEAKER_07]: May I have your name and address for the record, please?

1025
01:10:35,049 --> 01:10:37,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, my name is Stella Lansing.

1026
01:10:37,289 --> 01:10:41,771
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a project manager with the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

1027
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:45,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1028
01:10:46,072 --> 01:10:47,592
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as Ms.

1029
01:10:47,652 --> 01:10:49,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Hunt explained,

1030
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:55,883
[SPEAKER_12]: We are almost ready to put this project out to bed.

1031
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:58,084
[SPEAKER_12]: We have completed our design process.

1032
01:10:58,124 --> 01:10:59,684
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at 100% design.

1033
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:03,326
[SPEAKER_12]: We are finalizing our easements.

1034
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:14,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And once we have those all in place, we can be ready to advertise this project for construction later this year, spring, summer of 2022.

1035
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:27,406
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have materials ready to show visual of the area that we are requesting an easement for.

1036
01:11:27,586 --> 01:11:30,087
[SPEAKER_12]: If you would like me to share my screen, I can do so.

1037
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:34,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1038
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,531
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could, that'd be helpful.

1039
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:38,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1040
01:11:38,413 --> 01:11:41,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like the screen sharing is disabled.

1041
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,883
[SPEAKER_11]: should be all set now.

1042
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:01,767
[SPEAKER_07]: You can share your screen now.

1043
01:12:02,268 --> 01:12:03,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1044
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:04,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Can everybody see this plan?

1045
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:16,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I just want to provide an overview of the location of the proposed greenway.

1046
01:12:17,389 --> 01:12:22,131
[SPEAKER_12]: It's between Clippership Drive and the middle school.

1047
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:31,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And this graphic right here shows all the different parcels that we're in the process of acquiring easements for.

1048
01:12:31,335 --> 01:12:37,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Number four indicated over here would be this easement for

1049
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,681
[SPEAKER_12]: over the city land connecting to Clippership Drive.

1050
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:57,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to be more clear on that, this parcel is located at Clippership Drive and it's about an easement that's approximately 20 feet wide and approximately 1,749 square feet in area.

1051
01:12:57,785 --> 01:12:58,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all information I have.

1052
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:11,132
[SPEAKER_12]: to share, so I can stop sharing or I could take some questions while the screen is up.

1053
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,437
[SPEAKER_11]: This goes behind the scenes, correct?

1054
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I beg your pardon?

1055
01:13:26,766 --> 01:13:27,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it should go there.

1056
01:13:38,022 --> 01:13:39,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, any further questions?

1057
01:13:41,707 --> 01:13:42,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further questions?

1058
01:13:42,527 --> 01:13:43,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1059
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:44,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1060
01:13:44,848 --> 01:13:46,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1061
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:49,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And this has been a long process.

1062
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:52,751
[SPEAKER_15]: The connectivity, I think, is long overdue.

1063
01:13:53,411 --> 01:14:04,996
[SPEAKER_15]: It adds a safety element for pedestrians, cyclists, that I think will serve a purpose that has been needed in this community for a lot of years.

1064
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:12,979
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll connect the east side of Medford into Medford Square and far beyond, Mr. President, in a safe fashion.

1065
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:20,739
[SPEAKER_15]: The one concern in the neighborhood meetings that I attended back some time ago, probably close to two years ago, maybe even longer than that.

1066
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:37,124
[SPEAKER_15]: time flies, is that we're now introducing a bike path slash pedestrian path within feet from the rear doors of many residents on Clippership Drive.

1067
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:50,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was a major concern at the time of many property owners in that area that, you know, that support the project, but we're also concerned that now we're introducing

1068
01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:56,663
[SPEAKER_15]: people, bikes, foot walkers that have never been in that area before.

1069
01:14:57,403 --> 01:15:01,464
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were concerned about safety, public safety and rightfully so.

1070
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:16,369
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was wondering, I noticed in the correspondence we received, it said the purpose of the easement is to install, construct, operate, maintain, repair the recreational non-motorized bicycle pedestrian trail.

1071
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:26,211
[SPEAKER_15]: but it doesn't talk about who is actually going to provide the public safety and patrol that particular area, Mr. President.

1072
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:34,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that we're introducing people along the river back there, that was never a path.

1073
01:15:34,633 --> 01:15:45,996
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't know if the woman from DCI can answer that question or someone from the city administration, but I have a concern about the patrolling and the safety

1074
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:47,958
[SPEAKER_15]: of that particular area.

1075
01:15:49,038 --> 01:15:51,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And will it be lit, Mr. President, at all?

1076
01:15:52,940 --> 01:16:00,845
[SPEAKER_15]: We all took, at least I know I did, a tour of the whole area along the water back there, and it's a dark, isolated area.

1077
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:11,150
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanna make sure when we do this, I support this 1,000%, but I wanna make sure we're not introducing a public safety concern as well, Mr. President.

1078
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:16,073
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask the representative from DCR or someone from the city administration

1079
01:16:16,473 --> 01:16:21,662
[SPEAKER_15]: to talk about safety and security of people using the path, as well as the direct above us.

1080
01:16:26,335 --> 01:16:42,100
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. President, it is my understanding from discussions with the police in the state that there's a mutual aid agreement for the city and the state on shared use trails like this, so that either one, they will both have jurisdiction on this location.

1081
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:53,904
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual discussion of patrols is one that would occur with the police chief at the point that we actually have something ready to open, which will be on the order of a year from now.

1082
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
[SPEAKER_07]: What about lighting on the bridge?

1083
01:16:56,981 --> 01:17:03,184
[SPEAKER_00]: With regards to the lighting, there is a plan to do lighting under the I-93 bridge where it will pass under.

1084
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:04,784
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ms.

1085
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:16,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Lensing can correct me if I am wrong on this, but there is a policy in DCR to not light their shared use paths and to not introduce lighting directly along the river because of the wildlife.

1086
01:17:17,685 --> 01:17:19,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, thank you, Mr. That is correct.

1087
01:17:20,088 --> 01:17:20,949
[SPEAKER_12]: We, um.

1088
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:33,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Do not usually like our linear corridors because we also see these as conservation corridors and wildlife corridors, but there will be lighting under the I 93.

1089
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:33,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Under pause.

1090
01:17:39,235 --> 01:17:39,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1091
01:17:40,276 --> 01:17:54,566
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mr. President, just so I understand, so there is a commitment that public safety will be provided either by the city of Medford or by state police when this is finally built out and so forth.

1092
01:17:54,586 --> 01:18:00,170
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is a commitment in that part of safety will be enforced, is that correct?

1093
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,011
[SPEAKER_15]: If I understood that right, I think that is correct.

1094
01:18:02,051 --> 01:18:02,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I correct?

1095
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:05,454
[SPEAKER_12]: That seems correct, Mr. President.

1096
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1097
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:08,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1098
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:11,864
[SPEAKER_07]: So, any further discussion on this.

1099
01:18:12,465 --> 01:18:26,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President, I, I think, as we get closer, I think that Councilmarks brings up a great point that we I think it's important that we let all of the people that will traverse that area, know that that's not going to be a little area because it

1100
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:37,099
[SPEAKER_16]: know, especially as we get going, I think that maybe that when we get closer to this project to completion, that we work with the city and the state to make sure that there's signs posted.

1101
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,961
[SPEAKER_16]: And citizens all understand because that's pretty scary.

1102
01:18:41,981 --> 01:18:46,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that's conservation land, but not having that area lit in many different levels.

1103
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:49,503
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, I know Councilmember Mox brought up the big point of the

1104
01:18:50,123 --> 01:18:52,585
[SPEAKER_16]: the members of the community a little bit about this.

1105
01:18:53,446 --> 01:19:00,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we've gone to a lot of discussion with this, but now not having a lit area and we can understand being police the right way.

1106
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:04,877
[SPEAKER_16]: And we appreciate state and local authorities working together.

1107
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:10,302
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that, um, making sure at the time we post, um,

1108
01:19:11,055 --> 01:19:17,316
[SPEAKER_16]: throughout that area as it gets dark so people can understand that it will not be lit.

1109
01:19:18,377 --> 01:19:31,840
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that if my daughter says, Dad, I'm going to go to one side or the other, and I'm going to be pretty scared as a parent that my daughter is going to make that trek during the evening when it's not lit.

1110
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,482
[SPEAKER_16]: That could be a recipe for some pretty serious issues.

1111
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:51,628
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would hope that as we get closer and I bring this forward, that we all agree to at least that point that it's a public notice and we put out some signage so people understand what's happening.

1112
01:19:51,688 --> 01:19:52,188
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1113
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:52,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1114
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:54,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further questions?

1115
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.

1116
01:19:59,432 --> 01:20:01,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Castagnetti in Method, Massachusetts.

1117
01:20:04,768 --> 01:20:13,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna say hallelujah, I am very thrilled and very happy to finally see this project hopefully come to completion.

1118
01:20:13,777 --> 01:20:23,046
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a half mile missing bike path that is a blockade to the rest of the 10 miles in both directions.

1119
01:20:23,967 --> 01:20:28,632
[SPEAKER_05]: From West Mifflin beyond, you can come to Medford Square today, but this is half mile

1120
01:20:29,676 --> 01:20:35,640
[SPEAKER_05]: that does not exist in the middle of the square from the Senior Services Center to the new schools.

1121
01:20:37,602 --> 01:20:42,405
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion, this is 20 years late when the new schools were built.

1122
01:20:42,425 --> 01:20:47,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have been done then, but better late than never, I hope.

1123
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:52,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it gets done now while I'm still alive.

1124
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:56,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want, it must be,

1125
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:19,565
[SPEAKER_05]: done according to the Riparian Rights Law in 1600s in Massachusetts, which guarantees we the people access to 10 feet above high tide along all waterways, including the Mystic River and the oceans and the state.

1126
01:21:22,227 --> 01:21:26,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially, it must be completed

1127
01:21:27,826 --> 01:21:46,876
[SPEAKER_05]: along the river behind those eight condos, numbered 54 to 68 on Ship Avenue, because they have two fences on each side of the property, next to the Royal House, the Riverside Yacht Club.

1128
01:21:47,537 --> 01:21:52,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Both their fences, from the front sidewalk to the rear, they go right into the river.

1129
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:56,542
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a blockage of the 10 foot that

1130
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:02,756
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a right under the repairing rights law in this state from the 1600s mind.

1131
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:16,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and if the condo owners didn't know they didn't own the last 10 feet towards the river in their backyards, it's not the people's fault.

1132
01:22:17,427 --> 01:22:20,750
[SPEAKER_05]: They must have a deed and a plot plan.

1133
01:22:21,691 --> 01:22:26,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And the point is the law is on our side.

1134
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1135
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:33,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, is this going to go behind those condominiums?

1136
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:36,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to ask the people in charge of this operation.

1137
01:22:36,407 --> 01:22:39,089
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the paper that's before us this evening.

1138
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:40,570
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have that paper.

1139
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:43,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Knight.

1140
01:22:43,712 --> 01:22:54,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I move for approval of the paper and request that the DCR hold the pre-construction meeting with the Butters after securing the necessary permitting to move forward with the project.

1141
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:54,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1142
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Castagnetti, anything else?

1143
01:22:57,532 --> 01:22:58,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

1144
01:22:59,552 --> 01:23:02,873
[SPEAKER_07]: All the motion by Vice President seconded by second.

1145
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:05,474

[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, sir.

1218
01:25:41,965 --> 01:25:43,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1219
01:25:44,967 --> 01:25:46,988
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Robert Pantazzo, Summit Road.

1220
01:25:47,468 --> 01:25:49,309
[SPEAKER_18]: And what subject would you be speaking on, sir?

1221
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:57,294
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd speak on the Ambulatory Surgical Center up at the location of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital at 170 Governor's Avenue.

1222
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:20,153
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason why I'm bringing this up was after reviewing your city budget and recognizing that you folks set a tax rate this past week, unless I missed it all together, there was no inclusion at all as it related to the amount of money that the new ambulatory service center would be bringing to the city of Medford.

1223
01:26:20,813 --> 01:26:23,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe this past, last past Tuesday,

1224
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:29,299
[SPEAKER_18]: On the 14th of December you folks sat in committee and discuss the tax rate.

1225
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:31,580
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe, and I could be wrong.

1226
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:41,046
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the questions that was asked by one of your colleagues Council marked to the assessor as it relates to have you arrived at any kind of a decision regarding the tax rate.

1227
01:26:41,606 --> 01:26:48,972
[SPEAKER_18]: at that location 170 Governors Avenue and the assessor responded that they had filed for a tax exempt status.

1228
01:26:50,613 --> 01:27:05,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Conferring upon that and having a brief discussion once again and reaffirming this conversation with Councilor Falco who once again had the same type of concern as related to the assessor's issue of how and what they're going to be taxed.

1229
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:09,107
[SPEAKER_18]: I think she said that it's charitable or something of that nature.

1230
01:27:10,193 --> 01:27:18,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So putting that together, and I just went back and just did a little bit of history on this because I was involved in many of the issues on this particular matter.

1231
01:27:19,915 --> 01:27:25,097
[SPEAKER_18]: On August 28th of 2018, I sent a certified letter to the State Department of Public Health.

1232
01:27:25,717 --> 01:27:34,819
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of the components of the letter, it was issued, I issued the regard regarding tax exam status, which up until that point in time had not been mentioned.

1233
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:37,159
[SPEAKER_18]: On September 17th of 2018, in the method transcript,

1234
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:46,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And headline title future of the lots of oil hostile include community input on this say, but in paragraph number 10.

1235
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:57,080
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the existing building, it says the ASC will be a for profit and will therefore pay property taxes to the city of method that came right from them themselves.

1236
01:27:57,841 --> 01:28:01,163
[SPEAKER_18]: October 30 2018 and the city council meeting.

1237
01:28:01,803 --> 01:28:14,611
[SPEAKER_18]: It was discussed again as to whether the proposed ASC being a builder and the hospital footprint would pay taxes, would it be by the square footage of the whole Lawrence and will hospital footprint itself.

1238
01:28:15,564 --> 01:28:30,347
[SPEAKER_18]: November 19 2018 at the council meeting, there was a need for an update for clarification for our city of sex office as to how the SC will be determined for tax purposes if approved by the State Department of Public Health.

1239
01:28:31,068 --> 01:28:39,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Will it be for the whole Lawrence Memorial Campus to be considered as a for profit, or would it be broken down by the square footage of each building separately.

1240
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:49,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, on November 27 of 2019 Susan Sandberg, then CEO and Vice President of Melrose Wakefield Hospital,

1241
01:28:50,106 --> 01:28:56,612
[SPEAKER_18]: appeared before the city council saying for the first time that the AFC will be a for profit business here in the city of method.

1242
01:28:57,372 --> 01:29:01,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Again in November 2018 I sprinted into the method transcript.

1243
01:29:01,776 --> 01:29:04,919
[SPEAKER_18]: The discussion was once again, a for profit business.

1244
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:14,047
[SPEAKER_18]: December 6 2018, the method transcript said in the proposed commentary period regarding method officials.

1245
01:29:15,177 --> 01:29:27,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Then in paragraph 13, quote, the proposed method surgery LLC, a joint venture between then named Melrose Wakefield and the Shields Healthcare as being a for-profit taxable ASC.

1246
01:29:28,365 --> 01:29:37,710
[SPEAKER_18]: February 19th, 2019 at a city council meeting, issues were presented as it related to the construction and to the taxing status.

1247
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:38,871
[SPEAKER_18]: March 19th, 2019,

1248
01:29:41,432 --> 01:29:52,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Melrose Wakefield then notifies the city council and the city that the separate footprint that was going to be at 170 Governors Avenue would now be merged into the property of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1249
01:29:53,519 --> 01:30:11,993
[SPEAKER_18]: April 23 2019 the city council meeting, Sue Sandberg said that she was so pleased with the development that have been taking place regarding this proposal taxes will be determined by the city assessor regarding this tax matter, and Michael Max F at the city will be doing a pilot program on the $733,000

1250
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:27,098
[SPEAKER_18]: community health initiative that community health initiative was a planned a planned program for health services within this community and surrounding communities over two to a five year period.

1251
01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:36,360
[SPEAKER_18]: I have not heard one comment by this city, this city administration, or the city assessor's office, as it relates to what is the plan program.

1252
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:41,001
[SPEAKER_18]: And if in fact it became a pilot program, it was possibly discussed at that time.

1253
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:52,877
[SPEAKER_18]: May 7 2019 at a committee of the whole meeting once again Council mass ask who, who is going to be paying the taxes on their separate office space, or not.

1254
01:30:54,591 --> 01:31:11,561
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor at that time, who was the city council, indicated that she was concerned of a pilot program as it related to just what and how, if we're not going to be getting taxes, if we're going to be involved in a pilot program.

1255
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:18,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilman Fred De La Russa also made comment as he was concerned over how the tax issue was going to take place.

1256
01:31:18,966 --> 01:31:20,867
[SPEAKER_18]: On May 28th, 2019, city council once again

1257
01:31:23,088 --> 01:31:34,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Susan Sandberg said the ASC will provide new tax revenue and will provide an additional $750,000 within a two to five year period for additional area services.

1258
01:31:34,854 --> 01:31:41,237
[SPEAKER_18]: She reiterated on May 18, that for which was said on April of that year of the Community Health Service $750,000.

1259
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:50,742
[SPEAKER_18]: On June 4, a letter was sent to Susan Sandberg by myself once again, talking about issues as it relates to the taxing issue.

1260
01:31:51,242 --> 01:32:00,928
[SPEAKER_18]: And then on October 15, 2019, Susan Sandberg reiterated that the ASA will bring tax revenue to the city of Medford.

1261
01:32:01,588 --> 01:32:11,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, then-Councilor and then-Mayor Brenna Lundgren stated that she wanted the developer to provide for the city of Medford

1262
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:26,243
[SPEAKER_18]: a tax, a tax review number one and number two, the vote will take you can say that the vote that the council is taking that the, the, the agreement would go to the petitioner, not to the land.

1263
01:32:30,164 --> 01:32:34,105
[SPEAKER_18]: When they made their proposal before this method city council into the state.

1264
01:32:36,145 --> 01:32:40,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Their information presentation read as follows in one of their sections.

1265
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:44,088
[SPEAKER_18]: What benefits will an ASC bring to the city of Medford?

1266
01:32:44,828 --> 01:32:51,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Their response was the ASC will pay local taxes, as well as add jobs in the area.

1267
01:32:52,411 --> 01:33:07,417
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition, as part of the state revenue process, there will be a substantial community benefits contribution, that's the $750,000 I was talking about, to help address the pressing health and social welfare needs of Medford and other communities.

1268
01:33:08,037 --> 01:33:18,842
[SPEAKER_18]: The total amount the ASC will contribute towards community health initiatives is approximately $733,000, and that'll be paid over a two to five year period of time.

1269
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:25,874
[SPEAKER_18]: From that period of time, from May 7 of 2015, that can be the whole meeting.

1270
01:33:25,894 --> 01:33:35,336
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe you had at that point in time made reference to Councilor Falco as it relates to that particular meeting, as it relates to how taxes were going to be paid.

1271
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:44,158
[SPEAKER_18]: This city council has not been advised, never mind the council, the taxpayers have not been advised as just how and when it's going to take place for taxes.

1272
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:52,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And how are they going to pay it and when are they going to play it, and what meetings if anything has taken place at that meeting in May of 2019.

1273
01:33:52,497 --> 01:34:08,952
[SPEAKER_18]: I also presented before there before the city assessor communities such as Weymouth, and then the central hospital and what they were doing with their cities and towns in combination of either a and in lieu of taxes or a tax payment to be made.

1274
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,017
[SPEAKER_18]: You have received nothing.

1275
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:15,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing has come back, Mr. President, as it relates to this particular issue.

1276
01:34:16,533 --> 01:34:32,603
[SPEAKER_18]: I secured from the Secretary of State and the State Attorney General's Office, there was no filing of any sorts, other than the amendment that they filed in 12-4-2020, which was December 4th, of a change of address.

1277
01:34:32,643 --> 01:34:36,586
[SPEAKER_18]: They had the original address in Boston, and now they changed it to 170.

1278
01:34:37,426 --> 01:34:45,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, just because they're built at 170, 170 Governors Avenue, same address as the Lowell Memorial Hospital, where urgent care is there right now,

1279
01:34:46,112 --> 01:34:50,653
[SPEAKER_18]: There should be no taking advantage of that being a tax exempt nonprofit.

1280
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:52,454
[SPEAKER_18]: When she was came in here.

1281
01:34:53,254 --> 01:35:05,177
[SPEAKER_18]: They made it perfectly clear that the linchpin to this deal was that they would pay taxes to the city method on the ASC 16,000 square foot piece of building that they were building for $17,500,000.

1282
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:14,788
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a shame that during this budgetary process, when you were setting and addressing your tax rate.

1283
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:28,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing was presented as it relates to the anticipation of approximately any wisdom, five and a half million plus dollars on an annual assessment of that piece of property, what that would bring in for taxes here to the city of medicine.

1284
01:35:31,452 --> 01:35:44,207
[SPEAKER_18]: But before this council gets going again in January next year that this issue is brought to your attention we've heard all kinds of rumors oh yeah they're going to pay, whatever it might have been, you have nothing from the assessor's office in this city.

1285
01:35:44,688 --> 01:35:46,911
[SPEAKER_18]: That's saying number one, they're going to pay.

1286
01:35:47,371 --> 01:36:02,736
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have anything regarding the community health portion of $755,000, that's going to be paid over to a five year period of time for the health initiatives and concerns that you might have to be brought forward, and that was brought to the state's Department of Public Health.

1287
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,257
[SPEAKER_18]: When this was all presented.

1288
01:36:04,277 --> 01:36:07,958
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a real concern that I have I'm very concerned over this because

1289
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:18,224
[SPEAKER_18]: That's hundreds and thousands of dollars that potentially could belong to the city of method coffers that could be used, whether it's in our public health department, our schools our budgets police fire, whatever it might be.

1290
01:36:18,964 --> 01:36:24,067
[SPEAKER_18]: This is too small of a thought to be issue when in fact it's a big issue.

1291
01:36:24,547 --> 01:36:32,152
[SPEAKER_18]: And to me it's such a big issue that it hasn't been discussed, I say shame on everyone who knows what that should have been done.

1292
01:36:32,832 --> 01:36:39,938
[SPEAKER_18]: This should not be a red herring coming up now to say okay why are we talking about we're talking about now because nobody in the city has talked about it.

1293
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:45,743
[SPEAKER_18]: And if somebody made a mistake in their commentary that that's it's for profit will then so be it.

1294
01:36:46,183 --> 01:36:48,325
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's a for profit, not enough.

1295
01:36:49,126 --> 01:36:55,031
[SPEAKER_18]: If it is for a for profit business, excuse me, you people should have this information.

1296
01:36:55,411 --> 01:36:57,233
[SPEAKER_18]: We the taxpayers should have that information.

1297
01:36:58,577 --> 01:36:59,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand.

1298
01:36:59,258 --> 01:37:01,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Is anyone behind this real received anything.

1299
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:10,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I, on this matter, I reached out to the hospital, and we got to this matter, and they will be.

1300
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:14,873
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a for profit and they will be paying taxes for 2021.

1301
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:18,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So let me ask you this, Mr. President, directly.

1302
01:37:18,617 --> 01:37:19,598
[SPEAKER_18]: You had a conversation.

1303
01:37:19,618 --> 01:37:21,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have anything in writing from them that says that?

1304
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:23,201
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want something in writing, I will get something in writing.

1305
01:37:23,221 --> 01:37:27,644
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the council deserves it, and I think your tax base and your tax rate deserves it.

1306
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:29,506
[SPEAKER_18]: I will have something in writing.

1307
01:37:29,546 --> 01:37:34,530
[SPEAKER_18]: I would strongly suggest that a council resolution go forward seeking that, and that nailing it down.

1308
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:39,334
[SPEAKER_18]: And for further information, Sue Sandberg is no longer with Melrose-Wakefield.

1309
01:37:39,394 --> 01:37:43,297
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an issue for the Board of Assessors, Mr. President.

1310
01:37:43,317 --> 01:37:44,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1311
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:45,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say, I will get that paper for you.

1312
01:37:48,248 --> 01:37:48,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1313
01:37:49,108 --> 01:37:49,569
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1314
01:37:49,589 --> 01:37:50,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1315
01:37:54,191 --> 01:37:57,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to the part of the evening that everybody came here for.

1316
01:37:59,313 --> 01:37:59,493
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1317
01:38:00,674 --> 01:38:01,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

1318
01:38:01,854 --> 01:38:04,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Sharon Diesso, Circuit Road and Metro.

1319
01:38:04,996 --> 01:38:05,936
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna be brief.

1320
01:38:06,537 --> 01:38:10,118
[SPEAKER_17]: It's gonna be hard, but I have just a few comments to make.

1321
01:38:10,879 --> 01:38:15,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy and a fun or fun holiday week coming up to everyone.

1322
01:38:15,892 --> 01:38:17,333
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been trying for everyone.

1323
01:38:17,653 --> 01:38:19,875
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still waiting for my class to open at Bunker Hill.

1324
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:22,477
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm helping two great principals in the city.

1325
01:38:22,557 --> 01:38:23,237
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all great.

1326
01:38:23,717 --> 01:38:27,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to let you know, Nicholas Tucci and Paul Delever at the high school.

1327
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:36,566
[SPEAKER_17]: I cannot tell you what they go through on a daily basis, trying to flip-flop rooms and swapping teachers around and taking care of the kids.

1328
01:38:36,626 --> 01:38:41,349
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're keeping that school, schools very clean and taking good care of our kids.

1329
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:42,310
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to add that.

1330
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:44,872
[SPEAKER_17]: It's good to see everybody.

1331
01:38:45,868 --> 01:38:58,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we're going to have a strange year ahead, because we are, we sometimes meet people in our lives, who to coin a phrase is kind of corny, make a difference.

1332
01:38:59,263 --> 01:39:01,385
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had the pleasure years ago along with

1333
01:39:02,481 --> 01:39:12,527
[SPEAKER_17]: former Councilor Penter and Mr. Caraviello, I've known him and his family for years, who have made a remarkable difference because they really do their homework.

1334
01:39:13,268 --> 01:39:18,331
[SPEAKER_17]: But I became especially involved with some of the issues and you've heard me here too.

1335
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:27,697
[SPEAKER_17]: And I noticed over the years, there were only a few of you who really were here concerned about and mentioned taxpayer money.

1336
01:39:28,457 --> 01:39:29,238
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have to commend

1337
01:39:30,178 --> 01:39:36,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Councilor Marks, my friend, Michael Max, for his years and years of service being here.

1338
01:39:37,183 --> 01:39:40,686
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have a chance, we're gonna try to get this going, if you give us a chance.

1339
01:39:41,006 --> 01:39:41,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

1340
01:39:41,747 --> 01:39:47,912
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so everyone's got a chance to give both Councilor Falco and Councilor Marks some memories.

1341
01:39:47,952 --> 01:39:49,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, okay, we're back.

1342
01:39:49,793 --> 01:39:50,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1343
01:39:51,454 --> 01:39:52,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1344
01:39:52,155 --> 01:39:57,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So, tonight is the final meeting for

1345
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:03,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco, three terms on the council, and for Councilor Marks, a whole bunch of terms on the council.

1346
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:08,686
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start with Councilor Falco first.

1347
01:40:08,726 --> 01:40:09,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, Vice President Knight.

1348
01:40:11,888 --> 01:40:12,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Johnny.

1349
01:40:12,848 --> 01:40:13,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a good run, brother.

1350
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:15,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I first met John

1351
01:40:17,048 --> 01:40:18,269
[SPEAKER_04]: playing basketball at St.

1352
01:40:18,409 --> 01:40:32,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis in the CYO when he and his cousin Peter were coaching the team of misfits over there that he put in the back of his minivan and would drive around from church to church in the greater Boston region, helping us kids stay busy and stay off the streets as a teenager.

1353
01:40:33,058 --> 01:40:43,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And since that time I've always been very fond of john through our work in politics we've been able to develop a great friendship and it's something that I'm very thankful for john it's been great working with you it's a pleasure.

1354
01:40:44,284 --> 01:40:48,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like every year that I sit here on the council and serve as the term goes by.

1355
01:40:50,326 --> 01:40:51,167
[SPEAKER_04]: We lose another friend.

1356
01:40:51,667 --> 01:40:55,290
[SPEAKER_04]: First, it was Paul Camuso, then it was Freddie Dello Russo, and now I'm seeing you go.

1357
01:40:55,430 --> 01:41:00,394
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's this transition in government and this progress that we're seeing in this community that's great.

1358
01:41:00,474 --> 01:41:03,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, at the same time, we're losing a lot of great people with institutional knowledge.

1359
01:41:04,137 --> 01:41:05,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to be sadly missed.

1360
01:41:05,758 --> 01:41:08,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I always had a great pleasure working with you and a great time with you.

1361
01:41:09,261 --> 01:41:10,402
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of laughs and a lot of fun.

1362
01:41:11,195 --> 01:41:12,376
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we didn't agree all the time.

1363
01:41:12,396 --> 01:41:14,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we didn't agree, we sure got at it.

1364
01:41:14,258 --> 01:41:16,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we did agree, we did a lot of great work together.

1365
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:20,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, John, congratulations on 12 years of great service to this community.

1366
01:41:21,365 --> 01:41:25,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you to your wife and family for allowing us the opportunity to have you as well.

1367
01:41:25,768 --> 01:41:26,649
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's been a long run.

1368
01:41:26,669 --> 01:41:27,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a great run.

1369
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:32,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that this is the last we're going to see you in the field of politics.

1370
01:41:33,555 --> 01:41:34,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1371
01:41:35,537 --> 01:41:35,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

1372
01:41:36,738 --> 01:41:40,381
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't say it better than Councilor Knight, but it's been an honour to serve with you.

1373
01:41:40,401 --> 01:41:46,885
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the first Council President when I came on, and two months into that term, a global pandemic started.

1374
01:41:46,905 --> 01:41:54,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always appreciated your thoughtfulness and communication, leading this Council through unprecedented times.

1375
01:41:55,971 --> 01:41:57,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know,

1376
01:41:57,492 --> 01:42:09,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a lot in two years, more than I could even say right now but I think we've done a lot of good for this community you've done a lot of good for the 10 years before we served together on the school, when you were on school committee and city council.

1377
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:22,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you may have joined the school committee as I was leaving the Medford Public Schools and we had some difficult budgets back then after that 2008 recession.

1378
01:42:22,945 --> 01:42:30,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you worked hard with Councilor Scarpelli, Paula van der Kloot and many others to keep all of our programs intact.

1379
01:42:30,369 --> 01:42:35,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've had an impact on me directly, both as a colleague and as a leader before that.

1380
01:42:35,933 --> 01:42:37,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate your service.

1381
01:42:37,794 --> 01:42:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1382
01:42:40,955 --> 01:42:42,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1383
01:42:43,337 --> 01:42:46,739
[SPEAKER_16]: To my friend John Falco, it's a sad day.

1384
01:42:47,539 --> 01:42:48,280
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't lie to you.

1385
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:53,322
[SPEAKER_16]: I first want to thank his his family, his wife, Jackie.

1386
01:42:54,083 --> 01:43:00,386
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think anyone could say they had a better partner beside them.

1387
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that Jackie has

1388
01:43:04,205 --> 01:43:11,367
[SPEAKER_16]: showing that she supports you in every which way and allowing her to represent the city for so many years.

1389
01:43:11,447 --> 01:43:17,248
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that you've done an amazing job with your boys, John, Joey, and Jack.

1390
01:43:17,968 --> 01:43:26,870
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that it's a great, you show not only how, what kind of a leader you are, but also as a parent.

1391
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:34,984
[SPEAKER_16]: If only one day, you could dress down and make me feel okay.

1392
01:43:35,104 --> 01:43:35,625
[SPEAKER_16]: I dress.

1393
01:43:36,386 --> 01:43:37,206
[SPEAKER_16]: You just couldn't do it.

1394
01:43:37,347 --> 01:43:44,754
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought maybe today you'd show up with that fake tuxedo shirt and but you didn't do it john and I applaud you, but

1395
01:43:46,048 --> 01:43:47,108
[SPEAKER_16]: We've gone through a lot.

1396
01:43:47,749 --> 01:43:56,972
[SPEAKER_16]: We started this together some time ago and we decided the reason why we wanted to do it is because we love Medford and we wanted to do what's best for Medford.

1397
01:43:57,793 --> 01:44:09,398
[SPEAKER_16]: And you stepping up and challenging the mayor for the most important seat here in the city, I think gives you, shows a lot in who you are as a person.

1398
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:14,940
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of phone calls, I mean,

1399
01:44:16,005 --> 01:44:23,527
[SPEAKER_16]: I think other than Dina and I talking, I think you probably in the top three phone calls that we shared.

1400
01:44:24,047 --> 01:44:28,348
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't see eye to eye in some things, but we always respected each other.

1401
01:44:28,588 --> 01:44:33,310
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's what we see that we're lacking in society.

1402
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:39,651
[SPEAKER_16]: It's okay to disagree, but always have that respect for each other.

1403
01:44:39,691 --> 01:44:41,812
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that you've done that.

1404
01:44:41,892 --> 01:44:43,753
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been a great example of that.

1405
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:48,532
[SPEAKER_16]: called you my friend before we started this journey.

1406
01:44:49,213 --> 01:44:52,795
[SPEAKER_16]: And hopefully I call you a friend for a hundred more years.

1407
01:44:52,935 --> 01:44:54,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for everything you've done.

1408
01:44:55,897 --> 01:44:56,617
[SPEAKER_16]: It will be sad.

1409
01:44:56,637 --> 01:45:12,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that a lot of times when I look across the room, I look at my two colleagues to look for, you know, support and something I said or something somebody said, and all you guys have to do is show me your eyes and especially with these wonderful masks.

1410
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:21,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Your friendship and guidance is something that I'm going to miss as a Councilor, but I know we'll be together for a long time.

1411
01:45:21,893 --> 01:45:24,134
[SPEAKER_16]: So you've made your mother and father very proud.

1412
01:45:24,634 --> 01:45:26,195
[SPEAKER_16]: You've made the Falco name very proud.

1413
01:45:26,215 --> 01:45:28,736
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, and thank you for everything.

1414
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:30,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1415
01:45:34,018 --> 01:45:34,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1416
01:45:34,979 --> 01:45:39,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's hard to say what hasn't already been said, but I think just personally, I want to thank you, John.

1417
01:45:39,881 --> 01:45:43,382
[SPEAKER_01]: You've always treated me, um, even when I was first running just as a

1418
01:45:43,856 --> 01:45:53,801
[SPEAKER_01]: as a friend, rather than a foe, even if we didn't always agree on issues, you always were magnanimous and polite, and something that goes a long way in politics.

1419
01:45:54,842 --> 01:46:09,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been happy to sit next to you for this past year, just to have someone with institutional knowledge beside me, a little comic relief sometimes, and also just similar to what Councilor Scarpelli just said, just, you know, sometimes you have to, everyone has to make sure they heard the same thing.

1420
01:46:09,209 --> 01:46:11,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I appreciate that and your willingness

1421
01:46:12,295 --> 01:46:22,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, chat with me and, and also what Councilor bear said, you, um, you know, we're the first council president I work with and, um, it, it truly challenging and wild year.

1422
01:46:22,424 --> 01:46:26,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you worked your hardest to navigate as a strange space.

1423
01:46:26,908 --> 01:46:35,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And many times when, um, you know, the council was pretty acrimonious, uh, internally and, and I'm, you know, can see that's not easy.

1424
01:46:35,755 --> 01:46:40,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I really appreciate your work on that and just, um, your, your dedication to the city.

1425
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:46,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanna echo my fellow Councilors and thank you for your service and wish you all the best whatever may come next.

1426
01:46:48,301 --> 01:46:49,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you councilor.

1427
01:46:50,442 --> 01:46:50,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1428
01:46:53,244 --> 01:46:56,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1429
01:46:56,087 --> 01:46:59,589
[SPEAKER_15]: I truly believe we shouldn't recognize anyone if they're not here for over 20 years.

1430
01:46:59,869 --> 01:47:01,731
With that being said, John was the only guy

1431
01:47:10,472 --> 01:47:17,715
[SPEAKER_15]: that you can get in a disagreement and an argument with that was so nice that you didn't realize you were arguing with him.

1432
01:47:18,595 --> 01:47:20,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, John was nice about everything.

1433
01:47:21,417 --> 01:47:25,078
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't ever remember a bad word said about John Falco.

1434
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:32,401
[SPEAKER_15]: And John, I refer to as someone that walks soft but carried a big stick.

1435
01:47:33,522 --> 01:47:36,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And this council, over the six years John served,

1436
01:47:37,734 --> 01:47:48,994
[SPEAKER_15]: made some major changes to things that people in the public may not know or didn't receive press, but it was John Falco that revamped our whole budgeting process.

1437
01:47:49,993 --> 01:48:03,661
[SPEAKER_15]: It was John Falco's expertise in budgeting and finance that led to major changes on how we review the budget and how we as a council request the administration to present the budget to us.

1438
01:48:04,121 --> 01:48:05,762
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was thanks to John Falco.

1439
01:48:06,342 --> 01:48:15,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And that wasn't press, that was anything other than John wanting to do the right thing and making the process transparent, which leads to my other point.

1440
01:48:16,608 --> 01:48:17,749
[SPEAKER_15]: It was John Falco

1441
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:25,031
[SPEAKER_15]: during this COVID period for the last 22 months that stood up and said, we need to still operate government.

1442
01:48:25,391 --> 01:48:27,092
[SPEAKER_15]: We still need to have transparency.

1443
01:48:27,412 --> 01:48:34,353
[SPEAKER_15]: We still need to include the community, even though we may not have open forums or forums people can attend.

1444
01:48:34,953 --> 01:48:45,355
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was John that led the charge to make sure in our Committee of the Whole meetings and subcommittee meetings that may not be on the floor were taped and televised live.

1445
01:48:46,339 --> 01:48:47,319
[SPEAKER_15]: That was john Falco.

1446
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that didn't get a ton of fanfare.

1447
01:48:49,821 --> 01:48:54,683
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you talk about transparency, john just didn't talk the talk he walked the walk.

1448
01:48:55,243 --> 01:49:00,005
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was a major change of this council, and it led to boards and commissions.

1449
01:49:00,611 --> 01:49:03,173
[SPEAKER_15]: and other entities in the community fall in suit.

1450
01:49:03,633 --> 01:49:07,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So for those two reasons, Mr. President, I wanna thank John Falco.

1451
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:10,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this is not the last we're gonna see of John in this community.

1452
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:16,861
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's a great family man, as we can see from his family and three sons and his wife in the audience.

1453
01:49:17,481 --> 01:49:20,743
[SPEAKER_15]: And John, it was a pleasure serving with you for the past six years.

1454
01:49:21,864 --> 01:49:22,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1455
01:49:23,244 --> 01:49:28,528
[SPEAKER_07]: John and I became pretty good friends over the last four or five years.

1456
01:49:29,677 --> 01:49:37,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think a day or two didn't go by where I didn't talk to john Falco on a daily basis.

1457
01:49:37,842 --> 01:49:39,183
[SPEAKER_07]: They talked to my wife.

1458
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:47,889
[SPEAKER_07]: They say, you know, Councilmarks brought up some real good points about things john did.

1459
01:49:48,209 --> 01:49:50,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, john was a great leader here of the community.

1460
01:49:50,871 --> 01:49:54,553
[SPEAKER_07]: He led us through a very difficult time in the city.

1461
01:49:55,233 --> 01:49:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank him for his leadership.

1462
01:49:58,668 --> 01:50:13,872
[SPEAKER_07]: John, I know Representative Donato has a little something for you, and the city has a city council or something, but John, I wanna thank you for your friendship over the years, and thank your wife for giving us to you for all these years, and your mother and father for producing a good son like you.

1463
01:50:13,892 --> 01:50:14,752
[SPEAKER_07]: John, thank you very much.

1464
01:50:14,932 --> 01:50:16,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And Representative Donato, would you?

1465
01:50:20,554 --> 01:50:24,975
[SPEAKER_07]: What if John doesn't wanna share the spotlight with you?

1466
01:50:25,355 --> 01:50:27,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, John, if you'd like to come forward.

1467
01:50:35,892 --> 01:50:41,516
[SPEAKER_07]: John, on behalf of our other Councilors here, we have this plaque for you for years of service to the community.

1468
01:50:42,056 --> 01:50:42,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank you.

1469
01:50:42,797 --> 01:50:46,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know we haven't seen the last of you.

1470
01:50:47,239 --> 01:50:50,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'll still be calling you.

1471
01:50:50,402 --> 01:50:50,962
[SPEAKER_23]: No problem.

1472
01:50:50,982 --> 01:50:51,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1473
01:50:51,923 --> 01:50:52,783
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much.

1474
01:50:52,803 --> 01:51:04,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, John.

1475
01:51:14,217 --> 01:51:17,020
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I will be brief.

1476
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:19,802
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to take this off, but I will be brief.

1477
01:51:33,337 --> 01:51:36,360
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't thank you enough all for your very kind words.

1478
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:41,424
[SPEAKER_23]: It is absolutely been a pleasure serving with each and every one of you.

1479
01:51:42,725 --> 01:51:47,930
[SPEAKER_23]: Zach and Nicole, it's only been two years, but Adam, George, Michael, Rick.

1480
01:51:48,848 --> 01:51:55,516
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been six and it has been an absolute pleasure to serve with each and every one of you.

1481
01:51:55,596 --> 01:51:59,720
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we maybe didn't always agree on everything, but we agree to disagree and we move on.

1482
01:52:00,261 --> 01:52:04,366
[SPEAKER_23]: Because we always had the common goal of moving Medford forward.

1483
01:52:04,906 --> 01:52:08,290
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what was always most important to all of us and

1484
01:52:09,497 --> 01:52:22,743
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, the council always works well when we work together, but there are disagreements, and we've had disagreements, but we move forward, and I think, you know, we've been a really good team, and we've got a lot of work done over the past six years.

1485
01:52:23,223 --> 01:52:24,163
[SPEAKER_23]: So I thank you.

1486
01:52:24,283 --> 01:52:27,465
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been a real pleasure working with each and every one here.

1487
01:52:28,485 --> 01:52:38,550
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanna thank, you know, everyone here tonight, those that are at home, and especially thank my wife, Jackie, in the back, and my three sons, John, Joey, and Jack,

1488
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:43,021
[SPEAKER_23]: for all of their support throughout the years.

1489
01:52:43,581 --> 01:52:49,806
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, to be a selected official, to be a successful elected official, you really need that support at home.

1490
01:52:50,506 --> 01:52:53,789
[SPEAKER_23]: And Jackie and the boys have always been very, very supportive.

1491
01:52:53,829 --> 01:52:57,692
[SPEAKER_23]: So I wanna thank them for their love and their support through the past 12 years.

1492
01:52:58,673 --> 01:53:06,559
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been an absolute honor and a privilege to serve the city of Medford the past 12 years as a member of the,

1493
01:53:08,133 --> 01:53:10,295
[SPEAKER_23]: school committee and as a member of the city council.

1494
01:53:10,895 --> 01:53:20,802
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can't thank you enough for having the confidence in me to be reelected numerous times to the school committee and to the city council.

1495
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:25,405
[SPEAKER_23]: During my tenure in the school committee, I had the opportunity to work with some great people.

1496
01:53:26,271 --> 01:53:36,841
[SPEAKER_23]: And to make improvements both inside of the schools and outside of the schools, new science labs, field of dreams, updated technology, updated vocational school, renovated swimming pool.

1497
01:53:37,461 --> 01:53:39,223
[SPEAKER_23]: But that comes when you work as a team.

1498
01:53:39,283 --> 01:53:40,824
[SPEAKER_23]: And we did that on the school committee.

1499
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:43,627
[SPEAKER_23]: We had the honor of working with some really great people.

1500
01:53:44,207 --> 01:53:52,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Paula Van der Kloot, Emery Cuno, Sharon Guzik, Billy O'Keefe, Bob Skerry, Aaron DiBenedetto, and my good friend, George Scarpell.

1501
01:53:53,492 --> 01:53:56,253
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we keep like you said, George, we came into this 12 years ago.

1502
01:53:57,034 --> 01:54:01,396
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, I remember working really hard on the school committee when we came in.

1503
01:54:01,416 --> 01:54:03,157
[SPEAKER_23]: And we had all kinds of goals.

1504
01:54:03,197 --> 01:54:06,718
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think we accomplished a lot of those and we left at a better place.

1505
01:54:07,959 --> 01:54:13,681
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know, that continues and you know that the next group is stepping up in there, you know, they're making progress as well.

1506
01:54:14,482 --> 01:54:20,144
[SPEAKER_23]: And on the city council, I had an opportunity to work with some great talented people in spearheaded some projects here as well.

1507
01:54:20,825 --> 01:54:21,505
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I said, you know,

1508
01:54:22,127 --> 01:54:43,152
[SPEAKER_23]: Even if, you know, I spare something individually or if any of us had something individual, it always takes the support of your colleagues to move it forward, like cameras in the community hall of the city council office, you know, to televise all of our meetings, you know, support of having our, you know, community police meetings moved out into the neighborhoods.

1509
01:54:43,552 --> 01:54:46,513
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, those are things that zoning, zoning reform.

1510
01:54:46,553 --> 01:54:47,853
[SPEAKER_23]: And those are things that I like to think that

1511
01:54:48,348 --> 01:54:52,871
[SPEAKER_23]: I let on, but you know, it takes support from your colleagues and you've all been very supportive.

1512
01:54:52,891 --> 01:54:53,832
[SPEAKER_23]: So I thank you for that.

1513
01:54:55,033 --> 01:55:04,340
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been, like I said, it's, you know, it works well when the council works together and, you know, together we moved a lot of, you know, projects forward.

1514
01:55:04,921 --> 01:55:06,342
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank you so much.

1515
01:55:06,382 --> 01:55:09,724
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, President Caraviello, we've known each other for years and you're right.

1516
01:55:09,944 --> 01:55:15,709
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there were many days I just had to talk to you more than I talked to Jackie, but you know, it's our passion for,

1517
01:55:16,566 --> 01:55:18,807
[SPEAKER_23]: City politics and making the city a better place.

1518
01:55:19,327 --> 01:55:25,710
[SPEAKER_23]: Council and I. You've been great to talk to probably one of the smartest people I know in city government knows how things work.

1519
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:33,933
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, process procedure and you've always been on top of that and, you know, I thank you for all your help and the guidance there.

1520
01:55:39,074 --> 01:55:40,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Our friendship goes back a long way.

1521
01:55:41,316 --> 01:55:46,760
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, there were many times where, you know, we'd have serious conversations, but we'd laugh a lot along the way.

1522
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,182
[SPEAKER_23]: And that always helped.

1523
01:55:51,283 --> 01:55:54,566
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Marks, the senior statesman of the city council.

1524
01:55:55,767 --> 01:56:02,011
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't even tell you how many times probably over the past year, I looked at you and I said, well, you know what?

1525
01:56:03,312 --> 01:56:03,673
[SPEAKER_23]: He's right.

1526
01:56:04,515 --> 01:56:06,416
[SPEAKER_23]: It's absolutely right, just here.

1527
01:56:08,636 --> 01:56:15,999
[SPEAKER_23]: I realized just over time, but it's funny, you had the experience, it's been valuable.

1528
01:56:16,559 --> 01:56:25,061
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's something that we always have to remember, I think as Councilors moving forward, is that there's processes and there's procedures and they're there for a reason.

1529
01:56:26,122 --> 01:56:29,643
[SPEAKER_23]: And you always make a good point saying, this is how we're supposed to do this.

1530
01:56:31,063 --> 01:56:35,685
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot can be said for that, because when you don't have processes and procedures, things fall apart.

1531
01:56:36,645 --> 01:56:40,666
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's important that we follow those processes and procedures and whatnot.

1532
01:56:41,126 --> 01:56:42,067
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank you.

1533
01:56:42,207 --> 01:56:43,647
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been a pleasure serving with you.

1534
01:56:44,207 --> 01:56:45,408
[SPEAKER_23]: And thank you so much.

1535
01:56:47,529 --> 01:56:55,411
[SPEAKER_23]: Fred DeLaRusso, not here tonight, but he was someone that I truly enjoyed sharing, working with over time.

1536
01:56:55,791 --> 01:56:59,713
[SPEAKER_23]: I maybe didn't agree with him all the time.

1537
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:15,661
[SPEAKER_23]: Fred, he was great to work with.

1538
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:16,841
[SPEAKER_23]: We didn't agree on a lot.

1539
01:57:16,961 --> 01:57:19,222
[SPEAKER_23]: I shouldn't say we didn't agree on a lot, but there were many things we didn't agree on.

1540
01:57:19,242 --> 01:57:21,723
[SPEAKER_23]: But once again, we agreed to disagree.

1541
01:57:21,743 --> 01:57:24,724
[SPEAKER_23]: He was someone that I could call, someone that I could talk to.

1542
01:57:25,224 --> 01:57:27,744
[SPEAKER_23]: And he was fabulous to work with.

1543
01:57:27,804 --> 01:57:34,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Zach and Nicole, like I said, we only worked together for two years, but you've been great to work with.

1544
01:57:34,786 --> 01:57:37,507
[SPEAKER_23]: I know if I ever, Nicole's on screen here.

1545
01:57:38,209 --> 01:57:44,755
[SPEAKER_23]: But I know it's always been, if I need to call you and talk to you, it's always been a pleasure talking to you.

1546
01:57:44,795 --> 01:57:45,896
[SPEAKER_23]: You always take my calls.

1547
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:48,578
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's been great working with the both of you.

1548
01:57:49,659 --> 01:57:51,260
[SPEAKER_23]: So I thank you very much for your time.

1549
01:57:52,021 --> 01:57:53,022
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank you.

1550
01:57:54,443 --> 01:57:55,604
[SPEAKER_23]: for working with you.

1551
01:57:56,244 --> 01:57:57,464
[SPEAKER_23]: You've both been great.

1552
01:57:58,085 --> 01:58:02,046
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, and I also want to thank Mayor McGlynn and Mayor Stephanie Michini-Burke.

1553
01:58:02,406 --> 01:58:07,709
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I worked with them both on the school committee and on the city council for 12 years.

1554
01:58:08,589 --> 01:58:16,312
[SPEAKER_23]: They, you know, leadership starts at the top and they led a lot of great initiatives and did a lot of great work.

1555
01:58:16,672 --> 01:58:17,593
[SPEAKER_23]: Representative Donato.

1556
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,643
[SPEAKER_23]: You've been a friend for many years, and it has always been a pleasure working with you.

1557
01:58:24,663 --> 01:58:29,827
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank you for your friendship and for your advice through the years.

1558
01:58:30,307 --> 01:58:31,668
[SPEAKER_23]: You've been great to work with.

1559
01:58:31,828 --> 01:58:43,976
[SPEAKER_23]: If I ever had any questions regarding what was happening at the state level and how it was going to impact our city, you always did answer and answer the call, and I thank you for that.

1560
01:58:46,213 --> 01:58:56,170
[SPEAKER_23]: And I represent about Lee and representative Barbara and Senate jail and I thank them as well and it's it's it's been an honor to work with with all of you.

1561
01:58:57,484 --> 01:58:58,705
[SPEAKER_23]: And thank you to the department heads.

1562
01:58:59,465 --> 01:59:02,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Now there are many department heads that we have here at City Hall.

1563
01:59:03,529 --> 01:59:05,530
[SPEAKER_23]: There are many that don't work here any longer.

1564
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:10,554
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank them, both those that are here and those that aren't here any longer.

1565
01:59:11,435 --> 01:59:12,036
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank them.

1566
01:59:12,616 --> 01:59:19,321
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank all of the workers in the City of Medford and the school system that are here day in,

1567
01:59:19,982 --> 01:59:21,903
[SPEAKER_23]: day out, making it happen.

1568
01:59:22,323 --> 01:59:29,686
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, the policemen, the police officers, the firefighters, like I said, everyone in this in our school system, thanks to them.

1569
01:59:29,706 --> 01:59:39,670
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, take a look at the people that you know, we don't think of that, not that we don't think of that often, but the people that are always there working 24 seven, there's a there's a water leak in the middle of February and

1570
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:45,392
[SPEAKER_23]: someone's freezing water, trying to repair it to make sure that people have running water in their neighborhoods.

1571
01:59:45,592 --> 01:59:51,633
[SPEAKER_23]: And those are the people that they're not recognized as often as they should.

1572
01:59:52,214 --> 02:00:01,856
[SPEAKER_23]: And I wanna thank each and every one of them for all of their help, all of their support, answering my phone calls when I had questions that needed to be answered.

1573
02:00:01,876 --> 02:00:03,657
[SPEAKER_23]: So I wanna thank them as well.

1574
02:00:04,457 --> 02:00:07,118
[SPEAKER_23]: And Larry Lepore,

1575
02:00:08,207 --> 02:00:09,427
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for being here every week.

1576
02:00:09,447 --> 02:00:13,689
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize that you have had to look at the back of my head for the past six years.

1577
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,911
[SPEAKER_23]: But it has been an absolute pleasure working with you.

1578
02:00:18,931 --> 02:00:20,551
[SPEAKER_23]: You've always had a smile on your face.

1579
02:00:20,571 --> 02:00:22,312
[SPEAKER_23]: You've been great to talk to.

1580
02:00:22,752 --> 02:00:25,913
[SPEAKER_23]: It's always nice to see you when you drop by with the agenda every Friday.

1581
02:00:26,293 --> 02:00:28,134
[SPEAKER_23]: So I thank you for being a good friend for the years.

1582
02:00:29,421 --> 02:00:32,023
[SPEAKER_23]: And I want to wish I just didn't get.

1583
02:00:32,924 --> 02:00:33,324
[SPEAKER_23]: Good luck.

1584
02:00:33,344 --> 02:00:37,127
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I hope you enjoy this as much as I have.

1585
02:00:37,667 --> 02:00:47,234
[SPEAKER_23]: This has been a thrill of a lifetime to represent the residents of our great city, and I want to wish you well in the future years and in the term ahead.

1586
02:00:48,695 --> 02:00:50,997
[SPEAKER_23]: On a personal note, I want to thank my campaign committee.

1587
02:00:52,105 --> 02:01:01,889
[SPEAKER_23]: In all my friends that have helped out with the various campaigns over the past 12 years, I believe they say it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

1588
02:01:02,589 --> 02:01:05,470
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's been an amazing journey over the past 12 years.

1589
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:09,952
[SPEAKER_23]: I have met a lot of friends that will be friends for life.

1590
02:01:10,811 --> 02:01:15,435
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can say that, especially in the past year running for mayor.

1591
02:01:15,856 --> 02:01:25,424
[SPEAKER_23]: There's so many people that I met along the way that he did not know prior to that were just fabulous and they're great friends today, and they'll always be friends.

1592
02:01:26,145 --> 02:01:31,830
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, in, you know, in hindsight thinking back at the 12 years they think about.

1593
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:37,111
[SPEAKER_23]: condolence resolutions that come up every so often.

1594
02:01:37,391 --> 02:01:44,435
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, you start to think about the many community members that we've lost along the way and the impact that they've had.

1595
02:01:45,055 --> 02:01:52,198
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, and, you know, I just, it brings back fond memories, the people and the impact that they've had on our community.

1596
02:01:52,258 --> 02:01:57,540
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, they had a big impact on what we do here each week as well.

1597
02:01:58,461 --> 02:01:59,881
[SPEAKER_23]: In closing,

1598
02:02:02,015 --> 02:02:02,835
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank everyone.

1599
02:02:03,075 --> 02:02:08,137
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I said, it has been an honor and a privilege to represent everyone here in the city of Medford.

1600
02:02:08,197 --> 02:02:13,680
[SPEAKER_23]: I absolutely love this job and I hope that I have served you well.

1601
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,320
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for the opportunity to serve.

1602
02:02:16,181 --> 02:02:18,341
[SPEAKER_23]: And like I said, it's been an honor and a privilege.

1603
02:02:18,662 --> 02:02:19,642
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you and be well.

1604
02:02:34,184 --> 02:02:34,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1605
02:03:02,647 --> 02:03:06,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, Councilor Marks.

1606
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:11,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So tonight, close to 40 years of institutional knowledge is walking out the store.

1607
02:03:13,073 --> 02:03:20,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And like Councilor Falco said earlier, institutional knowledge is key and who to call and who not to call.

1608
02:03:20,378 --> 02:03:24,760
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I wanna thank you, John and Michael for your many years of service.

1609
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So Councilor Knight.

1610
02:03:29,442 --> 02:03:30,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only been eight years, huh, Michael?

1611
02:03:31,243 --> 02:03:34,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels like eight minutes underwater.

1612
02:03:39,587 --> 02:03:41,188
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'll joke it aside, Michael.

1613
02:03:41,929 --> 02:03:58,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I can honestly say that I owe you a debt of gratitude for making me a better Councilor, because I knew every day that I came into these chambers, I had to be on my A game, because you were prepared, you were ready, and most importantly, you held your colleagues accountable.

1614
02:03:58,655 --> 02:04:00,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something I always respected you for.

1615
02:04:01,357 --> 02:04:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: You hold your colleagues accountable.

1616
02:04:03,158 --> 02:04:05,140
[SPEAKER_04]: You said what you meant, you did what you were going to say.

1617
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:06,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's commendable.

1618
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:11,984
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't too many politicians around anymore these days that are what they are and do what they do and say what they say.

1619
02:04:12,445 --> 02:04:14,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And you walk the walk and you talk the talk.

1620
02:04:14,726 --> 02:04:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really been great working with you.

1621
02:04:16,467 --> 02:04:17,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned a lot from you.

1622
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:28,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, you know, I've always looked forward to those Tuesday nights, when Parker Musa was sitting in that chair and you were sitting here and I was sitting here and Bob Penta was sitting there and Freddie was here and Brianna was here.

1623
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd see fireworks.

1624
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Some nights on issues that we didn't agree on.

1625
02:04:32,562 --> 02:04:35,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on nights, and the things that we did agree on and we were clicking.

1626
02:04:35,764 --> 02:04:40,168
[SPEAKER_04]: What great work we were able to accomplish, and over the last couple of years, you know,

1627
02:04:40,989 --> 02:04:48,136
[SPEAKER_04]: As I matured in my role I've come to agree with you in a lot more things than I did when I first started and I think that that comes with the experience of the job.

1628
02:04:48,596 --> 02:04:55,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also comes with having that open line of communication and being able to respect each other as colleagues and professionals, and I always have had that respect for you.

1629
02:04:56,364 --> 02:05:01,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank you for all the service that you provided this community it's been a long run, it's been a long run.

1630
02:05:02,223 --> 02:05:11,070
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we shared a great story today when you said that my father had sent you an email relative to the service that you provided to this community, and I think that that just goes to show you how.

1631
02:05:12,253 --> 02:05:26,721
[SPEAKER_04]: highly we hold you in our household, although we don't necessarily agree all the time, we've always been able to move past that for the greater good which is this community and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with you, and I look forward to being able to serve with you in some capacity in the future, whatever it may be.

1632
02:05:27,582 --> 02:05:34,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really someone that has a vision is someone that wants to execute that vision and is someone that's always cared about the city more than you've cared about anything else.

1633
02:05:36,567 --> 02:05:38,828
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, Mike, congratulations.

1634
02:05:38,908 --> 02:05:39,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a great run.

1635
02:05:39,668 --> 02:05:42,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, you've been here for a very long time.

1636
02:05:42,049 --> 02:05:55,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I can remember the first time I met you, um, when I was, you know, just out of college working for Senator Shannon and you were running for a city council and, uh, Billy Wood was giving me, uh, the business file holding science with Paul Camuso because I was coming out of the Senator's office.

1637
02:05:56,292 --> 02:06:00,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that was, uh, how many years ago, geez, you know?

1638
02:06:00,654 --> 02:06:03,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so Mike, it's just, it's been a great, great run.

1639
02:06:03,154 --> 02:06:05,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go on and on and on and not pat you on the back, but, uh,

1640
02:06:05,735 --> 02:06:07,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you know what you've accomplished.

1641
02:06:07,157 --> 02:06:17,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been someone that's been putting results before the rhetoric and someone who's always been able to walk the walk and hold his head proud because he's been able to look at the mirror every morning and nobody's believed is right.

1642
02:06:18,108 --> 02:06:18,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that.

1643
02:06:19,669 --> 02:06:20,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1644
02:06:20,070 --> 02:06:21,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

1645
02:06:22,792 --> 02:06:23,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1646
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:40,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably in these past two years I've been in more meetings with you than any other Councilor we've served on subcommittees, obviously these meetings committee of the whole, and and your historical knowledge, your understanding of something that started 20 years ago and we're still dealing with it now.

1647
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:45,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's been incredibly helpful to me in the smallest situation of the biggest situation.

1648
02:06:46,605 --> 02:06:51,749
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also have to count echo Councilor Knight, and we've had a few knockdown drag outs here.

1649
02:06:51,769 --> 02:06:55,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And welcome.

1650
02:06:55,871 --> 02:07:06,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, every time I'm like, maybe I'll be a little less anxious when Michael gets that bulldog attitude on and he's coming at you, but it makes me think about what I'm doing.

1651
02:07:06,818 --> 02:07:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: what I'm bringing to the table, the argument that I wanna put forward at that specific moment.

1652
02:07:11,542 --> 02:07:24,792
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we even had one tonight and I'm glad we're going out on the same page that we've been going on the whole time because exactly what Councilor Knight said, you make me a better councilor, you make me more knowledgeable about what's going on in the city.

1653
02:07:25,512 --> 02:07:28,294
[SPEAKER_03]: You changed my mind more than I expected when I started.

1654
02:07:29,375 --> 02:07:33,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only that, you've been in public service as long as I can remember here in Medford.

1655
02:07:34,499 --> 02:07:41,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember holding out a sign in 2003 for Bruce Kulik, because his daughter was in my elementary school class.

1656
02:07:42,001 --> 02:07:44,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And your signs are out there, and they have been ever since then.

1657
02:07:45,342 --> 02:07:51,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can't be understated, what you've given to the city, the time, your family, and your service.

1658
02:07:52,003 --> 02:08:01,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it will be missed, and it is definitely deeply appreciated and evidenced by the many, many times that you've been re-elected by the residents of this community.

1659
02:08:01,726 --> 02:08:02,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1660
02:08:02,426 --> 02:08:02,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1661
02:08:02,986 --> 02:08:03,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bates.

1662
02:08:04,018 --> 02:08:06,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1663
02:08:07,699 --> 02:08:08,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council President.

1664
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:20,502
[SPEAKER_16]: First, again, I think we owe a great gratitude to Mike's wife, Lisa, his daughters, Gianna and Olivia, and son, Evan.

1665
02:08:21,282 --> 02:08:29,144
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that when we've talked, we've talked so proudly of your children, and it makes me a better father.

1666
02:08:30,865 --> 02:08:31,405
[SPEAKER_16]: As a person,

1667
02:08:33,445 --> 02:08:40,471
[SPEAKER_16]: When I got that phone call, when you called me and said Georgia decided to step down, whether you realize it or not, it got choked up.

1668
02:08:40,811 --> 02:08:55,483
[SPEAKER_16]: And because I think that what Michael Marx has taught us is to love Medford, be true to who you are and fight for the community members, whether you know them or not.

1669
02:08:56,955 --> 02:09:12,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody talks about charter review and wanting to have precinct award representation, Michael Marx is a great example, why that might not help why that might not work, because Michael Marx worked as hard as he could for someone that lived in Wellington Glenwood.

1670
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:18,043
[SPEAKER_16]: or someone who lived in Hillside or someone from West Medford and North Medford or South Medford.

1671
02:09:18,604 --> 02:09:21,186
[SPEAKER_16]: You worked hard for every single person.

1672
02:09:21,866 --> 02:09:23,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only that, you were prepared.

1673
02:09:23,387 --> 02:09:27,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think I said this probably one of the most impressive evenings.

1674
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:37,398
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember that night that you came out and talked about an issue and you were so thorough and so prepared that I don't know how we as a council couldn't support you.

1675
02:09:38,258 --> 02:09:42,882
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's what you've always done because you've believed in what you wanted to say.

1676
02:09:44,505 --> 02:09:45,546
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I'll say it again.

1677
02:09:45,566 --> 02:10:04,759
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that if society understood what happens in these chambers and we can all understand to agree to disagree and have the pride and respect for a person across from you that might not look at things the same way, but maybe understand it.

1678
02:10:05,579 --> 02:10:12,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I tell you a lot of times I didn't agree what you were saying, but I had to take a step back like my dad taught me with his Jesuit upbringing.

1679
02:10:13,797 --> 02:10:20,880
[SPEAKER_16]: To put yourself in that person's shoes and I realized a lot of time, boy, you don't wear to eat.

1680
02:10:22,341 --> 02:10:27,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And my feet hurt because I stood in your shoes so many times and realized, wow, that man is right.

1681
02:10:28,523 --> 02:10:30,724
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of the time is because you love Medford.

1682
02:10:34,152 --> 02:10:39,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna, it's gonna be tough because one thing you realized is what a good man you are.

1683
02:10:39,735 --> 02:10:44,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of people, you know, when you first got on that, all that Michael Mox, he's something.

1684
02:10:45,138 --> 02:10:49,100
[SPEAKER_16]: He just, he's just an angry man and he's just not a good man.

1685
02:10:49,821 --> 02:10:57,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you sit with the man, you realize what a great individual, what a great father, what a great husband, what a great friend.

1686
02:10:58,195 --> 02:11:06,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I tell you, Mike, when I might have something down with my family, you were there, the phone call was there, had nothing to do with city council.

1687
02:11:07,257 --> 02:11:10,958
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, whether it was a edible arrangement for my daughter when she was going through a tough time.

1688
02:11:11,618 --> 02:11:16,279
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I said today is Council Marks' last day, she says, I have basketball.

1689
02:11:17,479 --> 02:11:18,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I watch it?

1690
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:18,920
[SPEAKER_16]: I said, you can watch it.

1691
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:23,701
[SPEAKER_16]: But she really wanted to be here because you make impacts on people's lives that you don't even know.

1692
02:11:24,567 --> 02:11:42,657
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will tell you, I know that what you've given this city, I don't know if people really truly appreciate it until you're gone, but you have made a fighter out of every single one of us and taught us how to do it the right way.

1693
02:11:43,217 --> 02:11:46,759
[SPEAKER_16]: So my friend, thank you for all your years of service.

1694
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:53,482
[SPEAKER_16]: You set a path that people should follow, that passion should be in our hearts, no matter if you're here a year or 44 years.

1695
02:11:55,097 --> 02:11:59,660
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will carry that on with me until my last day in the seat.

1696
02:12:00,001 --> 02:12:02,402
[SPEAKER_16]: And you'll always be my friend.

1697
02:12:02,642 --> 02:12:04,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's what's more important.

1698
02:12:04,324 --> 02:12:05,584
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1699
02:12:05,985 --> 02:12:06,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1700
02:12:06,365 --> 02:12:07,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1701
02:12:08,306 --> 02:12:08,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell.

1702
02:12:09,667 --> 02:12:10,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1703
02:12:11,108 --> 02:12:20,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Marks, I mean, it's no secret that we don't always agree, but I have always truly respected just the amount of homework you do before every meeting.

1704
02:12:20,995 --> 02:12:24,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see it on the papers next to you, the amount of preparation you come

1705
02:12:25,564 --> 02:12:27,425
[SPEAKER_01]: to meetings with and ready to speak.

1706
02:12:27,525 --> 02:12:36,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think a meeting has gone by where you haven't asked a question or raised a point that's made me kind of rethink or reframe how I'm thinking about a topic.

1707
02:12:36,807 --> 02:12:44,149
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not totally change my vote, but it absolutely provides a perspective that I didn't think of and is so needed and so welcome in these meetings.

1708
02:12:45,169 --> 02:12:52,491
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone who perhaps my signature is my brevity, I am truly impressed and amazed at your ability to speak at length on topics

1709
02:12:52,935 --> 02:12:59,739
[SPEAKER_01]: and not repeat yourself, it's truly, it's unlike anything else anyone else can do, and it's very impressive.

1710
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:04,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, in the two years we've worked together, you've never phoned it in.

1711
02:13:05,363 --> 02:13:18,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even at 11 p.m., which maybe sometimes some of us would like you to phone it in, if it was an issue that you were passionate about, that residents cared about, you were ready to fight, and you were ready to speak your piece on it, and that's absolutely admirable.

1712
02:13:19,231 --> 02:13:21,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Councilor Scarpelli just said,

1713
02:13:23,141 --> 02:13:48,126
[SPEAKER_01]: door knocking campaigning talking to residents around the city I've met many many members of your fan club people who are very appreciative of the work you do, and you as an individual and you leaving the council, you're going to be deeply missed by the community and I thank you as others have said for for challenging me challenging me to be a better Councilor and know just, I have to come to every meeting and be on my toes because of you and I thank you for that and your service to the city for so long.

1714
02:13:49,686 --> 02:13:49,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1715
02:13:50,407 --> 02:13:50,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1716
02:13:51,067 --> 02:13:51,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1717
02:13:53,563 --> 02:13:59,229
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I'd like to thank Michael for his many, many years of service.

1718
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:04,574
[SPEAKER_23]: You've been a great colleague, you've been a great friend.

1719
02:14:04,594 --> 02:14:10,360
[SPEAKER_23]: You've always kept all of us on our toes, and that's a good thing.

1720
02:14:12,108 --> 02:14:21,454
[SPEAKER_23]: You are amazing when it comes to a number of things, but constituent services, I think, has been your wheelhouse, no matter who I talk to.

1721
02:14:21,514 --> 02:14:22,554
[SPEAKER_23]: I talk to Councilor Marks.

1722
02:14:22,734 --> 02:14:25,236
[SPEAKER_23]: I talk to Councilor Marks.

1723
02:14:26,297 --> 02:14:31,640
[SPEAKER_23]: Just the way you know so much about everything with regard to the issues that are happening in this city.

1724
02:14:32,738 --> 02:14:46,102
[SPEAKER_23]: And like I said before, you bring that institutional knowledge of how things have been done before in the past, or maybe if something has changed, and then you point out why it has changed and why it's important to do things the way we're doing things.

1725
02:14:46,602 --> 02:14:47,982
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's been huge.

1726
02:14:48,802 --> 02:14:52,984
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's been great serving with you.

1727
02:14:53,024 --> 02:14:54,204
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been very educational.

1728
02:14:55,404 --> 02:14:58,205
[SPEAKER_23]: You come to each and every meeting.

1729
02:15:00,058 --> 02:15:04,321
[SPEAKER_23]: ready to talk ready to debate ready to talk about the issues, you're always prepared.

1730
02:15:05,282 --> 02:15:14,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I have the customer said you always have you know your files you actually I was a few weeks ago you clean out your file cabinet I don't know how many trips you made.

1731
02:15:18,585 --> 02:15:27,230
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of paper there, but you know you've always come armed and with data and you do the research you do the work.

1732
02:15:28,491 --> 02:15:39,537
[SPEAKER_23]: You know it's it's been great serving with you, I you know we've had some comical times over the past year, so I know we had a I think back to committee, the whole meeting we had on Sydney street.

1733
02:15:40,979 --> 02:15:45,422
[SPEAKER_23]: in the woods behind the Budweiser plant.

1734
02:15:45,442 --> 02:15:48,164
[SPEAKER_23]: The trees are going into the residents yard.

1735
02:15:48,264 --> 02:15:52,126
[SPEAKER_23]: We had to go back there and have a committee of the whole and we're tripping all over the place.

1736
02:15:52,727 --> 02:16:00,632
[SPEAKER_23]: But, you know, Michael had the history with regard to, you know, I think how Budweiser was supposed to be, you know, maintaining the property and they weren't.

1737
02:16:00,732 --> 02:16:04,515
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, we called them out on it and they resolved the issue.

1738
02:16:05,315 --> 02:16:07,877
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, like I said, constituent services has been,

1739
02:16:10,490 --> 02:16:14,593
[SPEAKER_23]: You're just amazing when it comes to that, and a number of other things, but you've always been there.

1740
02:16:14,613 --> 02:16:25,680
[SPEAKER_23]: I know when I've called and asked you questions, you've taken the time to walk me through that, to walk me through different issues and whatnot, and it's been an absolute pleasure to serve with you.

1741
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:30,183
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you're a great dad and a great family.

1742
02:16:30,243 --> 02:16:38,849
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanna thank your kids for sharing your dad with us for the many years that he served here and that he's given back to the city.

1743
02:16:40,550 --> 02:16:47,594
[SPEAKER_23]: It's hard to believe it's been 20 years, but I want to wish you well moving forward.

1744
02:16:47,614 --> 02:16:49,695
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you're gonna, I know you'll still be involved.

1745
02:16:50,735 --> 02:16:59,119
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you love living in the city of Medford and I know you love being involved and I can't thank you enough for the guidance that you've given me through the years.

1746
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:02,101
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a little story.

1747
02:17:02,921 --> 02:17:05,082
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell a little story really quick.

1748
02:17:06,343 --> 02:17:08,424
[SPEAKER_23]: Back when Michael was first running for council,

1749
02:17:09,381 --> 02:17:12,784
[SPEAKER_23]: I got a call from a mutual friend, Dr. Wood.

1750
02:17:12,804 --> 02:17:17,687
[SPEAKER_23]: And he said to me, he said to me, I need your help.

1751
02:17:18,248 --> 02:17:19,749
[SPEAKER_23]: And I said, what do you need my help with?

1752
02:17:19,769 --> 02:17:22,811
[SPEAKER_23]: He's like, I got a friend running for city council.

1753
02:17:22,831 --> 02:17:24,433
[SPEAKER_23]: And I said, who is it?

1754
02:17:25,093 --> 02:17:25,594
[SPEAKER_23]: Michael Mox.

1755
02:17:25,834 --> 02:17:26,294
[SPEAKER_23]: I said, okay.

1756
02:17:26,795 --> 02:17:28,996
[SPEAKER_23]: He's like, I need your help with signs on election day.

1757
02:17:29,036 --> 02:17:29,697
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you help me out?

1758
02:17:29,917 --> 02:17:31,418
[SPEAKER_23]: And I said, yeah, I'll help you out.

1759
02:17:32,099 --> 02:17:35,261
[SPEAKER_23]: So I held signs for Michael in his first campaign.

1760
02:17:35,982 --> 02:17:38,884
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, but like, you know,

1761
02:17:40,715 --> 02:17:48,941
[SPEAKER_23]: But things like that allow you to meet people like Ray Cipriani and Bill Wilder, who are friends with Billy, who've been friends with me ever since I helped him run on the campaign that day.

1762
02:17:50,422 --> 02:17:55,026
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's the nice thing about community and working together.

1763
02:17:55,066 --> 02:17:57,848
[SPEAKER_23]: And I like to think I put Michael over the top and got this started.

1764
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:03,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Michael, I just want to thank you for your years of service.

1765
02:18:04,593 --> 02:18:06,034
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been a pleasure serving with you.

1766
02:18:06,054 --> 02:18:09,737
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank you for all your hard work through the years, and I wish you well.

1767
02:18:10,097 --> 02:18:10,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1768
02:18:10,317 --> 02:18:10,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Likewise.

1769
02:18:10,717 --> 02:18:11,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jim.

1770
02:18:11,718 --> 02:18:12,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1771
02:18:13,578 --> 02:18:21,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think I'm the only guy that's had the fastest rise from junior to senior councilor.

1772
02:18:21,402 --> 02:18:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1773
02:18:22,822 --> 02:18:23,223
[SPEAKER_07]: In like 10 years.

1774
02:18:23,243 --> 02:18:24,703
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1775
02:18:24,783 --> 02:18:31,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be a sad day when I come back in January, because everybody I started with 10 years ago will be gone.

1776
02:18:32,306 --> 02:18:37,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So that makes me a little sad, because it's a lot of memories, a lot of things happened here over the years.

1777
02:18:39,786 --> 02:18:43,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Serving with Michael has been fun and challenging at times.

1778
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:53,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when you first get elected, you've got these grand ambitions and you're gonna change the world and you know everything.

1779
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Until you say something and Michael Marx hits you back.

1780
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:05,742
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't do it to me, but he lets you understand, hey, I'm in charge here.

1781
02:19:05,802 --> 02:19:06,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't mistake it.

1782
02:19:06,943 --> 02:19:15,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, over the years, a lot of people said to me, why is the Michael Marx president of the council?

1783
02:19:27,900 --> 02:19:29,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a good reason why.

1784
02:19:29,142 --> 02:19:32,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilor Falco can tell you and I can, there's other people that have been in the front.

1785
02:19:33,549 --> 02:19:35,332
[SPEAKER_07]: When you stand up at the podium here, you lose your voice.

1786
02:19:37,015 --> 02:19:41,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And Councilor Marks' trademark is his voice.

1787
02:19:42,215 --> 02:19:45,478
[SPEAKER_07]: for the voice of the community for about 26 years.

1788
02:19:46,158 --> 02:19:47,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's his trademark.

1789
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:49,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what people come to know him.

1790
02:19:50,042 --> 02:19:57,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's part of the reason he never took up this podium because he wouldn't be able to be the Michael Marks that we know and appreciate.

1791
02:19:58,769 --> 02:20:03,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what the people always say, you know, give the guy a chance.

1792
02:20:04,654 --> 02:20:07,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I say, I asked him to be president last time and he didn't want to.

1793
02:20:08,037 --> 02:20:09,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand why, because I say,

1794
02:20:10,993 --> 02:20:12,474
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the voice of the community.

1795
02:20:13,475 --> 02:20:17,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say, from being up in the party, you no longer be the voice of the community.

1796
02:20:17,478 --> 02:20:21,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna thank him for his years of being the voice of the community.

1797
02:20:21,981 --> 02:20:25,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's helped make me a better councilor.

1798
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:31,148
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no such thing as a slam dunk proposal with councilmembers.

1799
02:20:31,248 --> 02:20:35,291
[SPEAKER_07]: You look at the agenda and you say, geez, it'll be an easy night, we'll be out of here quick.

1800
02:20:35,311 --> 02:20:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1801
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:46,855
[SPEAKER_07]: There was there was there was no such thing as a slam dunk proposal with Councilman Miles.

1802
02:20:47,155 --> 02:20:48,016
[SPEAKER_07]: He was thorough.

1803
02:20:48,076 --> 02:20:50,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, you know, hey, listen, that's his job.

1804
02:20:51,098 --> 02:20:57,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank him, you know, I think he made me a better councilor over the years and him and I have become good friends over the last few years also.

1805
02:20:58,103 --> 02:21:01,245
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to thank him and his family for his years of service here.

1806
02:21:01,926 --> 02:21:05,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mike, if you'd like to come up here, we have a little something for you.

1807
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:12,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he called me and he said, Rick, don't get me a chair.

1808
02:21:12,851 --> 02:21:14,072
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I don't want a chair.

1809
02:21:14,732 --> 02:21:16,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't know what to get, and so I... So what's the rules for people?

1810
02:21:16,472 --> 02:21:17,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 10 years.

1811
02:21:19,293 --> 02:21:23,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, according to you, it's 10 years, and... But he didn't want a chair.

1812
02:21:23,294 --> 02:21:25,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, I don't think I want a rocking chair either when I go.

1813
02:21:26,936 --> 02:21:27,816
[SPEAKER_07]: You will, sir.

1814
02:21:27,856 --> 02:21:28,956
[SPEAKER_07]: You will.

1815
02:21:29,336 --> 02:21:33,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But on behalf of the council, I want to present you with this card.

1816
02:21:35,618 --> 02:21:35,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

1817
02:21:36,299 --> 02:21:36,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1818
02:21:36,979 --> 02:21:37,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1819
02:21:37,778 --> 02:21:38,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1820
02:21:38,678 --> 02:21:39,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1821
02:21:39,678 --> 02:21:40,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1822
02:21:53,962 --> 02:21:55,382
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll never be late for another meeting.

1823
02:21:55,602 --> 02:21:56,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1824
02:22:09,056 --> 02:22:09,957
[SPEAKER_15]: This is bittersweet.

1825
02:22:11,958 --> 02:22:15,680
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a long run and I've enjoyed it.

1826
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:27,667
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, tonight's go around with all the Councilors, I would recommend for the next council, try doing that once a week.

1827
02:22:28,808 --> 02:22:32,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Try turning to your colleague and saying, thank you for doing this.

1828
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:33,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for doing that.

1829
02:22:35,412 --> 02:22:36,613
[SPEAKER_11]: It really goes a long way.

1830
02:22:38,437 --> 02:22:39,177
[SPEAKER_11]: It's remarkable.

1831
02:22:41,638 --> 02:22:44,658
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some things have changed over the last 30 years.

1832
02:22:46,259 --> 02:22:52,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I have right here now, I use spectacles to see.

1833
02:22:56,681 --> 02:23:06,523
[SPEAKER_11]: My ability to, I think, reason and

1834
02:23:07,745 --> 02:23:10,387
[SPEAKER_15]: talk issues out has changed over the years.

1835
02:23:11,387 --> 02:23:13,729
[SPEAKER_15]: My temperament has changed, believe it or not.

1836
02:23:16,170 --> 02:23:21,613
[SPEAKER_15]: But one thing that hasn't changed is my love for this community.

1837
02:23:23,735 --> 02:23:32,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will forever be grateful for the honor and privilege to serve the residents of this community.

1838
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:37,752
[SPEAKER_15]: for the past three decades, 26 years altogether.

1839
02:23:40,374 --> 02:23:49,521
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when people put their trust and confidence in you, it's probably the highest form of respect someone can show, right?

1840
02:23:49,541 --> 02:23:52,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone that takes the time to go to the poll and say, I'm with you.

1841
02:23:53,584 --> 02:23:57,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone to put up a launch sign, someone to donate money in tough times.

1842
02:23:58,608 --> 02:24:02,191
[SPEAKER_15]: And that always meant so much to me that

1843
02:24:03,199 --> 02:24:06,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would all these people put their trust and confidence in me?

1844
02:24:06,601 --> 02:24:14,407
[SPEAKER_15]: I never realized it until it dawned on me that we're all in this together.

1845
02:24:16,388 --> 02:24:18,210
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a great community here.

1846
02:24:19,771 --> 02:24:22,833
[SPEAKER_15]: And what makes the community is its residents.

1847
02:24:23,133 --> 02:24:25,515
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not the city of Medford, it's its residents.

1848
02:24:26,295 --> 02:24:27,435
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the people that live here.

1849
02:24:27,715 --> 02:24:28,896
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the people that care.

1850
02:24:30,116 --> 02:24:39,759
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I truly believe that what makes us a great community is a community that's united.

1851
02:24:40,559 --> 02:24:42,979
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are going to be many issues that may separate us.

1852
02:24:42,999 --> 02:24:46,260
[SPEAKER_15]: There are going to be many issues that we may have differences of agreement on.

1853
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:52,962
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think the one thing we can agree upon is that we want to move this city forward and we love this community.

1854
02:24:53,873 --> 02:24:56,896
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we're at that point now.

1855
02:24:58,117 --> 02:24:59,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank my family.

1856
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:02,961
[SPEAKER_15]: I have my three children here tonight.

1857
02:25:02,981 --> 02:25:06,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't have kids when I first ran for office.

1858
02:25:07,426 --> 02:25:08,847
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's amazing.

1859
02:25:09,067 --> 02:25:11,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I have three children here tonight, my son, Evan.

1860
02:25:18,061 --> 02:25:21,602
[SPEAKER_15]: who's finishing up his studies at UMass Amherst.

1861
02:25:22,643 --> 02:25:28,424
[SPEAKER_15]: My daughter Olivia, who just took her test and is now a registered dietician.

1862
02:25:33,426 --> 02:25:36,907
[SPEAKER_15]: And my oldest, my daughter Gianna, who is a first grade teacher.

1863
02:25:41,549 --> 02:25:44,810
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't begin to say how proud they've made me over the years.

1864
02:25:50,679 --> 02:25:51,980
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanna thank them.

1865
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:55,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank for being there for me.

1866
02:25:55,982 --> 02:26:00,804
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank for allowing me to participate at the fullest.

1867
02:26:01,224 --> 02:26:04,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I gave this job my everything for almost three decades.

1868
02:26:05,546 --> 02:26:10,389
[SPEAKER_15]: And no matter what people say, and I don't have to tell my colleagues, it takes from your family life.

1869
02:26:11,376 --> 02:26:12,296
[SPEAKER_15]: But I signed up for it.

1870
02:26:12,476 --> 02:26:14,217
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not, I wouldn't change anything.

1871
02:26:14,497 --> 02:26:20,619
[SPEAKER_15]: I signed up for it, but my family was there every inch of the way through good times and bad times.

1872
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:22,880
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank my three kids.

1873
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:27,822
[SPEAKER_15]: My biggest supporter, my rock, my wife Lisa is at home tonight.

1874
02:26:28,942 --> 02:26:32,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone that knows my wife Lisa knows that she's not one for the limelight.

1875
02:26:33,884 --> 02:26:35,424
[SPEAKER_15]: She never has, never will.

1876
02:26:35,944 --> 02:26:37,285
[SPEAKER_15]: She's always been consistent.

1877
02:26:38,035 --> 02:26:53,666
[SPEAKER_15]: And the one reason why I was able to do what I did for so many years and do the research and study and do the things that I needed to do and be at events and everything a politician does is because I had that rock at my house.

1878
02:26:54,166 --> 02:27:03,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I had the foundation, the beacon that my wife served as raising the children and being the supportive wife and mother.

1879
02:27:04,594 --> 02:27:06,575
[SPEAKER_15]: And without that, I wouldn't be anywhere.

1880
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:10,682
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to thank my wife, Lisa.

1881
02:27:13,504 --> 02:27:14,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna thank my mother.

1882
02:27:15,926 --> 02:27:21,570
[SPEAKER_15]: My mother started me off with family values back 55 years ago.

1883
02:27:22,871 --> 02:27:29,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was her guidance over the years that shaped how I voted.

1884
02:27:31,778 --> 02:27:37,362
[SPEAKER_15]: And I never realized that until I took a step back and said, this was my mother that

1885
02:27:37,924 --> 02:27:39,365
[SPEAKER_15]: gave me these particular values.

1886
02:27:39,465 --> 02:27:51,755
[SPEAKER_15]: This was my mother that raised four children as a single parent and did her best to give us a roof over our head and provide the opportunities that she did.

1887
02:27:51,775 --> 02:27:57,059
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will forever be grateful for my mother.

1888
02:27:58,478 --> 02:27:59,679
[SPEAKER_15]: and her support over the years.

1889
02:28:00,099 --> 02:28:03,082
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank my in-laws, Linda and Vincenzo Federico.

1890
02:28:03,462 --> 02:28:10,648
[SPEAKER_15]: If you ever came to one of my fundraisers, they used to make the best thick pizzellis, not the thin ones, the best thick pizzellis.

1891
02:28:11,649 --> 02:28:17,595
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you came in the door, I'd go to shake a hand and they would go right over to my in-laws and get their pizzellis.

1892
02:28:18,888 --> 02:28:22,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think most people were there to get the pizzellis, which was fine.

1893
02:28:22,929 --> 02:28:23,609
[SPEAKER_15]: It was fine with me.

1894
02:28:24,309 --> 02:28:28,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to thank my in-laws, Linda, Machenzo, Federico, for the many years.

1895
02:28:29,951 --> 02:28:34,452
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank all the volunteers in the community that served on boards and commissions.

1896
02:28:35,192 --> 02:28:36,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about being behind the scenes.

1897
02:28:37,092 --> 02:28:39,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about volunteering, right?

1898
02:28:40,688 --> 02:28:42,708
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the very heartbeat of the community.

1899
02:28:43,129 --> 02:28:44,809
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the volunteers that are out there.

1900
02:28:45,129 --> 02:28:55,151
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the people that are doing this, not for any praise, but because they love the community because they want to do better in the community, and they want to see our city progress forward.

1901
02:28:55,612 --> 02:29:00,273
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to thank all the countless volunteers that I've been involved with over the past 30 years.

1902
02:29:01,633 --> 02:29:10,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank the countless community groups, civic organizations that we all come in contact with on a daily basis.

1903
02:29:11,661 --> 02:29:19,246
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Councilor Falco alluded to, this was never about me, honestly, and I still feel the same way.

1904
02:29:20,968 --> 02:29:22,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone just looked up at the clock.

1905
02:29:23,694 --> 02:29:25,035
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a lot of pages ahead of me.

1906
02:29:26,115 --> 02:29:32,057
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a lot of, I got a page for each year, so just bear with me.

1907
02:29:33,858 --> 02:29:37,259
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want to recognize at this point, I've never done this before.

1908
02:29:37,619 --> 02:29:39,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to recognize the city workers.

1909
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:41,701
[SPEAKER_15]: The city workers are the heartbeat.

1910
02:29:42,201 --> 02:29:43,942
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the lifeline of this community.

1911
02:29:44,462 --> 02:29:46,282
[SPEAKER_15]: And they get very little recognition.

1912
02:29:46,943 --> 02:29:50,324
[SPEAKER_15]: And they do tremendous work on a daily basis.

1913
02:29:50,724 --> 02:29:52,665
[SPEAKER_15]: This city doesn't operate by chance.

1914
02:29:53,457 --> 02:29:59,141
[SPEAKER_15]: It's because of the hundreds and not thousands of city employees that make this city function.

1915
02:29:59,721 --> 02:30:08,628
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to take the time to recognize an office we deal with on a consistent basis, the city clerk in the registrar voters office.

1916
02:30:09,268 --> 02:30:19,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to recognize Clerk Herbise, who has been the city clerk for the last several years, and probably one of the best appointments that I've been involved with.

1917
02:30:19,775 --> 02:30:24,818
[SPEAKER_15]: And I appreciate you and everything you've done for the city clerk's office, Mr. Clerk.

1918
02:30:25,219 --> 02:30:28,501
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Sylvia DiPasolito.

1919
02:30:28,921 --> 02:30:38,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Jennifer Grogan, Janice DePace, Evelyn O'Rourke, Dorothy Donaghy, Janice Joyce, Sandy Gill, Joan Lamone,

1920
02:30:39,453 --> 02:30:43,274
[SPEAKER_15]: and Haley Brogan for their work in the city clerk's office.

1921
02:30:44,075 --> 02:30:46,176
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank my good friend, Larry Lepore.

1922
02:30:47,696 --> 02:30:49,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Larry, you sat in that corner for many years.

1923
02:30:50,357 --> 02:30:52,938
[SPEAKER_15]: People would ask me, what is that guy doing in the corner?

1924
02:30:54,079 --> 02:30:55,359
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's the city messenger.

1925
02:30:55,379 --> 02:30:56,760
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a very important job.

1926
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:59,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And Larry, I consider you a friend.

1927
02:31:00,621 --> 02:31:05,863
[SPEAKER_15]: You've held that position with distinction and I look forward to seeing you around the community.

1928
02:31:07,222 --> 02:31:07,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Larry.

1929
02:31:08,162 --> 02:31:10,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank the people in the building department.

1930
02:31:10,583 --> 02:31:20,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Paul Moki, a gentleman that's been in this community a number of years and handles the day-to-day operations of every building function, every permit.

1931
02:31:21,085 --> 02:31:24,465
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a giant job, and Paul Moki has done a tremendous job.

1932
02:31:24,485 --> 02:31:36,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank Amy Tanaglia, Dennis McDonald, Jeff Fago, Kenny Lanzilli, Mike Malabar, and Paul Smith in that office.

1933
02:31:37,288 --> 02:31:46,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank Director Pam Kelly and the Council on Aging, who deals with our seniors and provides senior programming and has done a tremendous job.

1934
02:31:46,434 --> 02:32:00,062
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank the people at the Department of Public Works and Engineering, Commissioner Brian Kerins, Mary Moniz, Phyllis Cerboni, Darlene Luke, Steve Tenaglia, who's in the audience,

1935
02:32:00,842 --> 02:32:06,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I've probably bothered Steve Tenaglia over my 26-year career than anyone else in the community.

1936
02:32:07,285 --> 02:32:11,967
[SPEAKER_15]: And Steve, I appreciate the attentiveness that you've done over the years.

1937
02:32:12,327 --> 02:32:16,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate your working on behalf of the residents of this community.

1938
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:23,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And no matter how big the crack was in the sidewalk or the hole in the street, you were out there when we called.

1939
02:32:23,953 --> 02:32:25,033
[SPEAKER_15]: You made things happen.

1940
02:32:25,413 --> 02:32:28,955
[SPEAKER_15]: And Steve, I will always be grateful for your service.

1941
02:32:29,811 --> 02:32:30,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank them for their service.

1946
02:32:58,021 --> 02:32:59,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Information technology.

1947
02:32:59,602 --> 02:33:00,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Mike Ferretti, the director.

1948

[SPEAKER_15]: City solicitor Kim Scanlon and Janice Spencer.

1950

[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank the police department.

1951
02:33:09,636 --> 02:33:27,627
[SPEAKER_15]: The first responders, as I spoke about tonight, Chief Jack Buckley, Patrol Union Representative Hal McGilvery, and all the brave men and women of the police department, our first responders that have done a tremendous job protecting the life and property of residents in this community.

1952
02:33:28,828 --> 02:33:30,209
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a thankless job.

1953
02:33:30,665 --> 02:33:32,846
[SPEAKER_15]: but it's a very important job in our community.

1954
02:33:33,326 --> 02:33:37,267
[SPEAKER_15]: The fire department, I'd like to thank incoming chief John Friedman.

1955
02:33:38,228 --> 02:33:45,810
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to thank union president Eddie Buckley on his many years of support and camaraderie.

1956
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:53,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to say, and I don't like to show favoritism, but the fire department, I consider them all brothers.

1957
02:33:54,393 --> 02:33:54,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I really do.

1958
02:33:55,373 --> 02:33:59,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I never met a bunch of gentlemen that, and women,

1959
02:34:00,215 --> 02:34:13,564
[SPEAKER_15]: that really cared for this community, that stepped up when needed, and I will ever be grateful for the fire department in our community.

1960
02:34:14,024 --> 02:34:14,805
[SPEAKER_15]: My one regret

1961
02:34:15,725 --> 02:34:22,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and I have several is that we never acted upon a new fire station.

1962
02:34:22,550 --> 02:34:36,660
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would ask my colleagues, uh, as they move forward that we keep the commitment we gave to the fire department like we did with the police department to create a brand new state of the art fire headquarters and training facility

1963
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:39,761
[SPEAKER_15]: that they all so well deserve.

1964
02:34:40,441 --> 02:34:42,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I hope that commitment is kept.

1965
02:34:42,581 --> 02:34:54,484
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank the health department director, Marianne O'Connor, uh, over the last 22 months, who has done yeoman's work with providing, um, health service in this community during covid.

1966
02:34:54,864 --> 02:34:56,905
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank veteran service director,

1967
02:34:57,305 --> 02:35:07,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Michael Durham, who in my opinion, over the last few years, has done so much work to put veterans on the radar in our community.

1968
02:35:07,434 --> 02:35:08,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Give veterans a voice.

1969
02:35:09,196 --> 02:35:13,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure that you're out there looking for the services that veterans may not be aware of.

1970
02:35:14,221 --> 02:35:20,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Mike would be the first to step forward and have the ability and knowledge to get things done and accomplished.

1971
02:35:21,407 --> 02:35:24,989
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank Mike Durham for his years of service.

1972
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:29,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Farmer City employees that I had the privilege to work with.

1973
02:35:30,752 --> 02:35:44,720
[SPEAKER_15]: If I miss some, I apologize, but the ones that come to mind, Farmer City Clerk Ed Finn, Farmer Mayor Michael McGlynn, Farmer City Solicitor Mark Rumley, who I consider a dear friend and advisor.

1974
02:35:45,718 --> 02:36:02,765
[SPEAKER_15]: former DPW Commissioner Paul Gere, former Budget Director Richard Lee, former Fire Chief Larry Sands, former Fire Chief Frank Gilberti, former Police Chief Leo Sacco, former Board of Health Director Karen Rose, former Treasure Collector Fred Pompeo Jr.,

1975
02:36:03,725 --> 02:36:11,092
[SPEAKER_15]: former superintendent of schools that I served with, Roy Belson, and former superintendent of schools, Phil DeVoe that I served with as well.

1976
02:36:11,112 --> 02:36:17,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank my fellow colleagues on the school committee that I served with for several years.

1977
02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:30,168
[SPEAKER_15]: We, as I mentioned tonight, I was part of building the new schools and talk about going from a process where we had neighborhood schools to centralized schools.

1978
02:36:30,978 --> 02:36:34,740
[SPEAKER_15]: It was probably one of the biggest contentious issues in this city's history.

1979
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:44,485
[SPEAKER_15]: But as a school committee, we rolled up our sleeves, we had our public meetings, and we were able to build centralized schools, state-of-the-art schools.

1980
02:36:45,365 --> 02:36:46,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And that I am very proud of.

1981
02:36:46,986 --> 02:36:52,829
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank my colleagues that I serve with, Lena DiGentimasso, who talk about a fighter,

1982
02:36:53,753 --> 02:37:00,458
[SPEAKER_15]: There's someone that served three decades, never ran for any other office, but always cared about the community.

1983
02:37:01,258 --> 02:37:05,762
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll never forget when we were building the new schools, we had to go look at the old schools.

1984
02:37:06,662 --> 02:37:08,644
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was behind every ladder to the roof.

1985
02:37:09,715 --> 02:37:15,758
[SPEAKER_15]: following Linda Gigentomaso with her high heels, climbing the ladder to get to the roof.

1986
02:37:16,439 --> 02:37:17,559
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the dedication.

1987
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:19,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Jack Buckley.

1988
02:37:19,660 --> 02:37:23,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Jack Buckley, when I served with him, Jack was a very intelligent man.

1989
02:37:24,323 --> 02:37:27,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was very young of age.

1990
02:37:27,664 --> 02:37:31,326
[SPEAKER_15]: And he used to always say during the meetings, the TQM approach.

1991
02:37:32,067 --> 02:37:34,828
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd be like, wow, TQM, this is something big.

1992
02:37:35,168 --> 02:37:38,270
[SPEAKER_15]: And he'd say it all the time, total quality management.

1993
02:37:39,159 --> 02:37:44,861
[SPEAKER_15]: And 25 years later, I have still not forgotten what TQM stands for.

1994
02:37:45,422 --> 02:37:49,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the type of Jack Buckley was in charge of the building of the schools project.

1995
02:37:49,783 --> 02:37:53,465
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the type of dedication Jack had and his business acumen.

1996
02:37:53,972 --> 02:37:55,692
[SPEAKER_15]: that that's where he came from.

1997
02:37:56,233 --> 02:37:58,653
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's funny how the little things stick with you.

1998
02:37:59,193 --> 02:38:03,955
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was one thing that stuck with me with Jack Buckley, Paul Van der Kloot, who we recognize tonight.

1999
02:38:04,655 --> 02:38:06,155
[SPEAKER_15]: I served with Paulette for six years.

2000
02:38:07,235 --> 02:38:08,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Bob Skerry, Bob Emmett Skerry.

2001
02:38:09,616 --> 02:38:12,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I served with Beth Fuller, who was the best knitter in the city of Medford.

2002
02:38:13,898 --> 02:38:21,571
[SPEAKER_15]: would be at committee meetings and she'd knit a blanket while we were sitting there actually just listening, she would knit a blanket.

2003
02:38:22,072 --> 02:38:24,336
[SPEAKER_15]: I always felt that I wasn't doing enough with my time.

2004
02:38:25,478 --> 02:38:26,420
[SPEAKER_15]: She made me feel guilty.

2005
02:38:27,822 --> 02:38:33,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Ed Nolan, who's a great firefighter, and I happen to have the opportunity to serve with Ed Nolan.

2006
02:38:34,624 --> 02:38:44,066
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but not least, Bill Brady, who was a great school committee member and a tenacious advocate for the children of this community.

2007
02:38:45,066 --> 02:38:46,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Former colleagues on the city council.

2008
02:38:47,547 --> 02:38:48,967
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleague here, Robert Penta.

2009
02:38:48,987 --> 02:38:52,188
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when I first got on the council,

2010
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:55,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be honest with you, I was intimidated by him.

2011
02:38:56,482 --> 02:39:06,948
[SPEAKER_15]: He was rough and gruff, but as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I come to know a gentleman that only cared and loved about the community.

2012
02:39:07,768 --> 02:39:13,311
[SPEAKER_15]: His delivery may be a little questionable once in a while, but he cared about the community.

2013
02:39:14,732 --> 02:39:17,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Bob always told me, stand up for your beliefs.

2014
02:39:17,633 --> 02:39:18,474
[SPEAKER_15]: You can never go wrong.

2015
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:24,062
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would advise anyone coming into public office, that's the number one thing.

2016
02:39:24,722 --> 02:39:25,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Stand up for what you believe.

2017
02:39:25,902 --> 02:39:27,903
[SPEAKER_15]: You can never ever go wrong.

2018
02:39:28,803 --> 02:39:29,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

2019
02:39:29,923 --> 02:39:37,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert Mayorko, no disregard to you, Mr. President, but the best president I ever served with on the council.

2020
02:39:39,046 --> 02:39:45,268
[SPEAKER_15]: He coined the phrase, at least he takes credit for it, that this city council is the people's forum.

2021
02:39:45,949 --> 02:39:47,009
[SPEAKER_15]: And that always stuck with me.

2022
02:39:47,889 --> 02:39:51,452
[SPEAKER_15]: because if you had an issue, there's nowhere else to go.

2023
02:39:53,053 --> 02:39:55,394
[SPEAKER_15]: And this has to be the people's forum.

2024
02:39:55,955 --> 02:40:09,424
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask my colleagues to always keep that microphone open for whoever wants to come up on the public participation, whoever wants to speak on no matter what the issue may be, this has to maintain itself as the people's forum.

2025
02:40:10,285 --> 02:40:14,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise we will lose confidence in government and that's the last thing we want.

2026
02:40:16,349 --> 02:40:17,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul Camuso.

2027
02:40:18,899 --> 02:40:32,068
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, when Paul got on the council, it dawned on me immediately when we were debating whether or not to allow Wendy's on Middlesex Ave, which was my neighborhood.

2028
02:40:32,489 --> 02:40:33,930
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were debating it back and forth.

2029
02:40:34,370 --> 02:40:40,594
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll never forget, Paul Camuso said to the representatives from Wendy's, all the higher ups were here, all the bigwigs.

2030
02:40:41,235 --> 02:40:46,759
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, we have to have more fine dining like Wendy's in this community.

2031
02:40:48,757 --> 02:40:51,119
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said we're going to be for a long ride with this guy.

2032
02:40:54,361 --> 02:40:59,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Stephanie machini Burke, I mean, Stephanie's had a long run in this community as well.

2033
02:40:59,945 --> 02:41:03,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I had the opportunity to serve a number of years, became mayor of this community.

2034
02:41:06,493 --> 02:41:13,337
[SPEAKER_15]: was responsible for the police station and a brand new library and has done yeoman's work pushing this community forward.

2035
02:41:14,117 --> 02:41:21,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Brianna Lungo-Curran was the current mayor and I served with for 18 years and I wish her well in the future years.

2036
02:41:22,622 --> 02:41:26,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Fred Dello Russo, the last person to ever let you down.

2037
02:41:30,246 --> 02:41:31,527
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a little joke.

2038
02:41:31,927 --> 02:41:32,748
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a little joke.

2039
02:41:35,737 --> 02:41:38,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Fred Dello Russo gave a perspective of business owner.

2040
02:41:39,340 --> 02:41:40,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Every Councilor has their own perspective.

2041
02:41:41,301 --> 02:41:42,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why you have to listen.

2042
02:41:42,502 --> 02:41:46,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And you may get in arguments, but everyone has their own ideas and their own perspective.

2043
02:41:46,705 --> 02:41:50,168
[SPEAKER_15]: And Fred came from a chamber of commerce and a business perspective.

2044
02:41:50,468 --> 02:41:54,711
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was always helpful for me because he was a business minded.

2045
02:41:56,132 --> 02:41:57,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Bill Carr Sr.

2046
02:41:57,513 --> 02:42:02,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember his slogan, nothing changes if nothing changes.

2047
02:42:04,182 --> 02:42:09,863
[SPEAKER_15]: But when I looked at the slogan, I said, well, how basic, but when you think about it, nothing changes if nothing changes.

2048
02:42:10,343 --> 02:42:11,764
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was absolutely right.

2049
02:42:12,124 --> 02:42:13,604
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll never forget that slogan.

2050
02:42:14,344 --> 02:42:16,265
[SPEAKER_15]: And I consider Bill Carr a good friend.

2051
02:42:17,745 --> 02:42:20,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Jim DiGiacomo, I had the opportunity to serve one term with.

2052
02:42:21,226 --> 02:42:25,847
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jim was an excellent city councilor and a real people person.

2053
02:42:26,807 --> 02:42:27,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Macarena.

2054
02:42:27,928 --> 02:42:31,929
[SPEAKER_15]: I served just a short period of time when one council stepped down.

2055
02:42:32,410 --> 02:42:34,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Macarena took over for about 10 months.

2056
02:42:35,071 --> 02:42:39,373
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was a man of commitment and dedication.

2057
02:42:40,253 --> 02:42:44,415
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wish Mac well.

2058
02:42:46,075 --> 02:42:47,696
[SPEAKER_15]: State Rep Paul Donato.

2059
02:42:49,717 --> 02:42:51,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul got off the council to run for state rep.

2060
02:42:52,798 --> 02:42:54,079
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when I got on the council.

2061
02:42:56,234 --> 02:43:00,336
[SPEAKER_15]: No one has done more to bring in local aid than Paul Donato.

2062
02:43:01,136 --> 02:43:05,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul Donato's name is synonymous with local aid.

2063
02:43:05,858 --> 02:43:14,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't wanna go through the laundry list, but just take a walk into Chevalier Auditorium and look at the brand new seats and look at the air conditioning.

2064
02:43:14,621 --> 02:43:20,384
[SPEAKER_15]: And that wasn't done for any other reason than we have an advocate in the state house, Paul Donato.

2065
02:43:21,464 --> 02:43:22,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And,

2066
02:43:24,175 --> 02:43:31,141
[SPEAKER_15]: A little known fact about Paul Donato, and I hope you don't mind me sharing this, because I know you're not a vain person.

2067
02:43:33,643 --> 02:43:41,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul Donato was one of the original signees on methods incorporation papers in 1892.

2068
02:43:42,030 --> 02:43:42,111
[SPEAKER_15]: 1892, yes.

2069
02:43:50,185 --> 02:43:55,126
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank you for your many, many years of service, Representative Donato.

2070
02:43:56,047 --> 02:44:01,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And I consider you a friend as well, Representative Donato, and always will be supportive.

2071
02:44:02,369 --> 02:44:03,369
[SPEAKER_15]: My present colleagues.

2072
02:44:04,609 --> 02:44:10,231
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have the two newest colleagues, Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell.

2073
02:44:10,871 --> 02:44:15,912
[SPEAKER_15]: With COVID, we didn't have a real opportunity to get to know each other.

2074
02:44:18,607 --> 02:44:20,728
[SPEAKER_15]: or know where you're coming from.

2075
02:44:21,549 --> 02:44:28,172
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that may have been some of maybe, I don't wanna say tension, but maybe some of the misinformation.

2076
02:44:29,113 --> 02:44:32,335
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know you both have great intentions.

2077
02:44:33,275 --> 02:44:37,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I know both of you will move this city forward.

2078
02:44:38,258 --> 02:44:40,239
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask that you just take a step back.

2079
02:44:40,979 --> 02:44:47,383
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I tell everyone, God gave us two ears, do twice as much listening than speaking.

2080
02:44:48,063 --> 02:44:50,245
[SPEAKER_15]: And I take that to myself, too.

2081
02:44:50,285 --> 02:44:56,491
[SPEAKER_15]: That's no reflection on anyone, but listen, because you learn so much when you listen and hear what people have to say.

2082
02:44:57,112 --> 02:44:58,513
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank my colleagues.

2083
02:44:58,594 --> 02:45:06,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone that throws their hat in the ring to run for public office, I think is an admirable cause.

2084
02:45:06,882 --> 02:45:09,925
[SPEAKER_15]: And anyone willing to do that, especially at a young age.

2085
02:45:10,770 --> 02:45:12,711
[SPEAKER_15]: I've always preached in this community.

2086
02:45:12,991 --> 02:45:14,652
[SPEAKER_15]: I've supported wide representation.

2087
02:45:14,953 --> 02:45:18,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I've supported initiatives to get people involved.

2088
02:45:18,595 --> 02:45:21,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though I ran for office, I want to see more people get involved.

2089
02:45:22,097 --> 02:45:26,580
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm glad that we have young people in this community as my neighbor.

2090
02:45:27,802 --> 02:45:31,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Justin, while a lot of people don't know, he's my neighbor right across the street.

2091
02:45:32,488 --> 02:45:36,534
[SPEAKER_15]: He called me up several months back and said, Mike, I'm running for office.

2092
02:45:37,234 --> 02:45:38,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, oh, you moved out of the city?

2093
02:45:39,377 --> 02:45:41,680
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, no, I'm running for Medford City Council.

2094
02:45:42,714 --> 02:45:51,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And a funny fact is that when I moved to Wellington Road some 30 years ago, I got a phone call from Angelo Morata.

2095
02:45:51,656 --> 02:45:58,098
[SPEAKER_15]: And that may not sound familiar from a lot of people, but he said, I just want you to know, and I didn't know him from a hole in the wall.

2096
02:45:58,778 --> 02:46:04,340
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want you to know that I was the original resident on Wellington Road.

2097
02:46:05,521 --> 02:46:08,845
[SPEAKER_15]: and I am therefore the original councilor on Wellington Road.

2098
02:46:09,506 --> 02:46:16,695
[SPEAKER_15]: So Justin, just so you know, I am the original city councilor on Wellington Road and don't ever forget that.

2099
02:46:17,356 --> 02:46:18,397
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't ever forget that.

2100
02:46:20,790 --> 02:46:26,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank my colleagues, Council beers Council morale for their dedicated service.

2101
02:46:27,456 --> 02:46:42,969
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank Councilor Falco, who I stated earlier, made meetings, more transparent in this community, made the budget process, a far better process in this community, and just

2102
02:46:43,769 --> 02:46:48,132
[SPEAKER_15]: lent a sense of calmness to this council that I am appreciative for.

2103
02:46:48,552 --> 02:46:56,518
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanna thank you for all your years of service and years of commitment to our community.

2104
02:46:57,258 --> 02:47:00,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam Knight, I mean, who's done more for working families?

2105
02:47:00,861 --> 02:47:04,804
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know half about what he was talking about unions and about living wages.

2106
02:47:05,484 --> 02:47:14,027
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was Adam Knight that brought the issues up and Adam Knight that fought for the unions in this community and fought for working families.

2107
02:47:14,607 --> 02:47:16,508
[SPEAKER_15]: It made sure that they were at the forefront.

2108
02:47:16,848 --> 02:47:21,369
[SPEAKER_15]: And there were many issues that I learned about listening to Councilor Knight.

2109
02:47:22,090 --> 02:47:29,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have to say, I will forever be thankful for opening my eyes up to those issues in the community.

2110
02:47:30,893 --> 02:47:32,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about a parliamentarian.

2111
02:47:33,332 --> 02:47:36,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, when he first got on the council, I said, oh, this kid's in for trouble.

2112
02:47:36,554 --> 02:47:39,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm gonna get him until he start calling rule seven, section 1630.

2113
02:47:39,996 --> 02:47:42,097
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's this guy doing?

2114
02:47:43,057 --> 02:47:44,218
[SPEAKER_15]: But when did he learn this stuff?

2115
02:47:44,678 --> 02:47:50,962
[SPEAKER_15]: And sure enough, he was the parliamentarian and I have to give him credit that he picked up on that second nature.

2116
02:47:51,002 --> 02:47:56,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's his legislative experience and his commitment to this community.

2117
02:47:56,084 --> 02:48:00,387
[SPEAKER_15]: But I wanna thank you for your friendship and years of service as well.

2118
02:48:01,707 --> 02:48:02,508
[SPEAKER_15]: George Scarpelli.

2119
02:48:04,332 --> 02:48:14,794
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I refer to him as Coach Scarpelli because George has done more for youth sports in this community than anyone in the history of the city.

2120
02:48:15,074 --> 02:48:16,975
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not just saying that because he's sitting here.

2121
02:48:17,535 --> 02:48:27,797
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, George to me, George was working with underprivileged students before there were people working with underprivileged students.

2122
02:48:29,197 --> 02:48:31,338
[SPEAKER_15]: George was the one that reached across the aisle.

2123
02:48:31,778 --> 02:48:32,858
[SPEAKER_15]: George was the one

2124
02:48:34,453 --> 02:48:39,095
[SPEAKER_15]: that lent himself to getting out there and looking for those in need.

2125
02:48:40,135 --> 02:48:51,660
[SPEAKER_15]: So I refer to George as coach Scarpelli because George, the Councilor, yes, great counsel, good friend, great advocate, but it's George Scarpelli, the man.

2126
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:58,783
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it says a lot about a person that's involved in a community behind the scenes.

2127
02:49:00,171 --> 02:49:03,612
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and then gets involved maybe in politics or do something else.

2128
02:49:04,272 --> 02:49:15,735
[SPEAKER_15]: So, George, I wanna thank you for your many years of service to this community, but also to the youth and the disenfranchised and to the people that didn't have a voice.

2129
02:49:16,255 --> 02:49:18,315
[SPEAKER_15]: You stood up, Councilor Scapelli.

2130
02:49:18,595 --> 02:49:22,456
[SPEAKER_15]: It was you that stood up and made sure that this happened in our community.

2131
02:49:22,776 --> 02:49:25,197
[SPEAKER_15]: It made sure that everyone felt welcome.

2132
02:49:25,517 --> 02:49:29,758
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanna thank you and I'll forever be beholden, Councilor.

2133
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:34,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Council President Caraviello.

2134
02:49:36,001 --> 02:49:39,181
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had more people say, when you talk, why do you say Mr. President all the time?

2135
02:49:40,341 --> 02:49:44,702
[SPEAKER_15]: And I say, that's out of deference and respect to Council President Caraviello.

2136
02:49:46,062 --> 02:49:49,703
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, talk about someone that's been involved in the community.

2137
02:49:50,963 --> 02:49:56,584
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Rick Caraviello was involved in the community back 45 years ago.

2138
02:49:56,604 --> 02:50:00,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember when I first ran for public office, it was Rick Caraviello

2139
02:50:02,237 --> 02:50:11,659
[SPEAKER_15]: that was sponsoring students, that was giving out part of all the civic organizations, giving out certificates and scholarships.

2140
02:50:12,039 --> 02:50:22,141
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Rick Caraviello that worked with families, that worked with families that had food insecurities and still does to today.

2141
02:50:22,782 --> 02:50:24,442
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't stop it when he became a council.

2142
02:50:25,677 --> 02:50:29,382
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Rick Caraviello was out in the community and he kept on doing it.

2143
02:50:29,402 --> 02:50:31,405
[SPEAKER_15]: And that says a lot about a person.

2144
02:50:31,945 --> 02:50:33,868
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't drop and say, ah, now I'm a Councilor.

2145
02:50:34,789 --> 02:50:39,456
[SPEAKER_15]: He kept on doing what he always knew and that's helping people in the community.

2146
02:50:40,417 --> 02:50:41,799
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanna talk about helping people.

2147
02:50:43,107 --> 02:50:57,639
[SPEAKER_15]: You turn around and it was Councilor Caraviello who led the charge to make sure veterans that were in need of home repair, that maybe couldn't afford to fix a leaky roof or add a handicap ramp to their home.

2148
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:00,802
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Councilor Caraviello without any fanfare.

2149
02:51:01,202 --> 02:51:02,323
[SPEAKER_15]: He wasn't looking for any fanfare.

2150
02:51:02,523 --> 02:51:07,287
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Councilor Caraviello that stood up and made sure these things happened.

2151
02:51:08,350 --> 02:51:21,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will forever be grateful for your leadership over the many years, and I consider every one of my colleagues a friend, and I hope we maintain our friendships.

2152
02:51:22,801 --> 02:51:30,207
[SPEAKER_15]: At this particular point, I know I'm getting long-winded, but I wouldn't be myself if I didn't mention my friends for decades.

2153
02:51:31,537 --> 02:51:41,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is probably where I get into a lot of trouble, but I'd like to recognize to the best of my ability, people that have been with me for three decades, or very close to three decades.

2154
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:48,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And people that put their trust in me, and I still don't understand why.

2155
02:51:50,903 --> 02:51:54,904
[SPEAKER_15]: But people I consider my friends, and people that have been with me for many years.

2156
02:51:55,384 --> 02:51:59,245
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank in the front row, Bill and Jeannie Wilder,

2157
02:52:00,379 --> 02:52:01,459
[SPEAKER_15]: been with me for many years.

02:52:08,122 --> 02:52:10,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Ray Cipriani, who's in the front row.

2166
02:53:30,398 --> 02:53:32,720
[SPEAKER_15]: If I miss some people, I apologize.

2167
02:53:35,638 --> 02:53:40,061
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna welcome the incoming members of the council, Justin and Kit Collins.

2168
02:53:41,342 --> 02:53:45,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish you good luck in the upcoming two years.

2169
02:53:46,585 --> 02:53:50,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm proud to be part of such a great and welcoming and inclusive community.

2170
02:53:52,168 --> 02:53:56,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

2171
02:53:57,732 --> 02:54:01,854
[SPEAKER_15]: May God bless our nation and may God bless the city of Medford.

2172
02:54:02,474 --> 02:54:03,135
[SPEAKER_15]: So long for now.

2173
02:54:18,433 --> 02:54:19,014
[SPEAKER_11]: put it back together.

2174
02:54:26,204 --> 02:54:28,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, represent that I was good.

2175
02:55:10,861 --> 02:55:13,082
[SPEAKER_13]: John.

2176
02:55:20,145 --> 02:55:33,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say before I even get involved in this, how proud I am to be a resident of the city of Medford, to have had representation

2177
02:55:34,506 --> 02:55:36,267
[SPEAKER_02]: and the city council such as yourself.

2178
02:55:36,868 --> 02:55:46,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, you proved why the people of the city of Medford have given you the opportunity to serve on both the school committee and the city council.

2179
02:55:47,195 --> 02:56:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just refreshing that your colleagues, but more important, residents of the city of Medford have given you the opportunity to serve, but just as important is you have served with distinction and honor.

2180
02:56:04,775 --> 02:56:13,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you want me to announce that we're going to start the 5'5 basketball team in the city of Medford.

2181
02:56:13,341 --> 02:56:22,268
[SPEAKER_13]: You wish you were 5'5.

2182
02:56:23,548 --> 02:56:28,632
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've known John, we're in the neighborhood up in North Medford.

2183
02:56:29,132 --> 02:56:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: We're members of the Medford Kiwanis together.

2184
02:56:31,454 --> 02:56:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been friends for

2185
02:56:34,708 --> 02:56:36,370
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 years since I signed the 1892.

2186
02:56:36,750 --> 02:56:40,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you were with me.

2187
02:56:42,214 --> 02:56:48,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been friends for a long, long time, co-ordinates together, but more important friends and family friends as well.

2188
02:56:48,559 --> 02:56:57,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so refreshing to have just watched you grow into the public servant that you are.

2189
02:56:57,425 --> 02:57:01,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that you will continue to get involved in our community because we need you.

2190
02:57:05,192 --> 02:57:09,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, Michael and I have been on both sides.

2191
02:57:09,333 --> 02:57:11,234
[SPEAKER_02]: He yells at me more than anyone else.

2192
02:57:11,434 --> 02:57:16,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day I get a phone call saying, what about this state legislation that's going on?

2193
02:57:16,636 --> 02:57:19,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's chapter 843, section 13?

2194
02:57:19,877 --> 02:57:25,839
[SPEAKER_02]: You think you have all those sections memorized?

2195
02:57:25,919 --> 02:57:28,440
[SPEAKER_02]: He's asking me, I don't even know what he's talking about.

2196
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:34,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But the important thing is that you have demonstrated even tonight,

2197
02:57:36,755 --> 02:57:44,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That not only are you tenacious with regard to your concern about the city and its well being.

2198
02:57:45,420 --> 02:57:51,283
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also showed the humanistic part of you when you said, I want to recognize.

2199
02:57:51,835 --> 02:57:59,202
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who do the work in this community, and those who have elected you to office.

2200
02:58:00,042 --> 02:58:05,487
[SPEAKER_02]: You recognize them, you recognize them because that's what you were all about.

2201
02:58:06,068 --> 02:58:14,715
[SPEAKER_02]: People gave you this opportunity, you took advantage of it, and you worked very hard to make sure that they were represented.

2202
02:58:15,156 --> 02:58:17,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So God bless you and your family.

2203
02:58:20,032 --> 02:58:23,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that, as I said to John, I give you this citation.

2204
02:58:23,794 --> 02:58:26,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had 50 of them, so you don't have to worry about it.

2205
02:58:27,215 --> 02:58:28,636
[SPEAKER_02]: On behalf of our delegation.

2206
02:58:29,196 --> 02:58:32,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But you worked very hard for the people of the community.

2207
02:58:33,298 --> 02:58:42,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you on behalf of the delegation, but more important, I think I can speak for the people of the city of Medford to say, don't go away.

2208
02:58:43,562 --> 02:58:47,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back and help make this community as great as we want it to be.

2209
02:58:48,124 --> 02:58:49,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you and God bless you.

2210
02:59:15,925 --> 02:59:16,125
[SPEAKER_11]: All yours.

2211
02:59:17,926 --> 02:59:18,166
All right.

2212
02:59:21,626 --> 02:59:22,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2213
02:59:22,127 --> 02:59:22,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2214
02:59:24,627 --> 02:59:25,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2215
02:59:25,087 --> 02:59:29,768
[SPEAKER_17]: From the public regarding the nice tribute that was made to these gentlemen tonight.

2216
02:59:30,789 --> 02:59:33,609
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some people who decided to watch this at home.

2217
02:59:34,410 --> 02:59:37,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And I almost didn't come because I know I would be seeing Michael.

2218
02:59:37,510 --> 02:59:44,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sort of, you know, a little bit more privileged than some people that we've become friends through the years.

2219
02:59:45,221 --> 02:59:53,999
[SPEAKER_17]: But there are some things that need to be mentioned because these jobs are very, very time consuming and people don't realize.

2220
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:57,691
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, all the time and the effort that goes goes into it.

2221
02:59:58,571 --> 03:00:04,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know john as well as I know, Michael, I know is know that your intentions are good.

2222
03:00:04,592 --> 03:00:06,352
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've listened carefully over the years.

2223
03:00:06,892 --> 03:00:13,094
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, I met Michael personally, actually through Councilman Robert Penta.

2224
03:00:13,714 --> 03:00:23,896
[SPEAKER_17]: So I knew if they were sort of pals, it was either going to be fireworks, or he was going to sort of follow in the footsteps and really do his homework to

2225
03:00:24,577 --> 03:00:27,518
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will say that my friends agree that you really, really did.

2226
03:00:27,538 --> 03:00:35,339
[SPEAKER_17]: We hate to lose you, but we're really not losing you because we have so many contributions through the years that you've done.

2227
03:00:35,999 --> 03:00:46,301
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will tell you a funny little snippet because the first time Michael came into my home, I had talked to him on the phone and we had written emails and whatnot.

2228
03:00:47,601 --> 03:00:51,082
[SPEAKER_17]: He was very gracious in talking to all my neighbors.

2229
03:00:51,142 --> 03:00:53,802
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't a big political thing for him, but he accompanied Bob

2230
03:00:54,358 --> 03:00:54,938
[SPEAKER_17]: to my house.

2231
03:00:55,559 --> 03:01:05,225
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I have my seasonal parties, and we had chatted more and I come to the podium, I included him, not as a guest to my home, but as a friend.

2232
03:01:05,845 --> 03:01:08,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So one night he came in and he looked a little harried.

2233
03:01:08,907 --> 03:01:18,433
[SPEAKER_17]: So there were people usually what about 20 at a time at the seasonal parties and he was walking around and I said to my friends Jim glad Michael could make it he's so busy.

2234
03:01:20,136 --> 03:01:25,759
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, so I then I turned I overheard him saying, boy, I was really tired I ran out tonight.

2235
03:01:26,159 --> 03:01:33,043
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought he was going to say, but then I remembered the hostess, you know, Sharon goes, but I remember the food she made.

2236
03:01:33,603 --> 03:01:36,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So, that was good.

2237
03:01:38,270 --> 03:01:51,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to tell you that he's a man of his word, and he also serves the public taxpayer, which people have to be very, very mindful for because we will be watching year after year.

2238
03:01:51,802 --> 03:02:03,411
[SPEAKER_17]: We're the ones who are the property owners and are very, very concerned about where our money's being spent because of differences of opinion and also differences of needs.

2239
03:02:04,132 --> 03:02:24,771
[SPEAKER_17]: shouldn't be city spending millions of dollars, and that this sidewalks are still cluttered in full of trash in certain areas, it's just, those are the types of things that he would, you could call him for my friends would say, should I call, I used to say, the only ones I really know well, Adam Knight, Michael mocks john Falco.

2240
03:02:25,652 --> 03:02:29,414
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll call Michael, because we hear him yelling all the time at the meetings.

2241
03:02:30,015 --> 03:02:43,463
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just a little picture of how he took time out of his very busy day when I took over the site from the city three years ago to add flowers and decor to that park, because it was getting run down.

2242
03:02:44,364 --> 03:02:48,547
[SPEAKER_17]: And my brother and my father had found these homes years ago to put us in.

2243
03:02:49,047 --> 03:02:50,508
[SPEAKER_17]: And I spoke to him that week.

2244
03:02:50,548 --> 03:02:53,690
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, would you do us the honor of coming down and saying a few words?

2245
03:02:54,690 --> 03:02:57,032
[SPEAKER_17]: He was wonderful that day, ran out of the house.

2246
03:02:57,452 --> 03:03:04,076
[SPEAKER_17]: I think your son was home from school, and he said, I'd like to stay longer, but the kids come first, and we so understood.

2247
03:03:04,657 --> 03:03:07,459
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will not be seeing you soon enough at home.

2248
03:03:07,979 --> 03:03:19,206
[SPEAKER_17]: People know from experience that they really, really cherish your years here, that we hope that we see you at the podium soon, and I will see you soon personally.

2249
03:03:19,226 --> 03:03:21,728
[SPEAKER_17]: And a healthy year to everyone.

2250
03:03:22,148 --> 03:03:23,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your time.

2251
03:03:23,513 --> 03:03:24,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Michael.

2252
03:03:24,373 --> 03:03:35,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, John, so much.

2253
03:03:35,835 --> 03:03:36,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President.

2254
03:03:37,236 --> 03:03:40,716
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to take Michael out, so if you could pick up the pace before the restaurant closes.

2255
03:03:40,736 --> 03:03:43,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get that.

2256
03:03:44,797 --> 03:03:45,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2257
03:03:45,597 --> 03:03:48,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, before the restaurant closes.

2258
03:03:48,398 --> 03:03:50,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

2259
03:03:51,036 --> 03:03:55,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all right, listen, I just wanted to add a few Andrewisms.

2260
03:03:55,398 --> 03:03:59,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be remiss not to say a few words on this last meeting of the year.

2261
03:04:01,321 --> 03:04:09,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, honorable Councilors, and start with our city Councilor, John Falco.

2262
03:04:09,704 --> 03:04:14,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You've always been a good Councilor and a superb, great gentleman.

2263
03:04:15,287 --> 03:04:15,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2264
03:04:20,230 --> 03:04:31,620
[SPEAKER_05]: To the chair, to city councilor Michael J. Marks, I wanted to thank you for being you and being the best councilor of all for many decades in Medford, Mass.

2265
03:04:32,581 --> 03:04:34,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the best of the litter.

2266
03:04:35,744 --> 03:04:36,705
[SPEAKER_05]: What else can I say?

2267
03:04:36,805 --> 03:04:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless, Godspeed, and good weed.

2268
03:04:40,929 --> 03:04:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew said that, dark on.

2269
03:04:44,452 --> 03:04:44,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And now,

2270
03:04:46,385 --> 03:05:01,711
[SPEAKER_05]: As you said at the last meeting, Councilor Marks, maybe you'll join me on this side of the railing and approve the unoccupied real estate tax exemption through the council and the mayor, and then run for governor.

2271
03:05:02,692 --> 03:05:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2272
03:05:04,032 --> 03:05:08,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Wish you all a happy Christmas and holidays and a good, healthy New Year's.

2273
03:05:08,954 --> 03:05:09,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Love you.

2274
03:05:09,454 --> 03:05:09,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2275
03:05:10,155 --> 03:05:11,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Quickest, we'll pass to Councilor Bears.

2276
03:05:12,115 --> 03:05:13,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I found, oh.

2277
03:05:14,927 --> 03:05:16,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, excuse me.

2278
03:05:16,728 --> 03:05:18,609
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't realize you're gonna allow folks from the audience.

2279
03:05:20,750 --> 03:05:22,170
[SPEAKER_18]: We're here with someone from 1892.

2280
03:05:25,012 --> 03:05:26,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Great service, Mr. Delato, 1892.

2281
03:05:26,632 --> 03:05:28,233
[SPEAKER_18]: He looks the same.

2282
03:05:28,953 --> 03:05:30,534
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what the pill is that he's taking.

2283
03:05:30,574 --> 03:05:32,815
[SPEAKER_18]: It's probably not the blue pill, but that's neither here or there.

2284
03:05:34,783 --> 03:05:57,798
[SPEAKER_18]: When I look at these two gentlemen here, I don't know John Falco as well as I do Michael Marx, but I will tell you this, going back to when John Falco was first running for school committee, I met with him and my wife at a restaurant at Mystic Avenue, and he was gracious enough to listen to her concerns being a school teacher as to what possibly could be things that he could bring forward to the school department for which he did.

2285
03:05:58,714 --> 03:06:13,051
[SPEAKER_18]: And I appreciate that and I commend them for taking the opportunity for run for higher office this past year, because it takes an awful lot for someone to give up something that you might have as a security position, which would be a council school committee seat to take the next step forward.

2286
03:06:13,631 --> 03:06:14,973
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you don't try and never know.

2287
03:06:14,993 --> 03:06:18,177
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as Michael Max goes all I can say.

2288
03:06:20,386 --> 03:06:29,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish he was here a little bit longer because I think he probably would have given me the one last incentive to once again run for this August party only for one reason.

2289
03:06:30,934 --> 03:06:43,183
[SPEAKER_18]: This city is going through a tremendous, like the country, a tremendous amount of change and you do need some level-headed people to understand yesterday, to capitalize what's going to take place for today.

2290
03:06:43,203 --> 03:06:48,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope and wish that this new incoming council can put together

2291
03:06:49,553 --> 03:07:05,679
[SPEAKER_18]: with the fellows that are here for a few years, some wisdom and common sense that recognizes that we are the city of method, and as an as inclusive as we are, we should not be divisive at the same time, because it cannot work and you cannot sustain itself.

2292
03:07:06,359 --> 03:07:09,140
[SPEAKER_18]: I thank you, Michael for your years of service your dedication.

2293
03:07:09,722 --> 03:07:16,246
[SPEAKER_18]: But more importantly, I thank your family for allowing you to do it like my family allowed me to do mine for 36 years.

2294
03:07:16,747 --> 03:07:20,569
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it and I know your folks and your families appreciate it.

2295
03:07:21,009 --> 03:07:31,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I just hope that the incoming city council grasps the knowledge that needs to be taken to make this city work to go forward and to be able to question

2296
03:07:31,796 --> 03:07:37,120
[SPEAKER_18]: without having to be called divisive rather than not divisive.

2297
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:44,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Asking a question to get an answer is the best way to resolve an issue rather than not listening.

2298
03:07:44,184 --> 03:07:48,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I think it was you, John Scott that says, you listen and you listen.

2299
03:07:48,126 --> 03:07:50,288
[SPEAKER_18]: And the more you listen, the more you can learn.

2300
03:07:51,028 --> 03:07:53,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Merry Christmas, happy, healthy new year.

2301
03:07:53,510 --> 03:07:55,271
[SPEAKER_18]: And congratulations, John and Michael.

2302
03:07:56,027 --> 03:07:57,228
[SPEAKER_18]: You're welcome.

2303
03:07:57,248 --> 03:07:58,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Records, we'll pass the Council of Mayors.

2304
03:07:58,589 --> 03:08:00,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Council of Mayors, how did you find those records?

2305
03:08:00,570 --> 03:08:04,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Found those records splendid, and I move approval.

2306
03:08:04,712 --> 03:08:06,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Flanagan.

2307
03:08:06,193 --> 03:08:07,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2308
03:08:07,974 --> 03:08:08,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2309
03:08:11,957 --> 03:08:12,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2312
03:08:18,521 --> 03:08:18,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2313
03:08:19,902 --> 03:08:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 70 in approval of the motion.

2314
03:08:21,977 --> 03:08:23,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish everybody Merry Christmas.

2315
03:08:23,858 --> 03:08:23,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2316
03:08:24,019 --> 03:08:24,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2317
03:08:24,319 --> 03:08:24,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2318
03:08:24,519 --> 03:08:24,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2319
03:08:24,639 --> 03:08:24,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
