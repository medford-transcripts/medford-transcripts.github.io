    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=528.114s">It</a>  was an honor and a privilege to serve with Paulette Vander Kloof for the six years I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=536.995s">Paulette,</a>  don't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=539.516s">During</a>  that period of time, Mr. President, the school committee ushered in what we refer to still after 20 something years, the brand new schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=550.342s">And</a>  that was a very trying time as a member of Vanderkloot remembers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=555.706s">It</a>  was a lot of time and effort put into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=558.668s">And</a>  the one thing, Mr. President, I do remember is Paulette Vanderkloot gave birth to her daughter on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=569.817s">Is</a>  that not correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=572.479s">And,</a>  you know, being a politician, I wanted to try to outdo Paulette. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=579.148s">And</a>  I missed it by about six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=582.31s">My</a>  wife gave birth to our twins the night before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=587.112s">And</a>  I still resent that, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=588.413s">I</a>  don't know how you held off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=590.374s">I</a>  don't know what food you were eating, but you did a great job holding off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=594.576s">And</a>  the other point I have to mention, Mr. President, that I still resent to this day, is that Paulette Van der Kloot stole <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=603.501s">George</a>  Scarpelli's slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=606.463s">Give</a>  a hoot vote, Scarpelli was the original slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=612.026s">And</a>  that was stolen by Paulette. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=613.807s">And</a>  I hope someday she recognizes that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=617.169s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=633.555s">Yeah,</a>  see? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=634.035s">These</a>  are all the ones you missed last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=642.502s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President and members of the council.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=645.925s">Paulette,</a>  on behalf of the delegation, state delegation, state representative Farber, I believe who's your state representative in your district, and he regrets that he was not able to be here tonight because of another engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=662.985s">Let</a>  me thank, well, we know each other personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=665.465s">We</a>  spent many of the Fourth of July together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=668.946s">And</a>  the dismay of this community is going to be that we don't have a Paulette Vanderkoop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=678.788s">With</a>  her knowledge of what was going on in the public school systems from the stages of the beginning of what this school was all about, and all the new schools that were there, Paulette Vanderkoop was in the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=693.06s">of</a>  making it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=694.881s">And</a>  slogan that you have, you know, give a hoot and both of, I don't believe it was his.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=701.444s">No,</a>  give a hoot was so popular, he tried to take it over.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=707.906s">But</a>  on behalf of the state delegation, I present you a citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=713.129s">I'm</a>  not gonna read it, because you're giving it 1,400 of those away. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=716.75s">But</a>  it's from our heart for all of the work that you did as a member of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=723.545s">a</a>  dedicated member of the school committee, one who made a major mark in education in our community, and you'll never be forgotten for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=731.191s">God</a>  bless you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=746.764s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=747.805s">And</a>  Paula, with age comes wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=753.093s">And</a>  you've brought a lot of wisdom to the city council over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=757.514s">And</a>  I thank you for your years of service to the city.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=762.476s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may just, I was grateful to be able to be here last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=768.297s">And</a>  here's some from so many of the folks that you served with and worked with over your years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=773.638s">And</a>  I was able to say to you last night, but I think it's worth saying to the public, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=780.432s">that</a>  I was able to grow up and go to schools that you built and the school system that you built. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=786.853s">And</a>  I've never known a Medford that didn't have a Paulette Van der Kloot on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=792.114s">So</a>  I'm just incredibly grateful for the service that you provided and for the education that I was able to receive, I think with a big portion of credit going to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=803.497s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1041.717s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1046.78s">Just</a>  as some initial comments, I believe we obviously have discussed these positions at two prior meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1057.386s">I</a>  believe we share a common vision and goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1060.588s">That</a>  is to develop a comprehensive ARPA spending plan which is built on a solid foundation so that the city can maximize its federal and state aid opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1071.228s">We</a>  see that solid foundation being inclusive of the City Council's input, the community's input, and the input of key positions within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1080.279s">The</a>  positions before the City Council this evening are the bare minimum positions that are necessary to begin that planning effort in a sustainable way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1088.268s">Without</a>  these key positions, we will be under-resourced when it comes <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1091.934s">to</a>  reaching for more resources and opportunities at the federal and state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1096.379s">There</a>  were several questions, in fact, several statements made at the Committee of the Whole meeting last week on the subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1103.407s">We</a>  did take those comments to heart and are prepared to provide further information to the degree we are able to at this early stage on each. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1111.88s">We</a>  sincerely ask for your support this evening as anything short of approval will have a negative impact on the city's ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic surge we're currently experiencing and will negatively impact the city's ability to maximize funding in this pandemic when resources are the biggest constraining factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1129.871s">Thank</a>  you for your consideration.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1132.792s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1133.893s">Any</a>  discussion on this before we take a vote?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1138.195s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1140.289s">In</a>  terms of how we're going to do this, Mr. President, what will we be doing will be going through each amendment will go for each one each member separate, are we going to discuss these amendments or just go.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1150.407s">We</a>  discussed them, I think we discussed them last week in Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1155.97s">If</a>  there's any discussion on them, we'll entertain that just as we get to each one.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1160.051s">The</a>  only concern I have is which positions are presently filled, which positions are filled and will be expiring for kids, after the Kids Act funding expires, which positions will go unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1173.037s">For</a>  example, is amendment not funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1174.718s">Is</a>  that a concern?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1179.586s">Yes,</a>  I'd be happy to, Mr. President, and through you to Vice President Knight, I also would ask that the Health Director, Marianne O'Connor, jump in if I miss anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1192.213s">Amendment</a>  G, I'm sorry, Amendment F, the Economic Development Planner, I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1201.737s">Planning</a>  Development Sustainability Director Alicia Hunt, who's online this evening, mentioned at one of the prior meetings that this position was quasi-filled, so to speak, that we're looking to, we have an existing employee who we would like to transition into this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1216.402s">Anyway,</a>  moving on quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1219.563s">Amendment</a>  K, administrative support for COVID-19.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1227.232s">Way</a>  of evasion, Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1228.813s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1231.154s">Nina,</a>  if I may, you said quasi-filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1234.136s">Is</a>  it filled or is it not filled?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1237.518s">The</a>  cleanest answer is it's not filled.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1240.16s">It's</a>  not filled.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1241.081s">Mr.</a>  President, to be- Let's stick to the clean answers just to get through this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1245.263s">Could</a>  we just discuss each amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1248.385s">Could</a>  we have that question answered as we go through the amendments instead of doing it all at once and then going back?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1254.709s">All</a>  right, we'll start with amendment F. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1258.113s">On</a>  the motion, the economic development plan, do we have a motion on the table for the economic development plan?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1291.97s">Chair</a>  awaits the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1292.931s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1293.971s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1295.533s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

We're on amendment F, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1300.957s">We're</a>  going to start with the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1301.898s">We're</a>  going to go right down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1302.579s">We're</a>  going to start at F and we're going to go right to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1306.903s">And</a>  we'll discuss each one as we get to them.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1308.704s">Right,</a>  but we had a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1310.265s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1310.906s">Which</a>  questions were asked of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1314.591s">And</a>  I think we should at least get those questions answered before we go through the whole process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1321.056s">But</a>  I had one question regarding frontline workers and first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1326.039s">And</a>  we were told by the city administration that there may be a salary limitation for those workers to receive APA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1339.289s">And</a>  I was wondering if that question has been answered, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1344.367s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1345.848s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1347.388s">I</a>  did look further into this information that's this question that was raised at the committee of the whole meeting, and I had seemed to recall a number and there's actually a lot of guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1359.233s">And</a>  so I'm just going to read very quickly unfortunately there is no straightforward answer as I mentioned, these rules have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1365.676s">a</a>  tremendous amount of data and information behind them, but I'll make it as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1370.98s">Basically,</a>  per the interim final rule issued by the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1374.903s">If</a>  premium pay would increase a worker's total above 150% of their residing states annual <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1380.927s">average</a>  annual wage for all occupants as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, or their residing country's average annual wage as defined by the same Bureau, whichever is higher on an annual basis, and then it goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1397.963s">So</a>  there's calculations that need to occur to determine that so-called minimum that we discussed, Councilor Marks, at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1406.119s">Again,</a>  I'm happy to look further into this as we review again, premium pay and we review all the different categories with the federal funds manager.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1416.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1416.963s">So</a>  from what I'm hearing tonight, that would not be a reason that frontline workers and first responders would not be able to attain some upper money <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1426.214s">for</a>  being on the front lines during the past 22 months of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1431.716s">So</a>  that's encouraging to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1433.596s">I</a>  just hope the administration falls through, Mr. President, taking care of those workers, as I mentioned during the Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1441.099s">We're</a>  talking about workers that work at a convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1445.66s">that</a>  were in the front line, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1447.401s">We're</a>  talking about workers at stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1449.721s">We're</a>  talking about workers that worked in a doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1453.362s">We're</a>  talking about postal workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1455.763s">We're</a>  talking about police, fire, EMTs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1459.784s">So</a>  I just hope, Mr. President, with this $49 million the city's receiving from the federal government, that we put our money where our mouth is and take care of those workers, Mr. President, that put their life on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1475.182s">and</a>  put their family's life on the line to make sure we could function as a community and as a society. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1481.824s">So</a>  I would hope the administration steps forward on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1486.146s">Amendment</a>  O, as I mentioned, Mr. President, it says that this is a CAF 12, which is the federal funds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1494.648s">I</a>  don't believe that it's a CAF 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1500.75s">I</a>  would say that's more of a CAF <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1503.687s">15,</a>  Mr. President, based on that salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1506.948s">And</a>  I don't know if that's an error that was made by the administration, but if they can also talk to that, Mr. President, I'd be curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1514.889s">Nina,</a>  can you answer that question?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1517.529s">Absolutely,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1519.07s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1520.99s">This</a>  actually came to my attention that there may be an error on this item on Monday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1527.391s">I</a>  wrote back to the clerk who was copied on the email <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1533.232s">It</a>  was brought to my attention by the director of veteran services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1536.413s">And</a>  I wrote back to the city clerk on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1538.954s">I</a>  copied the city council president and the city council vice president on this, noting that there was a Scrivener's error indicating that it is a CAF 15.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1549.919s">So</a>  that is an error that we're being asked to vote on, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1553.2s">Yes,</a>  we'll change it.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1554.861s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1555.421s">And</a>  that's an important change, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1558.447s">And</a>  the last point, Mr. President, I would like to bring up, and I brought this up during the Committee of the Whole meeting, so I've been very consistent on bringing up this issue, is the fact that we still have department heads in this community, non-union department heads, who for the past 22 months have not received a step raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1581.829s">And</a>  I think the question was offered by Vice President Knight about whether that's contractual or not and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1589.015s">But</a>  here we have a number of upper positions, Mr. President, at salaries that far exceed some of our department heads, existing department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1602.977s">So</a>  it's a tough pill to swallow when we're asking to bring in new positions, Mr. President, at a higher salary range while existing employees, existing department heads did not get their step raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1621.202s">And</a>  we heard money was tight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1624.503s">And</a>  now we have $49 million of federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1630.392s">and</a>  we have commitments out there to every non-union department head that they should receive their step raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1639.595s">So</a>  I have a real tough time, Mr. President, voting for new positions for ARPA at a higher salary range without taking care of existing employees in this building that have been in here every day fighting through the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1659.383s">And</a>  that's an important distinction, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1662.064s">We</a>  should take care of the workers we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1664.526s">And</a>  as I stated at the community hall meeting, if we don't address frontline workers, first responders, as part of this ARPA funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1678.115s">And</a>  if we don't take care of city employees, current city employees, I will not support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1684.537s">I</a>  don't care how critical the administration says it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1687.358s">They've</a>  been sitting on this paper for the past four months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1691.18s">We</a>  don't even have a federal funds manager, someone to oversee all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1696.021s">They</a>  could have put a federal funds manager, the first position on several months back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1702.806s">And</a>  now we're being told this is critical.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1705.447s">It's</a>  critical because they dropped the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1708.549s">That's</a>  why it's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1712.451s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1713.532s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1714.572s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1716.863s">The</a>  reason I motion to table amendment F is that there are several positions in here I think many in public health that are currently filled and using cares act funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1727.774s">My</a>  preference tonight would be that the council approved those positions so that those those continue to be funded we're moving from one federal funding source the cares act to the another one the ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1737.501s">I</a>  think the federal funds manager is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1740.702s">Obviously,</a>  interested to hear the discussion and get questions answered but that's kind of where I'm coming from on this tonight, you know, we can have further discussion on positions that aren't filled but if there's stuff currently filled using cares act funding, and it's moving over to ARPA, I think we should move forward with that tonight.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1756.987s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1758.868s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1760.876s">I</a>  appreciate everybody's hard work on presenting this but, again, I think Council marks brings out some valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1767.701s">And</a>  the first point that I think that business area and has has expressed the beginning and that our community whole meetings is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1777.214s">is</a>  really a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1778.215s">I'm</a>  finding this bothersome that we talked about this with traffic and parking, that when we're talking about money and different departments and really not having a plan in place yet and still having a focus group, but that was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1792.182s">But</a>  as this comes through our process here, again, without having <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1806.233s">these</a>  positions, and with the shared vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1810.719s">I</a>  don't know how we can support until we know what this this ARPA money is going to encompass, because one of the things that was very clear last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1821.494s">that</a>  other department heads weren't involved in these discussions, not to say that these positions right now aren't important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1829.678s">And</a>  I would tend to maybe agree with Councilor Bears with continuing some of these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1836.041s">But</a>  I think right now, I think Councilor Marks brought it up last week, that this position, Amendment O, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1845.605s">That</a>  should have been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1846.646s">I</a>  think that tonight would probably be the only position that I would even entertain for the fact that we really don't have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1853.232s">And</a>  this person for this position is the person to help us with that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1858.977s">Other</a>  than that, I don't, until we bring everybody to the table and really share a vision, you know, I'm lucky that I work in a community that the city council works with the administration and <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1872.062s">they</a>  share each other's visions to get the product to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1876.325s">And</a>  I'm not seeing this here and I'm very disappointed, really disheartened actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1881.408s">So</a>  this is a lot of money that can do a lot of great things for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1885.55s">And</a>  right now, it seems like what we're getting now with traffic and parking now this paper is <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1893.865s">We're</a>  just gonna add things and spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1896.426s">And</a>  then when we come down to some important pieces that we all feel that are important, we're gonna be told what? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1902.727s">Unfortunately,</a>  we spent all of our ARPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1905.608s">And</a>  without a plan, I can't support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1908.128s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1908.949s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1909.269s">Councilor</a>  Bacow.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1910.229s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1912.169s">I</a>  wanna share, I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1914.99s">This</a>  is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1916.99s">I</a>  know myself, I've been talking about this for months on end, and that there is absolutely no plan <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1924.232s">at</a>  all with regard to ARPA from the administration, none $48 million in no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1931.795s">We</a>  have had, we have not had a CFO for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1937.35s">Six</a>  months we have $191 million budget we have no CFO $48 million in ARPA funding no CFO, and no one right now is currently managing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1947.814s">I</a>  don't even think they're discussing opera in the finance office because I think they're basically trying to just do the day to day activities that that that occur on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1957.799s">This</a>  is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1959.444s">And</a>  then they throw it on us to say, oh, we need all these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1963.087s">There's</a>  no planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1964.028s">There's</a>  a complete lack of planning when it comes to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1966.951s">And</a>  it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1968.532s">I</a>  definitely could vote on the federal funds manager because I think that kicks us all off with regard to planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1976.339s">Eventually</a>  we're gonna have to plan to do something with this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1979.702s">It's</a>  unfortunate that the discussion has not happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1984.726s">And</a>  if I may, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1987.44s">Cat</a>  15 Can you give us the range please.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1994.443s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, through you to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2001.267s">I</a>  have 8542 62 to 94,000 to 3532.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2005.228s">Okay,</a>  so that is the actual cat 15, but it was just listed as cap 12 on the original document.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2014.793s">Yes,</a>  Councilor my that's a scrivener's error. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2017.517s">On</a>  my end, I made that error.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2022.821s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2023.682s">And</a>  who actually helps determine the actual caps? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2027.485s">Is</a>  that the chief people officer?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2030.587s">There</a>  is a process to review similar positions in other communities, similar positions within our organization, level of obviously work responsibility, level of training and education, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2045.048s">Yes,</a>  it is essentially the human resources department that chief people officer becomes responsible to make recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2110.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2113.79s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2117.453s">Are</a>  we in the process of, I thought we were in the process of reviewing everybody's salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2124.378s">Is</a>  that something we were doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2127.053s">Isn't</a>  that I believe it was something that the mayor brought up that they were going to look at every position and look at each individual salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2135.1s">Is</a>  this still happening or this wasn't part of that?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2140.084s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2142.266s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2143.247s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2143.987s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scalapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2145.168s">Yes,</a>  that is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2146.77s">We</a>  have a classification and compensation study that's going to be launching very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2153.395s">The</a>  city has received a grant for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2156.305s">Um,</a>  and essentially that process takes several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2160.147s">Um,</a>  it's, it's, it's a process that will, uh, basically go on for much longer than the time period in which we need to get moving on many of these positions, but absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2172.774s">I</a>  mean, these would be reviewed, um, to the degree, you know, each position, um, essentially the process has a cost per position. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2182.54s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2184.156s">You</a>  know, we'd have to do the math as we enter to add positions to this organization, but we would absolutely review including these and all of, first and foremost, the existing positions we have.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2200.462s">Last</a>  question, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2202.924s">Right</a>  now, how many of our units, are we whole now with every unit right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2208.607s">Do</a>  we have any negotiations for contracts? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2210.608s">A</a>  teacher's union, I believe is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2212.469s">Are</a>  the other unions, as we move forward through these money papers, is everything complete? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2219.613s">Do</a>  we have any big outstanding raises coming up or negotiations still out there?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2227.465s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2230.308s">I</a>  would advise that the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2232.53s">And</a>  again, I'm happy to answer the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2236.715s">I</a>  would not be the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2238.937s">I'm</a>  not anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2240.058s">You</a>  guys are the body, um, as to who is responsible for the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2244.943s">I'm</a>  happy to answer the questions, but Contracts, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2250.73s">Other</a>  other issues relating to Mr. President are not items that are on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2256.455s">Again,</a>  I'm happy to answer the question I'm just advising and cautioning the city council as to the open meeting</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2266.752s">This</a>  is the question I'm presenting is on behalf of a money paper that we're voting on about money that this city has to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2275.897s">So</a>  as we make our decisions, I think it's important that we know if there are outstanding negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2281.9s">It's</a>  not, you could say yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2284.261s">You</a>  could say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2285.421s">I'm</a>  not asking for any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2286.882s">I'm</a>  not asking for anything that would interfere with any sort of negotiations, union negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2293.886s">The</a>  question I have in front of you is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2296.579s">is</a>  that are there any outstanding negotiations still with any major union in the city as you move forward to vote on a money paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2304.866s">I</a>  believe that has nothing to do with the violation of meeting law, because it's a money paper that's in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2310.05s">We're</a>  voting on money.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2312.932s">Mr.</a>  President, again, I'm happy to answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2317.055s">Again,</a>  it's not on the agenda, but the answer is yes, there are collective bargaining agreements that have not been settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2324.492s">prior</a>  to this administration, which had not been settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2327.436s">And</a>  I will add, Mr. President, that those are not able to use ARPA funding to subsidize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2334.363s">So</a>  again, that's the reason I was cautioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2336.306s">I</a>  was not intending, Councilor Scarapelli, to avoid the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2340.891s">By</a>  any means, I'm just trying to provide some guidance.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2345.572s">Okay,</a>  so that would have been my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2347.332s">But</a>  if you answer the question, the simple question, because it seemed like it was avoidance, just so our chief of staff could understand what it looks like, at least to this council.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2357.074s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2357.975s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2358.995s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2361.035s">Mr.</a>  President, just a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2363.116s">The</a>  fire department has been without a contract, I believe, for close to two years now.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2368.897s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2369.217s">All</a>  right, so get back to amendment F. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2373.745s">has</a>  been a motion before by Councilor Bears to table the economic development planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2381.008s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2382.949s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2385.01s">The</a>  table, the table.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2392.734s">Again,</a>  Mr. President, this is not a position that's that's in place, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2397.317s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2398.197s">Mr.</a>  President, can we just ask if the committee, in case I got it wrong, I'd just like to ask the Planning Development and Sustainability Director to speak on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2406.541s">I</a>  know she wanted to speak earlier.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2407.942s">It's</a>  a yes or no question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2409.983s">Is</a>  the position vacant? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2411.043s">We</a>  don't need to go into- Is the position vacant? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2413.544s">No,</a>  that's the question.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2415.185s">I</a>  believe the answer is yes, but I'm just looking for confirmation from my colleague.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2419.367s">Okay,</a>  so we have a motion on the floor by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2424.429s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2653.746s">I</a>  know that contact tracer is presently being utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2657.129s">I</a>  defer to- I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2673.424s">So</a>  the data analyst is filled and the community liaison and the contact tracers are not filled, correct?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2679.87s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2688.149s">Mary</a>  and the council is asking you to point three full time employees.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2694.535s">Yes,</a>  she basically works about 10 hours a week and supporting us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2699.119s">10</a>  to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2700.981s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2702.262s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2703.363s">Sorry,</a>  and director O'Connor Did you say the community liaison we don't currently have that filled.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2708.933s">Correct</a>  those are currently filled under grant positions but those grant positions will be expiring in June.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2715.978s">Okay,</a>  so it's the data analysts the liaison are filled in the contact tracer would be additional.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2722.162s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2723.523s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2724.123s">I</a>  would move approval.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2725.664s">Second,</a>  three on all three I mean, yeah, we're in a motion by concept is seconded by Council morale.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2738.895s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2739.796s">I</a>  will not be voting on this position as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2743.338s">I</a>  just find it ironic, Mr. President, that when these positions were put forth for spending of ARPA money to assist in COVID needs in the community, that the administration was at the table, the Office of Community Development was at the table, and the Board of Health was at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2764.26s">who</a>  was not at the table, Mr. President, that would equally have needs for COVID spending, the Council on Aging was not at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2773.908s">Police</a>  and fire, first responders in this community were not at the table to seek what their needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2781.094s">The</a>  building department, DPW, the Office of Diversity, Mr. President, was not at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2790.119s">So</a>  in a sense of fairness, Mr. President, when we talk about not having a plan, as Councilor Falco mentions, he's absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2800.844s">Again,</a>  here we are going forward without a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2805.627s">I'm</a>  having deja vu. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2807.628s">Two</a>  weeks ago, they asked us to vote to extend contracts so the city administration could take parking enforcement in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2817.119s">And</a>  this council said, what's the plan that you have to take over this program January 5th of next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2824.245s">And</a>  the administration says, we don't have a plan.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2829.469s">So</a>  here we are again, voting on things without a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2837.495s">I</a>  just don't know where this council's going, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2841.398s">I</a>  understand there's a need for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2844.734s">but</a>  there's also a need to follow a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2847.795s">There's</a>  also a need to include all stakeholders, Mr. President, and that's currently not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2855.737s">When</a>  you have three department heads sitting around a table and omitting the other 10 department heads that have similar needs, I have a concern with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2864.499s">When</a>  you're bringing in people off the street at a higher salary, Mr. President, then counting workers, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2872.787s">When</a>  people aren't getting step raises and this council votes to bring people off the street at a higher salary, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2882.51s">And</a>  we can always put things off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2884.571s">You</a>  know, I hear people fighting for people and people fight for this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2888.793s">When</a>  push comes to shove, they bury their head in the sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2895.258s">And</a>  this is the exact issue right now when we talk about first responders and we talk about frontline workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2901.16s">Again,</a>  we allow the administration to go off without a plan, and we refuse, Mr. President, to address the current needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2912.124s">It's</a>  a sad state of affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2914.245s">Let</a>  me tell you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2915.805s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2916.345s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2916.846s">So,</a>  Vice President Knight, could Director O'Connor please clarify again when the grant expires on these greenfield positions?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2925.845s">Yes,</a>  certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2927.006s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2929.108s">For</a>  the community liaisons, the grant will expire in June.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2936.735s">And</a>  for data analysts?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2939.217s">The</a>  CARES Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2940.338s">That's</a>  a currently filled position by CARES Act, which is no longer available. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2944.362s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2947.705s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2949.346s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2950.147s">Councilor</a>  Scott Belli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2951.663s">Again,</a>  looking at the positions I agree with Council marks wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2956.747s">I</a>  believe I said that my first statement that we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2961.971s">We're</a>  doing this piecemeal, and it's not fair, but at the same time, I'm also looking at the positions that are there that are upholding that these positions to the coven. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2974.216s">pandemic</a>  and looking to make sure that those positions are still moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2980.819s">So</a>  as of right now, again, just for clarification, because maybe I'm not that quick, but the data analysis person is in place, but ends in June.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2994.225s">Data</a>  analysis is paid under the CARES Act.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2996.246s">CARES</a>  Act that ends in June.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3000.672s">So</a>  the liaison is on a grant that's here till June.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3004.776s">Motion</a>  to sever data analysts from the other two positions.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3010.022s">The</a>  motion by Councilor Bears to sever the data analyst position from the other two positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3015.407s">Seconded</a>  by Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3016.849s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3029.117s">Yes,</a>  several council bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3031.279s">Yes,</a>  Council Falcon. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3032.92s">Yes,</a>  Vice President night. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3035.062s">Councilmarks</a>  No. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3039.486s">Council</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3040.527s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3042.889s">Yes,</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3044.13s">Yes,</a>  60 affirmative on the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3046.312s">Motion</a>  passes listen to approve the data analyst position on the motion by Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3052.857s">If</a>  I may just quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3056.687s">This</a>  is a 0.3, so this is 10 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3058.949s">And</a>  Marianne, did you say there's 600 people just in the month of December?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3065.693s">So</a>  the data analyst position is basically 10 to 12 hours a week, and that helps us set up our clinics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3071.177s">It</a>  helps us convey information to the community on where we're at, where our stats at, helping with the graphs and charts every week, and also doing the back end of the multi-resource <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3085.333s">multilingual</a>  resource line and keeping track of the information coming in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3091.739s">The</a>  contact tracing position, as you may or may not be aware, the state ended its contact tracing program as of December 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3103.129s">Actually,</a>  they stopped taking cases December 1, just as the surge blew up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3109.515s">We</a>  do have a grant that we're currently in regionally with Somerville and Arlington, which has given us additional capability, but no way able to keep up with 650 cases from Medford alone since December 1st, which is why that contact tracing position right now is critical.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3130.783s">So</a>  shouldn't it be more than a 0.5?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3134.324s">Well,</a>  when I wrote this, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3136.92s">It</a>  was pre search, and we had hoped that point five would would do what we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3142.621s">But</a>  again with with the additional help from the grant that we have with metric with some of all knowledge and obviously, you know, it's not what we expected to happen back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3154.284s">So,</a>  it's point five was what was written a month or so ago.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3161.446s">So,</a>  we know we're going into this really not being staffed correctly.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3166.68s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3169.524s">That's</a>  why all of those positions are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3173.008s">We</a>  cannot, we are hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3175.351s">We</a>  need these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3178.595s">We've</a>  lost staff due to COVID fatigue, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3183.481s">The</a>  emergency response coordinator <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3186.158s">we</a>  were being able to pay through CARES funding, that person left, our food security person left, basically burnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3194.78s">We</a>  are in need here in the Board of Health, and we have been doing our best, but I sorely hope that you consider us being able to continue to protect and inform the residents of Medford to the best of our ability, if not, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3215.393s">We're</a>  not going to be able to keep up the vaccination clinics, the testing, the data, the contact tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3222.796s">We're</a>  on the edge.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3226.898s">I</a>  don't disagree that you need the positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3230.379s">I</a>  think one of the big concerns is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3233.361s">And</a>  that is that we've been talking about a pandemic for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3238.543s">It's</a>  not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3241.758s">You</a>  know, I think, you know, many of us or some of us are thinking that this would have been planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3249.925s">And</a>  I'm not, this is not on you, but that this would have been planned out by the administration months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3255.409s">And</a>  we just got this paper a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3259.552s">And</a>  this goes back to Councilor Mark saying that there's no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3265.637s">I</a>  don't, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3267.899s">You</a>  can hop and pop all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3269.14s">There's</a>  no plan.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3271.83s">What</a>  if it makes you comfortable? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3273.291s">Is</a>  the fact that we, this is not worth people's health and lives.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3277.935s">I'm</a>  not saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3278.856s">I</a>  just said, I didn't say that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3280.197s">Well,</a>  if we're not going to pass it, then we're not going to have contact tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3283.159s">We're</a>  in the Omicron surge. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3284.26s">We</a>  have 700 cases or 650 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3286.802s">So,</a>  you know, I'll vote to keep this ball in the air as much as we can, but I'd like to approve the positions.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3293.528s">You</a>  should stay home then.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3294.989s">You</a>  should stay home.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4424.848s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4426.769s">And</a>  this has been a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4430.11s">The</a>  connectivity, I think, is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4433.411s">It</a>  adds a safety element for pedestrians, cyclists, that I think will serve a purpose that has been needed in this community for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4445.676s">It'll</a>  connect the east side of Medford into Medford Square and far beyond, Mr. President, in a safe fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4453.552s">The</a>  one concern in the neighborhood meetings that I attended back some time ago, probably close to two years ago, maybe even longer than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4461.595s">time</a>  flies, is that we're now introducing a bike path slash pedestrian path within feet from the rear doors of many residents on Clippership Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4477.965s">And</a>  that was a major concern at the time of many property owners in that area that, you know, that support the project, but we're also concerned that now we're introducing <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4490.981s">people,</a>  bikes, foot walkers that have never been in that area before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4497.403s">And</a>  they were concerned about safety, public safety and rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4502.144s">So</a>  I was wondering, I noticed in the correspondence we received, it said the purpose of the easement is to install, construct, operate, maintain, repair the recreational non-motorized bicycle pedestrian trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4517.369s">but</a>  it doesn't talk about who is actually going to provide the public safety and patrol that particular area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4526.651s">Now</a>  that we're introducing people along the river back there, that was never a path. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4534.633s">So</a>  I didn't know if the woman from DCI can answer that question or someone from the city administration, but I have a concern about the patrolling and the safety <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4546.877s">of</a>  that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4549.038s">And</a>  will it be lit, Mr. President, at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4552.94s">We</a>  all took, at least I know I did, a tour of the whole area along the water back there, and it's a dark, isolated area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4561.685s">And</a>  I wanna make sure when we do this, I support this 1,000%, but I wanna make sure we're not introducing a public safety concern as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4571.19s">So</a>  I would ask the representative from DCR or someone from the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4576.473s">to</a>  talk about safety and security of people using the path, as well as the direct above us.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4586.335s">So</a>  Mr. President, it is my understanding from discussions with the police in the state that there's a mutual aid agreement for the city and the state on shared use trails like this, so that either one, they will both have jurisdiction on this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4602.64s">The</a>  actual discussion of patrols is one that would occur with the police chief at the point that we actually have something ready to open, which will be on the order of a year from now.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4615.36s">What</a>  about lighting on the bridge?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4616.981s">With</a>  regards to the lighting, there is a plan to do lighting under the I-93 bridge where it will pass under. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4624.244s">But</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4624.924s">Lensing</a>  can correct me if I am wrong on this, but there is a policy in DCR to not light their shared use paths and to not introduce lighting directly along the river because of the wildlife.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4637.685s">Um,</a>  thank you, Mr. That is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4640.088s">We,</a>  um. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4641.77s">Do</a>  not usually like our linear corridors because we also see these as conservation corridors and wildlife corridors, but there will be lighting under the I 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4653.182s">Under</a>  pause.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4659.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4660.276s">So</a>  Mr. President, just so I understand, so there is a commitment that public safety will be provided either by the city of Medford or by state police when this is finally built out and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4674.586s">So</a>  there is a commitment in that part of safety will be enforced, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4680.31s">If</a>  I understood that right, I think that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4682.051s">Am</a>  I correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4683.913s">That</a>  seems correct, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4686.6s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4687.381s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4688.081s">So,</a>  any further discussion on this.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4692.465s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I, I think, as we get closer, I think that Councilmarks brings up a great point that we I think it's important that we let all of the people that will traverse that area, know that that's not going to be a little area because it <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4707.136s">know,</a>  especially as we get going, I think that maybe that when we get closer to this project to completion, that we work with the city and the state to make sure that there's signs posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4717.859s">And</a>  citizens all understand because that's pretty scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4721.981s">I</a>  understand that's conservation land, but not having that area lit in many different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4726.602s">I</a>  know, I know Councilmember Mox brought up the big point of the <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4730.123s">the</a>  members of the community a little bit about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4733.446s">Um,</a>  we've gone to a lot of discussion with this, but now not having a lit area and we can understand being police the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4741.033s">And</a>  we appreciate state and local authorities working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4744.917s">But</a>  I think that, um, making sure at the time we post, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4751.055s">throughout</a>  that area as it gets dark so people can understand that it will not be lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4758.377s">I</a>  know that if my daughter says, Dad, I'm going to go to one side or the other, and I'm going to be pretty scared as a parent that my daughter is going to make that trek during the evening when it's not lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4773.76s">That</a>  could be a recipe for some pretty serious issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4778.562s">So</a>  I would hope that as we get closer and I bring this forward, that we all agree to at least that point that it's a public notice and we put out some signage so people understand what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4791.688s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4792.649s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4793.489s">Any</a>  further questions?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4796.33s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4799.432s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti in Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4804.768s">I</a>  wanna say hallelujah, I am very thrilled and very happy to finally see this project hopefully come to completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4813.777s">This</a>  is a half mile missing bike path that is a blockade to the rest of the 10 miles in both directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4823.967s">From</a>  West Mifflin beyond, you can come to Medford Square today, but this is half mile <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4829.676s">that</a>  does not exist in the middle of the square from the Senior Services Center to the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4837.602s">In</a>  my opinion, this is 20 years late when the new schools were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4842.425s">It</a>  could have been done then, but better late than never, I hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4849.09s">I</a>  hope it gets done now while I'm still alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4853.854s">And</a>  I want, it must be, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4858.313s">done</a>  according to the Riparian Rights Law in 1600s in Massachusetts, which guarantees we the people access to 10 feet above high tide along all waterways, including the Mystic River and the oceans and the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4882.227s">And</a>  especially, it must be completed <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4887.826s">along</a>  the river behind those eight condos, numbered 54 to 68 on Ship Avenue, because they have two fences on each side of the property, next to the Royal House, the Riverside Yacht Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4907.537s">Both</a>  their fences, from the front sidewalk to the rear, they go right into the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4913.86s">That</a>  is a blockage of the 10 foot that <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4917.612s">We</a>  have a right under the repairing rights law in this state from the 1600s mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4924.417s">So,</a>  and if the condo owners didn't know they didn't own the last 10 feet towards the river in their backyards, it's not the people's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4937.427s">They</a>  must have a deed and a plot plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4941.691s">And</a>  the point is the law is on our side. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4947.48s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4950.042s">Also,</a>  is this going to go behind those condominiums? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4954.125s">I</a>  want to ask the people in charge of this operation.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4956.407s">That's</a>  not the paper that's before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4959.109s">We</a>  don't have that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4962.671s">Vice</a>  President Knight.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5130.984s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5132.024s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5132.384s">President</a>  Caraviello?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5133.204s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5133.364s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5134.644s">Public</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5136.165s">Anyone</a>  want to speak to public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5141.405s">Good</a>  evening, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5141.965s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5144.967s">My</a>  name is Robert Pantazzo, Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5147.468s">And</a>  what subject would you be speaking on, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5149.329s">I'd</a>  speak on the Ambulatory Surgical Center up at the location of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital at 170 Governor's Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5159.495s">The</a>  reason why I'm bringing this up was after reviewing your city budget and recognizing that you folks set a tax rate this past week, unless I missed it all together, there was no inclusion at all as it related to the amount of money that the new ambulatory service center would be bringing to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5180.813s">I</a>  believe this past, last past Tuesday, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5184.056s">On</a>  the 14th of December you folks sat in committee and discuss the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5189.979s">And</a>  I believe, and I could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5191.64s">One</a>  of the questions that was asked by one of your colleagues Council marked to the assessor as it relates to have you arrived at any kind of a decision regarding the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5201.606s">at</a>  that location 170 Governors Avenue and the assessor responded that they had filed for a tax exempt status. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5210.613s">Conferring</a>  upon that and having a brief discussion once again and reaffirming this conversation with Councilor Falco who once again had the same type of concern as related to the assessor's issue of how and what they're going to be taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5225.924s">I</a>  think she said that it's charitable or something of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5230.193s">So</a>  putting that together, and I just went back and just did a little bit of history on this because I was involved in many of the issues on this particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5239.915s">On</a>  August 28th of 2018, I sent a certified letter to the State Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5245.717s">And</a>  one of the components of the letter, it was issued, I issued the regard regarding tax exam status, which up until that point in time had not been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5255.539s">On</a>  September 17th of 2018, in the method transcript, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5259.94s">And</a>  headline title future of the lots of oil hostile include community input on this say, but in paragraph number 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5266.688s">I</a>  like the existing building, it says the ASC will be a for profit and will therefore pay property taxes to the city of method that came right from them themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5277.841s">October</a>  30 2018 and the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5281.803s">It</a>  was discussed again as to whether the proposed ASC being a builder and the hospital footprint would pay taxes, would it be by the square footage of the whole Lawrence and will hospital footprint itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5295.564s">November</a>  19 2018 at the council meeting, there was a need for an update for clarification for our city of sex office as to how the SC will be determined for tax purposes if approved by the State Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5311.068s">Will</a>  it be for the whole Lawrence Memorial Campus to be considered as a for profit, or would it be broken down by the square footage of each building separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5320.417s">Again,</a>  on November 27 of 2019 Susan Sandberg, then CEO and Vice President of Melrose Wakefield Hospital, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5330.106s">appeared</a>  before the city council saying for the first time that the AFC will be a for profit business here in the city of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5337.372s">Again</a>  in November 2018 I sprinted into the method transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5341.776s">The</a>  discussion was once again, a for profit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5345.699s">December</a>  6 2018, the method transcript said in the proposed commentary period regarding method officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5355.177s">Then</a>  in paragraph 13, quote, the proposed method surgery LLC, a joint venture between then named Melrose Wakefield and the Shields Healthcare as being a for-profit taxable ASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5368.365s">February</a>  19th, 2019 at a city council meeting, issues were presented as it related to the construction and to the taxing status. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5378.49s">March</a>  19th, 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5381.432s">Melrose</a>  Wakefield then notifies the city council and the city that the separate footprint that was going to be at 170 Governors Avenue would now be merged into the property of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5393.519s">April</a>  23 2019 the city council meeting, Sue Sandberg said that she was so pleased with the development that have been taking place regarding this proposal taxes will be determined by the city assessor regarding this tax matter, and Michael Max F at the city will be doing a pilot program on the $733,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5415.035s">community</a>  health initiative that community health initiative was a planned a planned program for health services within this community and surrounding communities over two to a five year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5427.778s">I</a>  have not heard one comment by this city, this city administration, or the city assessor's office, as it relates to what is the plan program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5436.78s">And</a>  if in fact it became a pilot program, it was possibly discussed at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5442.021s">May</a>  7 2019 at a committee of the whole meeting once again Council mass ask who, who is going to be paying the taxes on their separate office space, or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5454.591s">The</a>  mayor at that time, who was the city council, indicated that she was concerned of a pilot program as it related to just what and how, if we're not going to be getting taxes, if we're going to be involved in a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5472.001s">Councilman</a>  Fred De La Russa also made comment as he was concerned over how the tax issue was going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5478.966s">On</a>  May 28th, 2019, city council once again <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5483.088s">Vice</a>  President Susan Sandberg said the ASC will provide new tax revenue and will provide an additional $750,000 within a two to five year period for additional area services. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5494.854s">She</a>  reiterated on May 18, that for which was said on April of that year of the Community Health Service $750,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5503.578s">On</a>  June 4, a letter was sent to Susan Sandberg by myself once again, talking about issues as it relates to the taxing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5511.242s">And</a>  then on October 15, 2019, Susan Sandberg reiterated that the ASA will bring tax revenue to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5521.588s">Also,</a>  then-Councilor and then-Mayor Brenna Lundgren stated that she wanted the developer to provide for the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5532.12s">a</a>  tax, a tax review number one and number two, the vote will take you can say that the vote that the council is taking that the, the, the agreement would go to the petitioner, not to the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5550.164s">When</a>  they made their proposal before this method city council into the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5556.145s">Their</a>  information presentation read as follows in one of their sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5561.147s">What</a>  benefits will an ASC bring to the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5564.828s">Their</a>  response was the ASC will pay local taxes, as well as add jobs in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5572.411s">In</a>  addition, as part of the state revenue process, there will be a substantial community benefits contribution, that's the $750,000 I was talking about, to help address the pressing health and social welfare needs of Medford and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5588.037s">The</a>  total amount the ASC will contribute towards community health initiatives is approximately $733,000, and that'll be paid over a two to five year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5600.053s">From</a>  that period of time, from May 7 of 2015, that can be the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5605.894s">And</a>  I believe you had at that point in time made reference to Councilor Falco as it relates to that particular meeting, as it relates to how taxes were going to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5615.776s">This</a>  city council has not been advised, never mind the council, the taxpayers have not been advised as just how and when it's going to take place for taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5625.17s">And</a>  how are they going to pay it and when are they going to play it, and what meetings if anything has taken place at that meeting in May of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5632.497s">I</a>  also presented before there before the city assessor communities such as Weymouth, and then the central hospital and what they were doing with their cities and towns in combination of either a and in lieu of taxes or a tax payment to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5649.833s">You</a>  have received nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5651.66s">Nothing</a>  has come back, Mr. President, as it relates to this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5656.533s">I</a>  secured from the Secretary of State and the State Attorney General's Office, there was no filing of any sorts, other than the amendment that they filed in 12-4-2020, which was December 4th, of a change of address. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5672.643s">They</a>  had the original address in Boston, and now they changed it to 170. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5677.426s">Now,</a>  just because they're built at 170, 170 Governors Avenue, same address as the Lowell Memorial Hospital, where urgent care is there right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5686.112s">There</a>  should be no taking advantage of that being a tax exempt nonprofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5691.033s">When</a>  she was came in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5693.254s">They</a>  made it perfectly clear that the linchpin to this deal was that they would pay taxes to the city method on the ASC 16,000 square foot piece of building that they were building for $17,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5708.327s">It's</a>  a shame that during this budgetary process, when you were setting and addressing your tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5715.429s">Nothing</a>  was presented as it relates to the anticipation of approximately any wisdom, five and a half million plus dollars on an annual assessment of that piece of property, what that would bring in for taxes here to the city of medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5731.452s">But</a>  before this council gets going again in January next year that this issue is brought to your attention we've heard all kinds of rumors oh yeah they're going to pay, whatever it might have been, you have nothing from the assessor's office in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5744.688s">That's</a>  saying number one, they're going to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5747.371s">You</a>  don't have anything regarding the community health portion of $755,000, that's going to be paid over to a five year period of time for the health initiatives and concerns that you might have to be brought forward, and that was brought to the state's Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5763.216s">When</a>  this was all presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5764.277s">This</a>  is a real concern that I have I'm very concerned over this because <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5768.638s">That's</a>  hundreds and thousands of dollars that potentially could belong to the city of method coffers that could be used, whether it's in our public health department, our schools our budgets police fire, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5778.964s">This</a>  is too small of a thought to be issue when in fact it's a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5784.547s">And</a>  to me it's such a big issue that it hasn't been discussed, I say shame on everyone who knows what that should have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5792.832s">This</a>  should not be a red herring coming up now to say okay why are we talking about we're talking about now because nobody in the city has talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5800.439s">And</a>  if somebody made a mistake in their commentary that that's it's for profit will then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5806.183s">If</a>  it's a for profit, not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5809.126s">If</a>  it is for a for profit business, excuse me, you people should have this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5815.411s">We</a>  the taxpayers should have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5818.577s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5819.258s">Is</a>  anyone behind this real received anything.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5822.101s">I,</a>  on this matter, I reached out to the hospital, and we got to this matter, and they will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5831.23s">It</a>  is a for profit and they will be paying taxes for 2021.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5836.495s">So</a>  let me ask you this, Mr. President, directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5838.617s">You</a>  had a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5839.618s">Do</a>  you have anything in writing from them that says that? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5841.159s">If</a>  you want something in writing, I will get something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5843.221s">I</a>  think the council deserves it, and I think your tax base and your tax rate deserves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5847.884s">I</a>  will have something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5849.546s">I</a>  would strongly suggest that a council resolution go forward seeking that, and that nailing it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5854.65s">And</a>  for further information, Sue Sandberg is no longer with Melrose-Wakefield.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5859.394s">This</a>  is an issue for the Board of Assessors, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5863.317s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5864.158s">And</a>  I say, I will get that paper for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5868.248s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5869.108s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5869.589s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5874.191s">Moving</a>  on to the part of the evening that everybody came here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5879.313s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5880.674s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5881.854s">Sharon</a>  Diesso, Circuit Road and Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5884.996s">I'm</a>  gonna be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5886.537s">It's</a>  gonna be hard, but I have just a few comments to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5890.879s">Holy</a>  and a fun or fun holiday week coming up to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5895.892s">It's</a>  been trying for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5897.653s">I'm</a>  still waiting for my class to open at Bunker Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5899.915s">So</a>  I'm helping two great principals in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5902.557s">They're</a>  all great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5903.717s">Just</a>  to let you know, Nicholas Tucci and Paul Delever at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5908.401s">I</a>  cannot tell you what they go through on a daily basis, trying to flip-flop rooms and swapping teachers around and taking care of the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5916.626s">And</a>  they're keeping that school, schools very clean and taking good care of our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5921.41s">I</a>  wanted to add that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5923.751s">It's</a>  good to see everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5925.868s">I</a>  know we're going to have a strange year ahead, because we are, we sometimes meet people in our lives, who to coin a phrase is kind of corny, make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5939.263s">So</a>  I had the pleasure years ago along with <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5942.481s">former</a>  Councilor Penter and Mr. Caraviello, I've known him and his family for years, who have made a remarkable difference because they really do their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5953.268s">But</a>  I became especially involved with some of the issues and you've heard me here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5958.391s">And</a>  I noticed over the years, there were only a few of you who really were here concerned about and mentioned taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5968.457s">So</a>  I have to commend <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5970.178s">Mr.</a>  Councilor Marks, my friend, Michael Max, for his years and years of service being here.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5977.183s">You'll</a>  have a chance, we're gonna try to get this going, if you give us a chance.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5981.006s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5981.747s">All</a>  right, so everyone's got a chance to give both Councilor Falco and Councilor Marks some memories.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5989.793s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5991.454s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5992.155s">So,</a>  tonight is the final meeting for <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5998.3s">Councilor</a>  Falco, three terms on the council, and for Councilor Marks, a whole bunch of terms on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6003.583s">We'll</a>  start with Councilor Falco first. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6008.726s">Councilor,</a>  Vice President Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6011.888s">Hello,</a>  Johnny. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6012.848s">It's</a>  been a good run, brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6014.709s">I</a>  first met John <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6017.048s">playing</a>  basketball at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6018.409s">Francis</a>  in the CYO when he and his cousin Peter were coaching the team of misfits over there that he put in the back of his minivan and would drive around from church to church in the greater Boston region, helping us kids stay busy and stay off the streets as a teenager. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6033.058s">And</a>  since that time I've always been very fond of john through our work in politics we've been able to develop a great friendship and it's something that I'm very thankful for john it's been great working with you it's a pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6044.284s">I</a>  feel like every year that I sit here on the council and serve as the term goes by. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6050.326s">We</a>  lose another friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6051.667s">First,</a>  it was Paul Camuso, then it was Freddie Dello Russo, and now I'm seeing you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6055.43s">And</a>  it's this transition in government and this progress that we're seeing in this community that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6060.474s">But,</a>  you know, at the same time, we're losing a lot of great people with institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6064.137s">And</a>  you're going to be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6065.758s">I</a>  always had a great pleasure working with you and a great time with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6069.261s">A</a>  lot of laughs and a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6071.195s">You</a>  know, we didn't agree all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6072.396s">And</a>  when we didn't agree, we sure got at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6074.258s">But</a>  when we did agree, we did a lot of great work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6076.74s">So</a>  with that being said, John, congratulations on 12 years of great service to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6081.365s">And</a>  thank you to your wife and family for allowing us the opportunity to have you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6085.768s">You</a>  know, it's been a long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6086.669s">It's</a>  been a great run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6087.75s">And</a>  I'm sure that this is the last we're going to see you in the field of politics.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6093.555s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6095.537s">You</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6096.738s">couldn't</a>  say it better than Councilor Knight, but it's been an honour to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6100.401s">You</a>  were the first Council President when I came on, and two months into that term, a global pandemic started. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6106.905s">And</a>  I always appreciated your thoughtfulness and communication, leading this Council through unprecedented times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6115.971s">And,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6117.492s">We've</a>  done a lot in two years, more than I could even say right now but I think we've done a lot of good for this community you've done a lot of good for the 10 years before we served together on the school, when you were on school committee and city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6131.258s">I</a>  think you may have joined the school committee as I was leaving the Medford Public Schools and we had some difficult budgets back then after that 2008 recession. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6142.945s">And</a>  I know that you worked hard with Councilor Scarpelli, Paula van der Kloot and many others to keep all of our programs intact. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6150.369s">So</a>  you've had an impact on me directly, both as a colleague and as a leader before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6155.933s">And</a>  I really appreciate your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6157.794s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6160.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6163.337s">To</a>  my friend John Falco, it's a sad day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6167.539s">I</a>  won't lie to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6168.54s">I</a>  first want to thank his his family, his wife, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6174.083s">I</a>  don't think anyone could say they had a better partner beside them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6180.507s">I</a>  think that Jackie has <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6184.205s">showing</a>  that she supports you in every which way and allowing her to represent the city for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6191.447s">I</a>  think that you've done an amazing job with your boys, John, Joey, and Jack. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6197.968s">I</a>  think that it's a great, you show not only how, what kind of a leader you are, but also as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6209.078s">If</a>  only one day, you could dress down and make me feel okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6215.104s">I</a>  dress. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6216.386s">You</a>  just couldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6217.347s">I</a>  thought maybe today you'd show up with that fake tuxedo shirt and but you didn't do it john and I applaud you, but <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6226.048s">We've</a>  gone through a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6227.749s">We</a>  started this together some time ago and we decided the reason why we wanted to do it is because we love Medford and we wanted to do what's best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6237.793s">And</a>  you stepping up and challenging the mayor for the most important seat here in the city, I think gives you, shows a lot in who you are as a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6250.238s">And</a>  a lot of phone calls, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6256.005s">I</a>  think other than Dina and I talking, I think you probably in the top three phone calls that we shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6264.047s">We</a>  didn't see eye to eye in some things, but we always respected each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6268.588s">And</a>  I think that's what we see that we're lacking in society. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6275.39s">It's</a>  okay to disagree, but always have that respect for each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6279.691s">And</a>  I think that you've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6281.892s">You've</a>  been a great example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6286.191s">called</a>  you my friend before we started this journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6289.213s">And</a>  hopefully I call you a friend for a hundred more years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6292.935s">So</a>  thank you for everything you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6295.897s">It</a>  will be sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6296.637s">I</a>  think that a lot of times when I look across the room, I look at my two colleagues to look for, you know, support and something I said or something somebody said, and all you guys have to do is show me your eyes and especially with these wonderful masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6313.99s">Your</a>  friendship and guidance is something that I'm going to miss as a Councilor, but I know we'll be together for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6321.893s">So</a>  you've made your mother and father very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6324.634s">You've</a>  made the Falco name very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6326.215s">And,</a>  um, and thank you for everything.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6329.356s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6334.018s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6334.979s">I</a>  mean, it's hard to say what hasn't already been said, but I think just personally, I want to thank you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6339.881s">You've</a>  always treated me, um, even when I was first running just as a <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6343.856s">as</a>  a friend, rather than a foe, even if we didn't always agree on issues, you always were magnanimous and polite, and something that goes a long way in politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6354.842s">I've</a>  been happy to sit next to you for this past year, just to have someone with institutional knowledge beside me, a little comic relief sometimes, and also just similar to what Councilor Scarpelli just said, just, you know, sometimes you have to, everyone has to make sure they heard the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6369.209s">So</a>  that's, I appreciate that and your willingness <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6372.295s">Um,</a>  chat with me and, and also what Councilor bear said, you, um, you know, we're the first council president I work with and, um, it, it truly challenging and wild year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6382.424s">And</a>  I know you worked your hardest to navigate as a strange space. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6386.908s">And</a>  many times when, um, you know, the council was pretty acrimonious, uh, internally and, and I'm, you know, can see that's not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6395.755s">Um,</a>  and I really appreciate your work on that and just, um, your, your dedication to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6400.895s">And</a>  I just wanna echo my fellow Councilors and thank you for your service and wish you all the best whatever may come next.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6408.301s">Thank</a>  you councilor.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6410.442s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6413.244s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6416.087s">I</a>  truly believe we shouldn't recognize anyone if they're not here for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6430.472s">that</a>  you can get in a disagreement and an argument with that was so nice that you didn't realize you were arguing with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6438.595s">Really,</a>  John was nice about everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6441.417s">I</a>  don't ever remember a bad word said about John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6445.958s">And</a>  John, I refer to as someone that walks soft but carried a big stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6453.522s">And</a>  this council, over the six years John served, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6457.734s">made</a>  some major changes to things that people in the public may not know or didn't receive press, but it was John Falco that revamped our whole budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6469.993s">It</a>  was John Falco's expertise in budgeting and finance that led to major changes on how we review the budget and how we as a council request the administration to present the budget to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6484.121s">And</a>  that was thanks to John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6486.342s">And</a>  that wasn't press, that was anything other than John wanting to do the right thing and making the process transparent, which leads to my other point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6496.608s">It</a>  was John Falco <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6498.65s">during</a>  this COVID period for the last 22 months that stood up and said, we need to still operate government. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6505.391s">We</a>  still need to have transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6507.412s">We</a>  still need to include the community, even though we may not have open forums or forums people can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6514.953s">And</a>  it was John that led the charge to make sure in our Committee of the Whole meetings and subcommittee meetings that may not be on the floor were taped and televised live. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6526.339s">That</a>  was john Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6527.62s">Now</a>  that didn't get a ton of fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6529.821s">But</a>  when you talk about transparency, john just didn't talk the talk he walked the walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6535.243s">And</a>  that was a major change of this council, and it led to boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6540.611s">and</a>  other entities in the community fall in suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6543.633s">So</a>  for those two reasons, Mr. President, I wanna thank John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6547.415s">I</a>  know this is not the last we're gonna see of John in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6550.977s">And</a>  he's a great family man, as we can see from his family and three sons and his wife in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6557.481s">And</a>  John, it was a pleasure serving with you for the past six years.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6561.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6563.244s">John</a>  and I became pretty good friends over the last four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6569.677s">I</a>  don't think a day or two didn't go by where I didn't talk to john Falco on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6577.842s">They</a>  talked to my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6579.864s">They</a>  say, you know, Councilmarks brought up some real good points about things john did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6588.209s">Again,</a>  john was a great leader here of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6590.871s">He</a>  led us through a very difficult time in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6595.233s">And</a>  I thank him for his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6598.668s">John,</a>  I know Representative Donato has a little something for you, and the city has a city council or something, but John, I wanna thank you for your friendship over the years, and thank your wife for giving us to you for all these years, and your mother and father for producing a good son like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6613.892s">John,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6614.932s">And</a>  Representative Donato, would you? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6620.554s">What</a>  if John doesn't wanna share the spotlight with you?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6625.355s">Okay,</a>  John, if you'd like to come forward.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6635.892s">John,</a>  on behalf of our other Councilors here, we have this plaque for you for years of service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6642.056s">And</a>  I want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6642.797s">And</a>  I know we haven't seen the last of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6647.239s">And</a>  again, I'll still be calling you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6650.402s">No</a>  problem.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6650.982s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6651.923s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6652.803s">Thank</a>  you, John.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6674.217s">You</a>  know, I will be brief.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6677.12s">I'm</a>  going to take this off, but I will be brief.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6693.337s">I</a>  can't thank you enough all for your very kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6696.4s">It</a>  is absolutely been a pleasure serving with each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6702.725s">Zach</a>  and Nicole, it's only been two years, but Adam, George, Michael, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6708.848s">It's</a>  been six and it has been an absolute pleasure to serve with each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6715.596s">You</a>  know, we maybe didn't always agree on everything, but we agree to disagree and we move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6720.261s">Because</a>  we always had the common goal of moving Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6724.906s">That's</a>  what was always most important to all of us and <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6729.497s">You</a>  know, the council always works well when we work together, but there are disagreements, and we've had disagreements, but we move forward, and I think, you know, we've been a really good team, and we've got a lot of work done over the past six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6743.223s">So</a>  I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6744.283s">It's</a>  been a real pleasure working with each and every one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6748.485s">I</a>  wanna thank, you know, everyone here tonight, those that are at home, and especially thank my wife, Jackie, in the back, and my three sons, John, Joey, and Jack, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6759.738s">for</a>  all of their support throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6763.581s">You</a>  know, to be a selected official, to be a successful elected official, you really need that support at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6770.506s">And</a>  Jackie and the boys have always been very, very supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6773.829s">So</a>  I wanna thank them for their love and their support through the past 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6778.673s">It's</a>  been an absolute honor and a privilege to serve the city of Medford the past 12 years as a member of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6788.133s">school</a>  committee and as a member of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6790.895s">And</a>  I can't thank you enough for having the confidence in me to be reelected numerous times to the school committee and to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6802.083s">During</a>  my tenure in the school committee, I had the opportunity to work with some great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6806.271s">And</a>  to make improvements both inside of the schools and outside of the schools, new science labs, field of dreams, updated technology, updated vocational school, renovated swimming pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6817.461s">But</a>  that comes when you work as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6819.283s">And</a>  we did that on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6820.864s">We</a>  had the honor of working with some really great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6824.207s">Paula</a>  Van der Kloot, Emery Cuno, Sharon Guzik, Billy O'Keefe, Bob Skerry, Aaron DiBenedetto, and my good friend, George Scarpell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6833.492s">You</a>  know, we keep like you said, George, we came into this 12 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6837.034s">And,</a>  you know, I remember working really hard on the school committee when we came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6841.416s">And</a>  we had all kinds of goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6843.197s">And</a>  I think we accomplished a lot of those and we left at a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6847.959s">But</a>  you know, that continues and you know that the next group is stepping up in there, you know, they're making progress as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6854.482s">And</a>  on the city council, I had an opportunity to work with some great talented people in spearheaded some projects here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6860.825s">Like</a>  I said, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6862.127s">Even</a>  if, you know, I spare something individually or if any of us had something individual, it always takes the support of your colleagues to move it forward, like cameras in the community hall of the city council office, you know, to televise all of our meetings, you know, support of having our, you know, community police meetings moved out into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6883.552s">You</a>  know, those are things that zoning, zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6886.553s">And</a>  those are things that I like to think that <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6888.348s">I</a>  let on, but you know, it takes support from your colleagues and you've all been very supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6892.891s">So</a>  I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6895.033s">It's</a>  been, like I said, it's, you know, it works well when the council works together and, you know, together we moved a lot of, you know, projects forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6904.921s">And</a>  I thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6906.382s">You</a>  know, President Caraviello, we've known each other for years and you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6909.944s">I</a>  think there were many days I just had to talk to you more than I talked to Jackie, but you know, it's our passion for, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6916.566s">City</a>  politics and making the city a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6919.327s">Council</a>  and I. You've been great to talk to probably one of the smartest people I know in city government knows how things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6926.41s">And,</a>  you know, process procedure and you've always been on top of that and, you know, I thank you for all your help and the guidance there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6939.074s">Our</a>  friendship goes back a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6941.316s">And,</a>  you know, there were many times where, you know, we'd have serious conversations, but we'd laugh a lot along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6947.46s">And</a>  that always helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6951.283s">Councilor</a>  Marks, the senior statesman of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6955.767s">I</a>  can't even tell you how many times probably over the past year, I looked at you and I said, well, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6963.312s">He's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6964.515s">It's</a>  absolutely right, just here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6968.636s">I</a>  realized just over time, but it's funny, you had the experience, it's been valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6976.559s">And</a>  I think that's something that we always have to remember, I think as Councilors moving forward, is that there's processes and there's procedures and they're there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6986.122s">And</a>  you always make a good point saying, this is how we're supposed to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6991.063s">And</a>  a lot can be said for that, because when you don't have processes and procedures, things fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6996.645s">And</a>  it's important that we follow those processes and procedures and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7001.126s">And</a>  I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7002.207s">It's</a>  been a pleasure serving with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7004.207s">And</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7007.529s">Fred</a>  DeLaRusso, not here tonight, but he was someone that I truly enjoyed sharing, working with over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7015.791s">I</a>  maybe didn't agree with him all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7031.36s">Fred,</a>  he was great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7035.701s">We</a>  didn't agree on a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7036.961s">I</a>  shouldn't say we didn't agree on a lot, but there were many things we didn't agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7039.242s">But</a>  once again, we agreed to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7041.743s">He</a>  was someone that I could call, someone that I could talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7045.224s">And</a>  he was fabulous to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7047.804s">Zach</a>  and Nicole, like I said, we only worked together for two years, but you've been great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7054.786s">I</a>  know if I ever, Nicole's on screen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7058.209s">But</a>  I know it's always been, if I need to call you and talk to you, it's always been a pleasure talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7064.795s">You</a>  always take my calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7066.476s">And</a>  it's been great working with the both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7069.659s">So</a>  I thank you very much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7072.021s">And</a>  I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7074.443s">for</a>  working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7076.244s">You've</a>  both been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7078.085s">And,</a>  you know, and I also want to thank Mayor McGlynn and Mayor Stephanie Michini-Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7082.406s">You</a>  know, I worked with them both on the school committee and on the city council for 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7088.589s">They,</a>  you know, leadership starts at the top and they led a lot of great initiatives and did a lot of great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7096.672s">Representative</a>  Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7099.6s">You've</a>  been a friend for many years, and it has always been a pleasure working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7104.663s">I</a>  thank you for your friendship and for your advice through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7110.307s">You've</a>  been great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7111.828s">If</a>  I ever had any questions regarding what was happening at the state level and how it was going to impact our city, you always did answer and answer the call, and I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7126.213s">And</a>  I represent about Lee and representative Barbara and Senate jail and I thank them as well and it's it's it's been an honor to work with with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7137.484s">And</a>  thank you to the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7139.465s">Now</a>  there are many department heads that we have here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7143.529s">There</a>  are many that don't work here any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7145.55s">I</a>  want to thank them, both those that are here and those that aren't here any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7151.435s">I</a>  thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7152.616s">And</a>  I thank all of the workers in the City of Medford and the school system that are here day in, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7159.982s">day</a>  out, making it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7162.323s">You</a>  know, the policemen, the police officers, the firefighters, like I said, everyone in this in our school system, thanks to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7169.706s">I</a>  mean, take a look at the people that you know, we don't think of that, not that we don't think of that often, but the people that are always there working 24 seven, there's a there's a water leak in the middle of February and <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7180.09s">someone's</a>  freezing water, trying to repair it to make sure that people have running water in their neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7185.592s">And</a>  those are the people that they're not recognized as often as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7192.214s">And</a>  I wanna thank each and every one of them for all of their help, all of their support, answering my phone calls when I had questions that needed to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7201.876s">So</a>  I wanna thank them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7204.457s">And</a>  Larry Lepore, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7208.207s">Thank</a>  you for being here every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7209.447s">I</a>  apologize that you have had to look at the back of my head for the past six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7216.93s">But</a>  it has been an absolute pleasure working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7218.931s">You've</a>  always had a smile on your face. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7220.571s">You've</a>  been great to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7222.752s">It's</a>  always nice to see you when you drop by with the agenda every Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7226.293s">So</a>  I thank you for being a good friend for the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7229.421s">And</a>  I want to wish I just didn't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7232.924s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7233.344s">You</a>  know, I hope you enjoy this as much as I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7237.667s">This</a>  has been a thrill of a lifetime to represent the residents of our great city, and I want to wish you well in the future years and in the term ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7248.695s">On</a>  a personal note, I want to thank my campaign committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7252.105s">In</a>  all my friends that have helped out with the various campaigns over the past 12 years, I believe they say it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7262.589s">And</a>  it's been an amazing journey over the past 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7265.49s">I</a>  have met a lot of friends that will be friends for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7270.811s">And</a>  I can say that, especially in the past year running for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7275.856s">There's</a>  so many people that I met along the way that he did not know prior to that were just fabulous and they're great friends today, and they'll always be friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7286.145s">And,</a>  you know, in, you know, in hindsight thinking back at the 12 years they think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7294.29s">condolence</a>  resolutions that come up every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7297.391s">And,</a>  you know, you start to think about the many community members that we've lost along the way and the impact that they've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7305.055s">And,</a>  you know, and, you know, I just, it brings back fond memories, the people and the impact that they've had on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7312.258s">And,</a>  you know, they had a big impact on what we do here each week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7318.461s">In</a>  closing, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7322.015s">I</a>  thank everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7323.075s">Like</a>  I said, it has been an honor and a privilege to represent everyone here in the city of Medford. <a

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7354.184s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7382.647s">And</a>  last but not least, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7387.47s">So</a>  tonight, close to 40 years of institutional knowledge is walking out the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7393.073s">And</a>  like Councilor Falco said earlier, institutional knowledge is key and who to call and who not to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7400.378s">But</a>  again, I wanna thank you, John and Michael for your many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7404.8s">So</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7409.442s">It's</a>  only been eight years, huh, Michael? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7411.243s">And</a>  it feels like eight minutes underwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7419.587s">No,</a>  I'll joke it aside, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7421.929s">I</a>  can honestly say that I owe you a debt of gratitude for making me a better Councilor, because I knew every day that I came into these chambers, I had to be on my A game, because you were prepared, you were ready, and most importantly, you held your colleagues accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7438.655s">And</a>  that's something I always respected you for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7441.357s">You</a>  hold your colleagues accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7443.158s">You</a>  said what you meant, you did what you were going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7445.46s">It's</a>  commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7446.4s">There</a>  aren't too many politicians around anymore these days that are what they are and do what they do and say what they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7452.445s">And</a>  you walk the walk and you talk the talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7454.726s">And</a>  it's really been great working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7456.467s">I've</a>  learned a lot from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7458.069s">But</a>  like I said, you know, I've always looked forward to those Tuesday nights, when Parker Musa was sitting in that chair and you were sitting here and I was sitting here and Bob Penta was sitting there and Freddie was here and Brianna was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7468.158s">You'd</a>  see fireworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7470.5s">Some</a>  nights on issues that we didn't agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7472.562s">And</a>  then on nights, and the things that we did agree on and we were clicking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7475.764s">What</a>  great work we were able to accomplish, and over the last couple of years, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7480.989s">As</a>  I matured in my role I've come to agree with you in a lot more things than I did when I first started and I think that that comes with the experience of the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7488.596s">And</a>  it also comes with having that open line of communication and being able to respect each other as colleagues and professionals, and I always have had that respect for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7496.364s">And</a>  I want to thank you for all the service that you provided this community it's been a long run, it's been a long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7502.223s">You</a>  know, we shared a great story today when you said that my father had sent you an email relative to the service that you provided to this community, and I think that that just goes to show you how. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7512.253s">highly</a>  we hold you in our household, although we don't necessarily agree all the time, we've always been able to move past that for the greater good which is this community and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with you, and I look forward to being able to serve with you in some capacity in the future, whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7527.582s">You're</a>  really someone that has a vision is someone that wants to execute that vision and is someone that's always cared about the city more than you've cared about anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7536.567s">With</a>  that being said, Mike, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7538.908s">It's</a>  been a great run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7539.668s">Uh,</a>  you know, you've been here for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7542.049s">I</a>  can remember the first time I met you, um, when I was, you know, just out of college working for Senator Shannon and you were running for a city council and, uh, Billy Wood was giving me, uh, the business file holding science with Paul Camuso because I was coming out of the Senator's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7556.292s">Um,</a>  and that was, uh, how many years ago, geez, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7560.654s">Um,</a>  so Mike, it's just, it's been a great, great run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7563.154s">I</a>  could go on and on and on and not pat you on the back, but, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7565.735s">I</a>  think you know what you've accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7567.157s">I've</a>  always been someone that's been putting results before the rhetoric and someone who's always been able to walk the walk and hold his head proud because he's been able to look at the mirror every morning and nobody's believed is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7578.108s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7579.669s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7580.07s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7582.792s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7586.71s">I</a>  think probably in these past two years I've been in more meetings with you than any other Councilor we've served on subcommittees, obviously these meetings committee of the whole, and and your historical knowledge, your understanding of something that started 20 years ago and we're still dealing with it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7600.635s">I</a>  think it's been incredibly helpful to me in the smallest situation of the biggest situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7606.605s">But</a>  I also have to count echo Councilor Knight, and we've had a few knockdown drag outs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7611.769s">And</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7615.871s">And</a>  it's, you know, every time I'm like, maybe I'll be a little less anxious when Michael gets that bulldog attitude on and he's coming at you, but it makes me think about what I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7626.818s">what</a>  I'm bringing to the table, the argument that I wanna put forward at that specific moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7631.542s">You</a>  know, we even had one tonight and I'm glad we're going out on the same page that we've been going on the whole time because exactly what Councilor Knight said, you make me a better councilor, you make me more knowledgeable about what's going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7645.512s">You</a>  changed my mind more than I expected when I started. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7649.375s">And</a>  not only that, you've been in public service as long as I can remember here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7654.499s">I</a>  remember holding out a sign in 2003 for Bruce Kulik, because his daughter was in my elementary school class. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7662.001s">And</a>  your signs are out there, and they have been ever since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7665.342s">So</a>  that can't be understated, what you've given to the city, the time, your family, and your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7672.003s">And</a>  I think it will be missed, and it is definitely deeply appreciated and evidenced by the many, many times that you've been re-elected by the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7681.726s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7682.426s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7682.986s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7684.018s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7687.699s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7689.599s">First,</a>  again, I think we owe a great gratitude to Mike's wife, Lisa, his daughters, Gianna and Olivia, and son, Evan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7701.282s">I</a>  think that when we've talked, we've talked so proudly of your children, and it makes me a better father. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7710.865s">As</a>  a person, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7713.445s">When</a>  I got that phone call, when you called me and said Georgia decided to step down, whether you realize it or not, it got choked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7720.811s">And</a>  because I think that what Michael Marx has taught us is to love Medford, be true to who you are and fight for the community members, whether you know them or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7736.955s">Nobody</a>  talks about charter review and wanting to have precinct award representation, Michael Marx is a great example, why that might not help why that might not work, because Michael Marx worked as hard as he could for someone that lived in Wellington Glenwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7753.58s">or</a>  someone who lived in Hillside or someone from West Medford and North Medford or South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7758.604s">You</a>  worked hard for every single person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7761.866s">Not</a>  only that, you were prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7763.387s">And</a>  I think I said this probably one of the most impressive evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7767.43s">And</a>  I remember that night that you came out and talked about an issue and you were so thorough and so prepared that I don't know how we as a council couldn't support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7778.258s">And</a>  I think that's what you've always done because you've believed in what you wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7784.505s">And</a>  again, I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7785.566s">I</a>  think that if society understood what happens in these chambers and we can all understand to agree to disagree and have the pride and respect for a person across from you that might not look at things the same way, but maybe understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7805.579s">Because</a>  I tell you a lot of times I didn't agree what you were saying, but I had to take a step back like my dad taught me with his Jesuit upbringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7813.797s">To</a>  put yourself in that person's shoes and I realized a lot of time, boy, you don't wear to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7822.341s">And</a>  my feet hurt because I stood in your shoes so many times and realized, wow, that man is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7828.523s">And</a>  most of the time is because you love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7834.152s">I'm</a>  gonna, it's gonna be tough because one thing you realized is what a good man you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7839.735s">And</a>  a lot of people, you know, when you first got on that, all that Michael Mox, he's something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7845.138s">He</a>  just, he's just an angry man and he's just not a good man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7849.821s">And</a>  then you sit with the man, you realize what a great individual, what a great father, what a great husband, what a great friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7858.195s">Because</a>  I tell you, Mike, when I might have something down with my family, you were there, the phone call was there, had nothing to do with city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7867.257s">You</a>  know, whether it was a edible arrangement for my daughter when she was going through a tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7871.618s">And</a>  when I said today is Council Marks' last day, she says, I have basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7877.479s">Can</a>  I watch it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7878.12s">I</a>  said, you can watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7879.1s">But</a>  she really wanted to be here because you make impacts on people's lives that you don't even know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7884.567s">So</a>  I will tell you, I know that what you've given this city, I don't know if people really truly appreciate it until you're gone, but you have made a fighter out of every single one of us and taught us how to do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7903.217s">So</a>  my friend, thank you for all your years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7907.199s">You</a>  set a path that people should follow, that passion should be in our hearts, no matter if you're here a year or 44 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7915.097s">And</a>  I will carry that on with me until my last day in the seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7920.001s">And</a>  you'll always be my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7922.642s">And</a>  I think that's what's more important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7924.324s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7925.985s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7926.365s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7928.306s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7929.667s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7931.108s">Councilor</a>  Marks, I mean, it's no secret that we don't always agree, but I have always truly respected just the amount of homework you do before every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7940.995s">And</a>  I can see it on the papers next to you, the amount of preparation you come <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7945.564s">to</a>  meetings with and ready to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7947.525s">And</a>  I don't think a meeting has gone by where you haven't asked a question or raised a point that's made me kind of rethink or reframe how I'm thinking about a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7956.807s">It</a>  may not totally change my vote, but it absolutely provides a perspective that I didn't think of and is so needed and so welcome in these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7965.169s">As</a>  someone who perhaps my signature is my brevity, I am truly impressed and amazed at your ability to speak at length on topics <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7972.935s">and</a>  not repeat yourself, it's truly, it's unlike anything else anyone else can do, and it's very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7979.899s">And</a>  really, in the two years we've worked together, you've never phoned it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7985.363s">I</a>  think even at 11 p.m., which maybe sometimes some of us would like you to phone it in, if it was an issue that you were passionate about, that residents cared about, you were ready to fight, and you were ready to speak your piece on it, and that's absolutely admirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7999.231s">And</a>  as Councilor Scarpelli just said, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8003.141s">door</a>  knocking campaigning talking to residents around the city I've met many many members of your fan club people who are very appreciative of the work you do, and you as an individual and you leaving the council, you're going to be deeply missed by the community and I thank you as others have said for for challenging me challenging me to be a better Councilor and know just, I have to come to every meeting and be on my toes because of you and I thank you for that and your service to the city for so long.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8033.563s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to thank Michael for his many, many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8039.93s">You've</a>  been a great colleague, you've been a great friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8044.594s">You've</a>  always kept all of us on our toes, and that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8052.108s">You</a>  are amazing when it comes to a number of things, but constituent services, I think, has been your wheelhouse, no matter who I talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8061.514s">I</a>  talk to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8062.734s">I</a>  talk to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8066.297s">Just</a>  the way you know so much about everything with regard to the issues that are happening in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8072.738s">And</a>  like I said before, you bring that institutional knowledge of how things have been done before in the past, or maybe if something has changed, and then you point out why it has changed and why it's important to do things the way we're doing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8086.602s">And</a>  that's been huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8088.802s">And</a>  it's been great serving with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8093.024s">It's</a>  been very educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8095.404s">You</a>  come to each and every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8100.058s">ready</a>  to talk ready to debate ready to talk about the issues, you're always prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8105.282s">Like</a>  I have the customer said you always have you know your files you actually I was a few weeks ago you clean out your file cabinet I don't know how many trips you made. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8118.585s">A</a>  lot of paper there, but you know you've always come armed and with data and you do the research you do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8128.491s">You</a>  know it's it's been great serving with you, I you know we've had some comical times over the past year, so I know we had a I think back to committee, the whole meeting we had on Sydney street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8140.979s">in</a>  the woods behind the Budweiser plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8145.442s">The</a>  trees are going into the residents yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8148.264s">We</a>  had to go back there and have a committee of the whole and we're tripping all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8152.727s">But,</a>  you know, Michael had the history with regard to, you know, I think how Budweiser was supposed to be, you know, maintaining the property and they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8160.732s">And,</a>  you know, we called them out on it and they resolved the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8165.315s">And</a>  so, like I said, constituent services has been, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8170.49s">You're</a>  just amazing when it comes to that, and a number of other things, but you've always been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8174.613s">I</a>  know when I've called and asked you questions, you've taken the time to walk me through that, to walk me through different issues and whatnot, and it's been an absolute pleasure to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8185.7s">I</a>  know you're a great dad and a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8190.243s">I</a>  wanna thank your kids for sharing your dad with us for the many years that he served here and that he's given back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8200.55s">It's</a>  hard to believe it's been 20 years, but I want to wish you well moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8207.614s">I</a>  know you're gonna, I know you'll still be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8210.735s">I</a>  know you love living in the city of Medford and I know you love being involved and I can't thank you enough for the guidance that you've given me through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8220.08s">And</a>  it's a little story. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8222.921s">I'll</a>  tell a little story really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8226.343s">Back</a>  when Michael was first running for council, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8229.381s">I</a>  got a call from a mutual friend, Dr. Wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8232.804s">And</a>  he said to me, he said to me, I need your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8238.248s">And</a>  I said, what do you need my help with? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8239.769s">He's</a>  like, I got a friend running for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8242.831s">And</a>  I said, who is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8245.093s">Michael</a>  Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8245.834s">I</a>  said, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8246.795s">He's</a>  like, I need your help with signs on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8249.036s">Can</a>  you help me out? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8249.917s">And</a>  I said, yeah, I'll help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8252.099s">So</a>  I held signs for Michael in his first campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8255.982s">And,</a>  you know, but like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8260.715s">But</a>  things like that allow you to meet people like Ray Cipriani and Bill Wilder, who are friends with Billy, who've been friends with me ever since I helped him run on the campaign that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8270.422s">But</a>  that's the nice thing about community and working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8275.066s">And</a>  I like to think I put Michael over the top and got this started. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8280.39s">Michael,</a>  I just want to thank you for your years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8284.593s">It's</a>  been a pleasure serving with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8286.054s">And</a>  I thank you for all your hard work through the years, and I wish you well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8290.097s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8290.317s">Likewise.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8290.717s">Thank</a>  you, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8291.718s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8293.578s">So,</a>  I think I'm the only guy that's had the fastest rise from junior to senior councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8301.402s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8302.822s">In</a>  like 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8303.243s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8304.783s">It's</a>  gonna be a sad day when I come back in January, because everybody I started with 10 years ago will be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8312.306s">So</a>  that makes me a little sad, because it's a lot of memories, a lot of things happened here over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8319.786s">Serving</a>  with Michael has been fun and challenging at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8324.57s">I</a>  remember when you first get elected, you've got these grand ambitions and you're gonna change the world and you know everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8336.08s">Until</a>  you say something and Michael Marx hits you back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8342.46s">He</a>  doesn't do it to me, but he lets you understand, hey, I'm in charge here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8345.802s">And</a>  don't mistake it.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8346.943s">But</a>  you know, over the years, a lot of people said to me, why is the Michael Marx president of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8367.9s">And</a>  there's a good reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8369.142s">I</a>  think Councilor Falco can tell you and I can, there's other people that have been in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8373.549s">When</a>  you stand up at the podium here, you lose your voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8377.015s">And</a>  Councilor Marks' trademark is his voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8382.215s">for</a>  the voice of the community for about 26 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8386.158s">And</a>  that's his trademark. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8387.78s">And</a>  that's what people come to know him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8390.042s">And</a>  I think that's part of the reason he never took up this podium because he wouldn't be able to be the Michael Marks that we know and appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8398.769s">So</a>  that's what the people always say, you know, give the guy a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8404.654s">I</a>  say, I asked him to be president last time and he didn't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8408.037s">And</a>  I understand why, because I say, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8410.993s">He's</a>  the voice of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8413.475s">And</a>  I say, from being up in the party, you no longer be the voice of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8417.478s">So</a>  I wanna thank him for his years of being the voice of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8421.981s">And</a>  he's helped make me a better councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8427.085s">There's</a>  no such thing as a slam dunk proposal with councilmembers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8431.248s">You</a>  look at the agenda and you say, geez, it'll be an easy night, we'll be out of here quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8435.311s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8440.19s">There</a>  was there was there was no such thing as a slam dunk proposal with Councilman Miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8447.155s">He</a>  was thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8448.076s">I'm</a>  telling you, you know, hey, listen, that's his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8451.098s">And</a>  I thank him, you know, I think he made me a better councilor over the years and him and I have become good friends over the last few years also. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8458.103s">And</a>  I just want to thank him and his family for his years of service here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8461.926s">And</a>  Mike, if you'd like to come up here, we have a little something for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8469.29s">Well,</a>  he called me and he said, Rick, don't get me a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8472.851s">He</a>  said, I don't want a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8474.732s">So</a>  I didn't know what to get, and so I... So what's the rules for people? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8476.472s">It's</a>  10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8479.293s">Well,</a>  according to you, it's 10 years, and... But he didn't want a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8483.294s">Listen,</a>  I don't think I want a rocking chair either when I go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8486.936s">You</a>  will, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8487.856s">You</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8489.336s">But</a>  on behalf of the council, I want to present you with this card.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8495.618s">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8496.299s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8496.979s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8497.778s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8498.678s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8499.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8835.926s">My</a>  mother started me off with family values back 55 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8842.871s">And</a>  it was her guidance over the years that shaped how I voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8851.778s">And</a>  I never realized that until I took a step back and said, this was my mother that <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8857.924s">gave</a>  me these particular values. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8859.465s">This</a>  was my mother that raised four children as a single parent and did her best to give us a roof over our head and provide the opportunities that she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8871.775s">And</a>  I will forever be grateful for my mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8878.478s">and</a>  her support over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8880.099s">I</a>  wanna thank my in-laws, Linda and Vincenzo Federico. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8883.462s">If</a>  you ever came to one of my fundraisers, they used to make the best thick pizzellis, not the thin ones, the best thick pizzellis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8891.649s">And</a>  when you came in the door, I'd go to shake a hand and they would go right over to my in-laws and get their pizzellis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8898.888s">And</a>  I think most people were there to get the pizzellis, which was fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8902.929s">It</a>  was fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8904.309s">And</a>  I just want to thank my in-laws, Linda, Machenzo, Federico, for the many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8909.951s">I</a>  want to thank all the volunteers in the community that served on boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8915.192s">Talk</a>  about being behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8917.092s">Talk</a>  about volunteering, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8920.688s">This</a>  is the very heartbeat of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8923.129s">It's</a>  the volunteers that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8925.129s">It's</a>  the people that are doing this, not for any praise, but because they love the community because they want to do better in the community, and they want to see our city progress forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8935.612s">So</a>  I'd like to thank all the countless volunteers that I've been involved with over the past 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8941.633s">I</a>  want to thank the countless community groups, civic organizations that we all come in contact with on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8951.661s">And</a>  as Councilor Falco alluded to, this was never about me, honestly, and I still feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8960.968s">Someone</a>  just looked up at the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8963.694s">I</a>  got a lot of pages ahead of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8966.115s">I</a>  got a lot of, I got a page for each year, so just bear with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8973.858s">But</a>  I want to recognize at this point, I've never done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8977.619s">I</a>  want to recognize the city workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8979.86s">The</a>  city workers are the heartbeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8982.201s">They're</a>  the lifeline of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8984.462s">And</a>  they get very little recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8986.943s">And</a>  they do tremendous work on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8990.724s">This</a>  city doesn't operate by chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8993.457s">It's</a>  because of the hundreds and not thousands of city employees that make this city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8999.721s">And</a>  I'd like to take the time to recognize an office we deal with on a consistent basis, the city clerk in the registrar voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9009.268s">I'd</a>  like to recognize Clerk Herbise, who has been the city clerk for the last several years, and probably one of the best appointments that I've been involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9019.775s">And</a>  I appreciate you and everything you've done for the city clerk's office, Mr. Clerk. <a

<a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9050.357s">People</a>  would ask me, what is that guy doing in the corner? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9054.079s">So</a>  he's the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9055.379s">He's</a>  a very important job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9057.86s">And</a>  Larry, I consider you a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9060.621s">You've</a>  held that position with distinction and I look forward to seeing you around the community. <a

function, every permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9081.085s">It's</a>  a giant job, and Paul Moki has done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9084.485s">I'd</a>  like to thank Amy Tanaglia, Dennis McDonald, Jeff Fago, Kenny Lanzilli, Mike Malabar, and Paul Smith in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9097.288s">I'd</a>  like to thank Director

the people at the Department of Public Works and Engineering, Commissioner Brian Kerins, Mary Moniz, Phyllis Cerboni, Darlene Luke, Steve Tenaglia, who's in the audience, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9120.842s">I've</a>  probably bothered Steve Tenaglia over my 26-year career than anyone else in the community. <a

your working on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9137.43s">And</a>  no matter how big the crack was in the sidewalk or the hole in the street, you were out there when we called. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9143.953s">You</a>  made things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9145.413s">And</a>  Steve, I will always be

property of residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9208.828s">It's</a>  a thankless job. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9210.665s">but</a>  it's a very important

href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9262.55s">And</a>  I would ask my colleagues, uh, as they move forward that we keep the commitment we gave to the fire department like we did with the police department to create a brand new state of the art fire headquarters and training facility <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9277.3s">that</a>  they all so well deserve. <a

centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9390.978s">It</a>  was probably one of the biggest contentious issues in this city's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9395.4s">But</a>  as a school committee, we rolled up our sleeves, we had our public meetings, and we were able to build centralized schools, state-of-the-art schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9405.365s">And</a>  that I am very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9406.986s">I</a>  want to thank my colleagues that I serve with, Lena DiGentimasso, who talk about a fighter, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9413.753s">There's</a>  someone that served three decades, never ran for any other office, but always cared about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9421.258s">And</a>  I'll never forget when we were building the new schools, we had to go look at the old schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9426.662s">And</a>  I was behind every ladder to the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9429.715s">following</a>  Linda Gigentomaso with her high heels, climbing the ladder to get to the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9436.439s">This</a>  is the dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9438.4s">Jack</a>  Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9439.66s">Jack</a>  Buckley, when I served with him, Jack was a very intelligent man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9444.323s">And</a>  I was very young of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9447.664s">And</a>  he used to always say during the meetings, the TQM approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9452.067s">And</a>  I'd be like, wow, TQM, this is something big. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9455.168s">And</a>  he'd say it all the time, total quality management. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9459.159s">And</a>  25 years later, I have still not forgotten what TQM stands for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9465.422s">And</a>  that was the type of Jack Buckley was in charge of the building of the schools project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9469.783s">That</a>  was the type of dedication Jack had and his business acumen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9473.972s">that</a>  that's where he came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9476.233s">And</a>  it's funny how the little things stick with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9479.193s">And</a>  that was one thing that stuck with me with Jack Buckley, Paul Van der Kloot, who we recognize tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9484.655s">I</a>  served with Paulette for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9487.235s">Bob</a>  Skerry, Bob Emmett Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9489.616s">I</a>  served with Beth Fuller, who was the best knitter in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9493.898s">would</a>  be at committee meetings and she'd knit a blanket while we were sitting there actually just listening, she would knit a blanket. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9502.072s">I</a>  always felt that I wasn't doing enough with my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9505.478s">She</a>  made me feel guilty. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9507.822s">Ed</a>  Nolan, who's a great firefighter, and I happen to have the opportunity to serve with Ed Nolan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9514.624s">And</a>  last but not least, Bill Brady, who was a great school committee member and a tenacious advocate for the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9525.066s">Former</a>  colleagues on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9527.547s">My</a>  colleague here, Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9528.987s">You</a>  know, when I first got on the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9533.02s">I'll</a>  be honest with you, I was intimidated by him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9536.482s">He</a>  was rough and gruff, but as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I come to know a gentleman that only cared and loved about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9547.768s">His</a>  delivery may be a little questionable once in a while, but he cared about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9554.732s">Bob</a>  always told me, stand up for your beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9557.633s">You</a>  can never go wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9559.4s">And</a>  I would advise anyone coming into public office, that's the number one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9564.722s">Stand</a>  up for what you believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9565.902s">You</a>  can never ever go wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9568.803s">Never.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9569.923s">Robert</a>  Mayorko, no disregard to you, Mr. President, but the best president I ever served with on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9579.046s">He</a>  coined the phrase, at least he takes credit for it, that this city council is the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9585.949s">And</a>  that always stuck with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9587.889s">because</a>  if you had an issue, there's nowhere else to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9593.053s">And</a>  this has to be the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9595.955s">I</a>  would ask my colleagues to always keep that microphone open for whoever wants to come up on the public participation, whoever wants to speak on no matter what the issue may be, this has to maintain itself as the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9610.285s">Otherwise</a>  we will lose confidence in government and that's the last thing we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9616.349s">Paul</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9618.899s">You</a>  know, when Paul got on the council, it dawned on me immediately when we were debating whether or not to allow Wendy's on Middlesex Ave, which was my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9632.489s">And</a>  we were debating it back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9634.37s">And</a>  I'll never forget, Paul Camuso said to the representatives from Wendy's, all the higher ups were here, all the bigwigs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9641.235s">And</a>  he said, we have to have more fine dining like Wendy's in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9648.757s">And</a>  I said we're going to be for a long ride with this guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9654.361s">Stephanie</a>  machini Burke, I mean, Stephanie's had a long run in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9659.945s">I</a>  had the opportunity to serve a number of years, became mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9666.493s">was</a>  responsible for the police station and a brand new library and has done yeoman's work pushing this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9674.117s">Brianna</a>  Lungo-Curran was the current mayor and I served with for 18 years and I wish her well in the future years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9682.622s">Fred</a>  Dello Russo, the last person to ever let you down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9690.246s">That's</a>  a little joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9691.927s">That's</a>  a little joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9695.737s">Fred</a>  Dello Russo gave a perspective of business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9699.34s">Every</a>  Councilor has their own perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9701.301s">And</a>  that's why you have to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9702.502s">And</a>  you may get in arguments, but everyone has their own ideas and their own perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9706.705s">And</a>  Fred came from a chamber of commerce and a business perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9710.468s">And</a>  that was always helpful for me because he was a business minded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9716.132s">Bill</a>  Carr Sr. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9717.513s">I</a>  remember his slogan, nothing changes if nothing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9724.182s">But</a>  when I looked at the slogan, I said, well, how basic, but when you think about it, nothing changes if nothing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9730.343s">And</a>  he was absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9732.124s">And</a>  I'll never forget that slogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9734.344s">And</a>  I consider Bill Carr a good friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9737.745s">Jim</a>  DiGiacomo, I had the opportunity to serve one term with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9741.226s">And</a>  Jim was an excellent city councilor and a real people person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9746.807s">Macarena.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9747.928s">I</a>  served just a short period of time when one council stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9752.41s">Macarena</a>  took over for about 10 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9755.071s">And</a>  he was a man of commitment and dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9760.253s">And</a>  I wish Mac well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9766.075s">State</a>  Rep Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9769.717s">Paul</a>  got off the council to run for state rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9772.798s">That's</a>  when I got on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9776.234s">No</a>  one has done more to bring in local aid than Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9781.136s">Paul</a>  Donato's name is synonymous with local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9785.858s">I</a>  mean, I don't wanna go through the laundry list, but just take a walk into Chevalier Auditorium and look at the brand new seats and look at the air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9794.621s">And</a>  that wasn't done for any other reason than we have an advocate in the state house, Paul Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9801.464s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9804.175s">A</a>  little known fact about Paul Donato, and I hope you don't mind me sharing this, because I know you're not a vain person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9813.643s">Paul</a>  Donato was one of the original signees on methods incorporation papers in 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9822.03s">1892,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9830.185s">And</a>  I want to thank you for your many, many years of service, Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9836.047s">And</a>  I consider you a friend as well, Representative Donato, and always will be supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9842.369s">My</a>  present colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9844.609s">And</a>  we have the two newest colleagues, Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9850.871s">With</a>  COVID, we didn't have a real opportunity to get to know each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9858.607s">or</a>  know where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9861.549s">And</a>  I think that may have been some of maybe, I don't wanna say tension, but maybe some of the misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9869.113s">And</a>  I know you both have great intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9873.275s">I</a>  know both of you will move this city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9878.258s">I</a>  would ask that you just take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9880.979s">And</a>  as I tell everyone, God gave us two ears, do twice as much listening than speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9888.063s">And</a>  I take that to myself, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9890.285s">That's</a>  no reflection on anyone, but listen, because you learn so much when you listen and hear what people have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9897.112s">And</a>  I want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9898.594s">Anyone</a>  that throws their hat in the ring to run for public office, I think is an admirable cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9906.882s">And</a>  anyone willing to do that, especially at a young age. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9910.77s">I've</a>  always preached in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9912.991s">I've</a>  supported wide representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9914.953s">I've</a>  supported initiatives to get people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9918.595s">Even</a>  though I ran for office, I want to see more people get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9922.097s">So</a>  I'm glad that we have young people in this community as my neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9927.802s">Justin,</a>  while a lot of people don't know, he's my neighbor right across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9932.488s">He</a>  called me up several months back and said, Mike, I'm running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9937.234s">And</a>  I said, oh, you moved out of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9939.377s">And</a>  he said, no, I'm running for Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9942.714s">And</a>  a funny fact is that when I moved to Wellington Road some 30 years ago, I got a phone call from Angelo Morata. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9951.656s">And</a>  that may not sound familiar from a lot of people, but he said, I just want you to know, and I didn't know him from a hole in the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9958.778s">So</a>  I just want you to know that I was the original resident on Wellington Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9965.521s">and</a>  I am therefore the original councilor on Wellington Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9969.506s">So</a>  Justin, just so you know, I am the original city councilor on Wellington Road and don't ever forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9977.356s">And</a>  don't ever forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9980.79s">I'd</a>  like to thank my colleagues, Council beers Council morale for their dedicated service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=9987.456s">I'd</a>  like to thank Councilor Falco, who I stated earlier, made meetings, more transparent in this community, made the budget process, a far better process in this community, and just <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10003.769s">lent</a>  a sense of calmness to this council that I am appreciative for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10008.552s">And</a>  I wanna thank you for all your years of service and years of commitment to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10017.258s">Adam</a>  Knight, I mean, who's done more for working families? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10020.861s">I</a>  didn't know half about what he was talking about unions and about living wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10025.484s">But</a>  it was Adam Knight that brought the issues up and Adam Knight that fought for the unions in this community and fought for working families. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10034.607s">It</a>  made sure that they were at the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10036.848s">And</a>  there were many issues that I learned about listening to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10042.09s">And</a>  I have to say, I will forever be thankful for opening my eyes up to those issues in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10050.893s">Talk</a>  about a parliamentarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10053.332s">I</a>  mean, when he first got on the council, I said, oh, this kid's in for trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10056.554s">Oh,</a>  I'm gonna get him until he start calling rule seven, section 1630. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10059.996s">So</a>  what's this guy doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10063.057s">But</a>  when did he learn this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10064.678s">And</a>  sure enough, he was the parliamentarian and I have to give him credit that he picked up on that second nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10071.002s">Maybe</a>  it's his legislative experience and his commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10076.084s">But</a>  I wanna thank you for your friendship and years of service as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10081.707s">George</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10084.332s">I</a>  mean, I refer to him as Coach Scarpelli because George has done more for youth sports in this community than anyone in the history of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10095.074s">And</a>  I'm not just saying that because he's sitting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10097.535s">You</a>  know, George to me, George was working with underprivileged students before there were people working with underprivileged students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10109.197s">George</a>  was the one that reached across the aisle. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10111.778s">George</a>  was the one <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10114.453s">that</a>  lent himself to getting out there and looking for those in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10120.135s">So</a>  I refer to George as coach Scarpelli because George, the Councilor, yes, great counsel, good friend, great advocate, but it's George Scarpelli, the man. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10132.48s">And</a>  I think it says a lot about a person that's involved in a community behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10140.171s">You</a>  know, and then gets involved maybe in politics or do something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10144.272s">So,</a>  George, I wanna thank you for your many years of service to this community, but also to the youth and the disenfranchised and to the people that didn't have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10156.255s">You</a>  stood up, Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10158.595s">It</a>  was you that stood up and made sure that this happened in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10162.776s">It</a>  made sure that everyone felt welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10165.517s">And</a>  I wanna thank you and I'll forever be beholden, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10172.5s">Council</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10176.001s">I've</a>  had more people say, when you talk, why do you say Mr. President all the time? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10180.341s">And</a>  I say, that's out of deference and respect to Council President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10186.062s">You</a>  know, talk about someone that's been involved in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10190.963s">I</a>  mean, Rick Caraviello was involved in the community back 45 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10196.604s">I</a>  remember when I first ran for public office, it was Rick Caraviello <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10202.237s">that</a>  was sponsoring students, that was giving out part of all the civic organizations, giving out certificates and scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10212.039s">It</a>  was Rick Caraviello that worked with families, that worked with families that had food insecurities and still does to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10222.782s">He</a>  didn't stop it when he became a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10225.677s">It</a>  was Rick Caraviello was out in the community and he kept on doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10229.402s">And</a>  that says a lot about a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10231.945s">He</a>  didn't drop and say, ah, now I'm a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10234.789s">He</a>  kept on doing what he always knew and that's helping people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10240.417s">You</a>  wanna talk about helping people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10243.107s">You</a>  turn around and it was Councilor Caraviello who led the charge to make sure veterans that were in need of home repair, that maybe couldn't afford to fix a leaky roof or add a handicap ramp to their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10258.32s">It</a>  was Councilor Caraviello without any fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10261.202s">He</a>  wasn't looking for any fanfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10262.523s">It</a>  was Councilor Caraviello that stood up and made sure these things happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10268.35s">And</a>  I will forever be grateful for your leadership over the many years, and I consider every one of my colleagues a friend, and I hope we maintain our friendships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10282.801s">At</a>  this particular point, I know I'm getting long-winded, but I wouldn't be myself if I didn't mention my friends for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10291.537s">And</a>  this is probably where I get into a lot of trouble, but I'd like to recognize to the best of my ability, people that have been with me for three decades, or very close to three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10303.7s">And</a>  people that put their trust in me, and I still don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10310.903s">But</a>  people I consider my friends, and people that have been with me for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10315.384s">I</a>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10764.627s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10765.087s">From</a>  the public regarding the nice tribute that was made to these gentlemen tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10770.789s">There</a>  are some people who decided to watch this at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10774.41s">And</a>  I almost didn't come because I know I would be seeing Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10777.51s">I'm</a>  sort of, you know, a little bit more privileged than some people that we've become friends through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10785.221s">But</a>  there are some things that need to be mentioned because these jobs are very, very time consuming and people don't realize. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10794.87s">you</a>  know, all the time and the effort that goes goes into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10798.571s">I</a>  don't know john as well as I know, Michael, I know is know that your intentions are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10804.592s">And</a>  I've listened carefully over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10806.892s">And</a>  also, I met Michael personally, actually through Councilman Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10813.714s">So</a>  I knew if they were sort of pals, it was either going to be fireworks, or he was going to sort of follow in the footsteps and really do his homework to <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10824.577s">And</a>  I will say that my friends agree that you really, really did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10827.538s">We</a>  hate to lose you, but we're really not losing you because we have so many contributions through the years that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10835.999s">But</a>  I will tell you a funny little snippet because the first time Michael came into my home, I had talked to him on the phone and we had written emails and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10847.601s">He</a>  was very gracious in talking to all my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10851.142s">It</a>  wasn't a big political thing for him, but he accompanied Bob <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10854.358s">to</a>  my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10855.559s">So</a>  when I have my seasonal parties, and we had chatted more and I come to the podium, I included him, not as a guest to my home, but as a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10865.845s">So</a>  one night he came in and he looked a little harried. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10868.907s">So</a>  there were people usually what about 20 at a time at the seasonal parties and he was walking around and I said to my friends Jim glad Michael could make it he's so busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10880.136s">You</a>  know, so I then I turned I overheard him saying, boy, I was really tired I ran out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10886.159s">I</a>  thought he was going to say, but then I remembered the hostess, you know, Sharon goes, but I remember the food she made. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10893.603s">So,</a>  that was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10898.27s">I</a>  have to tell you that he's a man of his word, and he also serves the public taxpayer, which people have to be very, very mindful for because we will be watching year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10911.802s">We're</a>  the ones who are the property owners and are very, very concerned about where our money's being spent because of differences of opinion and also differences of needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10924.132s">shouldn't</a>  be city spending millions of dollars, and that this sidewalks are still cluttered in full of trash in certain areas, it's just, those are the types of things that he would, you could call him for my friends would say, should I call, I used to say, the only ones I really know well, Adam Knight, Michael mocks john Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10945.652s">We'll</a>  call Michael, because we hear him yelling all the time at the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10950.015s">So</a>  it's just a little picture of how he took time out of his very busy day when I took over the site from the city three years ago to add flowers and decor to that park, because it was getting run down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10964.364s">And</a>  my brother and my father had found these homes years ago to put us in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10969.047s">And</a>  I spoke to him that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10970.548s">And</a>  I said, would you do us the honor of coming down and saying a few words? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10974.69s">He</a>  was wonderful that day, ran out of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10977.452s">I</a>  think your son was home from school, and he said, I'd like to stay longer, but the kids come first, and we so understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10984.657s">So</a>  we will not be seeing you soon enough at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10987.979s">People</a>  know from experience that they really, really cherish your years here, that we hope that we see you at the podium soon, and I will see you soon personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=10999.226s">And</a>  a healthy year to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11002.148s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11003.513s">Thank</a>  you, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11004.373s">Thank</a>  you, John, so much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11114.927s">Well,</a>  excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11116.728s">I</a>  didn't realize you're gonna allow folks from the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11120.75s">We're</a>  here with someone from 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11125.012s">Great</a>  service, Mr. Delato, 1892. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11126.632s">He</a>  looks the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11128.953s">I</a>  don't know what the pill is that he's taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11130.574s">It's</a>  probably not the blue pill, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11134.783s">When</a>  I look at these two gentlemen here, I don't know John Falco as well as I do Michael Marx, but I will tell you this, going back to when John Falco was first running for school committee, I met with him and my wife at a restaurant at Mystic Avenue, and he was gracious enough to listen to her concerns being a school teacher as to what possibly could be things that he could bring forward to the school department for which he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11158.714s">And</a>  I appreciate that and I commend them for taking the opportunity for run for higher office this past year, because it takes an awful lot for someone to give up something that you might have as a security position, which would be a council school committee seat to take the next step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11173.631s">But</a>  if you don't try and never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11174.993s">As</a>  far as Michael Max goes all I can say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11180.386s">I</a>  wish he was here a little bit longer because I think he probably would have given me the one last incentive to once again run for this August party only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11190.934s">This</a>  city is going through a tremendous, like the country, a tremendous amount of change and you do need some level-headed people to understand yesterday, to capitalize what's going to take place for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11203.203s">I</a>  just hope and wish that this new incoming council can put together <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11209.553s">with</a>  the fellows that are here for a few years, some wisdom and common sense that recognizes that we are the city of method, and as an as inclusive as we are, we should not be divisive at the same time, because it cannot work and you cannot sustain itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11226.359s">I</a>  thank you, Michael for your years of service your dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11229.722s">But</a>  more importantly, I thank your family for allowing you to do it like my family allowed me to do mine for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11236.747s">I</a>  appreciate it and I know your folks and your families appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11241.009s">I</a>  just hope that the incoming city council grasps the knowledge that needs to be taken to make this city work to go forward and to be able to question <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11251.796s">without</a>  having to be called divisive rather than not divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11257.6s">Asking</a>  a question to get an answer is the best way to resolve an issue rather than not listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11264.184s">Because</a>  I think it was you, John Scott that says, you listen and you listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11268.126s">And</a>  the more you listen, the more you can learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11271.028s">Merry</a>  Christmas, happy, healthy new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11273.51s">And</a>  congratulations, John and Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11276.027s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11277.248s">Records,</a>  we'll pass the Council of Mayors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11278.589s">Council</a>  of Mayors, how did you find those records?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11280.57s">Found</a>  those records splendid, and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11284.712s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scott Flanagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11286.193s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11287.974s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11291.957s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=11294.819s">Yes.</a> </p>
