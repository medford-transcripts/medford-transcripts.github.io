1
00:00:01,552 --> 00:00:14,479
[SPEAKER_05]: 1927.

2
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:14,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, if you wish to submit any comments or questions during the meeting, you can email me to pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us.

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:23,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Those submitting an email must include the following, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

4
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:27,347
[SPEAKER_05]: The memo is that as approved by the committee on

5
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:38,758
[SPEAKER_05]: January 24th, 2022 in paper 2022-5, the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will review the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan for recommended updates.

6
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:44,001
[SPEAKER_05]: This is continued from the Rules and Policy Subcommittee meeting, which was previously held on December 6th, 2022.

7
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:48,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we've had one more recent than that as well.

8
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:50,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll get that fixed on the next agenda.

9
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:52,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh actually, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:58,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The agenda continued from the Rules and Policies Subcommittee meeting previously held on March 2nd, that's the one, 2023.

11
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to take the roll.

12
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

13
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:05,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

14
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:08,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

15
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:09,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

16
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:11,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

17
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:12,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

18
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:13,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Three present, we have a quorum.

19
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:20,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those that are joining us and have not been in this, this is our

20
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:25,484
[SPEAKER_05]: third or maybe our fourth meeting on the bullying prevention and intervention plan.

21
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:41,432
[SPEAKER_05]: We are working to update the plan, bring it in compliance with the law that seems to change more often than we expected, and also to make it human usable, which it is not at the moment.

22
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:49,816
[SPEAKER_05]: The last meeting we had, there were a couple of takeaways

23
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:51,426
[SPEAKER_05]: that's fine either way.

24
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Um member Glockman was going to begin work on a flow chart, which we.

25
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:55,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Can get to today or not.

26
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,030
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

27
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way.

28
00:01:56,511 --> 00:02:02,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Um the member Graham, um, after this meeting.

29
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:08,701
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal is for her to, um, review the structure of the the document.

30
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:12,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Um and I was assigned to clean the

31
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:24,806
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of comments in the Google Doc that make it interesting, but there's no date and time stamp.

32
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:27,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there is, but it's a real hard thing to use.

33
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:34,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And then check on the sections that are required in the law so we can delete unnecessary stuff from the current document.

34
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:43,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Between then and now, I heard from our school attorney who was supposed to be the star tonight.

35
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:45,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, COVID is not done.

36
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:54,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will not have our attorney tonight, which sort of threw me into a bit of a like, oh, okay, something to do tonight because this meeting is scheduled.

37
00:02:55,698 --> 00:03:00,181
[SPEAKER_05]: He did review the entire policy and sent me an email and told me that there are a

38
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,122
[SPEAKER_05]: substantial number of updates.

39
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:14,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawyers don't tend to use a lot of exciting language, but I read into his very short email that most of the policy does not appear to be what he thinks it should be.

40
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,950
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't send me a list or anything like that.

41
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plan was he was going to go through that with us tonight, but I just found out yesterday that he was not going to be able to make it.

42
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:32,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to just share some of the work I did since the last meeting.

43
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:45,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did go to the actual law, section 370, I actually forget the full reference from Mass General Law.

44
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:54,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went through the document, I copied it out of the Mass General Law website, which is remarkably,

45
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: 1995, if you ever enjoyed using it.

46
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:08,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I put it, I formatted it, actually did some indentation just so it was readable, because it's just, if you look at the law, it is a gigantic blob.

47
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:19,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It is really a remarkable, when you look at a lot of other laws on the state website, you see formatting and spacing and like, you can read it.

48
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is very, very strange.

49
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a gigantic dump.

50
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:26,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like without return characters, frankly.

51
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:31,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went through and did that just so it would be easy enough for us to

52
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: With Mr. Greenspan, our attorney, who's not here, with him here, we would be able to look at the actual text that he was referring to.

53
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,206
[SPEAKER_05]: That took a bunch of time, but is of no value.

54
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:56,234
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I did other than that was I was assigned to work on the actual definition section, look at the definitions throughout the document.

55
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:07,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I also then looked at the definitions from the state's website, the Mass General Law, which includes a whole pile of definitions, and frankly, will solve a couple of the questions we had.

56
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:14,426
[SPEAKER_05]: But before I share my definitions, did anybody want anything you wanted to say?

57
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Just talk continuously now.

58
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:16,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

59
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:23,573
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think I've heard.

60
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:35,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I would love to see some of the changes that you had and some of the pieces that you just were talking about.

61
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:52,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And knowing that, unfortunately, Attorney Greenspan isn't able to be with us today, maybe we can at least look at some of what the suggestions were and then know that moving forward, we'll have that other legal counsel regarding the document.

62
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:55,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

63
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Needed to hear somebody's voice other than mine.

64
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I went through the definitions that are in the current document.

65
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Can everybody see this and is it big enough?

66
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:11,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's good.

67
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:16,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took a couple, okay, I took one liberty.

68
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:23,791
[SPEAKER_05]: In the actual law, there's a whole section with definitions at the top, which you will see here.

69
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:45,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in, after that, there's two examples for which they should have just put a definition and instead had this like three line long school districts, charter schools, chapter, you know, 766 schools or whatever, day schools that like listed all the schools that law applied to.

70
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:48,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would repeat it, I don't know,

71
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:52,758
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple dozen times, which added a huge amount of text.

72
00:06:52,938 --> 00:07:01,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the liberty I took here was to simply convert that to say, let me find an example.

73
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not so long anymore.

74
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

75
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,361
[SPEAKER_05]: School district, there it is.

76
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:12,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So where I say school district,

77
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is for us.

78
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,001
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not any of those other things.

79
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:25,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So I chopped, frankly, a remarkable amount of language out of their definition because we don't need that other stuff.

80
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a liberty I took.

81
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I've changed this slightly.

82
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:36,850
[SPEAKER_05]: The current version in the document says definitions.

83
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, let me grab that.

84
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little long, but it also,

85
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:50,760
[SPEAKER_04]: language requires us to, sorry, the scrolling is slower when I'm on Zoom.

86
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:06,827
[SPEAKER_05]: The current language says several of the following definitions are copied directly from Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 37-0, as noted below.

87
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:12,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, taking to heart that a lot of people had

88
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,585
[SPEAKER_05]: and all of us I think had really been like this current document isn't terribly usable.

89
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:20,209
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is supposed to be a document that is used.

90
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:27,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So I rewrote that to say definitions substantially taken from that are italicized.

91
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:35,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So I couldn't say we copied it because I took out all that extra language about, you know, all the different kinds of school districts that exist.

92
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, these are the definitions right out of the law.

93
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And I take the definitions out of the law to be that that's the definition we have to use.

94
00:08:49,662 --> 00:09:01,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I mean, you could say I've taken liberties here, but I think there's no change to the intent or meaning of the language at all to take out that chunk.

95
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:05,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the definition of cyberbullying, I wouldn't write it this way.

96
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's in the law.

97
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:13,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So if Howard was here, I would ask him, are we required to use these definitions?

98
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:17,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we would want to ask him that when we see him at the next meeting.

99
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:23,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Because these are definitions that need to be updated, frankly.

100
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Hostile work environment.

101
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I added a couple that we didn't have.

102
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,852
[SPEAKER_05]: that were in the law that I thought were actually something we should have.

103
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:40,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the last meeting, we had a pretty interesting conversation.

104
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:51,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we ended with any kind of decision about whether to use perpetrator or what was the other word?

105
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Aggressor.

106
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:09,264
[SPEAKER_05]: perpetrator feels an awful lot to me like you're already convicted, but that's what's in there.

107
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:14,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, unless if Howard says we're supposed to use these words and I guess we're stuck.

108
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And if he says we're not, then we're gonna have to have that conversation again.

109
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:25,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like I'd rather wait to dig into what we wanna use until Howard can tell us that we could change it.

110
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So just from a efficiency perspective.

111
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Retaliation, school grounds, school staff is when I added.

112
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:42,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So every time it says school staff, this was the other liberty I took, I'm sorry, there was two.

113
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:54,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single time school staff was referenced, it would be school staff, including but not limited to educators, all that whole thing over and over and over again.

114
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:58,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put school staff and

115
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: we could discuss whether we wanna put like a C definition or something like that or not.

116
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:11,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is just the definition section.

117
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other one is victim, which we did.

118
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:22,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be the one we talked the most about, but that is also in the law.

119
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:30,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we have conversations to be had once we have Howard to tell us there's no point or not.

120
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:48,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the definitions that we currently had, plus the addition of school staff and the addition of perpetrator, because our current definitions actually didn't, oh, it did have aggressor, sorry.

121
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:58,416
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have victim either, but I put that in because it was in the law.

122
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,716
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the actual copy.

123
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:08,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share this with everybody after the meeting, if you want to take a look at it.

124
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:20,330
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the copy of the law that has had formatting and then a couple of small items that are in the law I just deleted.

125
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,552
[SPEAKER_05]: They were things specific to charters.

126
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:23,713
[SPEAKER_05]: They just weren't relevant to us.

127
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:30,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to have a clean version to work from and understanding the law, I thought this was helpful.

128
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:39,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I have also taken the three times the law has been updated and I've applied those changes into this document.

129
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not look to see what changed.

130
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:59,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So in 2014, there was a change that simply took all of section D, whatever the law was before,

131
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:06,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It replaced section D with a new section D. So I copied the new version of section D into here.

132
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:10,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't painstakingly look to see what had changed in the law.

133
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:23,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm guessing that's some of what Howard will have to talk about is that maybe we have language that needs to be updated because the law was changed three times or four times.

134
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what else we should be talking about.

135
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:32,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I really was planning for Howard.

136
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:45,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody want ever grammar you're talking, sir.

137
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking sorry, quite ready yet.

138
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,370
Okay.

139
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:52,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. dilemma just raised his hand.

140
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:56,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Leavitt, hi, sorry.

141
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:57,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's okay.

142
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:02,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, Paul, because I haven't seen, sorry, member Ruseau.

143
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:13,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen the law in a while, but in our old policy, there was something about filing a false bullying report and what would happen if somebody did.

144
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if that was present in the law at all.

145
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:18,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

146
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:20,377
[SPEAKER_05]: In section D,

147
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,109
[SPEAKER_05]: and it may well be part of what changed, I don't know.

148
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:30,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like the kind of thing that would get added after the law went into effect and people like, well, what about this?

149
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:43,681
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, subsection D29 is a provision that a student who knowingly makes a false accusation of bullying or retaliation shall be subject to disciplinary action.

150
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:47,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's in there, yep.

151
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:50,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that is something

152
00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:01,603
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that has come up, and I don't know if we should look at that too, as well, to make sure that that's kind of stated correctly.

153
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask a question about that?

154
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:04,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

155
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:06,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you give us an example?

156
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:18,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like this is one of those sort of dangerous topics, because what we're trying to do is encourage people who are feeling threatened in some way

157
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:24,942
[SPEAKER_07]: to come forward so that the proper people can get involved to investigate.

158
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:45,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always get like a little bit concerned when there's emphasis on like falsely doing such a thing, because I think it brings up a lot of questions about like, is it false if you as the administration find that it's not bullying?

159
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make it false?

160
00:15:47,791 --> 00:16:09,344
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just like, I, I would love a couple of examples of like how this has come up for you all in context to really be able to think through what needs to be in our policy so that we are not discouraging people from bringing forward issues that they're, that they or their children are facing.

161
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:14,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like that's like the very real danger when you start talking about like consequences for

162
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,408
[SPEAKER_07]: or falsely accusing people.

163
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:21,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a very serious problem too.

164
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:30,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think like we have to really think carefully about how to do service to like both ends of that spectrum.

165
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:48,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham, if I may, through the chair, Member Ruseau, I agree that here right now, especially with the changes that we're trying to make, we definitely are providing people with bullying paperwork.

166
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: If families feel that bullying has taken place,

167
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:58,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that regards, we're not trying to run away and not conduct the investigations.

168
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:04,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if the determination is at the end that it might not be bullying, it could be something else.

169
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe Principal DeLeva could speak to it.

170
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:14,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am aware, and I do know that sometimes

171
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:21,243
[SPEAKER_03]: a bullying claim or something could be reported.

172
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:31,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's evidence, maybe cell phone evidence, texting or things that were on social media that might show otherwise.

173
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:41,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the norm, it is the exception, but it has happened within the district.

174
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:46,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you could give a very kind of vague example, Principal DeLeva.

175
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna I did have one.

176
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:51,227
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I bring up is I did have one incident.

177
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:59,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, as vague as I possibly can be where a family met with me, we discussed and determined that it was not bullying.

178
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:09,844
[SPEAKER_02]: with the aggressor and then the aggressor family or the alleged aggressive family pushed back and said, well, I feel this is a false claim.

179
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:13,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you going to do to the other family kind of thing?

180
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that did occur.

181
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that frequently occurs, but it does occur.

182
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:23,078
[SPEAKER_02]: once in a while.

183
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:31,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, that's why I kind of brought it up, because I'm trying to see like, okay, where's the, like you said, Memogram, like, where's the happy ground?

184
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:39,647
[SPEAKER_02]: If everyone's going to refute, you know, if the determination is not bullying, and then you're just going to go back and say, well, well, then that's a false claim.

185
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:44,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you doing to that other person that false claimed my child as an aggressor?

186
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something we got to look at.

187
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:56,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, actually, thank you for that example.

188
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:12,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's really helpful for us to think through in terms of, you know, not just what does the policy say, like, you know, the law says like, a false accusation, but I think that's different than

189
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,394
[SPEAKER_07]: a report being filed that was found to be not bullying, right?

190
00:19:18,854 --> 00:19:36,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a differential there, but to hear that from, if you are the aggressor's parent, you certainly would feel like this was a false claim, especially if the administration sided with your child in some way.

191
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:42,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's really important for us to think through in terms of the policy, but also in terms of,

192
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:51,077
[SPEAKER_07]: how we describe this process to parents and children who end up in it, right?

193
00:19:51,137 --> 00:20:03,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that there are consequences for false accusations, but that is not the same necessarily as, you know, a finding of not bullying, right?

194
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:13,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So thinking about how we describe that for the users of this policy, I think is also really important.

195
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

196
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:27,065
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I would agree that it's important to be very clear on what we're discussing when we're talking about.

197
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:37,202
[SPEAKER_06]: false accusations and actually who determines whether something is a false accusation and what the implications are that because I think it's a slippery slope as well.

198
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that I'm not sure who's actually qualified to do that and what the implications could be, whether they would be, there might be legal or criminal ramifications as well.

199
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:54,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's really, that's why I think it's important to have our attorney as part of this as well.

200
00:20:59,225 --> 00:20:59,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

201
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:12,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just also wanted to say that I'm similar to DCF if I can make this scenario that when 51 a is filed.

202
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:26,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It is ruled in for 10 days, and DCF does the investigation, and at the end of their determined investigation they determine whether it's ruled in or ruled out.

203
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:36,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if a family is going to complete the bullying paperwork, we are going to look at it from the perspective of, we have to rule it in.

204
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:41,340
[SPEAKER_03]: conduct the investigation, and then at the end come to the determination.

205
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want people to think that we don't want to go through the process.

206
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:50,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better to be safe than sorry.

207
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:56,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So complete the paperwork, submit it, and we'll conduct the investigation.

208
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:59,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will either be the rule in or the rule out.

209
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:01,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with DCF,

210
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:08,644
[SPEAKER_03]: What they say to us, Department of Children and Families, is when in doubt, file, and let them make the determination.

211
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:17,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a family is in doubt, they should complete the paperwork, and then let us do the investigation.

212
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:19,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

213
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I just need to lower my hand, sorry.

214
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

215
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer Graham?

216
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:42,890
[SPEAKER_07]: If a student files a bullying report, is their signature required from the parent as well?

217
00:22:52,353 --> 00:22:57,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the other question I have is, should there be some acknowledgement?

218
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:01,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are the parents required to acknowledge the filing

219
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,441
[SPEAKER_07]: in some way?

220
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:06,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe- Oh, sorry.

221
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:23,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say, depending on the age of the child and like the, you know, at the high school where the kids are much older, but if it were to be in the younger grades, we definitely would have to have, you know, parent involvement and consent for them to know what was going on.

222
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,844
[SPEAKER_03]: But the high school, I think, you know,

223
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:31,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Some students are 16, 17.

224
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:55,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't thank you, Principal Tucci's on as well, but I would definitely say, depending on the age of the child, and as we're revamping this, it could be something where we just say, no matter what, as part of the policy in Medford, parents, no matter what grade level, whether you're 11th grade or sixth grade, parents have to be notified that the bullying paperwork is being completed.

225
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:18,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, you know, in terms of the practice the practices at the middle school level certainly that anytime there is a report of bullying, all parties in their parents guardians caregivers would be would be contacted, you know, certainly we're going to be working with each one of the families in different contexts hand in hand.

226
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:27,077
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to make sure they're apprised of a situation and, you know, understanding what the next steps are going to be while respecting confidentiality too as well.

227
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:30,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, certainly, you know, if we wanna...

228
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:56,839
[SPEAKER_01]: denote perhaps on some sort of a sheet of paper, you know, to denote the contacts, the times at which we have gone ahead and made contact that might be helpful for documentation standpoints and also for families to understand that that's a level of, you know, service and care we're going to provide to them to make sure that we provide them with, you know, that level of, you know, understanding and transparency and communication throughout this process that's difficult for all parties involved.

229
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

230
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:04,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say exactly what Nick said.

231
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:12,862
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that, and we, you know, we always keep a log of when we contact families as well so that nobody can turn around and say, well, we were never informed.

232
00:25:12,982 --> 00:25:21,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes investigations do take a long time, but what we like to do is say, you know, we're still working on it just so you know, because sometimes witnesses are absent.

233
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:23,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're absent for longer periods of time than we'd want.

234
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,783
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just kind of keep a running log of the communication home, but always trying to keep everybody in the loop.

235
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:30,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sometimes they do take a while.

236
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it can be anywhere from one to two weeks sometimes to complete an investigation.

237
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:36,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always just want to take your time with it.

238
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:37,948
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't rush through that at all.

239
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:38,768
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

240
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:40,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

241
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:53,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if we can put on the list of questions for our attorney, whether it would be okay to

242
00:25:55,525 --> 00:26:20,872
[SPEAKER_07]: um, make the process such that like, we would ideally have a parent's acknowledgement at the, at the time where something is filed, which I think would, I think provide some comfort, maybe all around that we're doing what we can to mitigate like knowingly false accusations.

243
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:21,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

244
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So that.

245
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:32,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there's like that extra care that when something is sort of on the way in the door, that there's some acknowledgement there from the family that, that they've been involved.

246
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:36,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, maybe we have to stop short of making it a requirement.

247
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:47,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I would be interested from his perspective, if that's permissible or if that would be seen as like us trying to deter complaints, which I would, I wouldn't want to do either.

248
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I'm trying to think of, you know, how to.

249
00:26:51,109 --> 00:27:01,296
[SPEAKER_07]: make this, I think, the process that you all intended to be, which is, you know, a collaboration of school and home, sort of at every step of the way.

250
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:07,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

251
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:13,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to bring up a point that I think might be worthy of reflecting, perhaps, in this new document.

252
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:28,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We've recently begun using the Sandy Hook Say Something reporting system, which I've found to be useful and helpful, certainly, to be able to give students and families another avenue to be able to document a concern.

253
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:36,436
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't always have to be about bullying or cyberbullying, but oftentimes the reports that we're seeing coming in at the secondary level are of that sort.

254
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:47,526
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, you know, certainly we've trained our students to find trusted adults in our school community and our community in general to be able to, you know, tell these things to and have conversations about.

255
00:27:48,206 --> 00:28:02,099
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's this added layer now that we have where students can anonymously send these tips to school administrators like myself and there's a whole team of folks through Sandy Hook that will then stream it and then send it to the appropriate parties, a person like myself.

256
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:11,828
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've found to be a little bit of a problem of practice is that sometimes we don't know who is sending this tip, obviously, because it's anonymous in nature.

257
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:18,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is troublesome and difficult at times to be able to follow up.

258
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:21,457
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, many of these tips are very, very useful.

259
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,220
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to just at least put that out there.

260
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps we can note the fact that we're using this anonymous tip line.

261
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:42,192
[SPEAKER_01]: As another layer of support for our students and families, but also just note the fact that sometimes it does add an element of challenge for us to be able to follow up with this anonymous tipster to receive the appropriate information.

262
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:44,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we found that these tips we.

263
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:52,143
[SPEAKER_01]: they may be even unfounded, you know, where we may just be given a random tip about somebody, and we just don't have enough information.

264
00:28:52,503 --> 00:29:01,094
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to do our best to engage whoever the tipster might be in the moment, but we're still learning a little bit about this process, we're working with Sandy Hook about it.

265
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:10,379
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it may be worthy of mentioning in our bullying, you know, new bullying plan, the fact that we have this new system.

266
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:17,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to share some candid feedback on that and, you know, see what people thought about perhaps adding that into our plan.

267
00:29:18,283 --> 00:29:18,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

268
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:20,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

269
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:24,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, I put it on the list of things to include in the new document.

270
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't see a downside really.

271
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:28,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So, member Graham.

272
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I, I agree.

273
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:36,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, um, but I think we should frame it in the policy as.

274
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:52,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Anonymous tips, like no, sort of no matter where from, like for like right now we're using Sandy hook, but, um, if an anonymous tip came in some other way, um, I would want us to like take the same treatment of an anonymous tip.

275
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:59,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the question then becomes like in those, in those moments of practice, it,

276
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:10,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a requirement of the policy that a bullying report be filled out by a school administrator in order to like sort of formally document the process?

277
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And if so, like, what are the parameters?

278
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:24,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Because not every, you know, like you just said, like not every anonymous tip is legitimate and there's lots of ways that you all go about doing that.

279
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,083
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, at what point does an anonymous tip rise to the level of,

280
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:35,316
[SPEAKER_07]: but an actual bullying report being filed and opened.

281
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:38,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how do we account for that in the policy?

282
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:59,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is the question because I think that it won't be every anonymous tip, but I want it to be clear when it should be part of this bullying process so that there can be consistency across school buildings and administrators and

283
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,001
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody knows how this all works, right?

284
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:13,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that question becomes like, what are the criteria that we would be expecting the school administrators to apply consistently in that case?

285
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:18,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Graham.

286
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:22,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think that's a really good point.

287
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,591
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be a weird question since I should know this, but,

288
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:32,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Are administrators allowed to fill out a bullying form report?

289
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:38,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would assume and hope, but I... Okay, a lot of heads going yes, that makes me happy.

290
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:46,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, I assumed, but Dr. Edward-Vinson, I see you want to say something.

291
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone can fill out a form, any staff person at all.

292
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:58,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just wanted to respond to member Graham's question about getting a little more information on the anonymous reporting.

293
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:03,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just going to say that I'll follow up with Stacey Shulman.

294
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:09,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's the lead administrator working with the Sandy Hook Promise.

295
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:16,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So she'll be able to provide more information specific to your questions.

296
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:18,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

297
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

298
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:28,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So

299
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:54,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if it would be helpful for everybody on the phone for us to sort of roll through the document in its current form to remind everybody of what is here, because I think this is a great time, particularly with such a huge group of administrators on the phone.

300
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be like respectful of the fact that you probably all came here for a reason.

301
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:16,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And there might be things that are on your mind, and this might be a great audience while we wait for our attorney to weigh in on the policy for you all to identify if there's anything else that you see that you wanna sort of dig into or dive into.

302
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:23,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have a handful of community members on the call as well, but we have a lot of administrators here.

303
00:33:23,913 --> 00:33:27,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's anything that you all are thinking about, it would be great

304
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:30,645
[SPEAKER_07]: use this time to collect all of that.

305
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:33,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if we just roll through the document, that might make it easiest.

306
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great idea.

307
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:37,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

308
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:44,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I would start with, did anybody come here with a list of your own?

309
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:50,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you didn't, we can start at the top.

310
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:55,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we have the table of contents, which I'm going to skip.

311
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe I should just do this table of contents and we can go to the sections if anybody says yes, that one.

312
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:09,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So now because, nevermind, sorry.

313
00:34:10,753 --> 00:34:12,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the structure of the document.

314
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,714
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff that doesn't belong in there.

315
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:15,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're gonna just go through it like this.

316
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:16,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

317
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:33,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was gonna say member who so I was going to suggest trying to use the key headers but if the headers on a line to what's in the document, then I was going to say just for simplicity sake, because we know that it's over 30 something pages.

318
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:50,479
[SPEAKER_03]: that if we were just able to focus in and look at the headers, there could be a particular header that jumps out at a member of the team that's on the call that would be able to say like this is a particular area that we need to focus in on.

319
00:34:52,620 --> 00:35:01,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I, that was what I was going to do but like right out of the gate we don't have any, this isn't even in the, in the index.

320
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:12,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But so this section here is really copied out of the law.

321
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:20,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everything in the law is here, but there is definitely, or actually it is almost the entire thing.

322
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:25,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me switch over to my version I created.

323
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:27,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So it ends right now with,

324
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:31,858
[SPEAKER_05]: department investigations.

325
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:33,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's not really the same.

326
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:35,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably was at one point.

327
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:40,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So that section is really mostly a copy of the law.

328
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:48,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these one through five definitions for bullying, that's just all right out of the law.

329
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:57,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we go down to the first section, the document just begins with a copy of the law,

330
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,382
[SPEAKER_05]: do that myself.

331
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:07,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Introduction to the plan, district and school district responsibilities.

332
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So these, I think there are some updates that have to happen here.

333
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the ones I noticed today was that

334
00:36:17,282 --> 00:36:25,825
[SPEAKER_05]: we're supposed to be providing specific education, K through 12, every single year to our students on bullying prevention.

335
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:45,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying that doesn't happen, but I'm saying that I was surprised and, you know, with all the other pressures, I guess it feels like something we're gonna take care of in the ECAT, the Health Education Curriculum Advisory Committee, to bring that in across the district.

336
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:48,898
[SPEAKER_05]: That was something in there.

337
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:51,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, there's staff training as well.

338
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I asked in the last meeting and that is happening already every year.

339
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:14,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So then there's responsibilities for the district, financial support, resources to teachers and parents, students, outreach.

340
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:22,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously the policies in the annual plan review and individual school plans.

341
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:24,098
[SPEAKER_05]: This says annual.

342
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:27,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the law was updated when I was reading that today.

343
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not every single year you have to redo this whole policy.

344
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:35,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Then individual schools have a whole set of responsibilities.

345
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:37,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

346
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:43,371
[SPEAKER_05]: This document for anybody who's joining us midway through this conversation is on our website.

347
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:52,967
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody wants it, raise your hand and I'll grab the URL and send it to you, but otherwise I won't make everybody wait while I browse.

348
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:02,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's the responsibilities for the staff.

349
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:12,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Student responsibilities, which we've talked about quite a bit this last year, six months.

350
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Parent caregiver responsibilities.

351
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,672
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's an interesting one to me.

352
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:26,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I just find it, this one in particular, I can't, I don't think I've ever been able to figure out what it even means.

353
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:35,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody wanna say something, Evergreen?

354
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:36,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I make two suggestions?

355
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,298
[SPEAKER_07]: One is, and I think we talked about this last time,

356
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:43,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that there would be a section of definitions.

357
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:47,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So there can be like the introduction to the policy, and then there can be a set of definitions so that.

358
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:53,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the current document has definitions sort of scattered throughout, but that's like one change I would like to see us make.

359
00:38:54,244 --> 00:39:05,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think the real question about this whole section is, um, who can we govern in our policy?

360
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:07,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is really.

361
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:09,970
[SPEAKER_07]: the district, right?

362
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:15,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we cannot actually govern the community with our policy.

363
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:23,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is like, one of those things that is well intentioned, but like, completely unenforceable, right?

364
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:25,699
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't want to build policy that's unenforceable.

365
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:30,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the question becomes, what, what are the

366
00:39:30,387 --> 00:39:39,149
[SPEAKER_07]: the responsibilities that we expect the district administrators to adhere to, what are the responsibilities we expect students to adhere to while they're in our buildings.

367
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:51,993
[SPEAKER_07]: But beyond that, I think the spirit of what some of this was trying to do is to say, this is not just about what happens in a school building, right?

368
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:57,735
[SPEAKER_07]: That this takes all of us and I don't want that message to get lost, but I think it's completely lost.

369
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:04,718
[SPEAKER_07]: in the idea that like, we have some say over what people do in their homes.

370
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:09,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we write it in a policy, then it will be so because it is just simply not true.

371
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:25,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I think the spirit of it, which is that this does take all of us, um, has to come through somehow, but I think it has to be reframed in terms of like, what do we expect the district to do?

372
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:31,363
[SPEAKER_07]: to educate parents and the community about the part they play.

373
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:45,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we can expect and enforce and prioritize and budget for, but we can't make people come to a six o'clock showing of screenagers, for example.

374
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:47,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I was with Mr. Tucci last night.

375
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

376
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:49,931
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't make people show up.

377
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,892
[SPEAKER_07]: We just can't.

378
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:56,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So to say it's part of our policy that you show up to do something like that is just,

379
00:40:56,818 --> 00:41:01,480
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's not going to get us to the, to the output that we're looking for.

380
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:14,904
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think to say things like we will, you know, provide parent education events on an annual basis is a, is actually something that we can accomplish that gets us to that same place.

381
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:24,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I think unless there's some legal reason why this stuff has to be here, that we strike this because no one's going to read it and we can't enforce it anyway.

382
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:25,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's.

383
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:29,053
[SPEAKER_07]: focus on the things, let's focus on the framing of things that we can enforce.

384
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:32,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

385
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:34,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, that's a really good point.

386
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:45,537
[SPEAKER_05]: One way we can certainly make this document more consumable is not including a bunch of stuff that feel good, but it's definitely not policy.

387
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:47,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like that sort of

388
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:55,792
[SPEAKER_05]: almost a, I don't want to say workaround, but providing those sessions like screen agers, I remember going to that a couple of times.

389
00:41:55,912 --> 00:42:06,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I don't know if it's the same exact one or if they keep updating it, but we can certainly put some, perhaps put something in here that that will be offered.

390
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:17,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we'd have to find out how to figure out how to word that one to make sure it still remains policy and not just a like on this date and time because that's not going to work well for a policy.

391
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:19,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, thanks.

392
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I regret that's good.

393
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:27,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this is a copy of the same exact thing again.

394
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:34,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I'm not going to reread it and obviously we'll be cutting it

395
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,000
[SPEAKER_05]: One or both of them out.

396
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:41,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, before we would cut anything, we would make sure they really are exactly that.

397
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:54,198
[SPEAKER_05]: But this section here, leadership and plan development, I don't know that I understand

398
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,741
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just document management history.

399
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:02,602
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably in minutes of former school committee meetings from many years ago.

400
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:25,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly, you know, when this was being brought up from nothing, very interesting stuff to read, but I don't see any reason this entire section should be in here unless there is some weird thing that Howard says, our attorney says, yes, you have to have it.

401
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:36,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But if he does say that, I'm sure we can get away with reordering it and putting it at the end as in some kind of document history or something like that.

402
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:47,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we put it as like an appendix of prior

403
00:43:53,367 --> 00:44:03,075
[SPEAKER_07]: implementation activity or something like that, so that, you know, it can sit somewhere, but it doesn't have to be in the main body of the policy.

404
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:15,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I, you know, I do think like, there will come a time where somebody will say, you know, you don't have this policy.

405
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:16,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're like, well, yes, we do.

406
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:18,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody will say, but you just made it up right now.

407
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:19,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

408
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:22,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's say, no, actually we didn't make it up just right now.

409
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Like look at all of this activity that's been happening since the spring of 2010.

410
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:27,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

411
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:37,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's like these weird edge cases where this stuff becomes very useful and important, even though it's not important the vast majority of the time.

412
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe just some sort of appendix or something that puts in like pre

413
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:52,002
[SPEAKER_07]: like pre-version control history, and then the document will be subject to all the version control that we do going forward.

414
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:55,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good point.

415
00:44:58,984 --> 00:45:02,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even the state's national laws website doesn't give you any version history.

416
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:04,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That's quite annoying.

417
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:10,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The next section is the parent and community involvement.

418
00:45:10,368 --> 00:45:12,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is probably where it would make sense

419
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:24,525
[SPEAKER_04]: but maybe involved isn't the right word, but this feels like a communications plan to me.

420
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:35,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more part of the implementation of all of this.

421
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:42,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it looks like to me, this reads like a continuation of what did we do along the way that

422
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:44,796
[SPEAKER_07]: belongs with this appendix idea.

423
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:46,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

424
00:45:48,097 --> 00:45:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that makes sense.

425
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a mixture of various things, so yeah.

426
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:08,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just seeing this community health organization, Redford Health Matters, it's not actionable, you can't do anything with it, it doesn't tell you what happened, were they really involved, was that the plan?

427
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

428
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:19,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, um, I am in agreement with that I believe in putting as much information as possible that isn't relevant.

429
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:30,860
[SPEAKER_03]: to the families that wanna use this document to put all of that in the appendix and really make the first portion of the final document just be user-friendly.

430
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of like who's filling it out, what are the forms?

431
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:39,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's a lot of information.

432
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:48,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a thesis, it can be overwhelming, but if people know that it's all of this,

433
00:46:50,253 --> 00:47:01,521
[SPEAKER_03]: that historical information, those pieces, if it can be in the appendix, and that the actual document is significantly smaller, that will make a big difference.

434
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

435
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, yeah, thank you.

436
00:47:05,804 --> 00:47:06,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

437
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:09,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was just saying I would agree, and

438
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:29,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think that we need to be thinking about, and not for this meeting, obviously, but in the bigger picture, I think we need to be thinking about how we're simplifying the language overall and the document overall for translation, because I think there's going to be a lot of things that don't actually translate.

439
00:47:30,853 --> 00:47:31,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So we might want to rethink that.

440
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:32,933
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really great point.

441
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:34,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

442
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't even thought about that.

443
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:41,361
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

444
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm just going to add a little note to my other notes.

445
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:20,765
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, next section is the, this is just the, oh, this was the thing I said earlier about how we have to do this education every year.

446
00:48:20,785 --> 00:48:24,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's listed right there.

447
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:28,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I said we weren't doing it and it's literally, I'm sorry.

448
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:34,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking too much of the heat cap meetings where we were kind of like, okay, well, this stuff has to go.

449
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:36,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Graham?

450
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:50,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this is appropriate for a policy document because first of all, the school committee doesn't have any say over curriculum, right?

451
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:55,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And second of all, like this could change for any number of reasons.

452
00:48:55,826 --> 00:49:07,175
[SPEAKER_07]: What the policy needs to say is that it happens every year perhaps, and maybe that an annual presentation of

453
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:14,099
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the bullying education provided district wide is presented in some way, right?

454
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:26,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Like those are things that the policy can dictate, but I don't, I just think like, and frankly, if you're a parent, like you, like, you're going to, your eyes are going to like gloss over and you're going to keep going.

455
00:49:26,493 --> 00:49:28,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause none of this means anything to you anyway.

456
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:33,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I don't think educators are coming to this document to be like, what should I teach in class today?

457
00:49:33,518 --> 00:49:35,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's not how they get their instructions either.

458
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:43,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it should be deleted, but I don't know if you all agree with that.

459
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly agree that it should be deleted.

460
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:56,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, if for no other reason than where we don't have authority over this, this literal, this policy, which is presently approved means that.

461
00:49:57,233 --> 00:50:00,295
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the curriculum that the district should be using in every spot.

462
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:04,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that that's necessarily right.

463
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:13,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But as member Graham mentioned, we are not supposed to be doing, we're not supposed to have decision matters in curriculum other than funding.

464
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:14,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

465
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:17,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

466
00:50:17,606 --> 00:50:18,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yes.

467
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:37,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to add to that that you know it could be that there was a requirement that a curriculum be mentioned so that parents understand and know what is being taught and or that you know, I mean so I don't want to eliminate it all together I think it should be a question for.

468
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:55,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Howard, because I think that maybe in a lot of these instances, they have requirements that a curriculum be posted to follow the guidelines or whatever, and that the district obviously chooses the curriculum.

469
00:50:55,112 --> 00:51:04,196
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not choosing the curriculum, but we are including the curriculum in the bullying policy because it's demonstrating that the district actually has chosen one and created one.

470
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:05,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to just

471
00:51:06,057 --> 00:51:07,358
[SPEAKER_06]: eliminate anything.

472
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:19,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's dated, obviously, and needs to be updated, but I think we need to double check and see if it's required that a curriculum is mentioned and created by the district, which I suspect is why this is in here.

473
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:25,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

474
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:48,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also note just, you know, if I may, you know, to be effective in this regard, schools have really found success in preventing bullying just through broader efforts, you know, including the topics like social-emotional learning and school climate-based programming, and making sure that we're infusing these, not just through health or wellness class, but across all disciplines.

475
00:51:49,512 --> 00:51:53,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And all teachers are teaching their students first and their subject matter second.

476
00:51:54,507 --> 00:52:11,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to be thoughtful in that, because that's where the research is saying that you're going to have some really effective anti-bullying type of campaigns if we're weaving it and infusing it in everything that we do in all of our practices across our schools, K through 12.

477
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:12,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

478
00:52:13,373 --> 00:52:13,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

479
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:29,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in the HECAP meetings, we are essentially like, unless we have a time machine and 40 hours a week, we're gonna have to find ways to make all this stuff come together in a less than math time, science time.

480
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:31,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It just isn't, there's not enough time in the day.

481
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, thank you.

482
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:41,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Next section is faculty and staff professional development, which is, I believe in the law as well.

483
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:43,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember every bit of it.

484
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:50,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we'll want to update that with the current language in the law.

485
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is part of the section that was replaced.

486
00:52:53,729 --> 00:52:55,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Section D was very long.

487
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:58,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the one that was just whole cloth replaced.

488
00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Definition of bullying.

489
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:05,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting.

490
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:09,954
[SPEAKER_05]: This definition looks like it came from somewhere.

491
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:26,340
[SPEAKER_05]: one, two, three, four, five, there's six items here, but the definition of bullying in the law is different.

492
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:35,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So in an unusual situation, the law is actually briefer, but it does have the repeated use.

493
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:36,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are five

494
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:44,386
[SPEAKER_05]: categories versus repeated use and six categories.

495
00:53:44,406 --> 00:53:48,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I need more tabs.

496
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:51,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have enough tabs to see which ones.

497
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:54,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So number one is causes physical or emotional harm.

498
00:53:54,895 --> 00:54:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's number two is places the target responsible fear.

499
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:03,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was number two over here.

500
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:03,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

501
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:11,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is hostile, four is infringes on the rights, that's right, materially disrupts the education process.

502
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:13,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's number five.

503
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:17,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And number six.

504
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:24,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well.

505
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:25,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is so strange.

506
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,644
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't a school committee document saying this is part of our definition, but it's not part of the official.

507
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:34,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody copy from another place.

508
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:43,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, so I think it makes sense to have this stuff as an actual, I could go either way.

509
00:54:43,402 --> 00:54:45,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Retaliation is a whole section of its own.

510
00:54:45,924 --> 00:54:53,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously retaliating, to retaliate, you must do something, right?

511
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:58,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And those things are the things that are the other definitions of bullying.

512
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:05,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, retaliating, there's looking at somebody with angry eyes, that's not retaliating.

513
00:55:07,192 --> 00:55:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

514
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:14,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like having a definition of itself as part of the definition is kind of a problem.

515
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:20,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but anyway, so let's see.

516
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:25,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are just some more definitions that showed up in the middle of nowhere.

517
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,801
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these reminders to staff.

518
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think these belong in here either.

519
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:43,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Frankly, we might want to put a line in the policy saying that

520
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:52,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect that the staff will be trained, but this is like stay calm and neutral.

521
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:59,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Our policy is going to do bullying intervention training of staff right in the document.

522
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:04,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to me, like best practice, I assume has changed since this was written.

523
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And it feels very strange to me that it's here.

524
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:10,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Graham?

525
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:19,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think there's probably a section of the policy around what we expect of staff?

526
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that makes a lot of sense, but this is not that, and I don't think this belongs in here.

527
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:31,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this seems like a way to say, see, we did professional development.

528
00:56:31,832 --> 00:56:42,715
[SPEAKER_07]: We gave staff a list of do not do, and we've now checked that off, which is just not how we approach professional development at all.

529
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:48,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I just, I don't think this belongs here necessarily.

530
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:51,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's really more that's more implementation oriented activity.

531
00:56:52,656 --> 00:57:00,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I do think there's some, there's some section about staff responsibilities that, um, make sense.

532
00:57:04,081 --> 00:57:04,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

533
00:57:04,441 --> 00:57:04,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

534
00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:11,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see.

535
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:16,014
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the procedures.

536
00:57:16,714 --> 00:57:21,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the procedures should be known.

537
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:23,256
[SPEAKER_05]: People should be able to find the procedures.

538
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:42,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that the procedure being part of the policy is, again, it means that you can't change your procedures without coming to school committee and us having yet more meetings, which I know you all love these meetings as much as everybody else.

539
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:56,789
[SPEAKER_05]: your procedures like that just changed in January, I'm guessing that they may not even coincide with this current policy and having those in here at all makes no sense.

540
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:10,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's similar to the last section, a statement that the superintendent and the, you know, actually the responsibilities are different between the superintendent central office and the principals, but that, you know, a statement that the,

541
00:58:11,893 --> 00:58:17,895
[SPEAKER_05]: procedures will be developed and they will be, you know, common across schools as appropriate.

542
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:27,758
[SPEAKER_05]: But specifying the actual procedures to me is not what should be in here.

543
00:58:28,478 --> 00:58:28,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Marguerite?

544
00:58:30,759 --> 00:58:40,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I was reading these, like I actually feel like calling these procedures is maybe the problem.

545
00:58:41,037 --> 00:58:44,399
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think there are some policy components in here, right?

546
00:58:44,459 --> 00:58:51,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Like building administrators have in place a system for staff that facilitates reporting of incident of unacceptable student behavior towards another student.

547
00:58:52,405 --> 00:58:56,308
[SPEAKER_07]: All incidents are treated with the standard school disciplinary conflict resolution procedures.

548
00:58:56,348 --> 00:59:00,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to me, that doesn't read, that is not a procedure.

549
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,012
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a statement of policy.

550
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:05,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the building administrators must have a system in place, right?

551
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:10,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like what this probably needs to like,

552
00:59:10,554 --> 00:59:22,899
[SPEAKER_07]: be rewritten to morph into, I'm happy to take a crack at it, is what is our policy around receiving and witnessing reports?

553
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what is our policy around submitting a report?

554
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:28,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what is our policy around investigative procedures?

555
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:34,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I think if I think back over the last like a couple of, you know, six, eight months,

556
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:57,798
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of times I've heard from parents who have been involved in a bullying situation with their student that, for example, they were unhappy that somebody in the administration, and I heard different names associated with this kind of thing, did not call them.

557
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the question, and I think sometimes,

558
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:09,624
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because there's a process in place where there's like a progressive set of people involved.

559
01:00:09,824 --> 01:00:10,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

560
01:00:10,224 --> 01:00:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a good example of like setting the framework of like, who is involved in various things.

561
01:00:17,228 --> 01:00:18,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the building principal?

562
01:00:18,569 --> 01:00:23,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the super like the superintendent can't be involved in every incident of bullying?

563
01:00:24,232 --> 01:00:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Because by definition, she, I believe is some sort of like, sort of last arbiter of any sort of issues.

564
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:38,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, but what it's wildly muddy is like what, who is responsible for what?

565
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:41,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think like this section makes sense.

566
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:44,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be called procedures because these are not procedures.

567
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:58,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think there are policy statements in here that make a lot of sense to crystallize like the framework of the process, right?

568
01:00:58,292 --> 01:00:59,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Like reporting,

569
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:05,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Like receiving or witnessing, um, investigating resolution, et cetera.

570
01:01:05,549 --> 01:01:11,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's probably a more effective way to deal with this section of the document.

571
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:24,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, maybe that's next and this really can be deleted, but these, many of these are really policy statements and not actual procedures in my mind.

572
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:27,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

573
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had not read this section yet.

574
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:31,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I was stuck on the title.

575
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:46,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to put you down as somebody who might make a... And I'm going to write it in my notebook so that I remember to do it.

576
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

577
01:01:55,710 --> 01:02:00,111
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, uh, let's see administrative investigation procedures.

578
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:07,793
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks, um, this looks more like a procedure.

579
01:02:08,653 --> 01:02:09,974
[SPEAKER_04]: That one does a little bit.

580
01:02:10,014 --> 01:02:10,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

581
01:02:10,274 --> 01:02:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, the determinations, but having said that, like, I think it's reasonable for the policy to say things like the.

582
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:26,710
[SPEAKER_07]: The investigator will interview all students involved.

583
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that is a statement of policy.

584
01:02:30,194 --> 01:02:32,936
[SPEAKER_07]: You, in order to do this, you, you do have to talk to everybody.

585
01:02:32,976 --> 01:02:33,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

586
01:02:33,256 --> 01:02:38,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's written again, I think it's just a rewrite, a reframing of that.

587
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:50,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of this to make it about policy instead of about like exactly the way it's written here.

588
01:02:56,713 --> 01:02:58,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

589
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:05,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess the issue is like, just how detailed does this have to get?

590
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:10,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if Howard might've had something to say about this section.

591
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:17,527
[SPEAKER_04]: The response plan.

592
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:19,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We can come back on that in a minute.

593
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:26,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So- Can I ask a question about, is it number seven?

594
01:03:27,188 --> 01:03:35,893
[SPEAKER_07]: So some, you know, as the process unfolds, somebody makes a determination of whether bullying has occurred.

595
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:47,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it seems like what is implied is if, if bullying did occur, then these things would happen, right?

596
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,221
[SPEAKER_07]: This behavior remediation agreement, et cetera.

597
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:54,744
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it,

598
01:03:55,157 --> 01:04:03,780
[SPEAKER_04]: if I'm recalling correctly, there are some, uh, what's the right word?

599
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:08,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Some leveling of determination that happens, right?

600
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:12,504
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either bullying or it's conflict.

601
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:15,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's a handful of like terms, right.

602
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,106
[SPEAKER_07]: That, that become the final answer.

603
01:04:19,506 --> 01:04:19,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And,

604
01:04:22,676 --> 01:04:37,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there in this document somewhere, we haven't seen it yet, like what is expected if something is described as not bullying, but conflict?

605
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:45,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Like is conflict subject to some set of policy or not?

606
01:04:45,888 --> 01:04:48,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, if it's conflict, does it just go, like, is it just over?

607
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it just disappear out of the policy at that point?

608
01:04:51,725 --> 01:05:08,930
[SPEAKER_07]: is there some description that has to occur to make that, yeah, it's like lots of places where conflict is talked about, conflict resolution, that all makes sense, but like, if that's like a final disposition of a bullying report, what does it mean?

609
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:14,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it happens to your child, what can you expect?

610
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:15,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

611
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:17,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

612
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:21,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also, I just did do a search and there is nothing here about,

613
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:26,228
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a determination of conflict, what happens?

614
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:37,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there another disposition that is on the form that ultimately can be decided by the administrator?

615
01:05:37,757 --> 01:05:41,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out to the end here.

616
01:05:45,803 --> 01:05:50,087
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the incident form.

617
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Investigation form, what you can do.

618
01:06:04,686 --> 01:06:06,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Determination, sorry.

619
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have the repeated use.

620
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just the items you check off the things provided for your description.

621
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a final determination.

622
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:18,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Does not meet the standard of bullying.

623
01:06:18,692 --> 01:06:19,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullying has occurred.

624
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:21,423
[SPEAKER_05]: or criminal harassment.

625
01:06:21,704 --> 01:06:31,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So there appears to be, if it's not bullying, because it wasn't repeated use for instance, then it's just over.

626
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:34,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like there's no, then what?

627
01:06:38,325 --> 01:06:38,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Superintendent?

628
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so it in the event, I know we had talked about the flow chart before.

629
01:06:47,697 --> 01:06:59,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But if, for example, conflict was the determination, it wouldn't just be that oh there was a conflict and nothing else is done, depending on.

630
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:04,410
[SPEAKER_03]: what the situation involves, counseling is an option.

631
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:18,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So working with the families, communicating with parents, whether it's writing to the parents, giving them a letter, speaking with them, emailing them, Zooming them in this modern day.

632
01:07:19,114 --> 01:07:23,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are follow-up meetings that can happen with Councilors or teachers or

633
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,999
[SPEAKER_03]: other parties that are involved.

634
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So it isn't just kind of like, oh, it's a conflict and you never address it.

635
01:07:32,806 --> 01:07:39,935
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some, I would say, follow up, but it would depend on, again, what each situation is.

636
01:07:39,975 --> 01:07:42,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's on an individualized basis.

637
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:55,182
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think once a bullying investigation takes place, you're now on the administration's radar in a more substantive way.

638
01:07:55,602 --> 01:08:05,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And if conflict is determined, you also would be aware because there were students that aren't dealing with bullying at all and aren't having any conflicts.

639
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:17,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do feel that there would be additional supervision or additional scrutiny to just make sure that things are.

640
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:25,051
[SPEAKER_03]: staying calm the way you want them to be and not heading back in the direction of bullying.

641
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:31,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it would be an appropriate response to what the outcome is.

642
01:08:31,755 --> 01:08:43,824
[SPEAKER_03]: But for DESE purposes, when we're reporting to the state and it's meeting what the law states, they want that information documented.

643
01:08:45,685 --> 01:08:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: from a state perspective.

644
01:08:47,646 --> 01:09:00,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And for conflicts, restorative circles, working with Councilors, guidance Councilors, adjustment Councilors, school psychologists, the teacher, the administrators.

645
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:08,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of potential offshoots that the conflict could be addressed.

646
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want people to think that it's a conflict and you never follow up, never deal with it again.

647
01:09:18,338 --> 01:09:18,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

648
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:29,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's actually leads me to a question I think I'll have for Howard, our attorney again also is that, you know, this plan, this document is mandated.

649
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And so is the expectation that the scope is limited by that, or is that a starting point we can go out?

650
01:09:39,664 --> 01:09:41,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it would feel very,

651
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:57,017
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, disconnected to have everything that we want to do or say that's a little more than what the law requires if we had to like stick it in another document or in another policy.

652
01:09:57,297 --> 01:10:12,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't know if that's the case and we'll have to ask our attorney Greenspan when he's here, because I think having something that says that, you know, after that term, not determined to be bullying,

653
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:29,035
[SPEAKER_05]: it just can't look like, even though if that's not what's happening in practice, having it in black and white, that it looks like it just, that's the end, rejected, have a nice day, which is sort of what it reads, even though I don't think that that's what you all do.

654
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:29,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Graham?

655
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:37,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I routinely hear that, you know, even that,

656
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:45,483
[SPEAKER_07]: that you all are working with families, even when bullying has not been officially like found.

657
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:52,887
[SPEAKER_07]: But the form definitely doesn't imply that there's any requirement to do so.

658
01:10:52,907 --> 01:11:06,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's probably some change to the form so that it's clear, like if you're filling this out as a family member, like, and you're receiving it back, like,

659
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:09,920
[SPEAKER_07]: it sort of looks like a dead end if you say not bullying, right?

660
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: But I hear people talk about it's not bullying, it's conflict.

661
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:26,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like there's a standard set of language that you all are using that should be reflected in this form that is more than what is listed here, right?

662
01:11:27,143 --> 01:11:35,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the important thing is that we only are

663
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:48,684
[SPEAKER_07]: it sounds like we are only required to report to DESE the number of bullying incidents that are found to be true, which is what DESE is asking for, so that's fine.

664
01:11:52,566 --> 01:11:59,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And to that end, the definition of bullying, and this is one of those, I think, parent education points.

665
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:05,213
[SPEAKER_07]: The definition of bullying is very explicit in terms of

666
01:12:06,315 --> 01:12:29,759
[SPEAKER_07]: defines bullying for DESE, but that does not mean that we as a district aren't interested in other incidents that may be occurring that may not rise to that level, but are still serious matters and could get in the way of our students' education.

667
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:31,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So we take those things seriously too.

668
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,760
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there needs to be some,

669
01:12:35,137 --> 01:12:44,784
[SPEAKER_07]: way to describe that on the form and some way to describe those different levels, whatever they are.

670
01:12:44,844 --> 01:12:51,508
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need you all to tell us what they are in this policy so that both of those things are clear.

671
01:12:51,588 --> 01:13:02,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And because, because I think at times what I hear from people is no, no bullying was found and they still feel like something really egregious happened.

672
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:03,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And

673
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:11,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the takeaway is because no bullying was found, nobody cares about the thing that they care a lot about, right?

674
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:13,054
[SPEAKER_07]: That's happening to their student.

675
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:18,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that's the intent, but that's definitely the takeaway from families that I've talked to.

676
01:13:19,098 --> 01:13:25,941
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't, I think we have an opportunity in this policy to make that not quite be the takeaway in that same way.

677
01:13:27,062 --> 01:13:31,324
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I would say that I would like to see us add to this policy is what

678
01:13:34,023 --> 01:13:36,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, and maybe it's not this policy member.

679
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:59,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and it's our reporting policy, but what reporting do we want to see at the school committee level on an annual basis around the efficacy of our bullying policy, which would be more than just like, what do we report to Desi, but how many reports are there?

680
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,131
[SPEAKER_07]: How are, how are they being decided?

681
01:14:01,151 --> 01:14:02,511
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what school,

682
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:14,579
[SPEAKER_07]: what school are they coming from, whatever have you, like there has to be some set of reporting requirements that is associated with this policy that will help us know that the policy is being adhered to.

683
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:16,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we have to come up with that list as well.

684
01:14:20,743 --> 01:14:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

685
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:22,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Tucci.

686
01:14:24,248 --> 01:14:33,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, just in response to a member grams couple questions there in terms of maybe naming you know some of the action steps that some schools would be taking in response to say, for instance, conflict or bullying.

687
01:14:34,412 --> 01:14:40,595
[SPEAKER_01]: i'd say one of the go to things that we would you know more than likely try to work towards would be something along the lines of a restorative practices.

688
01:14:41,115 --> 01:14:52,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we've had a significant amount of professional development in this area with our staff members, in order to, you know how to facilitate these community circle discussions, however, you know weave in more restorative practices.

689
01:14:52,704 --> 01:14:57,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say from a school administrator standpoint that's nine times out of 10 how we are going to show a level of response.

690
01:14:58,288 --> 01:15:11,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the research says that's going to have a more lasting effect in terms of how to resolve conflicts and how to mentor and guide students and capture important teachable moments of how to handle future problems too as well from that standpoint.

691
01:15:11,118 --> 01:15:16,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of great lessons to be learned in those types of conversations that we oftentimes will facilitate.

692
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:20,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps as a checkbox, was this handled in a restorative fashion?

693
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,288
[SPEAKER_01]: or was this handled through a clinical aspect?

694
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it handled with the guidance Councilors or parent conferences?

695
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:37,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps there's some a checklist that we could kind of delineate and you know check off as we see fit and how we are able to document how maybe a conflict or bullying has been resolved and you know steps that we've taken too as well.

696
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a gram are you still up because you want to talk.

697
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

698
01:15:52,671 --> 01:15:52,851
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

699
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:54,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

700
01:15:55,191 --> 01:15:57,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent did you have your.

701
01:15:57,932 --> 01:16:05,073
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just think that there, there definitely was a lot of information or suggestions shared today.

702
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:12,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just was thinking where there are so many sections that either need to be moved to an appendix.

703
01:16:12,955 --> 01:16:31,608
[SPEAKER_03]: or completely deleted to condense this report that I just was saying I'm looking forward to the legal counsel so that we can actually get to a more substantive document and then really dig into it because

704
01:16:32,828 --> 01:16:42,555
[SPEAKER_03]: even though we're having a lot of rich discussion, some of what we've been discussing, maybe because of the law, it either has to be in or it should be out.

705
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:53,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm just thinking that like the next meeting that we have to make sure that we're able to have Attorney Greenspan

706
01:16:55,572 --> 01:17:07,778
[SPEAKER_03]: support us so that we can just work on a more condensed document that I'll be able to share with administrators and try to get feedback from them as a collective.

707
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:22,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just say, this is our collective feedback regarding the new and improved policy so that we'll be able to get through this entire document.

708
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, yes.

709
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:27,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

710
01:17:28,248 --> 01:17:54,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I wondered if I could make a suggestion in the interest of time, which is that one of us take the to-do to talk to our attorney and get answers to these questions of like, what must be in the document, what doesn't need to be in the document, et cetera, and make the update so that the next meeting we have, we're not looking at this same

711
01:17:55,121 --> 01:18:02,285
[SPEAKER_07]: document that we all agree is just full of stuff that we don't even particularly want or need.

712
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:13,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, ask our attorney to come so that whoever does this work and the attorney and our attorney can describe what they did.

713
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:19,196
[SPEAKER_07]: And then people have like something new to react to other than this.

714
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:22,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just don't want to have another meeting with all of these people.

715
01:18:23,963 --> 01:18:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at a document that we all know and agree has to change.

716
01:18:27,104 --> 01:18:36,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to make a motion that we ask somebody to do this on our behest so that we can move along.

717
01:18:43,403 --> 01:18:49,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just gonna say, I thought at first that it was gonna be just that and not have the attorney come to the meeting.

718
01:18:49,348 --> 01:18:56,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's also important to have the attorney come to the meeting also, not just for us, but for the edification of the community as well.

719
01:18:57,794 --> 01:19:05,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a good teaching opportunity, but I don't think we need to go through the weeds with the community.

720
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:12,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine with seconding the motion with the assurance that the attorney Greenspan will come to the meeting

721
01:19:13,185 --> 01:19:19,490
[SPEAKER_06]: review the material after having gone over it with a school committee member.

722
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So second.

723
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:24,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

724
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:26,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just agree.

725
01:19:27,076 --> 01:19:32,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna do that on my own, but I figured I would let us all decide as a group to do that.

726
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:38,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will, well, let me just take a vote on that.

727
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion is to have a member

728
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:48,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Condense the document in consultation with our school attorney.

729
01:19:48,693 --> 01:19:57,037
[SPEAKER_04]: He's probably not giving recommendations.

730
01:19:57,077 --> 01:19:58,457
[SPEAKER_05]: He's gonna tell us what we have to do.

731
01:19:58,537 --> 01:20:03,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So attorney's advice on required changes.

732
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:10,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And member Graham.

733
01:20:11,994 --> 01:20:12,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

734
01:20:14,195 --> 01:20:15,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

735
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:20,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

736
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:31,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to do that since I've already been in communication with Mr. Greenspan and I will absolutely ensure that he comes to our next meeting.

737
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:36,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because we would no matter what I end up

738
01:20:37,765 --> 01:20:43,810
[SPEAKER_05]: with after talking to him, either I will have a lot more questions or you all have a lot more questions to understand things.

739
01:20:45,471 --> 01:20:47,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will make sure he is at our next meeting.

740
01:20:48,753 --> 01:20:52,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, did you have another question?

741
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:54,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

742
01:20:55,038 --> 01:21:01,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just scroll down a little bit more so I can make sure we put notes on all the sections.

743
01:21:02,203 --> 01:21:04,145
[SPEAKER_05]: This section here, the response options, I think,

744
01:21:05,046 --> 01:21:05,586
[SPEAKER_05]: We should wait.

745
01:21:05,887 --> 01:21:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to have something to say on this.

746
01:21:07,848 --> 01:21:15,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking at some of this and I'm thinking it doesn't even jive with all of our other policies that we've passed.

747
01:21:15,273 --> 01:21:18,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So member Graham.

748
01:21:19,055 --> 01:21:22,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I will actually hold my question until you're done with this.

749
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had another question about next meeting.

750
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:26,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

751
01:21:29,202 --> 01:21:32,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a bunch more definitions.

752
01:21:32,464 --> 01:21:33,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's just do this last page here.

753
01:21:33,865 --> 01:21:34,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Notification.

754
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:41,986
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, well, I feel like we just did this once before already, but this is the notification process.

755
01:21:42,926 --> 01:21:53,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like this is going to, Attorney Greenspan's gonna have something to say about both that and especially documentation.

756
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:03,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody have anything specifically they want to say about these two sections?

757
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:13,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that is the problem resolution system.

758
01:22:13,347 --> 01:22:14,487
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on page 25.

759
01:22:16,268 --> 01:22:20,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we do only have this last page before we are done with the stuff we haven't covered.

760
01:22:21,452 --> 01:22:22,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Problem resolution system.

761
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:31,733
[SPEAKER_05]: this is just more of the law saying that we have to have one, but, oh, this is what if we're not doing it.

762
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:43,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm guessing that Attorney Greenstein is gonna tell us we have to have this in this policy, access to resources and services.

763
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:52,290
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pretty much real policy that says that the superintendent will have a list of resources and,

764
01:22:53,943 --> 01:22:58,225
[SPEAKER_05]: We had looked at a list of resources earlier in the previous meeting and decided that made no sense.

765
01:22:58,685 --> 01:23:00,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally all the links were broken except for one.

766
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:06,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it makes sense to have it in policy that that will be there.

767
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:09,470
[SPEAKER_05]: The title probably could use some work.

768
01:23:13,231 --> 01:23:18,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And then definitions and then the forms, which we're not gonna do the forms right now, cause we're out of time.

769
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 5.56.

770
01:23:22,476 --> 01:23:27,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have anything they want to say before we end a minute and a half early?

771
01:23:30,263 --> 01:23:39,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about when we might target our next meeting, because I know our April calendar is a little wacky.

772
01:23:39,632 --> 01:23:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wondered if we might target week of the 24th.

773
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:52,640
[SPEAKER_04]: because there is no school committee meeting that week.

774
01:23:53,781 --> 01:23:54,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

775
01:23:55,682 --> 01:24:03,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll aim for the 24th or the 25th since the members are here.

776
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:09,472
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a superintendent evaluation subcommittee meeting on the 24th.

777
01:24:09,532 --> 01:24:10,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the 25th would be better.

778
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:12,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

779
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:13,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

780
01:24:13,935 --> 01:24:15,116
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not in my calendar, of course.

781
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:18,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I am available on the 25th.

782
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:23,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 27th, Thursday, are you available?

783
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:31,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Preferably not, but I could make it work if necessary.

784
01:24:32,002 --> 01:24:34,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

785
01:24:36,344 --> 01:24:37,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

786
01:24:41,105 --> 01:24:42,186
[SPEAKER_04]: My calendar just froze.

787
01:24:42,246 --> 01:24:43,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you asking for April 27th?

788
01:24:43,346 --> 01:24:43,526
[SPEAKER_06]: 25th and 27th.

789
01:24:47,627 --> 01:24:48,387
[SPEAKER_05]: just as options.

790
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:54,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to check with the attorney Greenspan, of course, and the superintendent and everybody else, but.

791
01:24:59,693 --> 01:25:02,834
[SPEAKER_06]: The 25th looks- For some reason I, sorry, go ahead, Maurice.

792
01:25:03,415 --> 01:25:11,378
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just saying the 25th is more open for me at this point in time, but I'll make it work.

793
01:25:12,339 --> 01:25:13,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the 25th for me too.

794
01:25:13,559 --> 01:25:16,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some reason, I actually already have a policy subcommittee meeting

795
01:25:17,587 --> 01:25:19,168
[SPEAKER_06]: listed on the 25th for us.

796
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe that was a tentative date we had talked about.

797
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:26,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So just seeing the future play play.

798
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:26,613
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

799
01:25:26,893 --> 01:25:28,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, calendar.

800
01:25:28,655 --> 01:25:31,136
[SPEAKER_06]: My phone's listening.

801
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:32,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll target for the 25th.

802
01:25:33,598 --> 01:25:38,041
[SPEAKER_05]: After I talked to our attorney and I'll let you know there a motion to adjourn.

803
01:25:40,023 --> 01:25:40,723
