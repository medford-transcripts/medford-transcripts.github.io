1
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:09,833
Hey Medford Bites listeners, I'm really excited to present today's interview as it combines a few of my favorite things.

2
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:13,075
Coffee, the public library, and inclusivity.

3
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:17,879
I also want to give a quick birthday shout out to my son Cole who turns six on Friday.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,180
Happy birthday Cole.

5
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:25,005
If you want a birthday shout out on the podcast, you can email me at medfordpod at gmail.com.

6
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:26,747
Hope you enjoy the episode.

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,592
Hi, thank you both so much for meeting with me today.

8
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,795
If we could start just by introducing yourself so you could say your name and your pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

9
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:53,682
Hi, my name is Carol Nigro, and I'm the founder and CEO of Chapters Coffee Carts in Medford.

10
00:00:54,743 --> 00:01:01,127
We're a new nonprofit company that has come to the Medford area.

11
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:11,344
and we will be setting up a supported worksite in the new Medford Public Library in the near future.

12
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:30,155
Our mission of our company is to set up supportive worksites in local communities to provide an opportunity for all individuals, regardless of their race, color,

13
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:40,657
identity, skills, abilities, to have a safe place to work and earn a paycheck.

14
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:51,005
We started about two years ago with an idea of building a company such as this.

15
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:57,090
And two years later, we're happy to see it finally coming to life.

16
00:01:58,792 --> 00:01:59,072
Thank you.

17
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:04,186
I'm Heather McKinnon, pronouns she, her, hers.

18
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:09,828
And I am the president of the board of directors of Chapters Coffee Carts.

19
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:20,571
I have been on board for about a year and have been through a lot of the nitty gritty of getting us up and running.

20
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:29,353
I am the mom of a child with autism and other associated diagnoses.

21
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,112
Um, he is actually what brought me two chapters.

22
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:39,354
He was a student of miss Carol's and, um, pardon me.

23
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:51,138
We always say it's because of Henry that we managed to get together and accomplish this, um, great, great project and bring it to fruition.

24
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,600
Um, we're just absolutely delighted that we have.

25
00:02:56,868 --> 00:03:06,390
secured the space and the library and that this sort of love child idea has come to life and that we're doing it.

26
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,491
Great.

27
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:23,374
So before we dig into some of those things that you brought up, it's prompted a few questions for me, but I'm wondering if, so every episode I ask guests to answer the same question, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

28
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:41,971
Well, since COVID, we've been not eating out a lot, but we have had an opportunity to discover new takeout places in Medford.

29
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:47,815
And one of our favorites is Iris's restaurant.

30
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,356
I believe they're on Salem Street.

31
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:56,480
And we love their subs and their pasta dishes.

32
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,318
It was really a great find for us.

33
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:01,079
That's a new one.

34
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,380
I haven't heard about that one before.

35
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,941
Maybe it's not new, but it's new to me.

36
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,981
So thanks for sharing.

37
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:08,203
I like nappies.

38
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:14,866
It's in my old neighborhood where I have my first home here in Medford.

39
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:22,050
And so I like to get the lemon, basically pasta limon.

40
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,473
And it's just absolutely delicious with their homemade pasta.

41
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:31,204
Mappies is also on Salem Street too.

42
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:39,267
So we talked about chapters that, and it sounds like you're starting up at the library soon.

43
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:43,288
Carol, you mentioned, you called it a supported worksite.

44
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,608
Could you describe what that is?

45
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:45,709
What does that mean?

46
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:56,372
A supported worksite means that we will set up accommodations for our employees.

47
00:04:57,472 --> 00:05:16,066
So if an employee needs a checklist by the register to do the job, we'll put the checklist there and we'll train them how to do that checklist and how to incorporate it into their job skills.

48
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:25,573
We also have students from Medford High School who will be coming over to join us.

49
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:35,626
And they will be bringing support staff with them to kind of ease them into working in a public setting.

50
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,809
And again, they'll set up accommodations.

51
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:46,933
Some of our students may not be able to put on their aprons correctly.

52
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:54,297
So we can break that down step-by-step and show them, train them, teach them

53
00:05:54,679 --> 00:06:02,604
how to do that and hopefully become independent in all skills that they need to work in a cafe.

54
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:12,111
Sounds like breaking down some of those barriers that might prevent some folks from working in a less supportive environment.

55
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:19,115
And we're doing it on a more macro level as well, where we're,

56
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:32,270
providing job applications, job interviews, really trying to prep our future employees for entering into the broader workforce.

57
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:46,933
So we're trying to, we're really trying to ready our employees for a pipeline into the broader Medford system of businesses.

58
00:06:49,577 --> 00:07:01,487
I imagine that will or does already involve creating relationships with those businesses and kind of connecting, using this as a stepping stone for folks to get employed in other businesses.

59
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:16,820
Yes, we're hoping that through our connections, through relationship building, that we will be able to create a pipeline for our employees once they're ready to join the broader workforce.

60
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:25,746
What other hopes do you have for your employees or for this program?

61
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:44,342
We hope to give them an opportunity to earn a paycheck, to become more viable in the community, to feel like they are a part of the community.

62
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:47,365
And what better place than the library

63
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:50,516
such a central location for Medford.

64
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:58,498
It's just, it's a great, great location to be a part of the community.

65
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:09,760
And again, we hope to give them experience, confidence so that they can move further out into the community.

66
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:17,401
It's our hope that by creating relationships with other local Medford businesses,

67
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:42,500
with perhaps some of the food businesses, Dunkin' Donuts or some of the other food services in Medford Square, that they perhaps can see our employees working at the library and say, hey, we have a opening at our store.

68
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,022
Would you like to come work for us now that you have that experience?

69
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:58,756
And just to build upon that, you know, people with disabilities are entitled to be taxpaying citizens.

70
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:10,103
And we are hoping to enable that by giving opportunities that maybe aren't available to them to begin with.

71
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:17,608
So we want to support them in their training in order to lift them up and get them into the pipeline of the workforce.

72
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:18,443
Yeah.

73
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:22,564
I think it's so impressive what you've been able to accomplish during a pandemic.

74
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:33,246
And I wonder, um, Heather, you talked a little bit about a personal drive for this project and, um, Carol, I'm wondering like, what's, what kind of drove you to, to start this organization?

75
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:47,688
We about two years ago, we were, you know, just thinking my husband and I were thinking in our heads, wouldn't it be nice to have a coffee shop in Medford in

76
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:53,594
we could hire people with disabilities to come work for us.

77
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,875
And at that time, it was just a thought.

78
00:09:57,235 --> 00:10:07,719
And then we learned about this new public library coming to Medford and we discovered that there was going to be a cafe space in the library.

79
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,421
So the two kind of connected and we saw that opportunity and we just couldn't pass it by.

80
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,522
It was just such

81
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:28,197
a great chance to be able to find that location and to be able to work at the library.

82
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:34,242
So we created Chapters Coffee Carts specifically to be in this location.

83
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:40,106
And we've spent two years building the company.

84
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,809
It's taken a lot of work.

85
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,511
There were times

86
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:50,716
We almost stopped, but we forged ahead.

87
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:56,677
The pandemic naturally has caused everything to be delayed.

88
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,157
The library has been delayed opening.

89
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:05,199
We're finding now getting supplies for our own shop is a challenge.

90
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,140
But again, we just kept going.

91
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,140
We never gave up.

92
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,761
And COVID has definitely

93
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:34,720
put a twist into all of our planning, all of our timelines, getting licenses, getting certificates, everything's been delayed.

94
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,781
But we never gave up.

95
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:42,483
And here we are today, hiring our first employees.

96
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:45,418
That's really exciting.

97
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:50,161
I've heard that food service can be kind of a highly regulated business.

98
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:53,164
So I'm sure there's like, there were some sort of bureaucratic hoops to jump through.

99
00:11:53,184 --> 00:12:01,571
I wonder about like any sort of, I think a theme of this podcast tries to be about inclusivity, right?

100
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:05,213
And so, and certainly everywhere there are barriers to that.

101
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,056
And I wonder if there have been any barriers for you all

102
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:13,139
in terms of starting a business that is so intentionally inclusive.

103
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,624
I wonder about sort of the stigma that we can experience around people with disabilities, if any of that's come up for you.

104
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:24,486
Not really.

105
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:35,553
Once we introduced what we wanted to do to our Medford community, people came on board and were so excited and so supportive.

106
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,055
This is something that

107
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:40,490
Medford wants.

108
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:44,112
Their support has been unbelievable.

109
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:50,257
We have over 1,000 people now following us on Facebook.

110
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:58,484
So in that regard, I think as a community, it's something that everybody wanted.

111
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:07,771
But again, just working through all the legal aspects, all the rules and regulations, that was our

112
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,955
our hardest hurdles to overcome.

113
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:13,517
It's great to hear.

114
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:14,778
Heather, would you add anything?

115
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:29,672
I would just say that we put out a petition while we were getting close to the RFP process, the request for proposals for the actual library space.

116
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,121
And we have over 650 signatures there as well.

117
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:45,304
And of course, you get different people who sign on to a petition than you do who follow you on Facebook or Instagram or what have you.

118
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:57,948
So the overwhelming support of this community has been really outstanding and has made it really easy to forge forward even during the harder times.

119
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:00,893
It's great to hear.

120
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:08,579
Is there anything that like it would help for folks to know how they could continue to support chapters?

121
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:12,581
Are there anything that you need from the community in terms of support for the next sort of phase?

122
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:23,188
So what we are doing is we're actually putting together, one thing we're putting together is an Amazon wishlist for supplies and things like that.

123
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,992
Carol, you had, you were going to say something and I cut you off, I apologize.

124
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:34,219
that's okay as a nonprofit.

125
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:42,782
we're always trying to find donations or supplies.

126
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:46,483
Anything that can help.

127
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:59,207
With help support our coffee cart as a nonprofit it's not our intention to make money, the money that all the money that we do make is.

128
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,012
supplied back into the business.

129
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,854
Have you decided what type of coffee you're going to serve?

130
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:08,995
Yes.

131
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:14,818
Our coffee is such a great question, Danielle.

132
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:16,178
Thank you for asking.

133
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:27,343
Mr. Coffee Roasters from Medford has agreed to make our own special library blend for the library.

134
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:33,601
So we're excited to bring that to our coffee stand.

135
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:36,923
That's really exciting to me.

136
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:37,704
I love their coffee.

137
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:43,688
I was so sad when they stopped serving it at the actual shop, but now we can just go to the library and get it, it sounds like.

138
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:49,753
So I can put a link in our show notes to your Amazon wishlist, if that's helpful.

139
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:54,516
And I'm wondering if you have any idea of when you'll open in the library.

140
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:03,935
No specific date, but it most likely will be in April or right at the beginning of May.

141
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,096
So pretty soon.

142
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:05,956
Wow.

143
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:07,517
So exciting.

144
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:12,680
Is there anything else that you both, either of you want to make sure to mention about chapters?

145
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:26,868
We're just, we're very excited to be starting up and we can't wait for the Medford community to come out and come have a good cup of coffee and a great

146
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:31,632
experience visiting us in the new library.

147
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:41,644
We're really excited about bringing this to the community and to showcase our talent as well.

148
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:45,770
I think it's going to be a really wonderful, wonderful

149
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,811
opportunity for everyone.

150
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:51,593
I can't wait to see it and in person.

151
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:55,314
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me about it.

152
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,896
I can direct people to your Facebook page and to the wish list.

153
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,698
And hopefully we'll be able to see it all in person soon.

154
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:05,819
Thank you so much.

155
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:06,980
Thank you.

156
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,931
Thank you so much to Carol and Heather.
