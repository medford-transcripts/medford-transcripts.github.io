1
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Check mic one, two, check mic one, two.

2
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:29,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, we'll now have a meeting of the resident services and public engagement committee meeting.

3
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:48,991
[SPEAKER_05]: The sole topic that we will be discussing is amending and approving the budget survey, which will go out to guys guys, which will go out to collect feedback from residents on the budget process.

4
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:50,072
[SPEAKER_05]: We're.

5
00:04:53,773 --> 00:05:06,145
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I will not accept disruptions from Council President Bears, who I remind everybody is not a member of this committee, but seems to be intruding on our affairs.

6
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:09,428
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

7
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:19,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only feedback that I found that I believe was sent in that I saw was a, and I will just go ahead and share.

8
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:25,184
[SPEAKER_05]: share my screen really quickly just so everybody knows what I'm looking at.

9
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:40,170
[SPEAKER_05]: The only piece of feedback that I saw was this very nice infographic from Councilor Callahan, which basically shows a breakdown of Medford's budget in a wonderful pie chart.

10
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of it's education, insurance, pensions.

11
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:55,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like that does a great job of clarifying to residents what kind of budget we have.

12
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:56,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, Councilor Callahan.

13
00:05:58,586 --> 00:05:59,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I will, one moment.

14
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:01,748
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I do this again?

15
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:04,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

16
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:06,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on on this chart.

17
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:19,766
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really just for discussion only this is the 2024 numbers not the 2025 numbers, and mainly what I wanted to ask about before I run the 2025 numbers is I grade out and put in brackets, three items.

18
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:27,211
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want people to understand that those three items are not things that are under our control at all.

19
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:32,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is insurance, one is pensions, and one is bonds, bonds and interest.

20
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:38,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to, so we don't talk about it right this second, but like, so that you know, this is not like the final chart.

21
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,378
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really for us to discuss.

22
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:41,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

23
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:43,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

24
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:56,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I personally think that's that an updated version of this would be very useful to residents along with probably just the total numbers in there as well just for instead of percentages if that's possible to add like.

25
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:57,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to discuss the chart now?

26
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:57,976
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

27
00:06:58,776 --> 00:06:59,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to discuss the chart.

28
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh I'll let Councilor Lazzaro go first.

29
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing.

30
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:10,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five.

31
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:11,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

32
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

33
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:11,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

34
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:12,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

35
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:19,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I was only gonna say that a lot of it is gray, but then you clarified that for me.

36
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:19,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

37
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:26,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the chart is great to include and some clarifying explanation below.

38
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:27,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

39
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:37,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have another who would like to speak, who is not a member of this committee, but I suppose we can let him speak anyway.

40
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, yeah, whatever you guys want.

41
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's horrible.

42
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:52,101
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just, I really wasn't gonna say anything, but did a budget chart.

43
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, a budget chart you don't want me to talk about?

44
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like my thing.

45
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:05,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this is beyond like the software's capacity, maybe that you're using, I think it might be useful to do it.

46
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how like sometimes you see that pie chart and there's a little slice of the pie that's separated from the rest of the chart.

47
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be useful to lump

48
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:21,852
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance, pensions, bonds, and interest in like a little slice and be like this slice is fixed costs that are defined by the retirement board and the GIC and the bond.

49
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:29,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, bonds and interest I think is a little more nebulous because we do decide how much to borrow, it's just we don't control the repayment schedule.

50
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:41,227
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think a little chart being like here's all the stuff that's we're not actually spending on the departments other than health insurance and pensions and the city's retirement pension and

51
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love that little graphic where you have a slice of the pie.

52
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think it might be really visually, because I looked at this and I was like, why so much gray?

53
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:51,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard to see.

54
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:57,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was like, people aren't going to see that 21% of the budget is, 22% of the budget is this.

55
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a thought.

56
00:08:58,689 --> 00:08:59,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

57
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:00,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

58
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm liking that.

59
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:07,012
[SPEAKER_00]: My main question was, are those three the three that should be grayed out?

60
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that everybody agrees.

61
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:13,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, just the general fund.

62
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:19,698
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, those are the three that we just can't control them.

63
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're just unmovable.

64
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:34,969
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I might suggest is actually combine DPW, but then separate out the trash contract line item and gray that out.

65
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the reason DPW highway is so high is that's almost all the trash contract.

66
00:09:40,574 --> 00:10:01,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like, I think, 7 million of the 9 million for DPW highways the trash contract and that's also one of the key fixed cost drivers along with, especially in this year's budget, so that might be worth putting in the gray as well waste management trash contract, and then if you subtract that out and then combine all of DPW together, I think that would just be a little more reflective of

67
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,008
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially that it's schools, police, fire, DPW, and everything else.

68
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:17,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And DPW together, you mean including cemetery and... Yeah, but also that, and obviously leave out water, sewer, because it's enterprise, but half of the total DPW budget is the trash contract.

69
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

70
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:38,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just, the notes I took were that to put the fixed costs in a pop out of the pie chart to clarify and separate the trash line item from the DPW since that's a fixed cost.

71
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:43,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Also just like put in a text explanation of the chart, but I think that's obvious.

72
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:50,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And to put in the actual dollar amounts.

73
00:10:56,238 --> 00:11:02,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Council Gowan, do you think you'd be able to do that, do that on your own since.

74
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I can plan on doing that tomorrow.

75
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:05,584
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, cool.

76
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:07,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

77
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:19,253
[SPEAKER_05]: See the only other suggestions that I sort of had and I, I just, I essentially jotted down things that I would like to see from that I think are interesting pieces of information to have from residents

78
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:25,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not 100% sure if it's appropriate to put out in a municipal survey.

79
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:36,867
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would like to have a demographic question about household income in there, like household income brackets.

80
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is a question about

81
00:11:45,621 --> 00:12:04,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, these can be phrased differently but the intent of the question is what one time city projects do you think what one time projects you think the city ought to fund the idea behind that being, you know that we have free cash and some idea of how the residents would like to spend things like that would be useful.

82
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is more just things that I'm interested in.

83
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:28,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like, I was thinking it would be interesting to have some questions about whether or not residents favored the tax override but again I'm not that that's one that I've kind of been like going back and forth on whether we would put that out just some sort of opinion on that.

84
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:46,624
[SPEAKER_05]: The last question that I was interested in knowing about from residents, there's this sort of idea that in cities you can have low taxes or you can have

85
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:57,932
[SPEAKER_05]: more and stable city services or you can build up the density of the city in order to increase commercial revenue.

86
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:00,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So those sort of three factors right there.

87
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:08,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I wanted some kind of a question that would rank residents preferences on that.

88
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:15,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So do they think that lower taxes are more important than keeping density?

89
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:25,504
[SPEAKER_05]: than keeping density low, or do they think that city service, they'd be willing to pay more taxes in order to have more city services.

90
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:37,034
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just things I would be interested in getting information on generally, but obviously, these are just items that we can discuss.

91
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:40,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

92
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

93
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:46,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we can start.

94
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:51,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I did create a dropdown of that, as you suggested, of neighborhoods on the second page.

95
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:58,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that was the other thing that I put there.

96
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:03,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I based the neighborhoods off of what people responded last time.

97
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:10,925
[SPEAKER_03]: just how people kind of self-sorted into neighborhoods when it was an open question.

98
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:20,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if there are any more neighborhoods we want to add in since it's not kind of a formal thing here.

99
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:26,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I know like Brooks Estate, we could do that, but I think a lot of people, like some people identify as Brooks Estate.

100
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:33,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people identify as living like near the Brooks Estate, some people identify as living in West Bedford.

101
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:40,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that might be a little confusing, but then West Bedford's tough to sort out because I think they're like different parts of West Bedford.

102
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be useful to have a map.

103
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I was looking for maps.

104
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:52,535
[SPEAKER_03]: basically no maps, unless we make one but I think it's hard to do that drawing.

105
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

106
00:14:54,376 --> 00:15:04,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Council President, I don't know if you've seen the New York Times study of our article it's kind of a graphic of the neighborhoods of New York City, and they like they all everyone disagrees.

107
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:05,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of did a heat map.

108
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean obviously that's way beyond the level of resources that we have.

109
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:25,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think too, right, like you could make an argument, there's a lot of folks, and actually it goes back, it's funny, it's really old, or right now, people who call the east side of the city East Medford, like, and there's an in-between group that is more like calling it Wellington or Glenwood.

110
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:40,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, I've always been a fan of kind of offering a north, south, east, west square model, and then kind of putting in

111
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:54,405
[SPEAKER_02]: like in parentheses like East Medford, Wellington Glenwood, West Medford, maybe you could put Brooks Estate or something, South Medford, Hillside, it could be in parentheses, I don't know.

112
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But I agree that Brooks Estate as a standalone is a little confusing.

113
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is fine.

114
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,908
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was to make a suggestion, I would change it to like

115
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Wellington slash Glenwood slash East Medford or something like that.

116
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:17,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's I'm agnostic on that I really think we don't have a clear definition of where some neighborhoods and other neighborhoods start, I think, okay so another suggestion maybe would just be to have.

117
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:30,124
[SPEAKER_05]: a map of, like a map of Medford, just the borders, and then put the words Wellington, Glenwood, South Medford, just on the map, but not actually specify the borders.

118
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:36,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I've found that a lot of people don't have, actually can't place their location on a map.

119
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:37,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

120
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Visually, without being able to search their address.

121
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:40,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

122
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

123
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:40,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

124
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:48,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a toughie.

125
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wouldn't do Brooks Estate because I think that got me very confused to just be like the caretaker of the Brooks Estate.

126
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:54,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I think that's a great point.

127
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:58,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing that out there to be like, is that confusing?

128
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:01,874
[SPEAKER_03]: But evidently, it's probably confusing.

129
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:08,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the main edit I've made with regards to what you sent me.

130
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:15,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chair.

131
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:17,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you put your mic on?

132
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:29,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can't see that you actually turned it off.

133
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:34,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you send a link to is this a live form.

134
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:35,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is a live.

135
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:40,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you send a link to Councilor Callahan and myself, please.

136
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:45,215
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can see.

137
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:51,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't see the bottom half of the screen because of the closed captioning.

138
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:56,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't see that Lawrence Estates is on there, and I was going to say that you should add it, but it was on there already.

139
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,199
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.

140
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:57,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

141
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is what I used last time.

142
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I wish there was better stuff.

143
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it just costs money to get.

144
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:09,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another recommendation?

145
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:17,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for the most part, I took out some things I kind of adjusted some things, but do you have any ideas.

146
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:18,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

147
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:19,749
[SPEAKER_02]: he's met for.

148
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:20,349
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

149
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a really pretty divisive issue.

150
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,669
[SPEAKER_03]: People have pretty strong feelings about it.

151
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really up in arms about that one.

152
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:55,713
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

153
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to refresh this here.

154
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:03,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, to your point about income, I thought about that last time.

155
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:06,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's not worth asking.

156
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we should just really highlight that this is an anonymous form.

157
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:13,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

158
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just don't think that household income is like that non-standard of a question.

159
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a crazy question to ask.

160
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,167
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, like it is.

161
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:26,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

162
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good context, I guess.

163
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,131
[SPEAKER_03]: How should we define the bans then?

164
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah.

165
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:38,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And are other Councilors comfortable with that question?

166
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:43,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I hear any objections to

167
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,271
[SPEAKER_04]: speak now forever, hold your peace.

168
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:47,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

169
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:52,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

170
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:54,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe by like tax brackets.

171
00:19:55,455 --> 00:20:10,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, so the tax brackets are like zero to 11,000.

172
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,049
[SPEAKER_05]: 11,000, 47,000, 47, 100, 100 to 191, 191 to 243, 243 to 609, and then 609 or above.

173
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,970
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bears, I was just going to say for simplicity's sake, maybe zero to 50, 50 to 100.

174
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you don't have to do like the full 47, 47 to 100, but yeah.

175
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even maybe, yeah, I think it's fine.

176
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably more representative to get more accurate data, especially at the low end and the high end.

177
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:44,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

178
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:51,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess I think what might make sense is rounding to the next 10,000 or something, or 5,000, something like that.

179
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:54,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, maybe like 0 to 15,000, 15,000 to 50,000, 50,000 to 100, 100 to 200, 200 to 600, then 600 plus.

180
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,983
[SPEAKER_03]: We found we found how we're going to fund the city.

181
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just 200 plus.

182
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:24,285
[SPEAKER_05]: If y'all billion now.

183
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Bloomberg, what do you think about the Medford budget?

184
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:48,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, yeah, I'll leave it to your discretion whether to put the 600 plus in there or not, but I feel like those other brackets are fairly reasonable and they're at least based on some sort of a standard.

185
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

186
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:55,039
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just curious why one to 15, and not one to 25.

187
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Well the first income bracket is zero to 11,600.

188
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:06,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just figured but we could we could round it to 25 if you think that would be more appropriate.

189
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:12,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I mean, I guess we won't know until people answer the question but like we might get zero like 11,000 a year like who earns.

190
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:20,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know maybe so many people.

191
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:28,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I was present bears, I would just also know that the tax brackets are based on adjusted gross income, and then minus the standard deduction.

192
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:30,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to go at it that way.

193
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:38,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The standard deduction is what I only know is my taxes is 14 six so 11 plus 14 six is about 25.

194
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:42,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so people don't think about their.

195
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:48,268
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably thinking their salary, not their adjusted salary, minus the deduction, which is what the brackets are based off of.

196
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:48,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

197
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.

198
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to get too technical.

199
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:55,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

200
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:59,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So those numbers, whatever they were, sounded great to me.

201
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:04,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just make it look nicer.

202
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Do something around that range and to make it look nice.

203
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I think the right sorry.

204
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,163
[SPEAKER_03]: um I was i'm not completely sure.

205
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not completely sure about the override thing.

206
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you describe?

207
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.

208
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:48,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess with the override thing and the ranking of density versus high versus low taxes versus city services, the intent of that question is to try to form some kind of an inquiry where we could figure out what residents prefer to.

209
00:23:51,276 --> 00:24:01,570
[SPEAKER_05]: spend less in taxes, or would they prefer to get more services in the future because it is it is a trade off, and I earnest.

210
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:13,146
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, this is one where this is what we're just discussing so this is one of my one of my submissions and I'm trying to think of a way to phrase the question in a way that doesn't sound like weird on a municipal survey.

211
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:22,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would like to, I would like to get an idea because I hear a lot of residents around the city, particularly during the override campaign we're saying, you know,

212
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:35,277
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to we want to pay more to invest in our schools than their other residents who are saying well we, you know, we're fixed income households and we don't want to pay extra pay extra taxes.

213
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:43,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, the intent of the question is to try to figure out from respondents, what their sort of rankings.

214
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:47,295
[SPEAKER_05]: like what their priorities are, so to speak.

215
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:58,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I would worry in that sense that like it veers too much towards a poll, like, and this isn't, it's, it's just like a feedback, like input survey rather than like a poll.

216
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:07,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like, I guess my worry is like a question like that's so complex, because for some, some for a lot of voters, it's like sometimes yes, and sometimes no, right?

217
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:11,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's like really depends on what, what the spending is on.

218
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:11,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And

219
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:13,807
[SPEAKER_03]: what the tax increase looks like.

220
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:18,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the main reason I would kind of hesitate from putting it on there.

221
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:20,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just don't want to overload.

222
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:25,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to overload the survey with questions, too.

223
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm fine.

224
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:28,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The back of the chair broke.

225
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:29,792
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair's not OK.

226
00:25:29,872 --> 00:25:30,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm OK.

227
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:31,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

228
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

229
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:47,677
[SPEAKER_06]: You are on camera.

230
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:56,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

231
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:05,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I understand though that that is like, um, that could be a bit of an out of place question, but it was something I was personally curious about.

232
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:09,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we don't think that it's, it has a place in the survey, that's fine.

233
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:09,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

234
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:15,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was basically all I had.

235
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:16,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

236
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:23,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody else have any suggestions for this survey?

237
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:25,233
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't exactly a suggestion.

238
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:30,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more, I don't know what it is, comment, I guess.

239
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:33,519
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the easiest way for you to participate in the budget process?

240
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like emailing your elected official, calling your elected official, or attending city meetings.

241
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:51,563
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were a person who is not a city councilor, I would be like, wait, I have to email my city councilor?

242
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,884
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to tell, what am I going to say?

243
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:53,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you mean?

244
00:26:53,585 --> 00:27:04,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it doesn't, I'm not sure what we can say there, but those three options, like attending city meetings, that at least makes sense to me because like you attend,

245
00:27:04,713 --> 00:27:04,853
[SPEAKER_00]: right?

246
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:13,319
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get some information, but like emailing your elected official, like with no, it just seems like an impossible ask.

247
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:19,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe once we have word-based Councilors, it'll be more of a personal relationship going on there.

248
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a few years out.

249
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:32,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say maybe we can update that to include our newsletter because that's something we can say, like reading the city council's newsletter

250
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,010
[SPEAKER_01]: attending a listening session at the senior center that happens monthly.

251
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:51,256
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have like new things that people can do, or attending a listening session at the library about the budget, we could hold those, we could give updates in a forum like that.

252
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,152
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we could offer something like that could be something that we do more regularly.

253
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:04,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I think what would maybe make sense if you can you actually go to the last page.

254
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:09,116
[SPEAKER_03]: What might make sense then is for me to switch the orders.

255
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:11,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what you say.

256
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:12,177
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to answer.

257
00:28:22,427 --> 00:28:22,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

258
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:29,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, just a note there, some of these are checkboxes when they should be radio buttons.

259
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

260
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I noticed that too.

261
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:34,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Option five.

262
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:38,436
[SPEAKER_03]: What might make sense is switching the first and second question on this page.

263
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So asking people about how to keep up to date first.

264
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:45,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, because what I was thinking about participation is like,

265
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:57,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Like once you know, like what you want to say like what's the easiest way for it like to participate which I guess like would make sense, logically, the flip the order in a hazard.

266
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:00,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Also include URLs to these things Councilor Callahan.

267
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:07,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I was excited by Councilor Lazzaros suggestions here was just what I was.

268
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:11,076
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping bringing this up would come to you.

269
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:16,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea also from Councilor Tseng of like first say, how are you keeping up to date?

270
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:20,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I think we should use this to figure out what we should do.

271
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:33,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And so attending regular city council meetings in the chambers, then we could say, you know, if we offered, you know, a listening session in the community, would you attend?

272
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,947
[SPEAKER_00]: If we offered a Zoom,

273
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,428
[SPEAKER_00]: special budget Zoom meeting, would you attend?

274
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:47,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Not promising that we're going to do these things, but saying we're curious to see what interest there is.

275
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,572
[SPEAKER_00]: If we offered these things, would you attend?

276
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

277
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:59,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that phrasing of it.

278
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:01,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro?

279
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a question for Councilor Tseng and Councilor and Chair Leming, is the goal

280
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:28,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the goal here to take the temperature of who, which residents or how many residents are interested enough in the budget process to see like how much outreach we would need to be doing to appropriately match that interest?

281
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:41,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it to satisfy the budget asks of our residents for this budget this year and just immediately do that work for them based on a survey?

282
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there are two goals.

283
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:49,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a goal on the first page, and then the third page has a different goal.

284
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:56,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first page's goal is to provide a way for residents to just give feedback or input about the budget.

285
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:08,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think I caution people against using that as a representative sample of the city, because all of these surveys skew, richer and like,

286
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:12,229
[SPEAKER_03]: like to be honest, richer, whiter, more homeowning, right?

287
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's important for us to be careful on that front.

288
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:23,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But treat it like people emailing us, for example.

289
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:30,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last page, I think, is for us to collect a little bit more information about how we can best engage with the public.

290
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's going to be skewed towards people who already can.

291
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:38,087
[SPEAKER_03]: But I find that in the last survey,

292
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:46,902
[SPEAKER_03]: there was some good input about like other things we could do that kind of were like the early percolations of ideas that led to a lot of what we do now.

293
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

294
00:31:52,944 --> 00:32:07,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that it's, I think coming at it from both angles is definitely something we should keep doing because you're totally right that the people that are going to be already weighing in

295
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,112
[SPEAKER_01]: on the things that they want to see more of are the people that are the most engaged.

296
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:27,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I was on the city council, I only knew about what I knew about and I the like, I really needed to learn more about the current conditions of the city's budget before I would have been able to weigh in.

297
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think listening sessions and

298
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:39,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom meetings or any of that stuff could be really beneficial for a lot of people.

299
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:46,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that those are nice ways to help people get engaged if they're interested in it.

300
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:56,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I am all for using this survey, both to gather feedback and to essentially use it as an advertisement for the things that we do.

301
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

302
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:10,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So Councilor Tseng, what do you, with your schedule, what do you think is the, yeah, there's like a budget tab under.

303
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think is the timeline you'll be able to get this out by?

304
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:15,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty soon.

305
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:21,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Like once we have the new pie chart in, so after like tomorrow.

306
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:22,834
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, cool.

307
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:26,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just get all that and then start blasting it on social media.

308
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

309
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have,

310
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:34,594
[SPEAKER_03]: language for like asking for like the zoom listening session, kind of like what, what we can offer question.

311
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:39,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I was like fixing other stuff while we were talking about that.

312
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:43,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

313
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:43,937
Cool.

314
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

315
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

316
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:06,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I would want to do is rephrase what is the easiest way for you to participate in the budget process like that whole question.

317
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:28,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe to say, maybe to say instead, which of the following methods of participating in the budget process appeal to you?

318
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:30,383
[SPEAKER_01]: check all that apply.

319
00:34:30,644 --> 00:34:31,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound good?

320
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:37,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could say attending city meetings, calling elected officials, emailing elected officials, you could keep those.

321
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:55,355
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you could also say, attending a listening session with a city councilor, reading a monthly newsletter, attending a special zoom meeting about the budget.

322
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:01,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe like, what is your favorite way of participating?

323
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:06,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would you be most likely to participate in?

324
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:09,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would have to choose one?

325
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:15,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is a radio.

326
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:20,390
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be like a checkbox, like which methods would you most likely.

327
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could keep other.

328
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:25,012
[SPEAKER_01]: You could keep the if none of these apply, please feel free to tell us how we'll

329
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,270
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can make it easier for you to participate.

330
00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:28,491
[SPEAKER_01]: That could stay there.

331
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:37,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It should definitely be a checkbox thing, because I would rather read the city council newsletter than call my elected officials, since I only have to choose one.

332
00:35:37,873 --> 00:35:41,294
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

333
00:35:42,354 --> 00:35:44,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me email.

334
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:49,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you want to send me options to put in, that'd be great.

335
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:54,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote down some of what you had, but I didn't get to all of it.

336
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:18,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, I forgot, are you able to put URLs in the checkboxes?

337
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I can try and then see if it works.

338
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:21,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

339
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:24,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure you can in the description.

340
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:27,753
[SPEAKER_05]: In the description, I think you can.

341
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,254
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go back to the first page.

342
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:32,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in the questions themselves.

343
00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:39,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you can't because I just did it for something else, but I mean in the checkboxes, like the checkbox text itself.

344
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:48,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be good if you could have reading the city council's newsletter and then you have a link right there to the latest one.

345
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:51,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to refresh your page?

346
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:54,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put one in.

347
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:57,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go all the way.

348
00:36:59,089 --> 00:36:59,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that works.

349
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

350
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:06,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I can... Let me try one thing.

351
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:07,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what a beautiful newsletter.

352
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:22,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted the latest newsletter to the website yet.

353
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think I can do it without it looking ugly, but I think it's possible.

354
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:31,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you could.

355
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:34,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it doesn't have to be like that.

356
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:41,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You could highlight it, then click put URL in there, and then just say click here or something.

357
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:43,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to include the full URL.

358
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:48,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't think I can highlight and put a URL in.

359
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:52,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have edit access to this?

360
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:52,845
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

361
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:53,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

362
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,947
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we could discuss this later if you share edit access with me.

363
00:37:57,288 --> 00:37:57,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

364
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:01,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do that particular part.

365
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to thank you for the introductory preliminary budget meeting will be April 29, so two weeks from today.

366
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:20,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And then likely the two longer budget meetings will be the week of May, May 20th and 21st.

367
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:24,664
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have one on the 6th, but I don't think we'll have one of the week of the 13th.

368
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:43,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So Justin, if that affects your calendar at all, like I would guess that the 30th of April and the 6th of May will likely be some of the smaller departments and then the larger departments would be in later in May.

369
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:53,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a recommendation for when we might want to set a deadline, like a due date?

370
00:38:54,395 --> 00:39:01,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you want to leave it open to get as many comments as possible, I mean, it depends on the level of analysis this committee is planning to do.

371
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:12,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to have a meeting to review the results prior to, you know, if you set the deadline as we want to review this, you want to review, all right, May 7th is the next meeting of this committee.

372
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you wanted to review it at that meeting, then that would be your purview, yeah.

373
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:19,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

374
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:33,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends on how many responses we could get in that two-week time period.

375
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:37,338
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

376
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any other recommendations from councillors?

377
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin, are you good?

378
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:47,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

379
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:48,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

380
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:48,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

381
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:50,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone, for helping out.

382
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

383
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:51,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

384
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we will have public participation.

385
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:04,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I actually speak as a public?

386
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,171
[SPEAKER_03]: No, go for it.

387
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:05,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.

388
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:06,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Use this.

389
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:11,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always dreamed of leaving my council chair and then participating in public.

390
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:15,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be the strangest sight ever, but we can do it.

391
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any motions on the floor?

392
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:22,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second to that motion?

393
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, do we need a motion to distribute?

394
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:26,031
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

395
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:28,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we do.

396
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:28,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

397
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion to do we have a motion to approve and distribute and adjourn.

398
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:44,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Approve distribute can we ask, ask the city administration to put it out on their feeds I don't like, I don't think they will but

399
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,531
[SPEAKER_03]: worth asking.

400
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:52,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the motion is to approve the survey as discussed here.

401
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:59,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Request that the city administration use their channels to distribute it and adjourn.

402
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:01,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

403
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,160
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't make them.

404
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

405
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:06,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Tseng did.

406
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:07,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

407
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:10,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Councilors are seconded.

408
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:10,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

409
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:10,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr.

410
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,132
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have to we can just say, Oh, we're all here.

411
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:20,554
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I, what am I, it's it's late.

412
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,016
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had a lot of all those in favor.

413
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:23,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

414
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:24,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed.

415
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:25,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes meeting is adjourned.
