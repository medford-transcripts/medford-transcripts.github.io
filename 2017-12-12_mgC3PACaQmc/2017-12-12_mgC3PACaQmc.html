    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=528.192s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello, and thank you for reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=533.354s">It's</a>  lengthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=535.095s">This</a>  was something that the council <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=538.953s">was</a>  interested in doing back in August of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=541.916s">It</a>  went to committee, and I believe there's some questions whether they were answered or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=547.36s">It</a>  just stayed in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=548.341s">I</a>  brought it up again probably two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=551.123s">At</a>  that time, the council voted seven to nothing with regards to being interested in this and just needing legal language drafted by our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=562.452s">I</a>  followed up with the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=565.635s">Thankfully,</a>  in November, a decision was rendered. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=568.858s">I</a>  believe, I'm not sure if you received it before that, but I did forward it to everybody this morning, just in case. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=575.425s">It</a>  tells you what the prior requirements were under Mass General Law 48. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=578.969s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=586.856s">I</a>  know he's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=587.397s">I</a>  was just going to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=590.299s">Mass</a>  General Laws, Section 40, Chapter 40A, Section 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=597.645s">The</a>  fact of the matter with regards to just notifying abutters and abutters to abutters is something that has caused a great deal of <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=608.465s">put</a>  it plainly, heartache to those who live either across the street or very close to a potential, in this case, obviously we're doing it for mainly the developments that have been proposed and people finding out after the fact and being really upset <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=626.273s">The</a>  council gets frantic emails and phone calls, and we're left having to step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=631.695s">Obviously,</a>  the mayor's office probably gets the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=634.055s">We're</a>  going to and from, myself and a number of Councilors, going to and from OCD meetings and zoning meetings and conservation commission meetings to try to find out what's going on and how to give the residents the ability to be heard and to voice their concerns, questions, and get answers to specific questions that they do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=656.478s">So</a>  I think it's important and I know it's important to this whole council that we give more notice and that be done in multiple ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=663.362s">And</a>  what this proposed ordinance change does, that I'm thankful the solicitor drafted, is it provides notice to everybody, every owner within 400 feet, and it provides notice through mail and through our reverse 911 system, which is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=680.612s">was</a>  well deserving of the reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=683.434s">I</a>  think it's a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=686.097s">I</a>  know there are some questions that the Councilors may have, one being how enforceable this is, which our solicitor is here to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=694.503s">And</a>  also if there is a minor permit or a minor variance that needs to be had, is this necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=699.868s">And</a>  I think the answer is it's just necessary because <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=705.857s">We</a>  have had such a problem over the last couple years, and we need to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=711.88s">We</a>  need to change it for the people and the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=714.781s">This</a>  is one step of many that has to be taken, and I ask my colleagues to obviously get your questions answered, but to move forward and vote for approval for the first reading of this ordinance change.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=726.427s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=727.007s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, would you take any questions or any opinion?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=734.352s">I</a>  can give a supplement to what Councilor Lungo-Koehn just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=739.236s">I</a>  can give a brief supplement which might go to the core of some concerns or some questions about the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=746.563s">First,</a>  my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=750.366s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=751.327s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=752.308s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=757.737s">right</a>  now the way the state statute is, and you have to understand this in terms of state statute and local ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=766.023s">The</a>  state statute says in terms of notice that it should be given to <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=771.969s">abutters</a>  to a petitioner property or abutters to abutters or those who are across the street within a 300-foot ambit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=781.658s">Now</a>  that doesn't mean under the state statute that everybody within the 300-foot ambit would receive notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=788.083s">It</a>  just means abutters, abutters to abutters or those across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=793.553s">The</a>  resolution which is before you tonight would make it a requirement that locally, that in the city of Medford, notice be given to all persons, all persons, within a 400-foot ambit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=809.287s">Now,</a>  it's important to be cognizant of the fact that this is <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=816.972s">in</a>  excess of what's required by the state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=820.454s">Therefore,</a>  from a legal point of view, it would be considered directory only. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=825.337s">I</a>  want to give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=827.378s">The</a>  example would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=829.099s">If</a>  you were somebody who was, say, 300 feet away, but you were not an abutter or an abutter to an abutter or across the street, and you disagreed with a decision made by the board, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=844.36s">If</a>  you appealed it, the land court would not recognize the fact that you didn't get notice because you were 300 feet away, because that's a local rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=855.869s">So</a>  the land court would not say that that would give you the status of a party in interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=860.532s">You</a>  would have to establish that another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=863.154s">So</a>  when I say that the extra notice would be directory only, it doesn't mean that it wouldn't be given, because if you pass it as an ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=872.041s">then</a>  the board and commission would have to implement that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=876.324s">However,</a>  what I'm saying is that if somebody appealed the decision to the courts, that would not give them an additional leg to stand on or some status that they didn't otherwise have, because the state statute would control as being the only requirement that's compulsory. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=896.938s">So</a>  that's essentially what this ordinance would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=902.361s">And</a>  I have a little bit of data that I didn't have earlier this morning that I received from Mr. McDougal as to what this would mean from a substantive point of view by way of example, which I could give you if you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=915.968s">I'll</a>  just explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=920.693s">Dennis</a>  McDougall is the clerk for the administrator for the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=925.898s">And</a>  just as an example of what this would mean, there's one project, I won't give the address, it's not that important, but it was the change of a property from a single family to a two family. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=940.11s">It</a>  was before the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=942.532s">Under</a>  the state statute, which means abutters, abutters to abutters, or those across the street, there were 10 notices that were given out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=952.568s">If</a>  it were all owners within 300 feet, there were 234 people that would have to be notified because there was a condominium within that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=964.298s">If</a>  it were 400 feet, there'd be 357 people that would have had to have been notified because of that condominium. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=972.145s">Now,</a>  that's a very steep example. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=975.508s">There's</a>  another one where, on a matter before the ZBA, under the law, 18 people were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=983.039s">If</a>  the circle was drawn at 300 feet, 38 people would be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=986.864s">And</a>  at 400 feet, 60 people would be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=993.596s">So</a>  you can see how there's an additional notice requirement if you draw the circle further out and further out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1000.64s">That's</a>  how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1002.361s">So</a>  I give that to you simply for your information, but that's how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1008.784s">And</a>  the condominium example is steep because obviously there are many units in a condominium.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1014.968s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1017.994s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1018.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1020.657s">City</a>  solicitor Romley, if I may ask a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1022.999s">So</a>  is this enforceable as far as if we were to vote for this change? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1027.784s">I</a>  mean, is it enforceable as far as from, I mean, I guess you could always appeal it, but I mean, do we have any grounds to enforce this, I guess?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1036.452s">Yes,</a>  the enforceability would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1038.352s">It</a>  would be a requirement of the local board and commission to give that notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1042.834s">Actually,</a>  it would be the petitioner who's going forth to make sure that that notice is given. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1047.915s">For</a>  example, Mr. McDougal does the notices for the Board of Appeals, but the costs of that are borne by the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1055.236s">Is</a>  it enforceable? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1056.557s">So</a>  the answer to that question is split. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1059.057s">The</a>  first part of the answer is, if it's made an ordinance, then it is required that it be implemented by the local board or commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1067.6s">However,</a>  at the state level, if there was an appeal to the courts, it would be informational but not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1077.649s">So</a>  to the degree that you would think that the state would enforce it, it would not.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1085.835s">So</a>  I mean, I think it's interesting, and I think it's definitely, I definitely like notifying more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1091.178s">I</a>  think that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1093.039s">I</a>  just have, I guess, some concerns that there's like unintended consequences here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1096.782s">So</a>  for like the local person that's trying to make a home improvement, put a deck on the back of their house, and they need a variance, maybe they're too close to the property line. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1106.948s">So</a>  if they have that type of a situation, that person is going to have to notify <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1114.789s">everyone</a>  within that 400 foot?</p>
