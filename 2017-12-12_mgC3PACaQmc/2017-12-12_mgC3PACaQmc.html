    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=528.192s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello, and thank you for reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=533.354s">It's</a>  lengthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=535.095s">This</a>  was something that the council <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=538.953s">was</a>  interested in doing back in August of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=541.916s">It</a>  went to committee, and I believe there's some questions whether they were answered or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=547.36s">It</a>  just stayed in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=548.341s">I</a>  brought it up again probably two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=551.123s">At</a>  that time, the council voted seven to nothing with regards to being interested in this and just needing legal language drafted by our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=562.452s">I</a>  followed up with the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=565.635s">Thankfully,</a>  in November, a decision was rendered. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=568.858s">I</a>  believe, I'm not sure if you received it before that, but I did forward it to everybody this morning, just in case. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=575.425s">It</a>  tells you what the prior requirements were under Mass General Law 48. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=578.969s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=586.856s">I</a>  know he's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=587.397s">I</a>  was just going to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=590.299s">Mass</a>  General Laws, Section 40, Chapter 40A, Section 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=597.645s">The</a>  fact of the matter with regards to just notifying abutters and abutters to abutters is something that has caused a great deal of <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=608.465s">put</a>  it plainly, heartache to those who live either across the street or very close to a potential, in this case, obviously we're doing it for mainly the developments that have been proposed and people finding out after the fact and being really upset <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=626.273s">The</a>  council gets frantic emails and phone calls, and we're left having to step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=631.695s">Obviously,</a>  the mayor's office probably gets the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=634.055s">We're</a>  going to and from, myself and a number of Councilors, going to and from OCD meetings and zoning meetings and conservation commission meetings to try to find out what's going on and how to give the residents the ability to be heard and to voice their concerns, questions, and get answers to specific questions that they do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=656.478s">So</a>  I think it's important and I know it's important to this whole council that we give more notice and that be done in multiple ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=663.362s">And</a>  what this proposed ordinance change does, that I'm thankful the solicitor drafted, is it provides notice to everybody, every owner within 400 feet, and it provides notice through mail and through our reverse 911 system, which is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=680.612s">was</a>  well deserving of the reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=683.434s">I</a>  think it's a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=686.097s">I</a>  know there are some questions that the Councilors may have, one being how enforceable this is, which our solicitor is here to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=694.503s">And</a>  also if there is a minor permit or a minor variance that needs to be had, is this necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=699.868s">And</a>  I think the answer is it's just necessary because <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=705.857s">We</a>  have had such a problem over the last couple years, and we need to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=711.88s">We</a>  need to change it for the people and the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=714.781s">This</a>  is one step of many that has to be taken, and I ask my colleagues to obviously get your questions answered, but to move forward and vote for approval for the first reading of this ordinance change.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=726.427s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=727.007s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, would you take any questions or any opinion?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=734.352s">I</a>  can give a supplement to what Councilor Lungo-Koehn just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=739.236s">I</a>  can give a brief supplement which might go to the core of some concerns or some questions about the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=746.563s">First,</a>  my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=750.366s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=751.327s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=752.308s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=757.737s">right</a>  now the way the state statute is, and you have to understand this in terms of state statute and local ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=766.023s">The</a>  state statute says in terms of notice that it should be given to <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=771.969s">abutters</a>  to a petitioner property or abutters to abutters or those who are across the street within a 300-foot ambit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=781.658s">Now</a>  that doesn't mean under the state statute that everybody within the 300-foot ambit would receive notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=788.083s">It</a>  just means abutters, abutters to abutters or those across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=793.553s">The</a>  resolution which is before you tonight would make it a requirement that locally, that in the city of Medford, notice be given to all persons, all persons, within a 400-foot ambit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=809.287s">Now,</a>  it's important to be cognizant of the fact that this is <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=816.972s">in</a>  excess of what's required by the state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=820.454s">Therefore,</a>  from a legal point of view, it would be considered directory only. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=825.337s">I</a>  want to give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=827.378s">The</a>  example would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=829.099s">If</a>  you were somebody who was, say, 300 feet away, but you were not an abutter or an abutter to an abutter or across the street, and you disagreed with a decision made by the board, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=844.36s">If</a>  you appealed it, the land court would not recognize the fact that you didn't get notice because you were 300 feet away, because that's a local rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=855.869s">So</a>  the land court would not say that that would give you the status of a party in interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=860.532s">You</a>  would have to establish that another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=863.154s">So</a>  when I say that the extra notice would be directory only, it doesn't mean that it wouldn't be given, because if you pass it as an ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=872.041s">then</a>  the board and commission would have to implement that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=876.324s">However,</a>  what I'm saying is that if somebody appealed the decision to the courts, that would not give them an additional leg to stand on or some status that they didn't otherwise have, because the state statute would control as being the only requirement that's compulsory. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=896.938s">So</a>  that's essentially what this ordinance would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=902.361s">And</a>  I have a little bit of data that I didn't have earlier this morning that I received from Mr. McDougal as to what this would mean from a substantive point of view by way of example, which I could give you if you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=915.968s">I'll</a>  just explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=920.693s">Dennis</a>  McDougall is the clerk for the administrator for the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=925.898s">And</a>  just as an example of what this would mean, there's one project, I won't give the address, it's not that important, but it was the change of a property from a single family to a two family. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=940.11s">It</a>  was before the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=942.532s">Under</a>  the state statute, which means abutters, abutters to abutters, or those across the street, there were 10 notices that were given out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=952.568s">If</a>  it were all owners within 300 feet, there were 234 people that would have to be notified because there was a condominium within that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=964.298s">If</a>  it were 400 feet, there'd be 357 people that would have had to have been notified because of that condominium. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=972.145s">Now,</a>  that's a very steep example. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=975.508s">There's</a>  another one where, on a matter before the ZBA, under the law, 18 people were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=983.039s">If</a>  the circle was drawn at 300 feet, 38 people would be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=986.864s">And</a>  at 400 feet, 60 people would be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=993.596s">So</a>  you can see how there's an additional notice requirement if you draw the circle further out and further out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1000.64s">That's</a>  how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1002.361s">So</a>  I give that to you simply for your information, but that's how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1008.784s">And</a>  the condominium example is steep because obviously there are many units in a condominium.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1014.968s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1017.994s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1018.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1020.657s">City</a>  solicitor Romley, if I may ask a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1022.999s">So</a>  is this enforceable as far as if we were to vote for this change? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1027.784s">I</a>  mean, is it enforceable as far as from, I mean, I guess you could always appeal it, but I mean, do we have any grounds to enforce this, I guess?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1036.452s">Yes,</a>  the enforceability would be this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1038.352s">It</a>  would be a requirement of the local board and commission to give that notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1042.834s">Actually,</a>  it would be the petitioner who's going forth to make sure that that notice is given. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1047.915s">For</a>  example, Mr. McDougal does the notices for the Board of Appeals, but the costs of that are borne by the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1055.236s">Is</a>  it enforceable? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1056.557s">So</a>  the answer to that question is split. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1059.057s">The</a>  first part of the answer is, if it's made an ordinance, then it is required that it be implemented by the local board or commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1067.6s">However,</a>  at the state level, if there was an appeal to the courts, it would be informational but not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1077.649s">So</a>  to the degree that you would think that the state would enforce it, it would not.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1085.835s">So</a>  I mean, I think it's interesting, and I think it's definitely, I definitely like notifying more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1091.178s">I</a>  think that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1093.039s">I</a>  just have, I guess, some concerns that there's like unintended consequences here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1096.782s">So</a>  for like the local person that's trying to make a home improvement, put a deck on the back of their house, and they need a variance, maybe they're too close to the property line. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1106.948s">So</a>  if they have that type of a situation, that person is going to have to notify <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1114.789s">everyone</a>  within that 400 foot?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1118.571s">Yes,</a>  if this ordinance were passed in its present form, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1121.832s">And</a>  they would actually pay the cost of that as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1124.353s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know what the cost would be of something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1127.015s">But</a>  they're responsible for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1128.795s">Ultimately,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1129.556s">It's</a>  done by Mr. McDougal, but the notices, the labels, I think the postage, along with the petition fee, advertisement, that's borne by the petitioner.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1144.221s">That's</a>  my concern, because I definitely like the idea of making sure that we notify more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1149.005s">But</a>  I guess I'm worried about once you get into the neighborhoods, if you're doing something to increase the value of your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1157.353s">Maybe</a>  you're putting on a deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1158.814s">You're</a>  doing some sort of home improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1161.597s">And</a>  it's not that major. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1166.62s">There's</a>  a concern, I think, that you're adding a cost to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1171.863s">And</a>  there's just a little bit of a concern there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1175.225s">So</a>  I think for big developments, this is something that's definitely needed and warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1183.089s">I</a>  mean, I think it's definitely something that would benefit the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1187.352s">But</a>  for someone that's doing a small type of home improvement, I have some concerns there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1197.561s">my</a>  colleague wouldn't mind if we could amend this maybe just to projects that have to go through site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1202.585s">And</a>  I'm not sure if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1204.027s">Maybe</a>  you could weigh in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1205.488s">But</a>  I'm just thinking that if we're going to have local, my concern is that if we're going to have local neighbors that want to make an improvement and add cost to that and add more red tape to that, I think that's a little bit of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1217.919s">So</a>  I'm just thinking if maybe we could have this applied to any type of <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1223.063s">project</a>  that requires site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1224.984s">Maybe</a>  that's the direction we should head in, and that's an amendment to the resolution that I would offer if my colleague is willing to accept that.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1232.365s">Well,</a>  I can answer you this way, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1235.146s">First,</a>  a site plan review project is one which has a greater magnitude towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1240.267s">I</a>  think it's six or more units for site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1244.748s">Of</a>  the list that I had for Mr. McDougall today, which again is just for my <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1250.029s">information.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1251.01s">There</a>  were two projects that he has here that were subject to site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1256.012s">And</a>  the first one, under the present law, or under the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, under the first one, there were 20 abutters, or abutters to abutters, et cetera, who were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1268.678s">If</a>  it went to 300 feet, there would have been 71. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1272.72s">If</a>  it went to 400 feet, there would have been 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1277.093s">In</a>  the next project that was subject to site plan review, under the law and the state statute in its present incarnation, the number of people notified was 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1288.659s">If</a>  that line were drawn out 300 feet, it would have been 58 people notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1294.102s">And</a>  if the line were drawn out to 400 feet, it would be 99 people who would have been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1299.965s">So</a>  there you can see, and of course that all depends upon the location, because as I said earlier, if there's a condo next door, that number's gonna go up exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1309.568s">So</a>  site plan review is only applicable, my recollection is, to projects which call for six units or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1319.591s">But</a>  just generally speaking.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1320.852s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1321.692s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1322.753s">That's</a>  just my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1323.594s">I</a>  mean, I think it's a great, I mean, I like the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1326.376s">I</a>  think it's, I think we should be reaching out to talk to more, to actually communicate with more people in the neighborhood when there's a project or development that's going to impact them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1337.245s">So</a>  more communication is definitely better. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1339.507s">I</a>  just wonder if, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1341.829s">if</a>  there's some unintended consequences to this where we're gonna impact them financially and make a simple home improvement into a larger type of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1352.797s">So</a>  that's why I offer the resolution if you're willing that maybe we have this apply just to something that requires site plan review.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1364.825s">That's</a>  up to Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1366.806s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1368.247s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1371.893s">I</a>  definitely think that that is something I'd like to hear the rest of my colleagues discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1377.358s">I</a>  don't see the harm in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1379.26s">I'm</a>  not putting this forward to hurt the individual homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1383.985s">I</a>  think you can look at it two ways, which is definitely, that is an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1388.249s">I</a>  don't think it's a huge financial burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1392.934s">100</a>  people need to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1394.454s">It's</a>  going to be $49 in postage. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1397.516s">But</a>  six or more units is something that definitely can be talked about tonight and discussed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1404.135s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1406.876s">I'm</a>  done for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1407.776s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1408.016s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1410.176s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1411.356s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1415.877s">And</a>  to this solicitor, I know John already brought this up, and I don't want to be redundant, but I actually had two phone calls today that residents were running to the building's office today to try to secure permits and possibly variances because they were looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1430.96s">building</a>  up, because they're nervous, the same questions you had, probably I've been getting, and I think that's my concern, is that the home improvement jobs, the home improvement variances that people will be looking for, because, you know, facts are facts, the costs of housing now have gone up, so people want to take advantage of that while they can, and try to <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1460.164s">make</a>  their homes the best they can at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1462.826s">So</a>  looking at the fear of someone questioning it down the line or that don't belong, that don't live in that radius and that these people that they've grown up and the neighbors that they know that they might have talked to and let them know that this is what's happening, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1482.459s">They'll</a>  be going to the appeal board and they'll be looking for something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1486.76s">They</a>  are just nervous that if it goes further out where people might not want a two family or a second floor built or that they would question out of fear that they wouldn't get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1499.984s">This</a>  is one of their biggest concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1502.965s">So</a>  I like the idea that, you know, the idea that putting it for the six or more units, I think that that's probably our biggest fear that we've heard here is that, the fear that things are happening so fast, so quick, and notifying people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1518.657s">But</a>  my question is ultimately, it can't be, the ordinance can't be written, excuse me, I'm getting off track, but the question is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1530.913s">If</a>  this, what we have in line right now, if this is adopted, it still goes to the state level, and the state level, it's just something that could be heard, but won't be, can't be used as judgment.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1545.058s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1547.279s">It's</a>  a valid concern, and it gets a little bit confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1552.062s">But</a>  it runs this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1554.123s">The</a>  state statute is the core. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1556.765s">It</a>  is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1558.186s">It</a>  is compulsory. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1559.767s">And</a>  the state statute says that notice must be given to abutters or abutters to abutters, and those across the street, within 300 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1569.194s">That's</a>  the core. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1570.635s">That</a>  doesn't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1571.995s">And</a>  that's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1573.737s">This</a>  would be additional requirement, a local option. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1578.64s">Not</a>  local option. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1579.28s">That's</a>  not the way to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1580.141s">Local</a>  requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1582.142s">And,</a>  if it's passed by the council, ultimately, then the Board of Appeals would have to implement that notice requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1590.527s">Now,</a>  as I said at the beginning, if Mr. Jones or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1593.689s">Smith</a>  is not happy with the approval of a variance or whatever it is, and then appeals to the court, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1602.368s">If</a>  they're not in that core area, they would not be considered to be a party in interest because of their location. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1609.671s">There</a>  may be some other reasons that they could have standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1612.011s">I'm</a>  not saying that they wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1613.712s">But</a>  their location, if they're outside of that core area, would not give them proper standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1620.234s">What</a>  it would do is mean that from a local point of view, here in Medford, they would get some notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1627.097s">Now</a>  here's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1628.505s">There's</a>  nothing bad in anything that anybody just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1631.646s">Because</a>  here's, I don't want to sound like Pollyanna, but I've been part of municipal government for 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1638.628s">And</a>  one of the common threads that goes through as a criticism is, I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1645.751s">When</a>  did that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1648.792s">Who</a>  did that? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1650.661s">And</a>  when that occurs, what you have is a lessening of the quantum of trust that a resident has in the local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1660.249s">This</a>  measure will address that in a fashion by giving greater notice, even if it doesn't give legal teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1671.216s">The</a>  benefit of fine-tuning it is that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1675.477s">Jones</a>  or Mr. Smith, who wants to extend a bedroom for maybe an elderly member of their family, won't have to go through hoops if this only applies to larger projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1689.661s">And</a>  generally speaking, I don't hear, in my 34 years, I don't hear, I didn't know about that when we're talking about a neighbor increasing the size of their house a little bit for a family reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1702.353s">When</a>  you hear it, you already know the projects that you hear it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1705.756s">They</a>  don't have to say what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1708.519s">But</a>  they're the larger projects, the ones that have multiple units, the ones that have traffic impact, which, by the way, is an element or an issue that has to be reviewed in site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1719.432s">Traffic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1720.753s">And</a>  those are the ones where people say, I didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1724.894s">And</a>  so there's where, if there is any fine-tuning, that may be a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1729.616s">The</a>  other thing is, since this is an amendment to the zoning ordinance, then this would have to go, assuming that it left the launching pad here at the city council, it would have to go to the planning board for a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1745.564s">So</a>  the input of others could be received, too, and then the planning board makes its recommendation back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1751.987s">Well,</a>  that's a pretty good thing to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1754.342s">public</a>  input on whether or not to extend public notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1758.968s">Seems</a>  to me that that fits together like Legos. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1762.283s">So</a>  that's what I'd say.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1764.165s">Thank</a>  you very much for my trivial response, but I think, again, I know that my council colleague put together a very thoughtful ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1773.732s">I</a>  think that the concerns that Councilor Falco brought up with the site plan review, I would definitely support this if, because I think we all sit here and understand the phone calls we get with the bigger developments that come out that are affecting the zoning that's affecting our <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1791.566s">our</a>  community so I will support this wholeheartedly if we can that I agree with what council Falco stated with <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1803.745s">site</a>  plan reviews, anything over six units, that this would be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1809.507s">So</a>  I think that wouldn't affect the phone calls I got that were questioning and nervousness and the fear of our neighbors that how this could affect a homeowner who was looking to improve their home and their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1825.252s">So</a>  I hope that helps with the other Brianna, but thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1830.333s">The</a>  clerk has informed me that the cost is approximately a dollar to send out a mailing to all the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1837.217s">And</a>  then it's another dollar because he has to also mail them the decision that is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1842.079s">So</a>  it will be about two dollars per household. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1845.321s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1846.462s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1850.505s">City</a>  Solicitor Rumley has framed this in a pretty basic and outright fashion, that the steps that we need to go through, if we decide to adopt the zoning amendment this evening, that it goes to the Community Development Board for a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1866.752s">So,</a>  in looking at the action that we're taking here as a body tonight, I think we're torn. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1871.414s">I</a>  mean, we've all sat here and we've all talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1874.035s">requirements</a>  for notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1875.016s">We</a>  want more people to know what's going on in their neighborhood, and we don't want to hurt people at the same time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1879.318s">So</a>  here we have a proposal that would increase the notification ramifications by about 100 yards, and then also add everybody that lives in that jurisdiction to the notification requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1891.286s">I</a>  think it might be in our best interest to send the paper as authored to the Community Development Board for their input at a public hearing, get the information and the input that they can secure, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1902.353s">And</a>  when they bring it back to us, then we'll be in a better position to make a determination as to what language changes we would like to see made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1908.474s">I</a>  certainly would agree that I think projects requiring site plan review only would be something that I'd be very supportive of, Mr. President, but I don't think that that's going to be something that's going to be a hindrance for me this evening for supporting this measure and sending it to the Community Development Board for a public hearing and for their input.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1923.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1925.158s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1928.818s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1929.859s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1936.428s">I'm</a>  generally in favor of this expanded notification, but if I could, Mr. President, through the chair to the solicitor, ask a question regarding the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1948.061s">My</a>  question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1950.335s">It</a>  was stated by Councilor Lungo-Koehn that, and I'm sure this is true without a doubt, that we're not seeking to harm the homeowner in this ordinance, but if we put a stipulation on the expansion of the notification to those <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1977.793s">projects</a>  that require site plan review, i.e., a way of getting at the bigger projects, is that a signaling that we're aiming to harm someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1987.721s">Could</a>  it be read as that? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1989.103s">So</a>  are we targeting someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1990.684s">Are</a>  we being prejudicial? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1992.525s">So</a>  what applies to one thing, should it apply to all? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1996.389s">That's</a>  just my question.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=1999.611s">I</a>  get the question, and I'd say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2002.296s">First</a>  of all, the legislative discretion of a body like the City Council is indeed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2008.223s">If</a>  you exercise that discretion in a reasonable way, based upon considerations before you, it would not be arbitrary, nor would it be discriminatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2017.933s">In</a>  addition, the greater concern of the public is always the larger projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2022.697s">It's</a>  not the smaller ones that have been alluded to here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2026.68s">So</a>  indeed, if a large developer said, I'm being prejudiced by having to notice this many people, I would say, so what? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2036.587s">Take</a>  your shot, bring us to court, and let's see what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2041.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2042.671s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2043.532s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2045.939s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2046.94s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2048.461s">I</a>  think we've heard from a number of councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2051.903s">It</a>  looks like there potentially is a vote to pass the first reading tonight, but as long as there's limited to site plan review projects or greater, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2062.95s">Just</a>  plain devil's advocate, my question would be to the solicitor is <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2067.488s">Because</a>  I understand it if it has to do with a deck or expanding a home so you can have a couple more feet in your bedroom or a walk-in closet, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2075.834s">And</a>  those are the people that, obviously, we don't want to have to bear the burden of hundreds and hundreds of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2080.898s">But</a>  what about a single-family home that the owner wants to turn it into a three-family and it's a two-family district or it's a single-family district? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2091.586s">Now,</a>  I'm playing devil's advocate because if that was in my neighborhood and it was down the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2096.149s">in</a>  a single-family district and a homeowner wanted to put up a three-family, I'd want to know.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2102.413s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2102.694s">And</a>  I don't think necessarily that you're playing devil's advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2105.596s">What</a>  you're doing is drawing the line at a different place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2108.938s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2109.458s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2110.179s">And</a>  how could we do that?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2112.92s">Well,</a>  I think that the best thing is to let the planning board have some people in to hear their opinions so they can make appropriate recommendations back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2121.228s">So</a>  because while the line suggested tonight by a prospective amendment has been projects that would require site plan review, and you just pointed out a larger project than a small addition to a house that nonetheless may impact a particular neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2138.023s">That</a>  is drawing the line at a different place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2140.885s">And</a>  I think the best way to decide where to draw that line, and I don't say that either one of those ideas are wrong, even the initial idea is not wrong, it's a matter of judgment and choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2151.332s">So</a>  the question is where is that line drawn? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2153.314s">And</a>  that really is something that would be interesting to receive in the recommendation from the planning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2159.758s">So</a>  I understand your point, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2161.92s">I</a>  think you're drawing the boundary line in a little different place. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2165.242s">There's</a>  nothing wrong with that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2169.501s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2171.442s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2172.643s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2175.524s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, in the letter dated November 8th regarding this paper 17-731, your response to the mayor on page 2, the last paragraph, it states that failure to comply with the ordinance requirements would not invalidate the approval of a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2194.994s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2196.335s">And</a>  my question to you would be, if this was not implemented and the Zoning Board of Appeals did not comply with the state statute, would that be, in and of itself, a reason to invalidate approval of a variance?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2214.941s">Not</a>  complying with the state statute would absolutely be a reason to invalidate something. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2220.082s">That's</a>  happened before. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2221.764s">We</a>  had years ago, there was a clerk of the ZBA who was ill with cancer and certain notices didn't go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2230.653s">That</a>  case was in the land court for one day and came back for re-notification.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2237.34s">So</a>  based on that, I guess my question is that, other than the fact that we're going to create a city ordinance, what would bound the Zoning Board of Appeals to follow it? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2255.339s">If</a>  there's no ramification on whether or not they follow it, it doesn't impact an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2264.185s">As</a>  you mentioned, it's governed by state statutory requirements or regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2271.679s">So</a>  what would bound them to follow this new notification of 400 feet?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2277.846s">All</a>  municipal employees, and that includes board and commission members, are required to comply with the requirements set forth in the revised ordinances of the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2290.321s">If</a>  they do not, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2293.203s">what</a>  could happen to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2294.664s">I</a>  really don't know, not being the person that appoints them, what could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2298.885s">But</a>  I'll tell you this, if a board or commission member just summarily said, well we're not doing that, we don't really care what the ordinance says, we have a fundamental problem that would have to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2309.388s">And</a>  it wouldn't be addressed by way of another ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2312.448s">I</a>  think it would be addressed by way of removal.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2316.472s">So</a>  you're saying once this is implemented, then we can rest assured that notification will take place based on whatever the ordinance reads?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2324.058s">Yes,</a>  the words that you used, rest assured, sounds like, could I say that once the ordinance is in place that it will always be complied with? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2332.184s">There's</a>  always room for the frailty of human nature and error. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2338.989s">I'm</a>  not saying that it's a foolproof system, but it certainly is greater than what exists right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2344.153s">And</a>  it may or may not be implemented for us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2346.154s">The</a>  reason why I bring it up, Mr. Solicitor, is that one of the ZBA meetings, it was brought up by a member of this council during public participation, that we may be interested in expanding their notification by changing city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2361.798s">And</a>  one of the board members more or less said, do whatever you have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2365.399s">We're</a>  not going to follow it anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2368.039s">And</a>  that was my concern, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2371.741s">And</a>  if it doesn't invalidate, to me, if it's a city ordinance, and I realize what you're saying about appeals and so forth, but if it's a city ordinance and our own Zoning Board of Appeals does not adhere to the notification process that's laid out, that should be enough to invalidate whatever variance they gave out.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2392.564s">So</a>  to me, that should be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2396.827s">I</a>  get what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2397.628s">What</a>  you're saying is that the remedy should be invalidation of the variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2401.411s">However,</a>  if the variance is given in compliance with the state law, the fact that the municipal law wasn't followed or the municipal ordinance wasn't followed would not, in and of itself, invalidate the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2413.079s">That's</a>  clear in what my opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2415.361s">I</a>  will agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2416.702s">that</a>  if a board or commission member just summarily says, I don't care what you say, we're not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2422.03s">That</a>  raises another issue which I think has to be remedied in a different way than invalidating an approval that's consistent with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2434.333s">If</a>  it's consistent with state law and somebody thumbed their nose at you, but it's consistent with state law, I think the remedy is not to invalidate the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2444.102s">The</a>  remedy is something else, which I think is removal.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2447.545s">Of</a>  course, that's just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2451.749s">We</a>  appreciate your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2456.421s">like</a>  what Councilor Falco threw out there by trying to target site plan review for units over six. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2463.485s">On</a>  the other side, I can see, as Councilor Longo-Kurd mentioned, that a lot of the projects we're going through now are in commercial zoned areas and so forth, but as we're seeing development, we're seeing it in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2478.732s">And</a>  the complaints that I'm also receiving aren't just on main roads or in commercial industrial areas, they're in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2487.157s">And</a>  I, too, would like to see maybe some discussion and that may be for a future or the <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2496.582s">the</a>  zoning board itself, when they have their public hearing, to look at how do we rest assure that we don't target, naturally, someone that wants to put another foot onto their porch in their backyard, but target units that will have an impact, as the city solicitor mentioned, regarding traffic, regarding quality of life, regarding, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2520.435s">A</a>  lot of other issues, infrastructure, water pressure, and a host of other issues that usually come when you develop large projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2529.602s">So</a>  I too would like to see a compromise on that and possibly lower the number of units and not just site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2541.009s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2541.95s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2542.811s">Councilor</a>  Rumley, this question is also for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2548.493s">If</a>  an applicant is in substantial compliance with the state law but fails to comply with the local expanded ordinance and submits their application in compliance with one but not the other, does the clock start ticking on the Zoning Board of Appeals timelines relative to when they have to take the application up for hearing?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2570.233s">The</a>  statutory timeframes are not waivable or changeable locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2576.078s">There</a>  are timeframes during which times the Board of Appeals must act. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2579.601s">If</a>  they do not, then there is constructive approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2582.903s">I</a>  can tell you, having been down the road on a couple of constructive approval cases over the years, <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2588.507s">It's</a>  a very steep way to try to get an approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2592.248s">Because</a>  what happens is, if somebody says the Board of Appeals didn't act within a certain time frame, and then they go for their building permit, you might say, well, everything's okay, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2601.11s">Well,</a>  the building department is going to say, is this okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2604.411s">So</a>  then they come to me, we look at the time frames, whether or not everything is the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2609.112s">But</a>  the litmus test on something like that is the lender who's lending to the person that's developing, in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2615.894s">The</a>  lender might say, I don't know if I want a loan on this project because you got a constructive approval from the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2622.167s">There</a>  are all kinds of variables when that stuff happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2625.093s">All</a>  kinds.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2629.22s">So</a>  if they put the application in and only just notify abutters of abutters within 300 feet, the time frame starts ticking right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2636.988s">And</a>  the zoning board has no recourse to require them to expand the notification to the city ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2642.593s">Well,</a>  we're hoping that the board is going to request their clerk to make sure that that's implied with, yes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2655.773s">So</a>  through the clerk, what does our next step have to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2660.097s">Can</a>  we take a first reading or if we even got there?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2662.499s">This</a>  is a zoning matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2668.084s">It</a>  has to be referred to the Community Development Board for their recommendation and public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2674.711s">Then</a>  it comes back if you accept <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2677.413s">the</a>  recommendations, then you would vote to go out to public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2684.558s">Which</a>  is a two week process, two or three week process.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2688.3s">So</a>  we have to move and get a vote on moving this to? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2692.202s">We</a>  have to send it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2693.223s">Send</a>  it up to? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2694.043s">Send</a>  it up to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2696.085s">So</a>  I make a motion that we send this up to the Community Development Board.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2698.846s">Second,</a>  as amended.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2700.487s">If</a>  I can, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2701.808s">Councilor</a>  Scott, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2705.787s">Is</a>  this as amended with what we talked about with the three, you know, with looking into, you know, the site review and the three family? <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2716.812s">That</a>  would be, we send the whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2718.633s">We</a>  send the whole thing, okay, all right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2725.195s">Councilor</a>  Palco, I mean Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2727.956s">Is</a>  this the amendment, is this the motion with ritual methods?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2734.4s">The</a>  paper is as it is until we make an amendment to it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2742.87s">Can</a>  we ask for them to review it with all our discussions and give us their opinions?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2752.822s">This</a>  paper, as is written, will go to the Community Development Board for their public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2762.071s">If</a>  you want to add that amendment, they'll look at that amendment also. <a href="https://youtu.be/mgC3PACaQmc&t=2765.174s">Maybe</a>  an amendment would be- If they want to incorporate it, they'll come back, but with their language and their recommendations.</p>
