1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:01,912
I feel sorry for them.

2
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:05,314
I don't know, after 30 years of working on computers, it's not the best thing.

3
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,155
So that's why it's really nice to make stuff.

4
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:08,796
I love working with materials.

5
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:10,677
I think that gets me off the computer.

6
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:22,763
For a while, I was reading a lot of black American women writers' work, and so I started making quilts because there was that story of quilts, that feminine process, and that whole idea of recycling.

7
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:25,084
So I asked people to come and visit me.

8
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:38,523
Memphis City Council, 39th regular meeting.

9
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:42,784

President Caraballo.

23
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,350
Present.

24
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,602
Please rise and salute the flag.

25
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:11,811
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

26
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:14,193
All right.

27
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:20,598
Motion by Councilor Lococo for the suspension of the rules to take paper 17795.

28
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,019
All those in favor?

29
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:22,380
Motion passes.

30
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:32,684
17795, offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

31
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:39,928
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council take a first reading on the ordinance change to read as follows.

32
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,792
In ordinance amending chapter 94 of the ordinance of the city of Medford, be it ordained.

33
00:06:47,832 --> 00:07:16,152
by the City Council of City of Medford that Chapter 94 of the Ordinance of the City of Medford entitled Zoning, Article 2, Division 1, Section 94-35, Paragraph E, that presently states, E, appeals from administrative decisions, petitions for variances, and applications for special permits shall be filed together with other supporting materials as required by applicable rules.

34
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:37,568
The City Council or Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and shall cause notice of such a hearing to be published in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40A, Section 11, as further amended and shall now state as follows.

35
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:38,249
A.

36
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:50,079
Appeals from administrative decisions, petitions for variances, and applications for special permits shall be filed together with other supporting materials as required by applicable rules.

37
00:07:51,119 --> 00:08:04,150
The City Council or Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing and shall cause notice of such hearing to be published in accordance with Massachusetts General Law's

38
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:29,166
Chapter 40A, section 11, and such notice shall also be given to all owners within 400 feet of the property line of the petitioner as the same are listed in the most recent tax list as kept by the chief assessor of the city and such notice shall also be given to the owners within 400 feet of the property line of the petitioner as the same area listed in the most

39
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:43,571
recent text that's kept by the chief assessor of the city by way of telephone call, text message that uses computerized auto dialer to deliver a pre-recorded message or its equivalent.

40
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:45,371
Councilor Longo Kern.

41
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:52,034
Thank you, President Carviello, and thank you for reading it.

42
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:53,974
It's lengthy.

43
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,916
This was something that the council

44
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:01,095
was interested in doing back in August of 2016.

45
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:07,260
It went to committee, and I believe there's some questions whether they were answered or not.

46
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,321
It just stayed in committee.

47
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,103
I brought it up again probably two months ago.

48
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:22,432
At that time, the council voted seven to nothing with regards to being interested in this and just needing legal language drafted by our city solicitor.

49
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,334
I followed up with the solicitor.

50
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,838
Thankfully, in November, a decision was rendered.

51
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:34,744
I believe, I'm not sure if you received it before that, but I did forward it to everybody this morning, just in case.

52
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:38,708
It tells you what the prior requirements were under Mass General Law 48.

53
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:39,569
Yes, thank you.

54
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:47,357
I know he's here.

55
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:49,338
I was just going to finish.

56
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:55,383
Mass General Laws, Section 40, Chapter 40A, Section 11.

57
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:05,991
The fact of the matter with regards to just notifying abutters and abutters to abutters is something that has caused a great deal of

58
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:25,653
put it plainly, heartache to those who live either across the street or very close to a potential, in this case, obviously we're doing it for mainly the developments that have been proposed and people finding out after the fact and being really upset

59
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:31,035
The council gets frantic emails and phone calls, and we're left having to step in.

60
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,935
Obviously, the mayor's office probably gets the same.

61
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:55,602
We're going to and from, myself and a number of counselors, going to and from OCD meetings and zoning meetings and conservation commission meetings to try to find out what's going on and how to give the residents the ability to be heard and to voice their concerns, questions, and get answers to specific questions that they do have.

62
00:10:56,478 --> 00:11:02,882
So I think it's important and I know it's important to this whole council that we give more notice and that be done in multiple ways.

63
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:20,412
And what this proposed ordinance change does, that I'm thankful the solicitor drafted, is it provides notice to everybody, every owner within 400 feet, and it provides notice through mail and through our reverse 911 system, which is something that

64
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:23,154
was well deserving of the reverse 9-1-1.

65
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,716
I think it's a win-win.

66
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:34,003
I know there are some questions that the counselors may have, one being how enforceable this is, which our solicitor is here to discuss.

67
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:39,848
And also if there is a minor permit or a minor variance that needs to be had, is this necessary?

68
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:44,331
And I think the answer is it's just necessary because

69
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:51,840
We have had such a problem over the last couple years, and we need to change that.

70
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,261
We need to change it for the people and the neighbors.

71
00:11:54,781 --> 00:12:05,907
This is one step of many that has to be taken, and I ask my colleagues to obviously get your questions answered, but to move forward and vote for approval for the first reading of this ordinance change.

72
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:06,867
Thank you.

73
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:11,890
Mr. Solicitor, would you take any questions or any opinion?

74
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:19,196
I can give a supplement to what Councilor Lungo-Kern just said.

75
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:25,802
I can give a brief supplement which might go to the core of some concerns or some questions about the language.

76
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:30,286
First, my name.

77
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,307
My name is Mark Rumley.

78
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:32,288
I'm the city solicitor.

79
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:35,371
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

80
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:45,463
right now the way the state statute is, and you have to understand this in terms of state statute and local ordinance.

81
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:50,626
The state statute says in terms of notice that it should be given to

82
00:12:51,969 --> 00:13:01,197
abutters to a petitioner property or abutters to abutters or those who are across the street within a 300-foot ambit.

83
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:07,703
Now that doesn't mean under the state statute that everybody within the 300-foot ambit would receive notice.

84
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,606
It just means abutters, abutters to abutters or those across the street.

85
00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:28,326
The resolution which is before you tonight would make it a requirement that locally, that in the city of Medford, notice be given to all persons, all persons, within a 400-foot ambit.

86
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:35,313
Now, it's important to be cognizant of the fact that this is

87
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,954
in excess of what's required by the state statute.

88
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:45,317
Therefore, from a legal point of view, it would be considered directory only.

89
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:46,678
I want to give you an example.

90
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,399
The example would be this.

91
00:13:49,099 --> 00:14:03,168
If you were somebody who was, say, 300 feet away, but you were not an abutter or an abutter to an abutter or across the street, and you disagreed with a decision made by the board,

92
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:14,588
If you appealed it, the land court would not recognize the fact that you didn't get notice because you were 300 feet away, because that's a local rule.

93
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:20,272
So the land court would not say that that would give you the status of a party in interest.

94
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,494
You would have to establish that another way.

95
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:31,200
So when I say that the extra notice would be directory only, it doesn't mean that it wouldn't be given, because if you pass it as an ordinance,

96
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,584
then the board and commission would have to implement that.

97
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:55,797
However, what I'm saying is that if somebody appealed the decision to the courts, that would not give them an additional leg to stand on or some status that they didn't otherwise have, because the state statute would control as being the only requirement that's compulsory.

98
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,941
So that's essentially what this ordinance would be.

99
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:15,288
And I have a little bit of data that I didn't have earlier this morning that I received from Mr. McDougal as to what this would mean from a substantive point of view by way of example, which I could give you if you like.

100
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:16,829
I'll just explain it.

101
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:25,377
Dennis McDougall is the clerk for the administrator for the ZBA.

102
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:40,090
And just as an example of what this would mean, there's one project, I won't give the address, it's not that important, but it was the change of a property from a single family to a two family.

103
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,632
It was before the Board of Appeals.

104
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:50,961
Under the state statute, which means abutters, abutters to abutters, or those across the street, there were 10 notices that were given out.

105
00:15:52,568 --> 00:16:03,217
If it were all owners within 300 feet, there were 234 people that would have to be notified because there was a condominium within that area.

106
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:11,465
If it were 400 feet, there'd be 357 people that would have had to have been notified because of that condominium.

107
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,888
Now, that's a very steep example.

108
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:22,298
There's another one where, on a matter before the ZBA, under the law, 18 people were notified.

109
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,784
If the circle was drawn at 300 feet, 38 people would be notified.

110
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:28,506
And at 400 feet, 60 people would be notified.

111
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:40,560
So you can see how there's an additional notice requirement if you draw the circle further out and further out.

112
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,720
That's how this would work.

113
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:48,564
So I give that to you simply for your information, but that's how this would work.

114
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:52,987
And the condominium example is steep because obviously there are many units in a condominium.

115
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:55,248
Thank you.

116
00:16:57,994 --> 00:16:58,735
Councilor Falco.

117
00:16:58,955 --> 00:16:59,836
Thank you, Mr. President.

118
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:02,959
City solicitor Romley, if I may ask a few questions.

119
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,744
So is this enforceable as far as if we were to vote for this change?

120
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:16,332
I mean, is it enforceable as far as from, I mean, I guess you could always appeal it, but I mean, do we have any grounds to enforce this, I guess?

121
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,212
Yes, the enforceability would be this.

122
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:22,133
It would be a requirement of the local board and commission to give that notice.

123
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:27,535
Actually, it would be the petitioner who's going forth to make sure that that notice is given.

124
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:34,696
For example, Mr. McDougal does the notices for the Board of Appeals, but the costs of that are borne by the petitioner.

125
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:36,157
Is it enforceable?

126
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,537
So the answer to that question is split.

127
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:46,159
The first part of the answer is, if it's made an ordinance, then it is required that it be implemented by the local board or commission.

128
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:57,068
However, at the state level, if there was an appeal to the courts, it would be informational but not required.

129
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:01,653
So to the degree that you would think that the state would enforce it, it would not.

130
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:11,058
So I mean, I think it's interesting, and I think it's definitely, I definitely like notifying more people.

131
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:12,199
I think that's a good thing.

132
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,742
I just have, I guess, some concerns that there's like unintended consequences here.

133
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:25,727
So for like the local person that's trying to make a home improvement, put a deck on the back of their house, and they need a variance, maybe they're too close to the property line.

134
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:33,311
So if they have that type of a situation, that person is going to have to notify

135
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,770
everyone within that 400 foot?

136
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,592
Yes, if this ordinance were passed in its present form, yes.

137
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:44,153
And they would actually pay the cost of that as well?

138
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:46,874
Yeah, I don't know what the cost would be of something like that.

139
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:48,095
But they're responsible for that?

140
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,496
Ultimately, yes.

141
00:18:49,556 --> 00:19:02,682
It's done by Mr. McDougal, but the notices, the labels, I think the postage, along with the petition fee, advertisement, that's borne by the petitioner.

142
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:08,925
That's my concern, because I definitely like the idea of making sure that we notify more people.

143
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:16,772
But I guess I'm worried about once you get into the neighborhoods, if you're doing something to increase the value of your property.

144
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:18,354
Maybe you're putting on a deck.

145
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:20,516
You're doing some sort of home improvement.

146
00:19:21,597 --> 00:19:24,499
And it's not that major.

147
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,283
There's a concern, I think, that you're adding a cost to that.

148
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:35,185
And there's just a little bit of a concern there.

149
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:42,969
So I think for big developments, this is something that's definitely needed and warranted.

150
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:47,272
I mean, I think it's definitely something that would benefit the whole neighborhood.

151
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:53,095
But for someone that's doing a small type of home improvement, I have some concerns there.

152
00:19:57,561 --> 00:20:02,425
my colleague wouldn't mind if we could amend this maybe just to projects that have to go through site plan review.

153
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:03,987
And I'm not sure if that makes sense.

154
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,068
Maybe you could weigh in on that.

155
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:17,899
But I'm just thinking that if we're going to have local, my concern is that if we're going to have local neighbors that want to make an improvement and add cost to that and add more red tape to that, I think that's a little bit of a concern.

156
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,882
So I'm just thinking if maybe we could have this applied to any type of

157
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,924
project that requires site plan review.

158
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:32,105
Maybe that's the direction we should head in, and that's an amendment to the resolution that I would offer if my colleague is willing to accept that.

159
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,086
Well, I can answer you this way, Councilor.

160
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:40,027
First, a site plan review project is one which has a greater magnitude towards it.

161
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:44,088
I think it's six or more units for site plan review.

162
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:48,609
Of the list that I had for Mr. McDougall today, which again is just for my

163
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:50,709
information.

164
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,292
There were two projects that he has here that were subject to site plan review.

165
00:20:56,012 --> 00:21:07,558
And the first one, under the present law, or under the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, under the first one, there were 20 abutters, or abutters to abutters, et cetera, who were notified.

166
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:11,520
If it went to 300 feet, there would have been 71.

167
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,022
If it went to 400 feet, there would have been 100.

168
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:27,018
In the next project that was subject to site plan review, under the law and the state statute in its present incarnation, the number of people notified was 15.

169
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,462
If that line were drawn out 300 feet, it would have been 58 people notified.

170
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:39,285
And if the line were drawn out to 400 feet, it would be 99 people who would have been notified.

171
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:48,047
So there you can see, and of course that all depends upon the location, because as I said earlier, if there's a condo next door, that number's gonna go up exponentially.

172
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:55,970
So site plan review is only applicable, my recollection is, to projects which call for six units or more.

173
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:00,711
But just generally speaking.

174
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,632
And I appreciate that.

175
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:02,033
Thank you.

176
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:03,574
That's just my concern.

177
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:06,316
I mean, I think it's a great, I mean, I like the resolution.

178
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:16,725
I think it's, I think we should be reaching out to talk to more, to actually communicate with more people in the neighborhood when there's a project or development that's going to impact them.

179
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:19,027
So more communication is definitely better.

180
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:20,648
I just wonder if, you know,

181
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:32,036
if there's some unintended consequences to this where we're gonna impact them financially and make a simple home improvement into a larger type of project.

182
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:40,282
So that's why I offer the resolution if you're willing that maybe we have this apply just to something that requires site plan review.

183
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:45,946
That's up to Council Member Kern.

184
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:48,227
Thank you.

185
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:48,788
Council Member Kern.

186
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:56,778
I definitely think that that is something I'd like to hear the rest of my colleagues discuss.

187
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:58,900
I don't see the harm in that.

188
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,204
I'm not putting this forward to hurt the individual homeowner.

189
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:08,229
I think you can look at it two ways, which is definitely, that is an option.

190
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:11,072
I don't think it's a huge financial burden.

191
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,394
100 people need to be notified.

192
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:17,136
It's going to be $49 in postage.

193
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:22,499
But six or more units is something that definitely can be talked about tonight and discussed.

194
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:26,816
Councilor Scott Pelley.

195
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm done for now.

196
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:27,916
Yes.

197
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,556
Councilor Scott Pelley.

198
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,296
Thank you, Mr. President.

199
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:34,537
Thank you for bringing this forward.

200
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:50,260
And to this solicitor, I know John already brought this up, and I don't want to be redundant, but I actually had two phone calls today that residents were running to the building's office today to try to secure permits and possibly variances because they were looking at

201
00:23:50,960 --> 00:24:18,543
building up, because they're nervous, the same questions you had, probably I've been getting, and I think that's my concern, is that the home improvement jobs, the home improvement variances that people will be looking for, because, you know, facts are facts, the costs of housing now have gone up, so people want to take advantage of that while they can, and try to

202
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:22,746
make their homes the best they can at this time.

203
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:41,579
So looking at the fear of someone questioning it down the line or that don't belong, that don't live in that radius and that these people that they've grown up and the neighbors that they know that they might have talked to and let them know that this is what's happening,

204
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:46,720
They'll be going to the appeal board and they'll be looking for something like this.

205
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:59,804
They are just nervous that if it goes further out where people might not want a two family or a second floor built or that they would question out of fear that they wouldn't get this.

206
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:01,525
This is one of their biggest concerns.

207
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:18,277
So I like the idea that, you know, the idea that putting it for the six or more units, I think that that's probably our biggest fear that we've heard here is that, the fear that things are happening so fast, so quick, and notifying people.

208
00:25:18,657 --> 00:25:29,186
But my question is ultimately, it can't be, the ordinance can't be written, excuse me, I'm getting off track, but the question is that,

209
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:45,038
If this, what we have in line right now, if this is adopted, it still goes to the state level, and the state level, it's just something that could be heard, but won't be, can't be used as judgment.

210
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:47,199
All right.

211
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,820
It's a valid concern, and it gets a little bit confusing.

212
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,163
But it runs this way.

213
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,085
The state statute is the core.

214
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,766
It is required.

215
00:25:58,186 --> 00:25:59,287
It is compulsory.

216
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:08,953
And the state statute says that notice must be given to abutters or abutters to abutters, and those across the street, within 300 feet.

217
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,054
That's the core.

218
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,495
That doesn't change.

219
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:12,936
And that's required.

220
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:18,140
This would be additional requirement, a local option.

221
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,260
Not local option.

222
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,101
That's not the way to put it.

223
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,142
Local requirement.

224
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:29,987
And, if it's passed by the council, ultimately, then the Board of Appeals would have to implement that notice requirement.

225
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:33,629
Now, as I said at the beginning, if Mr. Jones or Ms.

226
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:41,394
Smith is not happy with the approval of a variance or whatever it is, and then appeals to the court,

227
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:49,410
If they're not in that core area, they would not be considered to be a party in interest because of their location.

228
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:51,971
There may be some other reasons that they could have standing.

229
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,052
I'm not saying that they wouldn't.

230
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:59,614
But their location, if they're outside of that core area, would not give them proper standing.

231
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:06,797
What it would do is mean that from a local point of view, here in Medford, they would get some notification.

232
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:07,837
Now here's the thing.

233
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,006
There's nothing bad in anything that anybody just said.

234
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:18,288
Because here's, I don't want to sound like Pollyanna, but I've been part of municipal government for 34 years.

235
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:24,230
And one of the common threads that goes through as a criticism is, I didn't know.

236
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:26,791
When did that happen?

237
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:29,652
Who did that?

238
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:38,888
And when that occurs, what you have is a lessening of the quantum of trust that a resident has in the local government.

239
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:49,417
This measure will address that in a fashion by giving greater notice, even if it doesn't give legal teeth.

240
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:55,397
The benefit of fine-tuning it is that Ms.

241
00:27:55,477 --> 00:28:09,081
Jones or Mr. Smith, who wants to extend a bedroom for maybe an elderly member of their family, won't have to go through hoops if this only applies to larger projects.

242
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:21,633
And generally speaking, I don't hear, in my 34 years, I don't hear, I didn't know about that when we're talking about a neighbor increasing the size of their house a little bit for a family reason.

243
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:25,736
When you hear it, you already know the projects that you hear it on.

244
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:27,278
They don't have to say what they are.

245
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:39,131
But they're the larger projects, the ones that have multiple units, the ones that have traffic impact, which, by the way, is an element or an issue that has to be reviewed in site plan review.

246
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:39,852
Traffic.

247
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:43,917
And those are the ones where people say, I didn't know that.

248
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:48,816
And so there's where, if there is any fine-tuning, that may be a benefit.

249
00:28:49,616 --> 00:29:04,864
The other thing is, since this is an amendment to the zoning ordinance, then this would have to go, assuming that it left the launching pad here at the city council, it would have to go to the planning board for a public hearing.

250
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:11,267
So the input of others could be received, too, and then the planning board makes its recommendation back to the council.

251
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:13,408
Well, that's a pretty good thing to have.

252
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:18,607
public input on whether or not to extend public notification.

253
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:21,131
Seems to me that that fits together like Legos.

254
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:23,604
So that's what I'd say.

255
00:29:24,165 --> 00:29:33,612
Thank you very much for my trivial response, but I think, again, I know that my council colleague put together a very thoughtful ordinance.

256
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:50,986
I think that the concerns that Councilor Falco brought up with the site plan review, I would definitely support this if, because I think we all sit here and understand the phone calls we get with the bigger developments that come out that are affecting the zoning that's affecting our

257
00:29:51,566 --> 00:30:00,096
our community so I will support this wholeheartedly if we can that I agree with what council Falco stated with

258
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:09,447
site plan reviews, anything over six units, that this would be implemented.

259
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:25,192
So I think that wouldn't affect the phone calls I got that were questioning and nervousness and the fear of our neighbors that how this could affect a homeowner who was looking to improve their home and their future.

260
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:29,133
So I hope that helps with the other Brianna, but thank you.

261
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:36,837
The clerk has informed me that the cost is approximately a dollar to send out a mailing to all the homes.

262
00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:41,679
And then it's another dollar because he has to also mail them the decision that is written.

263
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,321
So it will be about two dollars per household.

264
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:45,842
Councillor Knight.

265
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:47,662
Mr. President, thank you very much.

266
00:30:50,505 --> 00:31:05,311
City Solicitor Rumley has framed this in a pretty basic and outright fashion, that the steps that we need to go through, if we decide to adopt the zoning amendment this evening, that it goes to the Community Development Board for a public hearing.

267
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,374
So, in looking at the action that we're taking here as a body tonight, I think we're torn.

268
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,215
I mean, we've all sat here and we've all talked about

269
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:14,976
requirements for notice.

270
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:19,298
We want more people to know what's going on in their neighborhood, and we don't want to hurt people at the same time, Mr. President.

271
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:30,746
So here we have a proposal that would increase the notification ramifications by about 100 yards, and then also add everybody that lives in that jurisdiction to the notification requirements.

272
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:41,232
I think it might be in our best interest to send the paper as authored to the Community Development Board for their input at a public hearing, get the information and the input that they can secure,

273
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:47,874
And when they bring it back to us, then we'll be in a better position to make a determination as to what language changes we would like to see made.

274
00:31:48,474 --> 00:32:02,897
I certainly would agree that I think projects requiring site plan review only would be something that I'd be very supportive of, Mr. President, but I don't think that that's going to be something that's going to be a hindrance for me this evening for supporting this measure and sending it to the Community Development Board for a public hearing and for their input.

275
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:04,158
Thank you.

276
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:05,958
Councilor Del Rosso.

277
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:09,479
Councilor Del Rosso.

278
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,059
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

279
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:26,979
I'm generally in favor of this expanded notification, but if I could, Mr. President, through the chair to the solicitor, ask a question regarding the amendment.

280
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:28,921
My question is this.

281
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:55,941
It was stated by Councilor Lungo Kern that, and I'm sure this is true without a doubt, that we're not seeking to harm the homeowner in this ordinance, but if we put a stipulation on the expansion of the notification to those

282
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:07,061
projects that require site plan review, i.e., a way of getting at the bigger projects, is that a signaling that we're aiming to harm someone?

283
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:08,782
Could it be read as that?

284
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:10,584
So are we targeting someone?

285
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:12,425
Are we being prejudicial?

286
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:16,309
So what applies to one thing, should it apply to all?

287
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:17,590
That's just my question.

288
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,053
I get the question, and I'd say this.

289
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:27,542
First of all, the legislative discretion of a body like the City Council is indeed that.

290
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:37,313
If you exercise that discretion in a reasonable way, based upon considerations before you, it would not be arbitrary, nor would it be discriminatory.

291
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:42,076
In addition, the greater concern of the public is always the larger projects.

292
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:46,139
It's not the smaller ones that have been alluded to here tonight.

293
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:54,545
So indeed, if a large developer said, I'm being prejudiced by having to notice this many people, I would say, so what?

294
00:33:56,587 --> 00:34:00,009
Take your shot, bring us to court, and let's see what happens.

295
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:02,251
Thank you.

296
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:02,972
You're welcome.

297
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:04,613
Thank you, Mr. President.

298
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:06,659
Council Member Kern.

299
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,441
Thank you, President Carviello.

300
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:11,863
I think we've heard from a number of councilors.

301
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:21,989
It looks like there potentially is a vote to pass the first reading tonight, but as long as there's limited to site plan review projects or greater, obviously.

302
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,112
Just plain devil's advocate, my question would be to the solicitor is

303
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:35,454
Because I understand it if it has to do with a deck or expanding a home so you can have a couple more feet in your bedroom or a walk-in closet, whatever it might be.

304
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:40,317
And those are the people that, obviously, we don't want to have to bear the burden of hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

305
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:51,526
But what about a single-family home that the owner wants to turn it into a three-family and it's a two-family district or it's a single-family district?

306
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:55,709
Now, I'm playing devil's advocate because if that was in my neighborhood and it was down the street,

307
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:01,953
in a single-family district and a homeowner wanted to put up a three-family, I'd want to know.

308
00:35:02,413 --> 00:35:02,594
Right.

309
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:05,355
And I don't think necessarily that you're playing devil's advocate.

310
00:35:05,596 --> 00:35:08,257
What you're doing is drawing the line at a different place.

311
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:09,078
Right.

312
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:09,658
Right.

313
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,600
And how could we do that?

314
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:20,707
Well, I think that the best thing is to let the planning board have some people in to hear their opinions so they can make appropriate recommendations back to the council.

315
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:37,603
So because while the line suggested tonight by a prospective amendment has been projects that would require site plan review, and you just pointed out a larger project than a small addition to a house that nonetheless may impact a particular neighborhood,

316
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:40,465
That is drawing the line at a different place.

317
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:50,792
And I think the best way to decide where to draw that line, and I don't say that either one of those ideas are wrong, even the initial idea is not wrong, it's a matter of judgment and choice.

318
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:53,294
So the question is where is that line drawn?

319
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:59,158
And that really is something that would be interesting to receive in the recommendation from the planning board.

320
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,860
So I understand your point, Counselor.

321
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,962
I think you're drawing the boundary line in a little different place.

322
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:06,123
There's nothing wrong with that.

323
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:09,821
Thank you.

324
00:36:11,442 --> 00:36:12,102
Vice President Mox.

325
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:13,583
Thank you, Mr. President.

326
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:34,834
Mr. Solicitor, in the letter dated November 8th regarding this paper 17-731, your response to the mayor on page 2, the last paragraph, it states that failure to comply with the ordinance requirements would not invalidate the approval of a variance.

327
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:35,515
That's correct.

328
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:54,620
And my question to you would be, if this was not implemented and the Zoning Board of Appeals did not comply with the state statute, would that be, in and of itself, a reason to invalidate approval of a variance?

329
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:59,822
Not complying with the state statute would absolutely be a reason to invalidate something.

330
00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:01,043
That's happened before.

331
00:37:01,764 --> 00:37:10,112
We had years ago, there was a clerk of the ZBA who was ill with cancer and certain notices didn't go out.

332
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:15,258
That case was in the land court for one day and came back for re-notification.

333
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:34,076
So based on that, I guess my question is that, other than the fact that we're going to create a city ordinance, what would bound the Zoning Board of Appeals to follow it?

334
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:42,444
If there's no ramification on whether or not they follow it, it doesn't impact an appeal.

335
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:50,750
As you mentioned, it's governed by state statutory requirements or regulations.

336
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,286
So what would bound them to follow this new notification of 400 feet?

337
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:09,901
All municipal employees, and that includes board and commission members, are required to comply with the requirements set forth in the revised ordinances of the City of Medford.

338
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,122
If they do not,

339
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,164
what could happen to them.

340
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:18,465
I really don't know, not being the person that appoints them, what could happen.

341
00:38:18,885 --> 00:38:28,988
But I'll tell you this, if a board or commission member just summarily said, well we're not doing that, we don't really care what the ordinance says, we have a fundamental problem that would have to be addressed.

342
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:32,128
And it wouldn't be addressed by way of another ordinance.

343
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,349
I think it would be addressed by way of removal.

344
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:43,718
So you're saying once this is implemented, then we can rest assured that notification will take place based on whatever the ordinance reads?

345
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:51,784
Yes, the words that you used, rest assured, sounds like, could I say that once the ordinance is in place that it will always be complied with?

346
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:58,689
There's always room for the frailty of human nature and error.

347
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:03,413
I'm not saying that it's a foolproof system, but it certainly is greater than what exists right now.

348
00:39:04,153 --> 00:39:06,134
And it may or may not be implemented for us.

349
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:21,137
The reason why I bring it up, Mr. Solicitor, is that one of the ZBA meetings, it was brought up by a member of this council during public participation, that we may be interested in expanding their notification by changing city ordinance.

350
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:25,379
And one of the board members more or less said, do whatever you have to do.

351
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,559
We're not going to follow it anyways.

352
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,140
And that was my concern, Mr. Solicitor.

353
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:50,768
And if it doesn't invalidate, to me, if it's a city ordinance, and I realize what you're saying about appeals and so forth, but if it's a city ordinance and our own Zoning Board of Appeals does not adhere to the notification process that's laid out, that should be enough to invalidate whatever variance they gave out.

354
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:55,326
So to me, that should be enough.

355
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:57,608
I get what you're saying.

356
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:01,050
What you're saying is that the remedy should be invalidation of the variance.

357
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:12,939
However, if the variance is given in compliance with the state law, the fact that the municipal law wasn't followed or the municipal ordinance wasn't followed would not, in and of itself, invalidate the approval.

358
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,821
That's clear in what my opinion is.

359
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:16,342
I will agree with you.

360
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:21,649
that if a board or commission member just summarily says, I don't care what you say, we're not doing it.

361
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:32,184
That raises another issue which I think has to be remedied in a different way than invalidating an approval that's consistent with state law.

362
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:43,782
If it's consistent with state law and somebody thumbed their nose at you, but it's consistent with state law, I think the remedy is not to invalidate the approval.

363
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:46,744
The remedy is something else, which I think is removal.

364
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,948
Of course, that's just my opinion.

365
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,790
We appreciate your opinion.

366
00:40:56,421 --> 00:41:02,764
like what Councilor Falco threw out there by trying to target site plan review for units over six.

367
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:17,852
On the other side, I can see, as Councilor Longo-Kurd mentioned, that a lot of the projects we're going through now are in commercial zoned areas and so forth, but as we're seeing development, we're seeing it in neighborhoods.

368
00:41:18,732 --> 00:41:26,477
And the complaints that I'm also receiving aren't just on main roads or in commercial industrial areas, they're in neighborhoods.

369
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:34,881
And I, too, would like to see maybe some discussion and that may be for a future or the

370
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:59,215
the zoning board itself, when they have their public hearing, to look at how do we rest assure that we don't target, naturally, someone that wants to put another foot onto their porch in their backyard, but target units that will have an impact, as the city solicitor mentioned, regarding traffic, regarding quality of life, regarding, you know,

371
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:09,582
A lot of other issues, infrastructure, water pressure, and a host of other issues that usually come when you develop large projects.

372
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:18,568
So I too would like to see a compromise on that and possibly lower the number of units and not just site plan review.

373
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:21,910
Councilor Knight.

374
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,771
Thank you, Mr. President.

375
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:24,612
Councilor Rumley, this question is also for you.

376
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:49,552
If an applicant is in substantial compliance with the state law but fails to comply with the local expanded ordinance and submits their application in compliance with one but not the other, does the clock start ticking on the Zoning Board of Appeals timelines relative to when they have to take the application up for hearing?

377
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:55,497
The statutory timeframes are not waivable or changeable locally.

378
00:42:56,078 --> 00:42:59,541
There are timeframes during which times the Board of Appeals must act.

379
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:02,243
If they do not, then there is constructive approval.

380
00:43:02,903 --> 00:43:07,287
I can tell you, having been down the road on a couple of constructive approval cases over the years,

381
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:11,788
It's a very steep way to try to get an approval.

382
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:20,690
Because what happens is, if somebody says the Board of Appeals didn't act within a certain time frame, and then they go for their building permit, you might say, well, everything's okay, right?

383
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,371
Well, the building department is going to say, is this okay?

384
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:28,612
So then they come to me, we look at the time frames, whether or not everything is the way it's supposed to be.

385
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:35,454
But the litmus test on something like that is the lender who's lending to the person that's developing, in this case.

386
00:43:35,894 --> 00:43:41,827
The lender might say, I don't know if I want a loan on this project because you got a constructive approval from the ZBA.

387
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:44,833
There are all kinds of variables when that stuff happens.

388
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:45,574
All kinds.

389
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:56,547
So if they put the application in and only just notify abutters of abutters within 300 feet, the time frame starts ticking right away.

390
00:43:56,988 --> 00:44:02,493
And the zoning board has no recourse to require them to expand the notification to the city ordinance.

391
00:44:02,593 --> 00:44:07,338
Well, we're hoping that the board is going to request their clerk to make sure that that's implied with, yes.

392
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:20,057
So through the clerk, what does our next step have to be?

393
00:44:20,097 --> 00:44:22,459
Can we take a first reading or if we even got there?

394
00:44:22,499 --> 00:44:28,064
This is a zoning matter.

395
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:33,790
It has to be referred to the Community Development Board for their recommendation and public hearing.

396
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:36,552
Then it comes back if you accept

397
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:44,497
the recommendations, then you would vote to go out to public hearing.

398
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,799
Which is a two week process, two or three week process.

399
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,782
So we have to move and get a vote on moving this to?

400
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:52,943
We have to send it up.

401
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,023
Send it up to?

402
00:44:54,043 --> 00:44:55,284
Send it up to the Community Development Board.

403
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:58,826
So I make a motion that we send this up to the Community Development Board.

404
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:00,427
Second, as amended.

405
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:01,768
If I can, point of information.

406
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:04,550
Councilor Scott, point of information.

407
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:16,792
Is this as amended with what we talked about with the three, you know, with looking into, you know, the site review and the three family?

408
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:18,613
That would be, we send the whole paper.

409
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:24,955
We send the whole thing, okay, all right, thank you.

410
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:26,596
Councilor Palco, I mean Councilor Knight.

411
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:33,159
Is this the amendment, is this the motion with ritual methods?

412
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:42,850
The paper is as it is until we make an amendment to it.

413
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:48,797
Can we ask for them to review it with all our discussions and give us their opinions?

414
00:45:52,822 --> 00:46:01,530
This paper, as is written, will go to the Community Development Board for their public hearing.

415
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:05,154
If you want to add that amendment, they'll look at that amendment also.

416
00:46:05,174 --> 00:46:14,103
Maybe an amendment would be- If they want to incorporate it, they'll come back, but with their language and their recommendations.

417
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:36,375
So why don't we amend this, okay, through the chair, amend this to read, to exclude, but, Mr. Rumley could get it probably perfectly, but amended to exclude property owners who only want to make a small change, like a deck or an extension of a bedroom on their property.

418
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:39,276
Mr. President, if I may.

419
00:46:43,656 --> 00:46:47,597
Ultimately, it's going to go to the Community Development Board for a public hearing, right?

420
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:52,799
They're going to have a public hearing, they're going to get input from the public, and they're going to come back to us and make a recommendation to us.

421
00:46:53,239 --> 00:47:01,862
If we're going to be sending them a document, and we're going to say we want this amendment and that amendment, I think that it's incumbent upon us to get language together and send them that language, Mr. President.

422
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:10,065
So if we were going to take a vote on this matter this evening, and we sent them the proposal as written, that's the language, we send it up to them, it's going to come back to us anyway.

423
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:15,095
In the interim, if we want to put together a site, put in review language, or anything else, we can do that.

424
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:19,817
We can do that, because the bill is still going to have to go through its three readings here at this level.

425
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:25,381
But ultimately, what we want to do is get input from the general public as to what they think is going to be good for them.

426
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:29,203
So we're already starting to amend a paper that's an idea.

427
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,525
And I think this idea is going to be shaped by the input that happens at the public hearing.

428
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:35,427
So I think it might be a good idea for us, Mr. President, to send this paper forward now.

429
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:44,213
Now, I'm wholeheartedly in support of limiting the scope to site plan review or to something a little bit smaller than Mrs. Jones getting her porch done or Mrs. O'Malley trying to expand her driveway.

430
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:44,993
I don't think that that's

431
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:47,896
the legislative intent of this proposal.

432
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:50,478
I don't think that that's what Councilwoman Lungo is trying to accomplish.

433
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:55,302
I think what she's trying to accomplish is expanding notifications in neighborhoods so people feel as though they have a voice.

434
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,685
A voice in their neighborhood as to what's going on and what direction things are going in.

435
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:09,714
So why don't we let that process happen and then when it comes back to us, we'll have the ability and the opportunity to make all the changes to it in the world we need, but we'll have more information and more data to make an informed decision.

436
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:10,634
I second.

437
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:10,874
Thank you.

438
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:12,276
Councilor Falco.

439
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,498
Thank you.

440
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:15,180
And I agree with the resolution.

441
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:26,394
I think it's a good resolution, but I do think that, and I don't think you're trying to do this on purpose, but I think there's unintended consequences that we're really, there's a cost associated with this.

442
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:31,497
And it's borne by the taxpayer, the person that owns the property.

443
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:34,278
And that's the piece that I guess I'm guarding against.

444
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:48,363
So the only thing I'm saying is if we add the amendment in, we're at least giving some guidance to the community development board to say, you know, there is an amendment here to see what the public thinks about the amendment.

445
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:56,945
To send them the language, I think we're at least giving them a little bit more guidance if we're actually adding the amendment in as to what we're thinking.

446
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:01,786
I mean, it seems like there's definitely some sort of an appetite for the amendment that was offered.

447
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:03,626
Thank you, Council Member.

448
00:49:03,646 --> 00:49:08,307
So let's give the clerk the language for the amendments.

449
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:12,568
Okay, on the motion by Council Member.

450
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:33,574
What information counselor table it and let him write the amendment and then we can take it up next week I Just I'm not comfortable mr. President sending a paper to the board or a commission Asking them to do something if we don't have the language for them to look at it.

451
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:37,237
I mean we want a zoning issue It's not like we're asking them to fix a pothole and you know what I mean

452
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,782
Smith Street, you know what I mean?

453
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:40,543
This is a big deal.

454
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:43,146
So I think that if we're going to do it, we have to do it right.

455
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:47,831
And we have to have everything in a nice little box with some Christmas wrapping paper on it and a bow when they get it.

456
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:55,218
Name and address for the record, please.

457
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:57,300
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

458
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,601
I live at 281 Park Street.

459
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:03,524
I'm always in favor of expanded notification.

460
00:50:03,924 --> 00:50:07,526
And I think I like the part in here about the text message or the phone call.

461
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:10,648
As we all know, reverse 911 calls cost pennies.

462
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:20,193
So if you ask someone to make 400 reverse 911 calls, we're talking about $4 to $10, which I don't think is exorbitant.

463
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:23,996
And then 400 neighbors get to get notification of a project.

464
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:30,538
I think that any project that is adding a housing unit, there should be an expanded notification.

465
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:37,480
Because if you live next door to a single family and it's going to be a two or a three, that's going to be a big difference.

466
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,161
If you live half a block down from that house, that's going to be a big difference on your street.

467
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:45,863
A lot of us lives on streets where parking is difficult.

468
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:51,084
We face the every time there's a snow emergency, it's where am I going to put my car?

469
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,565
If you start adding housing units onto streets,

470
00:50:54,005 --> 00:51:01,336
people are going to want to have input on to whether or not there's going to be parking because that's the most common variance that's granted when these units are added.

471
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:02,718
Excuse me, Mrs. Rodriguez.

472
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:06,003
Mr. Vignoli, if you're going to film, please film from the notified area, please.

473
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:06,824
Thank you.

474
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:08,146
I apologize.

475
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:13,610
Okay, so I think that we should just strive for more notification.

476
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,531
I would love to see the agendas for the zoning board on the front page of the website.

477
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,591
I would love to see them read here at meetings.

478
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:26,372
We really need to find a way for people to know because we're chasing these things.

479
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:38,374
I was at the building department last week and I asked them if there was a way for me to find out about permit refusals because the most common question that people are asking online about zoning is how do we find out about these projects before they get to the ZBA?

480
00:51:38,814 --> 00:51:40,556
because once they get there, it feels too late.

481
00:51:41,096 --> 00:51:47,942
Currently, unless you know the address of a project that's received a permit refusal, you cannot find out what the permit refusals are in the city.

482
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:54,127
So that's an obstacle that we have to face and that we're chasing down as we're seeing more and more units.

483
00:51:54,147 --> 00:52:01,573
We're seeing zoning ordinances being written by our mayor and I'm very concerned as are many, many of our residents.

484
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:02,133
Thank you.

485
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:02,494
Thank you.

486
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:03,935
Council Member Kern.

487
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:07,198
The motion is on the floor.

488
00:52:07,578 --> 00:52:08,479
Oh, excuse me.

489
00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:10,521
Name and address of the record, please.

490
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:11,963
My name is John Elliott.

491
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,645
I live at 34 Emery Street on the hillside.

492
00:52:15,947 --> 00:52:19,270
I'm in favor of expanding the notification area as well.

493
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:24,655
And that's primarily, if you'd asked me a year ago, I might not have felt so strongly.

494
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:41,208
My opinion is heavily influenced by the fact that I live just over 300 feet from the closest house in what's being called the Capon Village.

495
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:46,778
It's just by that luck of the draw that I got notification.

496
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:48,899
That's a huge project.

497
00:52:49,339 --> 00:52:50,460
I wouldn't have known.

498
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:56,603
My next door neighbor didn't get notification because he's over the 300-foot line.

499
00:52:57,763 --> 00:53:02,065
I think it's worthwhile that people know what's going on in their neighborhoods.

500
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:08,869
I think sunlight is a good thing to have, and more sunlight is an even better thing to have.

501
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:14,401
I'm certain that 300 feet isn't enough in all cases.

502
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:18,426
I'm not even sure that 400 feet is enough in some cases.

503
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:26,215
Emory Street is a thousand feet long and it's one way and it's only a block and a half.

504
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:31,120
Anybody who lives in the first block is going to drive by or walk by

505
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,303
houses that are at the beginning.

506
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:38,145
And they're going to be affected one way or the other.

507
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:51,293
I think it's important to let as many people as, you know, you shouldn't let the whole city know, but there's, as I think the solicitor was saying, it's drawing the line.

508
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:54,435
And I think the 300 foot line is too short.

509
00:53:55,948 --> 00:53:58,692
and maybe the 400 feet is enough.

510
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:00,274
It's the right direction.

511
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:00,715
Thank you.

512
00:54:00,955 --> 00:54:01,316
Thank you.

513
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:04,280
Councilor Locren, motion is on the floor.

514
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,062
I didn't know if anybody else wanted to speak, I think.

515
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,622
Name, address, or the record, please.

516
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:14,144
Elizabeth Bale, 34 Emory Street.

517
00:54:14,725 --> 00:54:16,326
I appreciate this discussion.

518
00:54:16,526 --> 00:54:19,268
I think that some really good points are being made.

519
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:26,775
And I would appreciate some language that draws the line with this.

520
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:30,398
And I'm not sure what that should be.

521
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,880
For example, on our street, Emory Street,

522
00:54:36,517 --> 00:54:54,704
Change that there's a definite changeover going on from single-family houses being changed to multifamily houses Which are being snapped up by absentee landlords that are renting to students that has changed the nature of our street drastically, and it really

523
00:54:56,405 --> 00:55:00,187
Has an effect on a negative effect on our quality of life.

524
00:55:00,347 --> 00:55:20,680
So I'm just submitting that as an example along with Councilor Mangocon's point about changing from a You know say from a two-family to a three-family or especially I feel a single family to a multi-family it really things that can change the character of a neighborhood

525
00:55:23,681 --> 00:55:39,389
And I can't pretend that I know what the way is, but I would encourage you to try to find it and to add it, rather than just sending this as written for a public hearing.

526
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:44,852
Because I think people are going to get agitated, to Councilor Falco's point, if you want to add it.

527
00:55:45,432 --> 00:55:50,296
do a deck or something to have to have, it's not the cost, I don't think.

528
00:55:50,857 --> 00:56:02,606
It's just the burden of having a lot of people being able to chime in on a project that shouldn't really, it's not really gonna affect their lives versus one that will.

529
00:56:04,308 --> 00:56:05,268
So that's all I have to say.

530
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:10,132
Thank you very much for bringing this up and discussing the consequences.

531
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:11,533
Council Member Kern.

532
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:15,377
Thank you, President Carviello.

533
00:56:15,837 --> 00:56:26,486
I guess to my two colleagues that want to do the site plan review, my question would be, what about notice with regards to any unit, any housing unit?

534
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:29,308
You still think that's too much notice?

535
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:36,915
Versus six plus, what about any unit, any housing unit?

536
00:56:36,975 --> 00:56:37,115
Yeah.

537
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:46,623
If I may, because I think that is definitely a legitimate concern about when you're adding units to existing units.

538
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:49,964
So if we can work on a compromise, I'm all for it.

539
00:56:50,804 --> 00:57:05,807
So I was wondering, City Solicitor Rumley, is there a way that we can, and I'm not sure if you could give us an opinion on this, but right now if the amendment is only apply where site plan review is required, could we also put or if,

540
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:08,628
you know, something.

541
00:57:08,648 --> 00:57:09,849
A housing unit is to be added.

542
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:17,614
Yeah, or if an existing unit is adding additional units, can we, can we, or if you have a recommendation as to some order.

543
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,776
Well, I'm gonna, I've listened and done my share of speaking tonight.

544
00:57:22,136 --> 00:57:24,538
The line can be drawn a whole bunch of places.

545
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:30,361
So I would suggest, and I don't know how you feel about this, that you just send the resolution up.

546
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:52,022
with an amendment that says that the city council suggests or recommends that the planning board discuss viable alternatives for the applicability of this expanded notification, such as

547
00:57:53,442 --> 00:58:03,832
applying it only to projects that are subject to site plan review or the conversion of housing to more units than it presently has.

548
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:05,473
Something like that.

549
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,555
That's the best I can come up with off the top of my head.

550
00:58:07,575 --> 00:58:08,196
Move approval.

551
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:09,177
I didn't write it down.

552
00:58:09,257 --> 00:58:11,419
Did you get that Mr. Finn?

553
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:12,780
I'd be fine with that amendment.

554
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,501
Did you get that?

555
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:34,809
So on the motion by Councilor O'Connor, as amended that the City Council ask for viable alternatives to housing for applicability.

556
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:37,590
Housing applicability.

557
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,132
As amended by Councilor Lococo.

558
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:41,913
As amended.

559
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:44,235
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

560
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:44,816
Roll call.

561
00:58:45,156 --> 00:58:46,858
Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

562

01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:46,815
Yes, Alicia Nunley Benjamin, Finance Director, Auditor for the City of Medford.

591
01:00:47,695 --> 01:00:51,358
And Kenneth Stein, Interim Assessor for the Board of Assessors.

592
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:52,639
Thank you.

593
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:00,664
Tonight, I'd like you to accept the residential factor at 0.906926, which will produce the 175% shift.

594
01:01:16,745 --> 01:01:20,987
I'm sorry, okay.

595
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:23,928
The residential factor for this evening is 0.906, 926, which will produce a 175% shift.

596
01:01:23,968 --> 01:01:24,528
On the motion.

597
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:26,188
On the motion to.

598
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:26,769
I'm sorry.

599
01:01:40,983 --> 01:01:44,706
on the motion by Councilor Knight to accept the residential factor.

600
01:01:44,946 --> 01:01:46,327
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

601
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,108
All those in favor?

602
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:52,812
Motion passes.

603
01:01:53,212 --> 01:01:56,675
I'm sorry.

604
01:01:56,755 --> 01:02:00,197
It's the public hearing at the moment, Mr. Storaro.

605
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:05,021
Motion passed before there was any discussion.

606
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:13,926
and I didn't hear the councilors discuss this and I didn't hear the audience invited up to it being a public hearing.

607
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:15,689
Motion for reconsideration.

608
01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:27,532
Uh, I, I did have, I did have some comments here and it seemed like he gathered my papers here.

609
01:02:27,552 --> 01:02:30,354
Uh, point of order, Mr. President.

610
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,134
Yes, Mr. Donaldson.

611
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:40,400
Uh, we in the public, uh, forum of the, uh, public hearing in those in opposition or in those in favor, Mr. President?

612
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,761
Mr. Starella is in opposition.

613
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:43,482
Opposition.

614
01:02:43,962 --> 01:02:44,242
Correct?

615
01:02:44,822 --> 01:02:46,103
No, I'm not in opposition.

616
01:02:46,123 --> 01:02:46,924
I'm neutral.

617
01:02:47,544 --> 01:02:51,986
But I do want it discussed on an information basis.

618
01:02:52,727 --> 01:03:03,013
I want the counselors who already know all about this, but the audience out there, the people, they don't understand this, most of my sayings.

619
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,974
We have to know if there's anyone else in opposition first.

620
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:06,215
Okay, go ahead.

621
01:03:06,255 --> 01:03:08,196
Is there anyone else in opposition to the resident?

622
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:09,478
By the way, I'm not in opposition.

623
01:03:09,778 --> 01:03:12,560
Okay, so you're in favor of it?

624
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:14,002
No, not yet.

625
01:03:14,642 --> 01:03:17,645
Okay, this is a public hearing, Dr. Straub.

626
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:21,108
So you're either in favor or you're opposed.

627
01:03:23,518 --> 01:03:28,300
At this point, let's move to the public hearing.

628
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,880
I'm in favor of an understanding.

629
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,321
Thank you.

630
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:33,862
And you can come back and speak after we.

631
01:03:33,962 --> 01:03:34,582
Certainly.

632
01:03:35,442 --> 01:03:36,883
Is there anyone in opposition?

633
01:03:36,903 --> 01:03:38,263
I await your invitation.

634
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,984
Thank you.

635
01:03:40,004 --> 01:03:41,184
Is there anyone in opposition?

636
01:03:42,545 --> 01:03:43,585
Hearing and seeing none.

637
01:03:43,605 --> 01:03:45,786
Motion to hear and close.

638
01:03:45,806 --> 01:03:46,947
We motion to not file the hearing and close.

639
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:48,687
Now you can address.

640
01:03:49,548 --> 01:03:50,408
Okay, now you can address.

641
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,281
Mr. President, point of order.

642
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:54,942
Councilor DelaRusso.

643
01:03:55,262 --> 01:03:58,965
Are we now in the portion of the meeting that we can openly discuss and debate?

644
01:03:58,985 --> 01:03:59,325
Yes, we are.

645
01:03:59,845 --> 01:04:01,186
The format is before us.

646
01:04:01,206 --> 01:04:01,646
Yes, we are.

647
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:02,247
Thank you.

648
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:02,747
Thank you.

649
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:04,728
Name and address of the record, please.

650
01:04:04,748 --> 01:04:05,949
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

651
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:11,012
My name is John Strahler, and I reside at 20 Metcalf Street, right here in Medford.

652
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:15,075
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak.

653
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:18,137
And thank you to the city council.

654
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:28,740
which I would like to thank individually for the opportunity to exercise our First Amendment right, freedom of speech.

655
01:04:31,222 --> 01:04:32,902
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

656
01:04:34,323 --> 01:04:36,524
Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kern.

657
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,606
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

658
01:04:40,306 --> 01:04:41,646
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

659
01:04:41,987 --> 01:04:44,028
Thank you, Councilor De La Russo.

660
01:04:44,488 --> 01:04:46,609
Thank you, Councilor Favreau.

661
01:04:48,419 --> 01:04:51,801
The property tax has already been passed.

662
01:04:53,062 --> 01:04:55,384
It was passed in June of 2017.

663
01:04:55,464 --> 01:04:58,446
That was six months ago.

664
01:04:59,467 --> 01:05:05,191
It was passed by a unanimous vote of the city council at $109.5 million, the most allowed.

665
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:20,065
All seven councilors voted and the mayor approved a $54 million increase in the property tax.

666
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:23,226
I mean, I'm sorry, I want to correct that.

667
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:24,987
A $4 million increase.

668
01:05:25,948 --> 01:05:27,909
Because last year it was $105 million.

669
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:29,730
This year it's $109 million.

670
01:05:31,851 --> 01:05:37,874
And the council passed the same $4 million increase in June of 2016.

671
01:05:40,443 --> 01:05:42,385
Again, in June of 2017.

672
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:49,710
And it's already scheduled to do it again in June of 2018.

673
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:58,637
We can predict right now that this city council will pass a $4 million increase in June of 2018.

674
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,742
Now, the reason the council does that is because you cannot run the city without that increase.

675
01:06:05,902 --> 01:06:07,123
You cannot pay the help.

676
01:06:08,523 --> 01:06:10,965
So it must be passed with that increase.

677
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:19,390
That's why we went from $105 million last year for a property tax to $109.5 million this year.

678
01:06:25,469 --> 01:06:26,950
Let's catch up here.

679
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:38,817
Now, without the annual property tax, as I said, without that increase, the Memphis City government will not be able to adequately compensate our loyal civil servants.

680
01:06:40,158 --> 01:06:47,163
So, if the highest ever property tax is already the law, why are we here?

681
01:06:49,144 --> 01:06:50,765
That's what the discussion is about.

682
01:06:52,248 --> 01:07:00,475
The city council is here now to decide who will pay for the property tax.

683
01:07:00,835 --> 01:07:02,577
That's what's gonna be determined tonight.

684
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,560
Not whether or not there is a tax, not how much the tax is.

685
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:08,322
We've already decided how much it is.

686
01:07:09,003 --> 01:07:12,145
This council is gonna decide who is going to pay for it.

687
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:14,367
By the way, it's not paid equally.

688
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:19,532
It is decided on a sometimes political basis.

689
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:26,331
The council will choose who among our tax groups will pay and how much each group will pay.

690
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:34,977
The 109, oh, by the way, Mr. President, this does not carry on for long, so please bear with me.

691
01:07:35,437 --> 01:07:45,564
The $109 million property tax, if divided evenly and fairly, would come to a rate of $11.30 for each $1,000 of assessed property.

692
01:07:46,945 --> 01:07:47,946
That seems fair.

693
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:50,248
The minimum commercial shift

694
01:07:51,498 --> 01:07:52,339
in the state law.

695
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:56,963
Now when I say commercial, I'm talking about CIPs, commercial, industrial, and personal property.

696
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:00,686
The minimum commercial shift in the state law is 1.75.

697
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:05,290
I mean, you can't shift less than that.

698
01:08:06,472 --> 01:08:09,194
And that makes the minimum residential factor 90.7.

699
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:15,380
That's what Auditor Nunley was referring to.

700
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:21,188
leaving the commercials that have 10% of the property to pay 20% of the tax.

701
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:21,889
Now think of that.

702
01:08:22,869 --> 01:08:27,270
The commercials have only 10% of the property, but they pay 20% of the tax.

703
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:33,212
The residents, that's all of us, who own 90% of the property pay only 80% of the tax.

704
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:45,002
I don't know if that's fair, but that is saving, is a saving which the council later takes away from our residents.

705
01:08:45,682 --> 01:09:01,906
Now the council wants to help the residents by having them pay less than the commercials, but later on it takes that away if, and this is where the two are connected, if it does not pass the residential exemption, the 35% exemption has got to be passed too.

706
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:07,227
That's why these have to be discussed mutually, together, at the same time.

707
01:09:08,247 --> 01:09:11,248
Do you see how convoluted the government has made this?

708
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:15,529
The commercials are the ones who invest their money in Medford.

709
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:17,510
They build the squares.

710
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:22,811
They provide the services and provide jobs to Medford residents.

711
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:28,192
And they, the commercials, are punished by the city.

712
01:09:29,553 --> 01:09:29,873
Pardon me.

713
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:43,827
Now, with reference to the residential exemption, if the residential exemption allows residents to pay less of the property tax and the commercials to pay more, guess what?

714
01:09:44,648 --> 01:10:08,141
If the residential exemption of 35% is not passed, those same residents who are owner-occupiers would be deprived of the tax gain which the council wanted to award them, and it would be given to the non-occupying investors who are already collecting huge rents at big profits, up to $3,000 a month for an apartment.

715
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:15,526
So the resident taxpayers bear the burden of the property tax.

716
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:19,469
Is that what the city council wants?

717
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:27,935
The city council wants the residents to think that they are favoring them, and then by not passing the residential exemption, they take that away.

718
01:10:30,197 --> 01:10:36,522
Anyway, to conclude, they always say that, don't they, to conclude.

719
01:10:37,428 --> 01:10:38,150
But they go on.

720
01:10:39,794 --> 01:10:41,217
A residential exemption.

721
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:47,746
would save the owner-occupied properties $800 to $1,000 a year, that's all.

722
01:10:48,106 --> 01:10:50,706
People are paying $5,000, $6,000 in taxes.

723
01:10:51,006 --> 01:10:58,188
Now this saves the people who own their homes and occupy them somewhere from $800 to $1,000 a year.

724
01:11:01,268 --> 01:11:08,710
The assessor could not come up with a number, but this is a reasonable number, and it seems that the average tax say is $5,000 to $6,000.

725
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,310
This would save them,

726
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:21,495
If you live in a single family house and you occupy it, your tax would, instead of being say $5,000, would be $4,200.

727
01:11:22,376 --> 01:11:39,665
The cities in the area already using, now there's cities already using this residential exemption are Chelsea, Somerville, Boston, Cambridge, Malden, Everett, Waltham, and Watertown.

728
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,081
Thank you, Mr. President.

729
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:42,881
Thank you, Dr. Straub.

730
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:43,861
Thank you, Dr. Straub.

731
01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:45,802
Thank you.

732
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:46,763
Thank you.

733
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:48,864
Thank you.

734
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:50,285
Thank you.

735
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,358
Apologize, can you go over the number one again?

736
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:01,859
Sure.

737
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:04,502
The determine the residential factor to be used in fiscal year 2018.

738
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:05,644
What was the number again?

739
01:12:05,664 --> 01:12:07,867
The number for the residential factor is 0.906926 to produce the 175% shift.

740
01:12:18,882 --> 01:12:22,483
on the motion to accept the residential factor.

741
01:12:23,043 --> 01:12:24,883
With the roll call, Mr. President.

742
01:12:24,943 --> 01:12:25,644
Roll call.

743
01:12:26,004 --> 01:12:26,864
Councilor Lengelkram.

744
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:32,225
Thank you, President Carviello, and thank you, Dr. Storillo, for your speech.

745
01:12:32,725 --> 01:12:45,708
I think the residential factor was brought up by Dr. Storillo, and it's something we discussed in depth today at our Committee of the Whole meeting at 6 and last week, and I thank the consultant and Ms.

746
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:46,728
Nunley for giving us

747
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:57,048
answers to all the questions we did ask and that fifth document we did want was a breakdown of the break even point and I just think it's worth some

748
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:13,938
a summary or some clarification for the viewing public, because I know once a month I feel like I get an email, why doesn't Medford have the residential exemption when it comes to owner-occupied versus non-owner-occupied?

749
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:22,663
And the answer I always give is because although we'd be helping the owner-occupied parcels, we'd also be burdening

750
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:32,669
about this year would be about 1,300 properties that are above $720,000.

751
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,571
And that's always the answer that I give.

752
01:13:36,072 --> 01:13:37,973
But sometimes it's almost not good enough.

753
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:40,875
And there are a lot of people struggling, I think, on both ends.

754
01:13:40,955 --> 01:13:46,699
And this council's never adopted the residential owner-occupied exemption.

755
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:48,720
And I think it's just

756
01:13:49,482 --> 01:13:52,845
It's good for the public to know that we are going to look into getting new data.

757
01:13:53,265 --> 01:14:02,652
Our data is five to six years old and we did request at our Committee of the Whole meeting to get new data so we can get better, more clear and accurate numbers.

758
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:08,156
Because if you look at a property that is worth a million dollars, if we took the shift at 5%

759
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:12,386
they'd be paying about an extra $110.

760
01:14:12,606 --> 01:14:17,268
If we took it at 20%, they'd be paying an extra $500.

761
01:14:17,388 --> 01:14:23,471
And that's, I think, something that's obviously the sticking point of doing this shift that a number of communities do do.

762
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:27,713
So I don't know if you could add anything else, just to educate the public a little more.

763
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:33,355
Because it is something that a lot of people do ask us, please accept this shift.

764
01:14:33,455 --> 01:14:36,777
And we're left explaining time after time after time.

765
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:38,438
what the issues are.

766
01:14:38,678 --> 01:14:42,059
It's a program that's revenue neutral for the city.

767
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:58,527
What it does is only within the residential class, it cuts the taxes of those properties qualifying as owner-occupied, and to make up for that, increases the tax on two classes of property.

768
01:14:58,767 --> 01:15:01,168
One, those that are above that so-called

769
01:15:02,128 --> 01:15:20,201
break-even point that are still worse off with a residential exemption than if the city didn't have it, and it also increases the tax on all those properties that don't qualify for the residential exemption, particularly rental properties, apartments, and so forth.

770
01:15:21,402 --> 01:15:36,588
So it's a cost-benefit analysis and an economic analysis for the council each year to determine is it worth the benefit to those people that qualify to increase the taxes on those people that don't qualify.

771
01:15:37,608 --> 01:15:44,891
And of the 351 towns and cities, right now I think only 13 actually have adopted it.

772
01:15:47,053 --> 01:15:47,353
Thank you.

773
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:54,278
And with regard to that, we did take a vote to get more updated data.

774
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:55,719
And I believe, Ms.

775
01:15:55,759 --> 01:16:00,542
Nunley, you did say that that is something the city is willing to pursue if the mayor and the council.

776
01:16:00,663 --> 01:16:02,544
Yes, the administration is absolutely open to that.

777
01:16:02,904 --> 01:16:22,957
So I just want to put that on record that we were told that the city is going to pursue getting us more accurate data and I think that will allow us, with this breakdown, number 5 of what we have in our packet, I think updated data, having this as well as what the savings would be for the owner occupied under 720 or whatever that number may be next year.

778
01:16:23,437 --> 01:16:29,361
I think we can make a more educated decision on whether or not to do it or maybe try it at 5% or whatnot.

779
01:16:29,421 --> 01:16:32,223
And I think that's just important to point out that we are looking into it.

780
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:37,547
We've looked into it, I think, two times in depth in the past 10 plus years.

781
01:16:38,187 --> 01:16:44,212
And I think if we can get this more updated data, it's something we can definitely think about again next year.

782
01:16:44,692 --> 01:16:45,012
Thank you.

783
01:16:45,052 --> 01:16:45,553
Vice President Mox.

784
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:48,078
Thank you, Mr. President.

785
01:16:49,878 --> 01:16:57,922
As was stated, this has been an issue before this council for, geez, the last probably five to eight years regarding a residential exemption.

786
01:16:58,642 --> 01:17:01,683
And my stance has always been the same, Mr. President.

787
01:17:02,704 --> 01:17:12,668
You know, in theory, it sounds great if you can shift to those that aren't living in their property and using them as income.

788
01:17:13,368 --> 01:17:23,010
you know, that are living outside this community, or maybe even inside this community that have rental apartments, shift the burden to them and take it off the people that live in their homes.

789
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:24,651
That sounds perfect.

790
01:17:25,211 --> 01:17:26,091
Sign me up for it.

791
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:29,052
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

792
01:17:29,572 --> 01:17:43,055
And what we've been told by the assessor's office, not only this year, but in past years, there's roughly a thousand or some homes in the community that will not get this benefit that actually live in their home.

793
01:17:43,796 --> 01:17:53,808
So if you're above the 720,000, I believe it is, assessed value, you could potentially pay more, even though you live in your home and we're giving out exemptions.

794
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:55,630
To me, that is unfair.

795
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,814
I cannot support that, Mr. President.

796
01:17:59,995 --> 01:18:04,997
care of the lion's share of people living in their homes, but what about the other percent?

797
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:09,359
I represent everyone in this community, and in my opinion, it's not fair.

798
01:18:09,979 --> 01:18:16,302
And the second point is that you have many elderly people in this community that are property rich.

799
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:22,845
So you may have someone that bought their home 55, 60 years ago, and their home is assessed at $800,000, $900,000.

800
01:18:23,886 --> 01:18:29,209
And the woman is living there by herself now on a fixed income.

801
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:30,429
And guess what?

802
01:18:30,989 --> 01:18:43,016
Based on what we're being presented for this exemption, that particular woman living by herself in a $900,000 house, she's property rich, would pay more under that proposal.

803
01:18:43,516 --> 01:18:44,738
And I cannot support that.

804
01:18:45,218 --> 01:18:46,179
I cannot support that.

805
01:18:46,560 --> 01:19:01,597
Someday, like other communities, it'll average out like they do in Malden, in Somerville, in Cambridge, that there are a fair number of non-owner-occupied in the city that you could shift the entire burden to them.

806
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,259
We in this community don't have that shift yet.

807
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,261
It doesn't work for our community yet.

808
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:07,422
Someday it may.

809
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:11,646
At the rate, you know, properties go into this community, it may work that way.

810
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:21,775
But currently right now, Mr. President, I cannot support that because it leaves out over a thousand homeowners in this community that will fall above the $720,000

811
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:28,118
and that live in their property, and that they will end up paying more.

812
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:37,442
So that's where I stand, Mr. President, on this, and I appreciate the fact that we will get updated information, and maybe next year or the following year, who knows?

813
01:19:37,922 --> 01:19:45,224
At that point, it may work, and I'll be the first to vote to shift it to the non-owned occupied, but not at this point, Mr. President.

814
01:19:45,444 --> 01:19:46,405
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

815
01:19:48,045 --> 01:19:52,847
On the first question, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

816
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:56,798
What is the question, sir?

817
01:19:57,219 --> 01:20:01,105
The question is to determine the residential factor to be used in fiscal year 2018.

818
01:20:06,487 --> 01:20:08,369
Dr. Stroud, do you have something to add?

819
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:11,771
Yes, I want to respond to what the councilors have said.

820
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:16,755
They are very much concerned about the 1,000 people who will pay more.

821
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:20,678
And we talk about $900,000 value homes.

822
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:23,080
How many of those are there in Medford, please?

823
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,501
Awful lot.

824
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:24,341
How many?

825
01:20:24,642 --> 01:20:25,282
An awful lot.

826
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:26,243
How many, well.

827
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:27,284
1,300 at the moment.

828
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:29,045
All right, now if you want to talk about the 1,000.

829
01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:29,045
1,300. 1,300.

830
01:20:32,909 --> 01:20:33,610
All right, 1,300.

831
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:39,298
Well, there are 13,000 which are unoccupied.

832
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:42,623
1,300 on one side, 13,000 on the other side.

833
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:46,028
I think this council should take care of the majority of the people.

834
01:20:46,549 --> 01:20:48,492
My opinion is- Point of information, Councilor Naith.

835
01:20:49,581 --> 01:21:00,063
I think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that the assessor's office in their presentation noted that the data that they were using to determine how many homes in this community were owner-occupied was certainly outdated.

836
01:21:00,224 --> 01:21:03,784
Therefore, all the data that was generated is garbage in, garbage out.

837
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:05,805
So we really don't have an accurate representation.

838
01:21:05,865 --> 01:21:09,766
All we know is that based on the materials that we had before us this evening, we weren't ready to go forward.

839
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:18,588
We recognize the fact that the information that we had before us was deficient, and we're asking the administration to go forward and get us the appropriate information so that in the future we can make an informed decision.

840
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:19,388
That is correct.

841
01:21:19,648 --> 01:21:20,449
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

842
01:21:21,249 --> 01:21:22,430
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

843
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:25,972
Councilor DelaRusso?

844
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:26,473
Yay.

845
01:21:27,293 --> 01:21:28,014
Councilor Falco?

846
01:21:28,374 --> 01:21:28,574
Yes.

847
01:21:29,075 --> 01:21:29,595
Councilor Knight?

848
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:30,035
Yes.

849
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:31,416
Councilor Lockerran?

850
01:21:31,957 --> 01:21:32,097
Yes.

851
01:21:32,897 --> 01:21:33,658
Vice President Monson?

852
01:21:34,138 --> 01:21:34,458
Yes.

853
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:35,839
Councilor Scott Pelli?

854
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:36,220
Yes.

855
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,340
President Caviello?

856
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:37,580
Yes.

857
01:21:37,901 --> 01:21:39,902
Seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.

858
01:21:39,922 --> 01:21:43,565
Number two, to select an open space discount.

859
01:21:44,411 --> 01:21:49,434
We don't have any open space currently classified in measure.

860
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:51,075
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

861
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:54,257
Do not adopt the open space discounts.

862
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:55,558
Councilor Del Rosso.

863
01:22:14,573 --> 01:22:18,355
I'm on the agenda, it says select an open space discount.

864
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:21,417
We don't have one.

865
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,939
The way that the clerk put it was the motion by Councilor Nantz did not adopt.

866
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:28,361
So my motion would be to make a motion, you would have to vote in favor.

867
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:34,104
This here, the old language is different than we have, where I used 15 years.

868
01:22:34,164 --> 01:22:39,607
So Councilor Nantz, yes vote would not adopt the open space discount.

869
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:44,436
I'm just saying turn their microphones on, people are wondering what they're saying.

870
01:22:44,456 --> 01:22:53,539
A yes vote would not adopt the open space discount, am I correct?

871
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:59,621
The motion that was made was a motion to not adopt, which would mean that the yes vote would be the negative on the question.

872
01:23:01,762 --> 01:23:03,643
That is the motion, yay.

873
01:23:06,241 --> 01:23:06,961
Councilor Falco.

874
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:07,782
Yes.

875
01:23:08,402 --> 01:23:08,942
Councilor Nye.

876
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:09,282
Yes.

877
01:23:09,963 --> 01:23:10,643
Councilor Kerr.

878
01:23:10,803 --> 01:23:11,023
Yes.

879
01:23:11,563 --> 01:23:12,304
Vice President Marks.

880
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:12,684
Yes.

881
01:23:13,104 --> 01:23:13,844
Councilor Scarpelli.

882
01:23:13,904 --> 01:23:14,205
Yes.

883
01:23:14,645 --> 01:23:15,305
President Caviello.

884
01:23:15,645 --> 01:23:18,086
Yes, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

885
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:23,128
Number three, to select a residential exemption.

886
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:33,213
Motion by Councilor Nye not to adopt a residential exemption.

887
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,098
We have someone who would like to speak.

888
01:23:38,419 --> 01:23:39,639
Name and address of the record, please.

889
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,961
Thank you, Honorable Council President.

890
01:23:46,281 --> 01:23:49,963
Andrew Castanetti, Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts.

891
01:23:51,808 --> 01:23:53,149
I'm a little bit disconnected here.

892
01:23:53,169 --> 01:23:54,549
I had to go home for some papers.

893
01:23:55,890 --> 01:24:05,755
And the information that I received today was actually not the answer I was looking for from the assessor's office.

894
01:24:07,196 --> 01:24:10,318
So first of all, good evening, honorable counselors.

895
01:24:15,186 --> 01:24:17,468
Please bear with me because I'm a bit disconnected here.

896
01:24:18,589 --> 01:24:32,823
This is probably my seventh and a half year that I've come here for this month of December as you set the tax rate or post to elect a residential owner exemption or not.

897
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:39,229
And without success in the last 7.5 years that I've come before you since 2009, I believe.

898
01:24:41,893 --> 01:24:58,348
When I ran for city council, my platform mission was, and still is, which I like to pass out, because some councilors had requested my political brochure, so I would like to.

899
01:24:58,368 --> 01:24:59,890
We're not handing out political brochures.

900
01:25:00,631 --> 01:25:01,732
No, this is information.

901
01:25:02,172 --> 01:25:07,237
It's about the real estate tax exemption, and if I may give it to the,

902
01:25:09,365 --> 01:25:15,091
Mr. Clerk, Mr. Lepore, the seven for the council, one specifically for Ms.

903
01:25:15,171 --> 01:25:16,092
Mayor Muccini-Burke.

904
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:20,191
I would like you to pass them out after I'm done, please.

905
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:20,991
Not now.

906
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:23,411
Thank you very much for your consideration.

907
01:25:24,372 --> 01:25:30,213
My priority number one for the community, for the people, is to improve public safety.

908
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:34,775
Number two, improve maintenance of public buildings and city infrastructure.

909
01:25:34,815 --> 01:25:37,995
Number three, encourage fiscal responsibility.

910
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:41,256
Number four, promote responsible development.

911
01:25:42,557 --> 01:25:43,377
And number five,

912
01:25:44,944 --> 01:25:54,129
My special interest would be to reduce real estate tax bills for owner-occupied.

913
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:57,650
Andy, I asked you not to give out any political literature.

914
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,831
This is about the- This is political literature on here.

915
01:26:00,932 --> 01:26:01,732
That's old news.

916
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:03,013
It's political literature.

917
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,974
It's just about the owner-occupied exemption.

918
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:06,915
It's political literature.

919
01:26:06,955 --> 01:26:07,635
Number five.

920
01:26:07,655 --> 01:26:08,816
Mr. Clerk, please take those back.

921
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:10,817
It's political literature.

922
01:26:12,552 --> 01:26:13,173
You can keep it.

923
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,193
Thank you, Brianna.

924
01:26:14,814 --> 01:26:15,715
That's political literature, Andy.

925
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:16,676
I asked you not to give it up.

926
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:18,797
No, it's obsolete.

927
01:26:19,338 --> 01:26:20,699
It's political literature.

928
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,580
Okay, you win.

929
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:27,825
I still would like to speak on behalf of the majority of the homeowners.

930
01:26:29,446 --> 01:26:40,856
Number five, I would want to reduce real estate tax bills for owner-occupied homeowners by adopting the full 35% under Massachusetts general law

931
01:26:42,657 --> 01:27:00,371
Chapter 59, Section 5C, as it is done, as Dr. Sturela said, in Somerville, Malden, Everett, all of Boston, and other area communities, to provide some long overdue tax relief to homeowners.

932
01:27:06,997 --> 01:27:10,400
Please be aware and assured

933
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:15,093
all seven counselors, and Ms.

934
01:27:15,153 --> 01:27:22,658
Mayor Burke, the city would not lose any real estate tax dollars.

935
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:31,684
They still will receive the whole real estate tax levy of $109.5 million, as they want, with a 4% increase from last year.

936
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:55,930
Our savings will simply be paid for by all others, such as absentee, residential only, residential homeowners who are absentee landlords, period.

937
01:27:57,313 --> 01:28:07,366
At the tune of whatever it cost on their bill, I didn't get enough current factual information to write this number in.

938
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:09,710
However, I may continue.

939
01:28:11,372 --> 01:28:19,454
On average, these absentee owners, they're collecting $2,000 a month rent.

940
01:28:19,854 --> 01:28:26,596
If it's a two family, you're talking $48,000 in rents, even if they had an $800 increase.

941
01:28:28,357 --> 01:28:32,838
They're still generating $48,000 and not living in our neighborhoods.

942
01:28:36,782 --> 01:28:41,643
You, the city councilors and the mayor, have before you an opportunity of a lifetime.

943
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:56,348
If you adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, the people would benefit greatly.

944
01:28:57,328 --> 01:29:06,391
Now, I don't have all my information because of other circumstances that I had no control over.

945
01:29:08,294 --> 01:29:23,643
However, I have a packet from the assessor's office that was given out a week ago, last Wednesday, and it states the communities and cities and towns that give out this owner-occupied exemption.

946
01:29:25,584 --> 01:29:31,027
And we're talking, as I said, Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville.

947
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:42,505
And the numbers I'm seeing here that they're saving on real estate tax bills, like the lowest is like $1,400 a year, and that is in Chelsea.

948
01:29:43,146 --> 01:29:50,269
And that is where the interim director of the assessor's office, Mr. Ken Stein, who's here this evening,

949
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,353
was working in that department.

950
01:29:54,214 --> 01:30:00,364
And I just found out this evening that the owner-occupied exemption was in effect prior to him working there in 1999.

951
01:30:04,245 --> 01:30:08,327
Wow, this has been around since the millennium.

952
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:10,287
This is over 17 years.

953
01:30:10,748 --> 01:30:18,631
If we're losing $1,000 a year for the average homeowner, and I'm talking nine out of 10, if you live in the house, that's 90%, 900% Batten average.

954
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:19,351
That's incredible.

955
01:30:24,259 --> 01:30:38,402
And furthermore, if that 10th person has an increase, it may indeed be less of an increase if we were not to adopt this wonderful law that was thought up by Massachusetts legislators.

956
01:30:39,163 --> 01:30:48,365
Finally, they come up with a solution to keep maybe the seniors to be able to afford to live in their town.

957
01:30:50,105 --> 01:30:53,166
because the real estate taxes are just too much for them to carry.

958
01:30:54,127 --> 01:31:07,432
And furthermore, I don't want to get off track, but the gentleman, Mr. Ken Stein, the interim assessor did say, Chelsea's been doing it since 19, prior to 1999.

959
01:31:09,973 --> 01:31:11,834
That's a lot of thousand dollar bills every year.

960
01:31:16,756 --> 01:31:19,217
I don't understand why this is not being done here.

961
01:31:21,054 --> 01:31:35,788
But in closing, lots of people, including City Hall employees, especially actually, asked me, why not here in 02155?

962
01:31:37,069 --> 01:31:38,791
I replied, I'm not sure.

963
01:31:39,772 --> 01:31:45,858
So I spoke to Bernie Sanders, and he said, Andrew, the system is rigged.

964
01:31:47,419 --> 01:32:00,150
He said, the political donations come from not you, with the empty two-family home on Cushing Street, it comes from the well-to-do, a la the corporate world, businesses, and the like.

965
01:32:02,031 --> 01:32:07,696
I hope he's wrong, because we must save the middle class from becoming extinct.

966
01:32:08,917 --> 01:32:14,222
If we're gonna have a society worth a damn, please give the average homeowner

967
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:23,573
90% of them, a 1,000 plus, who knows how much, can't get a straight answer.

968
01:32:25,274 --> 01:32:25,634
Sad.

969
01:32:25,654 --> 01:32:33,819
Give them a nice present for Christmas for the first time ever in history, and go to 155.

970
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:34,619
Thank you.

971
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,542
On the motion to accept,

972
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:42,431
Name and address of the record.

973
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:45,432
John Starella, 20 Metcalf Street.

974
01:32:47,013 --> 01:32:52,676
Mr. President, this city council continues to kick this can down the road.

975
01:32:54,577 --> 01:33:01,021
Through parliamentary maneuvers, they push this forward and don't deal with the question.

976
01:33:01,821 --> 01:33:09,886
But someday, I wish one of them would explain to me why they continue to favor millionaire owners

977
01:33:11,247 --> 01:33:25,591
who don't live in Medford, who are collecting as much as $36,000 a year in rents, but they will not help the owner-occupied residents of Medford.

978
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:27,292
Thank you.

979
01:33:29,992 --> 01:33:30,873
Councilor Neist.

980
01:33:30,993 --> 01:33:32,093
Move the question.

981
01:33:32,433 --> 01:33:37,234
On the question, number three, to select a residential exemption.

982
01:33:37,274 --> 01:33:38,955
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

983
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:44,187
Councilor Dela Russo?

984
01:33:44,247 --> 01:33:44,527
Nay.

985
01:33:48,168 --> 01:33:48,888
Councilor Falcone?

986
01:33:48,948 --> 01:33:49,128
No.

987
01:33:50,228 --> 01:33:50,709
Councilor Nye?

988
01:33:50,809 --> 01:33:51,389
No.

989
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:53,389
Councilor Lococo?

990
01:33:53,429 --> 01:33:53,529
No.

991
01:33:54,989 --> 01:33:55,730
Vice-President Mox?

992
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:56,190
No.

993
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:57,810
Councilor Scarpelli?

994
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:58,070
No.

995
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,650
Vice-President Caviello?

996
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,190
No.

997
01:34:00,931 --> 01:34:03,271
Seven in the negative, motion fails.

998
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:08,972
Number four, to select a small commercial exemption.

999
01:34:11,533 --> 01:34:11,833
Mr. Stein?

1000
01:34:14,063 --> 01:34:23,106
The Small Commercial Exemption is another tax-shifting program which shifts tax within the commercial and industrial class only.

1001
01:34:24,086 --> 01:34:30,408
It's a program that needs to be adopted well in advance of the setting of the tax rate because it requires

1002
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:46,015
application, it requires certification from the Department of Workforce Development, and serves again to increase the tax rate to make up for anything that is exempted.

1003
01:34:48,236 --> 01:34:48,576
It says the

1004
01:34:50,003 --> 01:35:08,024
With the approval of the council, may grant a small commercial exemption to all commercial industrial properties occupied by businesses with an average annual employment of no more than 10 people and assessed value of less than a million dollars.

1005
01:35:08,825 --> 01:35:12,447
The exemption may not exceed 10% of the assessed value.

1006
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:23,893
And to qualify, the director of the Department of Workforce Development must certify that it has an average annual employment of 10 or few people, et cetera, et cetera.

1007
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:33,457
This is something that can be done, but it would normally be begun and analyzed during the summer months and prepared

1008
01:35:34,998 --> 01:35:38,742
as part of the recap submission against a tax shift.

1009
01:35:38,762 --> 01:35:40,464
Thank you.

1010
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:44,909
On the motion by Councilor Del Rosso to move the question, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1011
01:35:48,873 --> 01:35:49,694
Councilor Del Rosso.

1012
01:35:49,734 --> 01:35:50,014
Nay.

1013
01:35:50,775 --> 01:35:51,556
Councilor Falcone.

1014
01:35:51,816 --> 01:35:51,977
No.

1015
01:35:52,857 --> 01:35:53,438
Councilor Nay.

1016
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,520
Councilor Leopold.

1017
01:36:03,542 --> 01:36:05,924
Mr. President, just if I could.

1018
01:36:22,924 --> 01:36:41,804
I believe it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that, and I brought this up during the tax discussion, is that the annual receipts that go into when we set our tax rate, every year we estimate what we're going to bring in in receipts.

1019
01:36:42,825 --> 01:36:53,273
And that number is then added to the recapitulation of what happens within our budget.

1020
01:36:54,154 --> 01:36:57,996
And the estimated receipts

1021
01:36:59,137 --> 01:37:06,842
is usually a lower number, what we expect to bring in, and the tax levy is usually a higher number.

1022
01:37:07,442 --> 01:37:13,706
So every year, because we don't know what we're gonna bring in for receipts, we have to estimate and we look at the previous year.

1023
01:37:14,326 --> 01:37:22,271
So I think it's only appropriate, because we asked for this information, Mr. President, and the assessor's office was kind enough to hand it to us.

1024
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:25,414
In 2014, we received $13,253,773 in actual receipts for 2014.

1025
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,891
we estimated that we were gonna bring in $12,392,303.

1026
01:37:41,951 --> 01:37:43,592
So we were off, we were over our estimates by $800,000.

1027
01:37:43,652 --> 01:37:51,797
The reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is in my opinion, that when you have year after year of estimates that are far below the actual receipts,

1028
01:38:06,906 --> 01:38:17,851
To me, it would say something about a community that the community is looking to have a surplus rather than to give actual numbers or closer to actual numbers.

1029
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:29,676
If you look at FY, FY15, the actual receipts that were received in FY15 was $16,000,414,434.

1030
01:38:36,392 --> 01:38:42,540
What we estimated, and that's what we put in our estimation for total receipts, was $13,475,700.

1031
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,402
We were almost off by $3 million.

1032
01:38:43,422 --> 01:38:44,944
And again, that should have been added to the receipts.

1033
01:38:53,535 --> 01:39:02,101
bringing up the receipts, what we anticipate to take in, and lower the tax levy, which would lower the tax for every resident in this community.

1034
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:04,623
And some would say, well, it's not a lot of money.

1035
01:39:04,983 --> 01:39:07,405
If you look at it, it really doesn't amount to much.

1036
01:39:07,885 --> 01:39:14,630
But if you add it up over year, over year, over year, you would see that it would be a savings to the residents of this community.

1037
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:17,032
So for the past four years,

1038
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:28,380
and I won't go any further into it, Mr. President, our actual receipts exceeded the estimated receipts in each and every year for the past four years.

1039
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:42,110
So I think we have to do a better job, and this is something I brought up at the Committee of the Whole meeting, when we have our estimates and look at last year's receipts and say we did X number of dollars.

1040
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,251
For instance, if you look at

1041
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,282
excise, room tax.

1042
01:39:50,563 --> 01:39:58,709
You know, we added a hotel in the community about a year and a half ago, although we decreased what we believe we're gonna be bringing in on room tax.

1043
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:00,891
It makes no sense at all.

1044
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:20,333
And the only sense it makes is to make sure that this community doesn't run into a deficit, but it doesn't really give, in my opinion, a strong number of estimated receipts based on year after year projections.

1045
01:40:21,153 --> 01:40:22,934
And the same applies to the meals tax.

1046
01:40:23,315 --> 01:40:26,737
The same applies to rentals and other fees in this community.

1047
01:40:27,277 --> 01:40:41,187
So again, Mr. President, I will ask in next year's budget that the number of receipts be closer to the previous year's actuals, unless they can speak up and say what the reason is.

1048
01:40:41,587 --> 01:40:44,910
If there's a legit reason, then I'd like to hear it.

1049
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:56,380
But year after year, to be underestimating and not giving the residents of this community somewhat of a break, to me is a shame, Mr. President, and shouldn't happen.

1050
01:40:56,941 --> 01:41:04,288
I also think it's important, and we didn't bring it up this year and I know it's mentioned every year, when we talk about the minimum residential factor,

1051
01:41:04,848 --> 01:41:07,030
It's important because we read this off all the time.

1052
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:11,414
Single family homes, the average value of $508,000 assessment will see roughly an increase of $179.

1053
01:41:11,474 --> 01:41:12,575
That's an average.

1054
01:41:12,615 --> 01:41:14,056
So some will be more, some will be less.

1055
01:41:20,401 --> 01:41:25,444
Condos at a 384,000 assessment will see an increase of $113.

1056
01:41:27,005 --> 01:41:29,107
Some will see more, some will see a little less.

1057
01:41:29,627 --> 01:41:33,049
Two families with the average assessment at 610,000 will see $393 increase over last year.

1058
01:41:33,149 --> 01:41:34,270
And again, that's average.

1059
01:41:39,733 --> 01:41:50,201
In three family, based on a 749,000 average assessment, we'll see a $579 increase in their property tax bill.

1060
01:41:50,702 --> 01:41:59,429
Commercial and industrial, we'll see a decrease, which hasn't happened in a lot of years, of $305, and that is an average.

1061
01:41:59,449 --> 01:42:03,172
Some will get a decrease more, and some will get a decrease less than that.

1062
01:42:03,672 --> 01:42:12,596
So I think that's important for the edification of people, Mr. President, that will see their bills go up in the upcoming tax fiscal year.

1063
01:42:13,056 --> 01:42:13,937
Thank you, Mr. President.

1064
01:42:14,117 --> 01:42:15,037
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1065
01:42:15,197 --> 01:42:15,718
Councillor Knight.

1066
01:42:16,218 --> 01:42:25,382
Mr. President, I missed Councillor Marks when he first started off because I was sending some paperwork that the messenger had, but I'm assuming that was paper 17793 we were just speaking about, the committee report?

1067
01:42:25,922 --> 01:42:26,763
No, we haven't done that one yet.

1068
01:42:27,783 --> 01:42:32,829
Why don't we take the committee reports up, Mr. President, move for approval on both, and then we can have this gentleman get a sign.

1069
01:42:32,849 --> 01:42:37,774
On the motion from the Spencer to accept the committee report 17793.

1070
01:42:38,075 --> 01:42:38,715
And 1794, Mr. President.

1071
01:42:38,815 --> 01:42:38,956
And 1794.

1072
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:46,361
Seconded by Councilor Scavelli.

1073
01:42:47,142 --> 01:42:58,210
Motion to accept the report of Committee of the Whole meeting December 6th, 2017 to review and discuss fiscal 2018 property tax allocation.

1074
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:58,930
All those in favor?

1075
01:42:59,030 --> 01:42:59,150
Aye.

1076
01:42:59,771 --> 01:43:02,052
Motion passes.

01:43:02,073 --> 01:43:10,579

1078
01:43:11,419 --> 01:43:12,060
On the motion by.

1079
01:43:13,678 --> 01:43:16,079
Move for approval.

1080
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:23,740
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1081
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:33,162
All those in favor?

1082
01:43:33,242 --> 01:43:33,422
Aye.

1083
01:43:33,442 --> 01:43:35,163
We already granted them the right to location.

1084
01:43:36,203 --> 01:43:39,443
We already gave them the grant license.

1085
01:43:39,603 --> 01:43:40,904
Just to adopt the committee report.

1086
01:43:43,807 --> 01:43:44,467
All those in favor?

1087
01:43:44,547 --> 01:43:44,867
Aye.

1088
01:43:45,628 --> 01:43:46,368
Motion passes.

1089
01:43:46,488 --> 01:43:48,549
Mr. President, motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

1090
01:43:48,569 --> 01:43:53,591
Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular business, seconded by Councilor Scapelli.

1091
01:43:53,951 --> 01:43:57,252
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1092
01:43:57,272 --> 01:44:05,735
17-796 petition for sign and denial reversal by Jason Perillo for back bay sign for Johnson Supply, 91 Hicks Avenue, Medford.

1093
01:44:05,855 --> 01:44:12,738
OCD application 2017-21B exceeds allowable size and secondary sign.

1094
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:18,039
Councilor, Vice President Mox is the signed subcommittee chairman.

1095
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:20,340
Thank you, Mr. President.

1096
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,360
We have the petitioner.

1097
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,821
Are you from the signed company or the petitioner?

1098
01:44:24,841 --> 01:44:25,381
Yes.

1099
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:27,842
We have a gentleman from the signed company here.

1100
01:44:28,442 --> 01:44:31,463
If he can just give a brief presentation, Mr. President.

1101
01:44:31,863 --> 01:44:32,403
Absolutely.

1102
01:44:33,704 --> 01:44:35,784
I'm Jason Perullo with Back Bay Sign.

1103
01:44:35,804 --> 01:44:38,185
I'll serve as representing Johnson Supply this evening.

1104
01:44:39,105 --> 01:44:42,947
This property is a new tenant, this property at 91 Hicks Ave.

1105
01:44:42,967 --> 01:44:53,213
It's a situation where the front of the property on Hicks Ave is shorter than the side elevation, which is on Mystic Ave, which isn't technically a street, but it functions much like a street.

1106
01:44:53,653 --> 01:45:00,296
Pretty much all the business activity of this business is gonna be on that secondary elevation, the parking, the loading dock, the customer entrance.

1107
01:45:00,636 --> 01:45:04,519
So that's why we proposed the larger sign to go on that secondary elevation.

1108
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:05,239
Thank you.

1109
01:45:10,423 --> 01:45:12,604
Counselor Knight.

1110
01:45:12,624 --> 01:45:14,525
Mr. President, I had an opportunity to speak with the gentleman.

1111
01:45:14,565 --> 01:45:16,686
I've taken a look at the sign, and I'm very familiar with the site.

1112
01:45:16,706 --> 01:45:22,449
I feel as though it's not going to have much impact on the quality of life or beauty of the neighborhood, and it certainly will help out the business owners.

1113
01:45:22,469 --> 01:45:24,550
So with that being said, I'd move for approval on the paper.

1114
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:32,634
Mr. President.

1115
01:45:32,654 --> 01:45:34,595
Mr. President of the box.

1116
01:45:36,066 --> 01:45:39,587
It's important to note that this sign is not internally illuminated.

1117
01:45:39,607 --> 01:45:40,107
That's correct.

1118
01:45:41,447 --> 01:45:47,188
And it does point to where the location is, which is to the rear of the building.

1119
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:47,628
Exactly.

1120
01:45:47,829 --> 01:45:48,349
The access.

1121
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:55,550
I too, Mr. President, have no problem with this sign and would move approval, Mr. President.

1122
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:59,971
On the motion by Vice President Mox for approval, seconded by?

1123
01:46:02,251 --> 01:46:03,592
Seconded by Council Member Kern.

1124
01:46:03,632 --> 01:46:04,232
All those in favor?

1125
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,580
Motion passes, thank you very much.

1126
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,981
Thank you very much, thank you.

1127
01:46:09,581 --> 01:46:12,102
Motion by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1128
01:46:12,642 --> 01:46:14,123
Seconded by Councilor Locren.

1129
01:46:14,183 --> 01:46:14,783
All those in favor?

1130
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:16,943
Motion passes.

1131
01:46:18,364 --> 01:46:19,424
I'm sorry?

1132
01:46:23,205 --> 01:46:26,306
Okay.

1133
01:46:26,366 --> 01:46:28,427
Let him speak.

1134
01:46:30,597 --> 01:46:31,618
Name and address of the record, please.

1135
01:46:32,218 --> 01:46:33,659
My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

1136
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,701
I live at 15 Canal Street, apartment 15.

1137
01:46:37,442 --> 01:46:40,284
I just want to apologize for not getting in on the docket in time.

1138
01:46:41,225 --> 01:46:45,168
But I'm here about some comments that were voiced last week at the school committee.

1139
01:46:45,188 --> 01:46:45,689
OK.

1140
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:47,070
I know that this is.

1141
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:47,990
Can I make a.

1142
01:46:50,264 --> 01:46:58,309
All the people that are mentioned are not here to defend themselves or make a comment, so it's something that we cannot discuss without all parties being present.

1143
01:46:58,609 --> 01:47:00,811
I'm not prosecuting anybody.

1144
01:47:00,971 --> 01:47:02,412
I'm not prosecuting anybody.

1145
01:47:02,452 --> 01:47:05,034
We won't discuss this without everybody being here.

1146
01:47:05,414 --> 01:47:07,155
And this should be discussed in executive session.

1147
01:47:08,976 --> 01:47:09,116
OK.

1148
01:47:09,136 --> 01:47:13,359
Counselor Knight.

1149
01:47:13,859 --> 01:47:16,861
So executive session excludes the residents, is that correct?

1150
01:47:16,881 --> 01:47:18,202
That's correct.

1151
01:47:18,222 --> 01:47:19,303
There's people here that are not

1152
01:47:20,895 --> 01:47:34,528
Mr. President, if I may, the Attorney General put out a guideline and the guideline was relative to the open meeting law and the requirements thereof and the top ten reasons for why a public body can go into executive session.

1153
01:47:35,008 --> 01:47:39,473
Rule number one is to discuss the reputation of character rather than the professional competence of any individual.

1154
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:48,492
I put the names down there that are part of the public record.

1155
01:47:48,552 --> 01:47:55,778
He has a paper here that I don't think that's something that we should be discussing and I'm gonna move the paper out of order.

1156
01:47:58,660 --> 01:47:58,960
Thank you.

1157
01:48:04,725 --> 01:48:09,049
The people on here to defend themselves that are on this paper.

1158
01:48:10,391 --> 01:48:15,514
Should we wish to go into executive to discuss the matter, we need to provide the parties that are subject to the discussion with 48 hours notice.

1159
01:48:15,534 --> 01:48:17,395
Point of information, Mr. President?

1160
01:48:18,515 --> 01:48:22,978
Before me here I have the open meeting guide from the Attorney General's office.

1161
01:48:37,526 --> 01:48:47,612
Individual to be discussed in executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 40 hours prior to the proposed executive session provided however the notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties.

1162
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,262
I believe that the handout that came across the desk indicated that.

1163
01:48:54,902 --> 01:48:57,524
I might not have read the handout.

1164
01:48:57,564 --> 01:48:59,605
I just read the materials that he passed out when he came up.

1165
01:49:00,085 --> 01:49:01,786
I guess I do because I read the papers that he gave us.

1166
01:49:01,806 --> 01:49:03,127
You got the paper that you were given.

1167
01:49:03,147 --> 01:49:07,469
Are we speaking about the paper he gave us or are you speaking in general about politics?

1168
01:49:07,549 --> 01:49:11,591
I was just providing something that's part of the public record with that paper.

1169
01:49:11,631 --> 01:49:15,293
We have it and it's for the council to do what they want with it.

1170
01:49:16,816 --> 01:49:22,820
That the council can do whatever everybody wants, but there are some important things to understand about how this reflects upon the community.

1171
01:49:23,261 --> 01:49:29,905
Okay, but again, there's people here whose reputations may be jeopardized here.

1172
01:49:35,829 --> 01:49:37,389
Look, I don't want to violate the law.

1173
01:49:37,549 --> 01:49:40,590
I'm not saying that this is a violation of open records.

1174
01:49:40,671 --> 01:49:42,351
If you're going to name people's names.

1175
01:49:42,771 --> 01:49:44,452
No, I have no interest in doing that.

1176
01:49:44,472 --> 01:49:45,552
I have no interest in naming names.

1177
01:49:45,572 --> 01:49:48,873
But there are some serious dynamics about what happened that need to be addressed.

1178
01:49:48,893 --> 01:49:50,114
I don't disagree if it's done right.

1179
01:50:02,299 --> 01:50:10,584
You mentioned that you wanted his public record, what you gave us, and that's what I find the issue, that's all.

1180
01:50:10,784 --> 01:50:13,986
I'm only saying that I'm referring to something that's already in the public record.

1181
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,708
Okay, I haven't seen it.

1182
01:50:17,108 --> 01:50:19,950
I haven't seen the public record, so I can't comment on it either.

1183
01:50:20,351 --> 01:50:20,651
Thank you.

1184
01:50:22,123 --> 01:50:30,926
Everybody needs to see a public record before people can discuss something that's already in the public record What is on public record the conversation that happened last week at the school committee?

1185
01:50:31,446 --> 01:50:37,909
That's It's not on the public record if it happens with the school committee

1186
01:50:39,472 --> 01:50:40,392
We have no record of that.

1187
01:50:41,073 --> 01:50:43,333
I have not received any record of that.

1188
01:50:43,914 --> 01:50:45,014
I put them all online.

1189
01:50:45,254 --> 01:50:47,015
Everybody knows I've been doing it for three years.

1190
01:50:47,095 --> 01:50:50,716
Online is not for us, a public record for us.

1191
01:50:51,156 --> 01:50:57,018
We've never received anything in our... Okay, so what will it take to move this forward?

1192
01:50:57,038 --> 01:50:59,599
Do I have to send emails to everybody with the links to the videos I put online?

1193
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:00,079
No, it's public.

1194
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,540
Again, he needs something else.

1195
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:05,441
Or do I have to get somebody to stamp it that it's a public record?

1196
01:51:05,501 --> 01:51:06,922
You submit it to the clerk.

1197
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:12,873
that this week, I just have to get you to stamp it or something like this?

1198
01:51:13,193 --> 01:51:13,974
It has to be received.

1199
01:51:14,054 --> 01:51:28,022
I mean, my only suggestion is that this is subject only to the school committee that your petition should be to the school committee.

1200
01:51:28,062 --> 01:51:28,763
Yeah, not to us.

1201
01:51:28,823 --> 01:51:30,123
And the school committee themselves.

1202
01:51:30,163 --> 01:51:31,484
They can make a difference to us.

1203
01:51:34,364 --> 01:51:36,706
Are you saying the school committee would make it a public record?

1204
01:51:37,147 --> 01:51:38,188
They can make it a public record.

1205
01:51:38,268 --> 01:51:40,530
And that would be up to their discretion?

1206
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:45,635
That's up to their discretion.

1207
01:51:45,695 --> 01:51:48,518
Can I say something without mentioning any of those people?

1208
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,461
If you're not mentioning any names.

1209
01:51:51,561 --> 01:51:53,823
I have no intention of mentioning any of those people.

1210
01:51:54,626 --> 01:51:58,547
I will say, though, that there are very many people who are upset about what happened.

1211
01:51:59,028 --> 01:52:06,110
And I know that there are things that people are trying to take to address some of these dynamics in our community.

1212
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:19,975
I would just ask that anybody on this body, when anybody comes forward and asks for any kind of support, that people really honor it, that people try to figure out how can we work to make sure that things that happened previously don't happen in any of our bodies.

1213
01:52:22,196 --> 01:52:22,896
Thank you for your opinion.

1214
01:52:27,761 --> 01:52:30,624
Motion to take hands from the clerk.

1215
01:52:31,865 --> 01:52:42,975
Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the pavement at the entrance to 100 High Street Condos parking lot located on Route 16 be repaired in the interest of public safety.

1216
01:52:44,283 --> 01:52:45,104
Vice President Mox.

1217
01:52:45,684 --> 01:52:46,625
Thank you, Mr. President.

1218
01:52:46,645 --> 01:53:01,738
This particular road, which is the entrance to the 100 High Street condos, their parking lot, is in deplorable condition, and I would ask that this paper be sent to the State Highway Department for repair of that roadway, Mr. President.

1219
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:05,822
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Council Member Kern.

1220
01:53:05,842 --> 01:53:06,463
All those in favor?

1221
01:53:07,283 --> 01:53:08,064
Motion passes.

1222
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:15,172
Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the two catch basins located at 16 Cook Circle be discussed.

1223
01:53:15,533 --> 01:53:16,394
Vice President Mox.

1224
01:53:17,195 --> 01:53:18,196
Thank you, Mr. President.

1225
01:53:18,696 --> 01:53:26,545
It's my understanding that on Cook Circle they installed two catch basins over the last several years to alleviate some of those things.

1226
01:53:26,665 --> 01:53:39,764
the water concerns that they have up on the hill and what's happening right now is these catch basins are getting clogged with leaves and the rain runoff is going behind the homes on

1227
01:53:41,707 --> 01:53:46,468
Cook Circle leading down to the backyards on homes that are on Lawrence Road.

1228
01:53:47,168 --> 01:53:54,430
And it's eroding the hill that separates the homes on both streets and creating a concern.

1229
01:53:54,470 --> 01:54:06,752
So I would ask that DPW take a look at ways that they can prevent the leaves from clogging up these two particular catch basins in front of 16 Cook Circle.

1230
01:54:07,312 --> 01:54:08,012
Thank you, Mr. President.

1231
01:54:08,473 --> 01:54:10,313
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1232
01:54:11,233 --> 01:54:12,694
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1233
01:54:12,775 --> 01:54:13,535
All those in favor?

1234
01:54:15,297 --> 01:54:16,698
Aye, motion passes.

1235
01:54:17,518 --> 01:54:21,382
Records of the meeting of December 5th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1236
01:54:21,682 --> 01:54:23,323
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1237
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:31,202
Mr. President, before we end the meeting.

1238
01:54:31,702 --> 01:54:32,502
Vice President Mox.

1239
01:54:33,243 --> 01:54:34,223
Thank you, Mr. President.

1240
01:54:34,783 --> 01:54:45,989
I just want to bring up, I had the opportunity with some of my colleagues this past Saturday to attend the grand opening of our first ever dog park in this community.

1241
01:54:46,009 --> 01:54:47,269
I know you were there, Mr. President.

1242
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:51,531
Councilor Lungo-Kern, Councilor Falco were present at the time.

1243
01:54:52,852 --> 01:54:53,893
It was a great event.

1244
01:54:54,333 --> 01:54:58,895
There were dozens of dogs, both for the small and large dog park.

1245
01:54:59,435 --> 01:55:13,918
I want to personally thank, again, Mr. President, a group of residents that got together with a particular need in mind, and that was to create an area where dogs could socialize and exercise some three years ago.

1246
01:55:14,638 --> 01:55:18,538
And this particular group of residents found a $250,000 Stanton Foundation grant.

1247
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:20,739
They did the research and found a dog park

1248
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:32,443
architect who was instrumental in doing other parks around this particular area.

1249
01:55:33,044 --> 01:55:47,573
The members of the PAWS committee, Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Gary DeStefano, Diane Gittner, John Sardone, were all instrumental in moving this very important and well-needed dog park in this community.

1250
01:55:48,114 --> 01:55:49,895
I want to thank Mayor McGlynn who

1251
01:55:49,915 --> 01:55:55,138
who originally was the person that this dog park committee approached.

1252
01:55:55,799 --> 01:56:02,863
The mayor saw fit to do a survey citywide, and that's how we came up with the location behind the McGlynn School.

1253
01:56:03,243 --> 01:56:07,786
So I want to thank Mayor McGlynn for his foresight and vision on this.

1254
01:56:08,586 --> 01:56:18,953
And I hope, Mr. President, for future needs in this community that citizen-driven participation will always be welcome.

1255
01:56:19,873 --> 01:56:28,879
in this community, and I think this is a great example of what can happen when there's a need in the community and a number of citizens that need to address that.

1256
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:39,166
And you, Mr. Vice President, should be championed for taking the lead in this way back a couple years ago, and we at the City Council thank you for all your hard work that you did on this.

1257
01:56:39,186 --> 01:56:40,987
Thank you.

1258
01:56:41,007 --> 01:56:41,888
Seconded by Councilor.

1259
01:56:42,268 --> 01:56:45,931
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso to adjourn.

1260
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:48,811
Although, seconded by Councilor Falcone.

1261
01:56:48,831 --> 01:56:52,754
May I comment on Councilor Marks' brilliant achievement?

1262
01:56:53,815 --> 01:56:54,195
Thank you.

1263
01:56:54,936 --> 01:56:56,417
Councilor Marks, congratulations.

1264
01:56:56,497 --> 01:56:57,197
You came through.

1265
01:56:57,218 --> 01:56:59,039
I'm glad the dogs got their due.

1266
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:04,963
I hope someday the owner-occupiers get their $1,200 a year in real estate tax savings also.

1267
01:57:05,343 --> 01:57:11,068
Especially when the seniors maybe can afford to stay and live in the houses in West Medford or South Medford.

1268
01:57:11,308 --> 01:57:12,148
Thank you for listening.

1269
01:57:12,849 --> 01:57:13,850
On the motion to adjourn.

1270
01:57:15,033 --> 01:57:15,697
All those in favor?

1271
01:57:16,602 --> 01:57:17,910
Motion passes, meeting adjourned.

1272
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:27,711
It's finished.

1273
01:58:27,731 --> 01:58:28,792
Let's look forward to 2018.

1274
01:58:29,512 --> 01:58:34,397
OK, let's jump from the business pages to the sports pages, or maybe this is sort of society pages.

1275
01:58:34,437 --> 01:58:36,900
I'm not quite sure whether they have those in Indian papers.

1276
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:41,425
But when the Indian cricket captain gets married, it's national news.

1277
01:58:42,626 --> 01:58:42,926
It is.

1278
01:58:43,006 --> 01:58:44,848
And look, you know, weddings are a business here.

1279
01:58:44,868 --> 01:58:48,091
They're one of the big businesses, one of the things of the recession.

1280
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:51,486
proof get bigger and bigger every year.

1281
01:58:51,606 --> 01:58:58,569
And Indians, it's, you know, Bisanyan prizes, weddings and the other things, the topic of conversation at this particular point of time.

1282
01:58:58,969 --> 01:59:06,212
And the marriage of Virat Kohli to Anushka Sharma, you know, this big Bollywood star marrying a big cricket star, has really grabbed the attention.

1283
01:59:06,252 --> 01:59:10,854
It's taken some of the conversation about what's happening in the economy and people just looking at that, really.

1284
01:59:10,874 --> 01:59:12,795
And I think it shows you the obsessions

1285
01:59:13,335 --> 01:59:14,656
that people have with weddings.

1286
01:59:14,696 --> 01:59:16,336
I mean, they had a secret wedding in Italy.

1287
01:59:17,357 --> 01:59:19,197
There was rumors that they were flying off there.

1288
01:59:19,217 --> 01:59:21,698
Then the whole country moved into a spin of weather.

1289
01:59:21,998 --> 01:59:25,980
India's most famous couple were about to finally tie the knot.

1290
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:26,820
They have done so.

1291
01:59:27,181 --> 01:59:29,601
So you'd think that that means that the talking is going to stop.

1292
01:59:29,621 --> 01:59:30,682
That's the end of the story.

1293
01:59:30,722 --> 01:59:33,383
But every day, it's still going on and on and on.

1294
01:59:33,703 --> 01:59:35,764
what she wore, what the priest did.

1295
01:59:35,784 --> 01:59:39,986
I mean, everybody now wants to wear what Virat Kohli was wearing, what she was wearing.

1296
01:59:40,687 --> 01:59:44,609
Yeah, so weddings, big, big business, big topics of conversation here.

1297
01:59:44,849 --> 01:59:46,029
Come on, let's get over it.

1298
01:59:46,049 --> 01:59:47,850
Let's move on to something else now, India.

1299
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:49,411
Got to be better stuff to talk about.

1300
01:59:49,751 --> 01:59:50,711
Rahul, thanks a lot.

1301
01:59:51,031 --> 01:59:52,832
Rahul Tandon this morning in Kolkata.

1302
01:59:53,592 --> 01:59:56,012
Now, didn't think I'd talk about this on Business Matters.

1303
01:59:56,273 --> 01:59:56,913
Peppa Pig.

1304
01:59:57,233 --> 01:59:58,313
Blamed for a lot of things.

1305
01:59:58,633 --> 02:00:03,354
Having a temper, encouraging children to be naughty, fat shaming daddy pig.

1306
02:00:03,854 --> 02:00:04,214
Shocking.

1307
02:00:04,815 --> 02:00:19,418
And it seems the cartoon character avidly watched by millions of children around the world is causing trouble again because a doctor here in Britain is blaming Peppa Pig for giving people unrealistic expectations of their medical practitioners, Terry Egan reports.

1308
02:00:20,018 --> 02:00:26,704
Dr. Brown-Bear, a GP who works alone and also appears to provide his patients with an excellent service.

1309
02:00:26,724 --> 02:00:35,851
His prompt offers direct telephone access, continuity of care, extended hours and is always ready for a home visit.

1310
02:00:35,951 --> 02:00:37,152
Dr. Brown-Bear speaking.

1311
02:00:37,352 --> 02:00:39,794
Hello doctor, this is Madame Gazelle.

1312
02:00:40,274 --> 02:00:41,515
A child is ill.

1313
02:00:41,876 --> 02:00:44,698
Don't panic, I'll come straight away.

1314
02:00:47,747 --> 02:01:00,755
Dr Catherine Bell wondered about the potential impact Dr Brownbear's actions could have on patient behaviour and, with her tongue firmly in her cheek, has looked at a number of cases, going on to examine their implications.

1315
02:01:01,216 --> 02:01:06,999
In one instance, Dr Brownbear makes an urgent home visit to a three-year-old piglet with a facial rash.

1316
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:13,784
He reassures the parents it's nothing serious and offers a dose of medicine, adding that it's likely to clear up quickly.

1317
02:01:14,324 --> 02:01:24,997
This case, suggests Dr Bell, is an example of unnecessary prescribing for a viral illness and encourages patients to attempt to access their GP inappropriately.

1318
02:01:27,026 --> 02:01:38,549
Peppa Pig is broadcast in more than 180 countries and writing in the BMJ, Dr Bell suggests that the way primary care is portrayed is likely to be influential to many people all over the world.

1319
02:01:39,029 --> 02:01:56,593
While Peppa Pig conveys many positive public health messages, such as encouraging healthy eating, exercise and road safety, she suspects that exposure to Peppa Pig and its portrayal of general practice raises patient expectation and encourages the inappropriate use of primary care services.

1320
02:01:57,453 --> 02:01:58,954
Terry Egan reporting.

1321
02:01:59,334 --> 02:02:05,975
Yes, the doctor rushing out to the house call reminded everybody of the 1950s.

1322
02:02:06,536 --> 02:02:08,216
Catherine, it seems a bit unfair, doesn't it?

1323
02:02:08,776 --> 02:02:23,260
You're trying to come up with an entertaining and slightly educational TV strip and suddenly everyone's holding you to account for, even somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as Dr Catherine Bell no doubt was, for making unrealistic demands.

1324
02:02:24,054 --> 02:02:37,748
I think you're right, it's a little bit unfair, but I do have to say that granted I'm the daughter of a doctor and my children are his grandchildren and it's not unusual for us to be calling him in the middle of the night for something like a rash on one of my kids' faces.

1325
02:02:38,108 --> 02:02:42,733
So maybe I inherently just expect efficiency when it comes to GP services.

1326
02:02:42,873 --> 02:02:46,397
But you're going to tell me that your dad was exactly like Dr. Brown Bear, surely?

1327
02:02:47,217 --> 02:02:49,578
I think Dr. Brown Bear is moral on my father, you know.

1328
02:02:50,698 --> 02:02:52,798
And the thing is, Alexander, from a U.S.

1329
02:02:52,838 --> 02:03:04,701
perspective, this is really interesting because this goes to the heart of things like Sesame Street, which have this early learning mission to explain from ABCs right through to cultural behavior.

1330
02:03:04,741 --> 02:03:07,842
Absolutely a fascinating thing to write and perform.

1331
02:03:08,613 --> 02:03:23,005
Yes, but as you can also imagine in the United States that trying to translate all of the issues around our healthcare market and, you know, why certain people have access to different things would be quite difficult in a children's show.

1332
02:03:23,086 --> 02:03:29,291
Yeah, so we were wondering where Dr. Brown Bear would get, would say, you know, visa or MasterCard?

1333
02:03:31,027 --> 02:03:39,295
Yeah, or when Dr. Brown Bear would actually be an employee of CVS or Walgreens or have a strange opinion about Obamacare.

1334
02:03:39,635 --> 02:03:41,777
Yeah, we don't take that insurance.

1335
02:03:41,797 --> 02:03:51,326
But Catherine, does this travel or do you think the translations into those multiple cultural contexts have to be equally sophisticated?

1336
02:03:52,415 --> 02:04:02,243
I think, you know, at the end of the day, I remember my little girl loved Madame Gazelle, who was a teacher, and wanted to become a school teacher, just like I'm sure many children look at, you know, Dr. Brown Bear and want to become doctors.

1337
02:04:02,664 --> 02:04:05,306
So I think maybe, I think we should just take it for what it is.

1338
02:04:05,366 --> 02:04:06,967
It's a children's cartoon.

1339
02:04:07,788 --> 02:04:09,489
They try and instill positive messages.

1340
02:04:09,549 --> 02:04:12,772
I don't think we should be digging around too much for negative connotations.

1341
02:04:12,972 --> 02:04:13,272
Okay.

1342
02:04:13,333 --> 02:04:14,354
The digging stops here.

1343
02:04:14,534 --> 02:04:19,400
Thank you very much both, Alexander Kaufman, New York, Katherine Young this morning in Hong Kong.

1344
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:21,703
It's been a pleasure having you along for the last hour.

1345
02:04:22,064 --> 02:04:23,265
Thanks to you all for listening.

1346
02:04:23,306 --> 02:04:29,373
The team is back same time tomorrow as Wednesday rolls into Thursday here on Business Matters.

1347
02:04:29,494 --> 02:04:30,054
Bye-bye for now.

1348
02:04:49,739 --> 02:04:51,420
This is the BBC World Service.

1349
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:55,641
Now, here's Harriet Gilbert to tell you about the next World Book Club.

1350
02:04:55,961 --> 02:04:59,403
Agatha Christie's murder mysteries are popular across the world.

1351
02:04:59,763 --> 02:05:03,604
We'll be discussing her most famous murder on the Orient Express.

1352
02:05:04,065 --> 02:05:14,509
As a luxurious train lies stuck in a snowdrift, an American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, and Detective Hercule Poirot must uncover who did it.

1353
02:05:14,849 --> 02:05:17,810
BBC World Book Club, from the 6th of January.

1354
02:05:20,688 --> 02:05:23,070
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

1355
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:26,754
Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale was at the court to hear.

1356
02:05:26,874 --> 02:05:29,776
As our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports from Mosul.

1357
02:05:30,036 --> 02:05:32,138
Our Africa editor Mary Harper reports.

1358
02:05:32,198 --> 02:05:33,440
Let's go to Hong Kong now.

1359
02:05:33,460 --> 02:05:34,400
Time for business news.

1360
02:05:34,481 --> 02:05:36,082
On our business desk is Andrew Wood.

1361
02:05:36,182 --> 02:05:38,624
Available on the BBC iPlayer radio app.

1362
02:05:38,884 --> 02:05:42,488
This is the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

1363
02:05:50,215 --> 02:05:54,079
At two o'clock GMT, welcome to the newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1364
02:05:54,299 --> 02:05:55,119
I'm Jonathan Blake.

1365
02:05:55,179 --> 02:06:04,227
The polls have closed in Alabama and America waits to see whether President Trump's man accused of sexual harassment can see off a democratic challenge in the crucial Senate election.

1366
02:06:04,928 --> 02:06:08,611
Let's talk the message from the US Secretary of State to North Korea.

1367
02:06:08,811 --> 02:06:11,754
We're ready to have the first meeting without precondition.

1368
02:06:12,254 --> 02:06:12,975
Let's just meet.

1369
02:06:13,536 --> 02:06:14,877
We can talk about the weather if you want.

1370
02:06:15,217 --> 02:06:16,298
Crisis in Congo.

1371
02:06:16,498 --> 02:06:21,283
A special report from our Africa editor coming up on the country's humanitarian disaster.

1372
02:06:21,564 --> 02:06:24,146
I saw people with machetes, guns and clubs.

1373
02:06:24,727 --> 02:06:28,351
They were beheading people, cutting arms and legs, slashing bellies.

1374
02:06:28,863 --> 02:06:32,247
What scientists are learning about Jupiter's great red spot.

1375
02:06:32,768 --> 02:06:37,914
And from A to B, research shows the insects can learn the most efficient route to travel.

1376
02:06:38,295 --> 02:06:45,744
There are shortcuts that may initially appear tempting, but by taking them, you actually increase your overall travel distance.

1377
02:06:45,924 --> 02:06:47,927
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

1378
02:06:50,122 --> 02:06:52,544
Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.

1379
02:06:53,145 --> 02:07:01,312
Results are keenly awaited in Alabama, a traditionally Republican state where votes are being counted in the election for a new U.S.

1380
02:07:01,372 --> 02:07:02,433
Senate representative.

1381
02:07:02,893 --> 02:07:10,579
President Trump's favorite candidate, Roy Moore, is hoping to secure victory and brush off allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers.

1382
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,902
His Democratic rival is Doug Jones.

1383
02:07:13,942 --> 02:07:16,785
Correspondent Gary O'Donohue explains what's at stake.

1384
02:07:17,466 --> 02:07:32,388
not just a seat in the US Senate from the state of Alabama, but also the potential balance of power in the Senate in the longer term, also the question of what to do about those accused of sexual harassment and assault, how will they

1385
02:07:32,488 --> 02:07:34,270
be treated in public life.

1386
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:36,712
And, of course, the question of Donald Trump.

1387
02:07:37,072 --> 02:07:48,984
Will Alabama elect someone who's like him, an outsider, an insurgent, someone who's not necessarily politically correct, or will they go with a Democrat for the first time in a quarter of a century?

1388
02:07:49,775 --> 02:07:50,255
The U.S.

1389
02:07:50,295 --> 02:07:58,979
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says America is willing to hold direct talks with North Korea without preconditions, saying, let's just meet.

1390
02:07:59,479 --> 02:08:06,682
He said the topic would not matter, it could simply be about the weather, but the point was to lay out a roadmap for formal negotiations.

1391
02:08:07,522 --> 02:08:09,404
McDonnell reports from South from Seoul.

1392
02:08:09,964 --> 02:08:14,168
The United States Secretary of State was speaking at a think tank in Washington.

1393
02:08:14,628 --> 02:08:24,317
Rex Tillerson said these initial talks could be about anything but that further discussions would require progress on the question of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.

1394
02:08:24,877 --> 02:08:27,279
This appears to be a softening of America's position.

1395
02:08:27,759 --> 02:08:31,941
However, he did also say that for this process to start, the U.S.

1396
02:08:32,001 --> 02:08:37,585
would require a quiet period without fresh North Korean nuclear or missile tests.

1397
02:08:38,145 --> 02:08:42,288
A White House statement said President Trump's views on North Korea had not changed.

1398
02:08:43,088 --> 02:08:51,661
Firefighters in Los Angeles say a wildfire, which swept through Bel Air, one of the city's most exclusive neighborhoods, started in a homeless encampment.

1399
02:08:52,101 --> 02:08:56,989
Investigators say the blaze began as an illegal cooking fire at a camp near a motorway.

1400
02:08:57,990 --> 02:09:11,803
The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, has warned that more than 400,000 severely malnourished children under the age of five in the Democratic Republic of Congo could die within months without emergency intervention.

1401
02:09:12,444 --> 02:09:21,413
UNICEF said the crisis unfolding in the region of Kasai was due to a combination of violence, mass displacement of families, and slumping agricultural output.

1402
02:09:22,013 --> 02:09:30,258
Jose Barahona, Oxfam's director for the country, says a lack of resources is making it difficult to offer help to people in many villages.

1403
02:09:30,878 --> 02:09:34,800
Where we are, this is a very real picture of the situations we face.

1404
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:36,961
These people have not received anything.

1405
02:09:37,001 --> 02:09:37,602
They are hungry.

1406
02:09:37,902 --> 02:09:38,902
They have huge problems.

1407
02:09:38,922 --> 02:09:40,663
They are asking us desperately for help.

1408
02:09:41,223 --> 02:09:44,305
We have some resources that we have already committed in other villages.

1409
02:09:44,845 --> 02:09:46,887
If we want to come here, we need extra resources.

1410
02:09:47,507 --> 02:09:48,668
World News from the BBC.

1411
02:09:50,502 --> 02:10:00,207
The United Nations Secretary General António Guterres has said continued subsidies of fossil fuel amounts to humanity investing in its own doom.

1412
02:10:00,747 --> 02:10:10,671
Mr. Guterres told more than 50 heads of state gathered at the One Planet Summit in Paris, we are in a war for the very existence of life on our planet as we know it.

1413
02:10:11,932 --> 02:10:18,718
Scientists say the region around the North Pole shows no sign of returning to its once reliably frozen state.

1414
02:10:19,259 --> 02:10:20,960
The annual assessment by the U.S.

1415
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:30,229
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the rapidly warming Arctic indicates that its environmental system has reached a new normal.

1416
02:10:30,649 --> 02:10:31,530
Here's Victoria Gill.

1417
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:45,452
While this past summer in the far north was cooler than in recent years, average air and sea surface temperatures continued to increase and the winter sea ice maximum, measured by satellites in March, was the lowest on record.

1418
02:10:46,033 --> 02:10:48,375
As the ice melts, the region is darkening.

1419
02:10:48,815 --> 02:10:54,040
Those white reflective surfaces are giving way to reveal darker earth and ocean beneath.

1420
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,622
which absorb even more of the sun's energy.

1421
02:10:56,642 --> 02:11:02,588
The constantly and reliably frozen north, scientists say, could now be a relic of the past.

1422
02:11:03,449 --> 02:11:09,074
An explosion at a plant in Austria has interrupted the flow of gas from Russia to Italy.

1423
02:11:09,414 --> 02:11:13,858
One person was killed and 21 others wounded in the blast at the facility in Baumgarten.

1424
02:11:14,339 --> 02:11:19,223
The incident prompted Italian officials to declare a state of emergency for energy supplies.

1425
02:11:20,224 --> 02:11:25,127
Scientists in Britain have suggested that bumblebees are much more intelligent than previously thought.

1426
02:11:25,667 --> 02:11:30,950
In a study, the bees were given the task of finding the most efficient routes between different sources of food.

1427
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:36,433
They were also tempting traps thrown in to trick them into increasing the distance they travelled.

1428
02:11:36,853 --> 02:11:44,977
At first, the bees fell for the inducement, but then, far from bumbling, they learned to refine their flight paths between flower feeding stations.

1429
02:11:46,038 --> 02:11:47,899
That's the latest BBC News.

1430
02:11:50,278 --> 02:11:52,919
You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1431
02:11:53,119 --> 02:11:59,880
I'm Jonathan Blake, and in the last hour, polls have closed in Alabama in what could be a pivotal election for the US Senate.

1432
02:12:00,261 --> 02:12:07,062
The Republican candidate, Roy Moore, who's denied accusations of child abuse, has been publicly endorsed by the US president.

1433
02:12:07,502 --> 02:12:14,724
The Democratic Party hasn't won in the state in more than two decades, but many think its candidate, Doug Jones, has a real chance.

1434
02:12:15,184 --> 02:12:17,705
From Birmingham in Alabama, Nick Bryant reports.

1435
02:12:18,567 --> 02:12:25,093
Just when he thought that American politics couldn't get any weirder, Judge Roy Moore arrived to vote on horseback.

1436
02:12:27,254 --> 02:12:30,857
He's come to personify the polarization of this manic age.

1437
02:12:31,258 --> 02:12:36,242
To his female accusers, he's a sexual predator who molested teenage girls in his 30s.

1438
02:12:36,562 --> 02:12:43,668
To his fans, he's a crusading conservative evangelical, a firebrand populist in the mold of Donald Trump.

1439
02:12:44,148 --> 02:12:45,630
I want to make America great again.

1440
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,743
with President Trump.

1441
02:12:48,345 --> 02:12:52,216
I want America great, but I want America good, and she can't be good

1442
02:12:53,782 --> 02:12:54,902
until we go back to God.

1443
02:12:55,242 --> 02:13:01,344
In the face of these allegations, his supporters have adopted the new default position of the politically embattled.

1444
02:13:01,804 --> 02:13:03,085
They're crying fake news.

1445
02:13:03,425 --> 02:13:05,345
That's nothing but a bunch of fake news.

1446
02:13:05,725 --> 02:13:07,826
And they've already been proven false.

1447
02:13:07,886 --> 02:13:10,727
If they were really true, why didn't they come out before now?

1448
02:13:10,867 --> 02:13:22,470
Though many senior Republicans have refused to back Moore, including Alabama's highly respected Senator Richard Shelby, he has a cheerleader in Donald Trump, who's made automated calls on his behalf.

1449
02:13:22,810 --> 02:13:27,873
Hi, this is President Donald Trump, and I need Alabama to go vote for Roy Moore.

1450
02:13:28,193 --> 02:13:29,634
It is so important.

1451
02:13:29,774 --> 02:13:32,076
For the president, it's morally uncomplicated.

1452
02:13:32,296 --> 02:13:35,938
He wants Alabama to send a Republican, not a Democrat, to the Senate.

1453
02:13:36,699 --> 02:13:41,722
This contest is so much more than just a Senate race against a Democratic candidate, Doug Jones.

1454
02:13:42,342 --> 02:13:44,944
It's a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.

1455
02:13:45,404 --> 02:13:50,991
between the establishment and more radical ideologues who've become such a force in recent decades.

1456
02:13:51,552 --> 02:14:02,707
It's a test of whether any allegation is disqualifying in modern-day American public life, and also the extent to which the Trump presidency has changed behavioural norms.

1457
02:14:03,147 --> 02:14:06,349
Nick Bryant on the race and what's at stake in Alabama.

1458
02:14:06,369 --> 02:14:07,810
At the moment it's too close to call.

1459
02:14:07,830 --> 02:14:12,032
We are expecting some results from various parts of the state in the coming hours.

1460
02:14:12,272 --> 02:14:16,275
These voters cast their ballots in Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.

1461
02:14:16,948 --> 02:14:22,732
Right now, I'm hoping to help Doug Jones become the new United States Senator.

1462
02:14:23,333 --> 02:14:26,075
I believe that my vote can make a difference.

1463
02:14:26,455 --> 02:14:34,261
And if everyone come in together and collectively put in their vote for their candidate, we can have the right people in power.

1464
02:14:34,721 --> 02:14:36,823
Voted for Rory Moore, Republican.

1465
02:14:37,983 --> 02:14:40,744
I believe that he stands for the values that I was brought up with.

1466
02:14:41,504 --> 02:14:45,765
And I believe that the generation that we're in right now, we need a lot of more.

1467
02:14:46,505 --> 02:14:51,486
I voted for him because I believe he believes in the right thing and he also believes in God.

1468
02:14:52,287 --> 02:14:57,428
And I think he'll help everybody education-wise and medical-wise, what he says.

1469
02:14:57,808 --> 02:15:02,189
Let's go to our correspondent watching the results in Washington, D.C., David Willis.

1470
02:15:02,269 --> 02:15:05,850
David, any indication yet of what the result may be?

1471
02:15:06,925 --> 02:15:12,747
Well, the polls closed just over an hour ago, Jonathan, and it is still too early to call.

1472
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:21,171
With 12 percent of the vote in, the cable news network here, CNN, is reporting 50 percent in favor of Roy Moore, 48 percent

1473
02:15:22,952 --> 02:15:24,994
for Doug Jones, the Democratic contender.

1474
02:15:25,074 --> 02:15:28,057
So it really is very, very tight.

1475
02:15:28,117 --> 02:15:33,262
And the polls in the last few weeks, of course, have put these two candidates absolutely neck and neck.

1476
02:15:33,302 --> 02:15:40,810
The Democrats have been working hard to get out the black vote in places such as Birmingham.

1477
02:15:41,150 --> 02:15:43,713
And the fear amongst Republicans, of course,

1478
02:15:44,594 --> 02:15:59,707
is that the conservative white voters who would normally vote en masse for Roy Moore might be tempted to stay at home in the light of the allegations against him, those lurid allegations of sexual misconduct.

1479
02:15:59,847 --> 02:16:07,935
Turnout could be the key here and the early indications are that it may well have been higher than expected, Jonathan.

1480
02:16:08,575 --> 02:16:17,844
Normally, a Senate race in the Deep South wouldn't even, well, certainly wouldn't get the amount of coverage that this one in Alabama is.

1481
02:16:17,924 --> 02:16:21,047
Remind us why this race is being so closely watched.

1482
02:16:21,988 --> 02:16:22,829
Well, you're absolutely right.

1483
02:16:22,849 --> 02:16:30,817
What's astonishing about all this is that a Republican victory in a state such as Alabama should have been a slam dunk for the Republicans.

1484
02:16:31,238 --> 02:16:32,459
Alabama hasn't elected

1485
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:35,581
a Democrat to the Senate for 25 years.

1486
02:16:35,641 --> 02:16:42,224
But the allegations against Roy Moore have turned everything on its head, basically.

1487
02:16:42,544 --> 02:16:58,693
Senior Republicans have been divided over whether to support him and protect the Senate majority, that narrow Senate majority, or shun him because of the sexual misconduct allegations and what they could mean in next year's midterm elections.

1488
02:16:59,253 --> 02:17:01,875
President Trump, of course, has gone from

1489
02:17:02,395 --> 02:17:24,995
tepid support from Roy Moore to more full-throttle support for him in recent days and a victory for Roy Moore would in a sense help establish President Trump's authority over a Senate that at times hasn't been completely compliant as far as he's concerned.

1490
02:17:25,475 --> 02:17:31,501
David Willis in Washington, D.C., watching the results come in from that key Senate race in Alabama.

1491
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:39,468
We'll have more as we get it on whether we can draw any conclusions at this stage as to the possible result.

1492
02:17:40,228 --> 02:17:42,851
But for now, we will move on, but stay in the U.S.

1493
02:17:42,891 --> 02:17:47,895
because the Secretary of State there, Rex Tillerson, has urged North Korea to come to the negotiating table.

1494
02:17:48,015 --> 02:17:50,698
With tensions high over the country's nuclear program,

1495
02:17:51,198 --> 02:17:55,781
Speaking in Washington, Mr Tillerson said the countries could meet with no preconditions.

1496
02:17:56,601 --> 02:17:59,603
We're ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk.

1497
02:18:00,303 --> 02:18:03,365
And we're ready to have the first meeting without precondition.

1498
02:18:03,845 --> 02:18:04,566
Let's just meet.

1499
02:18:05,166 --> 02:18:06,527
We can talk about the weather if you want.

1500
02:18:06,547 --> 02:18:11,289
We can talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about.

1501
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:16,612
But can we at least sit down and see each other face to face?

1502
02:18:17,593 --> 02:18:19,614
And then we can begin to lay out

1503
02:18:20,396 --> 02:18:24,060
a road map of what we might be willing to work towards.

1504
02:18:24,421 --> 02:18:36,233
Well, previously, the US has demanded that North Korea disarm first, the White House saying that this is not a policy shift and that the president's views on North Korea have not changed.

1505
02:18:36,674 --> 02:18:42,160
Our correspondent at the US State Department, Barbara Pletusha, gave us her assessment of Mr Tillerson's speech.

1506
02:18:42,872 --> 02:18:44,433
He said, let's just meet and talk.

1507
02:18:44,494 --> 02:18:48,877
We just have to sit down face to face, get to know each other and put things on the table.

1508
02:18:48,898 --> 02:18:55,624
He said, it's not realistic to say that you can only talk about containing the nuclear program because, of course, Pyongyang is too invested in that.

1509
02:18:55,644 --> 02:19:00,548
So we need to, you know, see what they want to put on the table and whether we can discuss that.

1510
02:19:00,728 --> 02:19:03,391
But he said, ultimately, the U.S.

1511
02:19:03,491 --> 02:19:07,875
cannot accept a nuclear armed North Korea because it has a record of selling weaponry

1512
02:19:08,415 --> 02:19:11,238
And it doesn't abide by the rule of law, so it would just be too dangerous.

1513
02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:14,963
But still, it was quite a strong, I think, diplomatic offering to North Korea.

1514
02:19:15,343 --> 02:19:18,286
And how much of a policy shift is this by the US?

1515
02:19:18,326 --> 02:19:22,351
Because it's in stark contrast to a lot of the tough talk we've heard, certainly from the president.

1516
02:19:23,165 --> 02:19:29,868
Yes, the tough talk has contrasted with Mr. Tillerson's talk, but the policy, I think, has been the same, which is a diplomatic one that's been emphasized over and over again.

1517
02:19:29,949 --> 02:19:39,193
And Mr. Tillerson's approach has been to try to rally international support to isolate North Korea, and he says that there's been quite a lot of progress on that.

1518
02:19:39,253 --> 02:19:42,255
He said that sort of process was reaching a zenith, he said.

1519
02:19:42,635 --> 02:19:48,318
But in terms of offering talks without preconditions, he's never spelled out what the preconditions would be before

1520
02:19:48,938 --> 02:19:54,701
But I think it's probably a shift in that he's basically saying the US is ready for talks of any kind, at least to begin with.

1521
02:19:55,101 --> 02:19:57,183
It doesn't necessarily have to be about the nuclear program.

1522
02:19:57,603 --> 02:20:06,848
The thing that is the same, though, is that he spelled out that the goal was the same, and they've always been clear about the goal, which is that North Korea, in the end, would not be acceptable for it to have nuclear weapons.

1523
02:20:07,428 --> 02:20:11,450
Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump have had a little bit of a rocky relationship.

1524
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:15,953
It wasn't all that long ago that there was talk of the Secretary of State being replaced.

1525
02:20:16,333 --> 02:20:18,334
Is his future certain at the moment?

1526
02:20:18,930 --> 02:20:24,974
Well, I don't think anything is certain, but certainly those reports were denied by Mr. Tillerson.

1527
02:20:25,014 --> 02:20:27,896
He said they were laughable previously to the press.

1528
02:20:27,936 --> 02:20:30,557
He said, you're always telling the wrong story, you need to get some new sources.

1529
02:20:30,597 --> 02:20:32,318
So he has previously dismissed them.

1530
02:20:32,619 --> 02:20:37,622
Mr. Trump has also, since those reports come out, has expressed some confidence in him.

1531
02:20:38,202 --> 02:20:46,826
I think there are tensions between the two that's been, I think, pretty widely reported, and they are quite different people, and they have different approaches to policy as well.

1532
02:20:46,886 --> 02:20:55,129
But certainly from the speech that Mr. Tillerson gave when he talked about everything he'd been working on in the year, and then he mentioned that he was planning to travel to South America in the new year.

1533
02:20:55,169 --> 02:20:56,530
We know he's planning to travel to Africa.

1534
02:20:57,115 --> 02:21:01,697
So he certainly sounded like a man who expected to continue in his job for at least a while longer.

1535
02:21:02,077 --> 02:21:02,978
Barbara Pletasha.

1536
02:21:03,598 --> 02:21:08,060
Now to a humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

1537
02:21:08,441 --> 02:21:14,624
The UN is warning that at least 400,000 children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

1538
02:21:15,164 --> 02:21:21,507
The crisis is at its worst in the central Kassai region where fighting erupted last year between local groups and government troops.

1539
02:21:22,227 --> 02:21:23,588
3,000 people have died.

1540
02:21:24,148 --> 02:21:27,710
Our Africa editor Fergal Keane travelled to Kassai and sent this report.

1541
02:21:29,831 --> 02:21:43,178
We're with a Pakistan Army patrol and we're moving along a dirt track outside the town of Chengulu and going in the direction of what we're told is a mass grave containing the bodies of people who were killed here.

1542
02:21:44,558 --> 02:21:46,519
We're just dismounting now from the vehicle.

1543
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:48,560
It's somewhere near here.

1544
02:21:53,697 --> 02:21:57,281
Walking along a narrow track, which is largely overgrown.

1545
02:21:57,321 --> 02:22:00,205
There's high grass and different kinds of bushes all around me.

1546
02:22:01,386 --> 02:22:05,771
And down here at the end, I'm told, is a mass grave.

1547
02:22:06,692 --> 02:22:10,617
Nobody knows exactly how many people are in it, but it's men, women, and children.

1548
02:22:11,479 --> 02:22:29,333
and they were dumped here by the military and have come to this small depression where you can see bush was cleared away, ground was dug up and there's human clothing here, man's trousers reaching out of the earth.

1549
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:37,127
A local woman approached us to say her 12-year-old son had been killed, and she'd witnessed the army dumping bodies.

1550
02:22:43,453 --> 02:22:52,982
The violence began when long-simmering resentments exploded into rebellion after security forces killed a chief, Kamina Ansapo, who'd rebelled against the government.

1551
02:22:54,163 --> 02:22:59,028
The Kabila regime was trying to entrench its hold on an area known as an opposition stronghold.

1552
02:22:59,768 --> 02:23:04,633
The chief's followers struck back, killing all they regarded as collaborators of the state.

1553
02:23:05,413 --> 02:23:08,356
There were mass beheadings, schools and clinics were burned.

1554
02:23:10,643 --> 02:23:18,207
The government responded with pitiless violence, killing militiamen and turning its guns on civilians accused of supporting the rebels.

1555
02:23:19,127 --> 02:23:25,410
I spoke with numerous survivors of the violence carried out by the state and the Banamura militia, which it supports.

1556
02:23:26,911 --> 02:23:31,553
I've come to the Ebenezer Church on the outskirts of the town of Chicago.

1557
02:23:32,113 --> 02:23:36,335
When I say church, it's basically tin shack.

1558
02:23:37,106 --> 02:23:41,536
a large open-air tin shack, crowded with children.

1559
02:23:41,596 --> 02:23:46,908
I've never seen so many children in a displaced environment and that backs up the statistic.

1560
02:23:47,737 --> 02:23:56,624
Out of an estimated 1.5 million people who were displaced, over 800,000 of them were children.

1561
02:23:56,664 --> 02:23:59,226
I saw people with machetes, guns and clubs.

1562
02:23:59,806 --> 02:24:03,469
They were beheading people, cutting arms and legs, slashing bellies.

1563
02:24:04,189 --> 02:24:06,131
I had to climb over dead bodies to escape.

1564
02:24:06,911 --> 02:24:09,793
I had four children, but could escape with only one.

1565
02:24:10,474 --> 02:24:11,575
The other three were killed.

1566
02:24:12,275 --> 02:24:15,658
The women at the church managed to escape, but others were abducted.

1567
02:24:16,604 --> 02:24:22,352
I met a mother and her 15-year-old daughter who were taken by the Banimura militia to isolated farms.

1568
02:24:25,335 --> 02:24:29,601
We had left our village in April and were taken as slaves on the farm the same month.

1569
02:24:29,941 --> 02:24:33,947
It's difficult to count how many times I was raped because it was during so many months.

1570
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:36,761
I did not know where my daughter was.

1571
02:24:37,582 --> 02:24:39,323
She was released after I escaped.

1572
02:24:40,284 --> 02:24:43,847
They told her, go now, for your mother has escaped and can get us arrested.

1573
02:24:44,828 --> 02:24:49,171
Only then, when she joined me in Chicapa, did I discover that she had been raped too.

1574
02:24:51,141 --> 02:25:04,186
The UN peacekeeping force is just under 20,000 troops, but is being cut by 3,000 under American pressure, and all at a time when violence across the Congo is mounting amid widening political instability.

1575
02:25:05,306 --> 02:25:14,830
In Kassai, where the dead are cast into rivers, into mass graves, there's no real peace to keep, only a daily effort to hold back the forces of chaos.

1576
02:25:15,984 --> 02:25:19,967
our Africa editor Fergal Keane in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

1577
02:25:20,228 --> 02:25:22,049
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

1578
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:23,310
Neil has the headlines.

1579
02:25:24,211 --> 02:25:31,697
Vote counting is getting underway in Alabama after polls closed in a highly charged contest to choose a new US senator.

1580
02:25:32,517 --> 02:25:38,963
The US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says America is ready to open talks with North Korea without preconditions.

1581
02:25:40,308 --> 02:25:46,515
The story now of a three-week-old baby girl in Britain who was born with her heart outside her body.

1582
02:25:47,076 --> 02:25:51,121
After three operations to place her heart back in her chest, she has survived.

1583
02:25:51,521 --> 02:25:56,668
Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh met her family and doctors at the hospital in Leicester.

1584
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:00,631
Good girl.

1585
02:26:01,432 --> 02:26:01,832
Yeah.

1586
02:26:02,433 --> 02:26:03,834
She's a beautiful girl.

1587
02:26:04,275 --> 02:26:09,020
Proud parents bending over the cot of their three-week-old daughter, Vanellope.

1588
02:26:09,580 --> 02:26:14,025
She was born with a very rare condition where the heart grows outside the chest.

1589
02:26:14,445 --> 02:26:16,788
Her chances of survival were put at less than 10%.

1590
02:26:18,029 --> 02:26:22,954
But mum, Naomi Findley, and dad, Dean Wilkins, say she's a fighter.

1591
02:26:23,334 --> 02:26:24,935
more strength than I could ever imagine.

1592
02:26:25,235 --> 02:26:26,815
She came out kicking and screaming.

1593
02:26:26,855 --> 02:26:29,816
And then she gave all the surgeons agro, didn't she?

1594
02:26:30,136 --> 02:26:31,857
It was a beautiful moment, wasn't it?

1595
02:26:32,057 --> 02:26:33,117
Absolutely beautiful.

1596
02:26:33,958 --> 02:26:40,340
If you saw when she was first born, to where she is now and what they've done, it's... It's beyond a miracle, isn't it?

1597
02:26:40,700 --> 02:26:45,261
Doctors at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital say Vanellope has defied the odds.

1598
02:26:45,741 --> 02:26:52,022
Consultant paediatric cardiologist Frances Bulock says her prospects have greatly improved.

1599
02:26:52,262 --> 02:26:56,523
You know, her heart is covered by skin, hopefully sealed away from the environment.

1600
02:26:57,203 --> 02:26:58,503
She's still on a breathing machine.

1601
02:26:58,703 --> 02:27:01,204
She's still got drains in to take fluid away.

1602
02:27:01,964 --> 02:27:03,704
She's got a long road ahead of her.

1603
02:27:03,744 --> 02:27:06,325
It's not done, but I think they're much better than they were.

1604
02:27:06,785 --> 02:27:11,990
Phenelope has no breastbone and will need more surgery to create one in years to come.

1605
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:19,136
Doctors are considering using material from a 3D printer or something organic that would grow with her.

1606
02:27:20,077 --> 02:27:27,641
Fergus Walsh, the Great Red Spot on Jupiter is the biggest storm in the solar system and we've known about it for more than 150 years.

1607
02:27:27,741 --> 02:27:32,883
We also know that it's wider than the Earth with wind speeds up to 650 kilometres an hour.

1608
02:27:33,363 --> 02:27:39,146
Now NASA says its space probe DUNE has discovered more about the Great Red Spot.

1609
02:27:39,706 --> 02:27:46,990
Our correspondent Jonathan Amos is at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans where the agency has been presenting its findings.

1610
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:53,634
We've been observing the Great Red Spot on Jupiter probably since the invention of the telescope.

1611
02:27:53,674 --> 02:27:59,939
Yes, we've got records 150 years back, but probably, you know, we've been seeing it for something like 400 years.

1612
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:01,220
That's extraordinary.

1613
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:05,223
If you think about hurricanes on Earth, they last, what, a couple of weeks?

1614
02:28:05,963 --> 02:28:08,785
And then you think how long the Great Red Spot has been going.

1615
02:28:08,965 --> 02:28:09,886
Now, why is that?

1616
02:28:09,966 --> 02:28:10,807
What drives it?

1617
02:28:11,187 --> 02:28:14,990
And that's one of the mission goals of Juno, is to try and understand it.

1618
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:19,733
And one of the first things it had to find out was just how deep its roots are.

1619
02:28:20,234 --> 02:28:26,318
Was it a feature that was just at the surface of the planet, or did those roots go deep, deep down inside?

1620
02:28:26,359 --> 02:28:34,064
Well, we know the answer to that question, or partially the answer to that question, because Juno has this microwave radiometer that can sense heat

1621
02:28:35,225 --> 02:28:40,367
inside the planet, and it can see that the roots go down at least 350 kilometers.

1622
02:28:40,407 --> 02:28:43,548
Now, that may not be the bottom of the Great Red Spot.

1623
02:28:43,628 --> 02:28:57,433
It may go down further, and if it can do some gravity measurements over the coming months, then we may well find out that this storm extends, you know, over a thousand kilometers down inside the planet, which would be quite extraordinary.

1624
02:28:57,933 --> 02:29:08,259
Now, if you go back to the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago, it's almost certain that Jupiter was the first thing to form after the Sun, sort of sucked up everything else that was around.

1625
02:29:08,499 --> 02:29:17,785
If you took all of the other planets, the comets, the asteroids, all of the other bits of debris apart from the Sun, you could fit it all inside of Jupiter.

1626
02:29:18,285 --> 02:29:24,916
So unless you understand how Jupiter works, you don't really understand how the rest of the solar system works.

1627
02:29:25,196 --> 02:29:32,948
So in many ways, this is one of the most important missions that NASA has ever undertaken, to reveal the great secrets of this amazing world.

1628
02:29:33,449 --> 02:29:37,291
That's Jonathan Amos on new discoveries about Jupiter's great red spot.

1629
02:29:37,752 --> 02:29:43,796
It is two years since the Paris Climate Agreement was signed and the question now is how to pay for it.

1630
02:29:43,936 --> 02:29:47,938
Representatives from around 50 countries are meeting again in the French capital.

1631
02:29:48,298 --> 02:29:54,082
Major investors have vowed to move away from the fossil fuel industry to try to reduce global warming.

1632
02:29:54,302 --> 02:29:55,323
Roger Harabin reports.

1633
02:29:55,983 --> 02:30:04,529
It's governments which set policies for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but it's typically business and financial institutions which make those policies happen.

1634
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:10,634
In Paris, more than a thousand firms and financial bodies pledged themselves to a low-carbon economy.

1635
02:30:11,214 --> 02:30:18,199
The commitment from the World Bank was the most eye-catching, with its promise to stop funding exploration in oil and gas.

1636
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:21,642
Its president, Jim Yong Kim, said the time was right.

1637
02:30:22,122 --> 02:30:29,588
We're now seeing that the price of solar has gone down so much, the cost and size of batteries has gone down so much.

1638
02:30:30,148 --> 02:30:44,510
that we think that energy needs can be provided by other means and the science of this is just changing so quickly that we want to get out ahead and we don't think that we need to be in the upstream oil and gas business anymore.

1639
02:30:45,051 --> 02:30:48,553
There was a big announcement, too, from the French insurance firm AXA.

1640
02:30:49,033 --> 02:30:58,639
It's going to quadruple its investment in green technologies, sell its shares in coal, and phase out insurance cover for new coal and oil sands projects.

1641
02:30:59,499 --> 02:31:08,264
Earlier, the oil giant Exxon announced that it would publish reports on the impact of climate change policies on its huge reserves of fossil fuels.

1642
02:31:08,844 --> 02:31:11,586
Some think these might look a liability in years to come.

1643
02:31:12,406 --> 02:31:16,348
After today's initiatives, though, came a reality check by environmentalists.

1644
02:31:16,968 --> 02:31:22,931
They said the pledges still weren't enough to save vulnerable communities from the effects of a heating climate.

1645
02:31:23,611 --> 02:31:25,852
You're listening to the Newsroom from the BBC World Service.

1646
02:31:25,932 --> 02:31:27,833
Neil has some other stories from our news desk.

1647
02:31:28,333 --> 02:31:37,537
In a high-profile court case in Egypt, a pop singer, Shaima Ahmed, has been jailed for two years for making a raunchy music video, Ellen Johnston reports.

1648
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:42,762
The video that got Shaima into trouble featured her dancing in lingerie.

1649
02:31:43,062 --> 02:31:49,844
She flirted with a classroom full of young men and ate a banana in a sexually suggestive manner.

1650
02:31:50,424 --> 02:31:54,066
The video would have been regarded as racy anywhere in the world.

1651
02:31:54,626 --> 02:32:00,048
In socially conservative Egypt, it provoked indignation and a torrent of criticism.

1652
02:32:00,728 --> 02:32:03,391
Sheymer was charged with inciting debauchery.

1653
02:32:04,032 --> 02:32:12,803
She denied the allegation, but she apologised, and when she came to court, she cut a much more modest figure, appearing in a face veil.

1654
02:32:13,573 --> 02:32:18,596
New research indicates feathered dinosaurs were covered in ticks, just like animals today.

1655
02:32:18,676 --> 02:32:25,500
Parasites similar to modern ticks have been found inside pieces of amber from Myanmar dating back 99 million years.

1656
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:30,763
And the co-founder of the global hairdressing chain Tony and Guy has died at the age of 75.

1657
02:32:31,203 --> 02:32:40,769
Giuseppe Tony Mascolo, an Italian, established the first of his salons in London in the 1960s with his younger brother, Gaetano, known as Guy.

1658
02:32:41,792 --> 02:32:42,313
Thank you, Neil.

1659
02:32:42,373 --> 02:32:46,978
Now, when it comes to navigating, bees, it seems, do not bumble.

1660
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:49,041
To tell us more, here's Richard Hamilton.

1661
02:32:49,702 --> 02:33:00,355
It's known as the travelling salesman problem, a benchmark question in computer science that poses the question, given a list of cities and the distance between each pair of cities,

1662
02:33:00,935 --> 02:33:09,699
What is the shortest possible route the salesman needs to take in order to visit each city and then return to his original starting point?

1663
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:17,803
The scientists gave the bees the travelling salesman problem, except they used flowers instead of cities, to see if they could solve it.

1664
02:33:18,363 --> 02:33:25,947
They tried to trick the bees by offering them shortcuts between individual flowers that increased the total distance they travelled.

1665
02:33:26,647 --> 02:33:29,669
At first the bumblebees fell for these tempting traps,

1666
02:33:30,049 --> 02:33:36,771
But after a while, they gradually began to refine their flight paths, thus reducing their overall distance.

1667
02:33:37,351 --> 02:33:42,012
The lead researcher is Dr. Joe Woodgate from Queen Mary University of London.

1668
02:33:42,432 --> 02:33:47,754
What we discovered is that there are some arrangements of the feeders that they're trying to travel between.

1669
02:33:48,314 --> 02:33:56,660
in which there are shortcuts that may initially appear tempting, because it means that you can get to another flower in only quite a short time.

1670
02:33:57,161 --> 02:34:00,884
But by taking them, you actually increase your overall travel distance.

1671
02:34:01,624 --> 02:34:06,728
And what we found here is that the bees, in fact, didn't learn to ignore the shortcuts.

1672
02:34:06,828 --> 02:34:11,792
They seem to have a very strong preference for taking the nearest possible route to a feeder.

1673
02:34:12,432 --> 02:34:15,254
But what we discover is that they do have flexibility.

1674
02:34:15,294 --> 02:34:18,076
They're not bound to only ever go to the closest feeders.

1675
02:34:18,256 --> 02:34:27,102
Dr. Woodgate believes that this study could also provide insights into analogous problems in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.

1676
02:34:27,803 --> 02:34:41,112
He also says that understanding how bees search for food and use the landscape is crucial to managing the risks posed by increased agricultural activity, environmental degradation and habitat loss.

1677
02:34:41,772 --> 02:34:43,275
That was Richard Hamilton reporting.

1678
02:34:43,395 --> 02:34:47,781
You've been listening to The Newsroom from the BBC World Service with me, Jonathan Blake.

1679
02:34:55,937 --> 02:34:57,979
Starvation stalked the Australians.

1680
02:34:58,499 --> 02:35:01,882
It hid in each man's every act and every thought.

1681
02:35:02,302 --> 02:35:08,187
Richard Flanagan talks about his Man Booker Prize winning novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North.

1682
02:35:08,447 --> 02:35:14,372
It was something that grew in me like a boulder till it was almost choking me.

1683
02:35:15,152 --> 02:35:16,473
And I felt I had to write it.

1684
02:35:17,114 --> 02:35:20,256
A story inspired by the life of his own father.

1685
02:35:20,477 --> 02:35:27,682
I felt a second utterly illogical thing, that if I didn't finish the book before my father died, I would never finish it.

1686
02:35:28,083 --> 02:35:30,565
That took him 12 years to write.

1687
02:35:31,245 --> 02:35:34,368
He asked me how it was going and I told him that it was done.

1688
02:35:35,308 --> 02:35:37,130
And he passed away that afternoon.

1689
02:35:40,302 --> 02:35:46,782
World Book Club with Richard Flanagan at bbcworldservers.com slash worldbookclub

1690
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:57,365
Coming up, President Trump's campaign to make America great again was an effective but very divisive campaign.

1691
02:35:57,966 --> 02:36:08,174
US citizens might talk about America as the greatest country on Earth, but it's a problematic word for Latin Americans who consider America to be a continent, not a country.

1692
02:36:08,734 --> 02:36:14,479
What does the region's history teach us about identity and politics of America in the Americas?

1693
02:36:14,919 --> 02:36:17,762
Join me, Katie Watson, after the latest world news.

1694
02:36:20,462 --> 02:36:22,203
BBC News with Neil Nunes.

1695
02:36:22,723 --> 02:36:30,766
Results are keenly awaited in Alabama, a traditionally Republican state, where votes are being counted in the election for a new U.S.

1696
02:36:30,786 --> 02:36:31,846
Senate representative.

1697
02:36:32,226 --> 02:36:37,768
The Republican Roy Moore is hoping to win and brush off allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers.

1698
02:36:38,188 --> 02:36:39,909
He has President Trump's backing.

1699
02:36:40,309 --> 02:36:45,591
Mr. Moore's rival, Doug Jones, wants to be the first Democrat in a quarter of a century to win the seat.

1700
02:36:46,511 --> 02:36:46,911
The U.S.

1701
02:36:46,951 --> 02:36:53,174
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says America is willing to hold direct talks with North Korea without preconditions.

1702
02:36:53,574 --> 02:36:55,175
He said the topic would not matter.

1703
02:36:55,275 --> 02:36:57,016
It could simply be about the weather.

1704
02:36:57,316 --> 02:37:00,718
But the point was to lay out a roadmap for formal negotiations.

1705
02:37:01,138 --> 02:37:01,618
The U.S.

1706
02:37:01,658 --> 02:37:04,580
has previously demanded that the North must first disarm.

1707
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:17,450
UNICEF has warned that more than 400,000 severely malnourished children under the age of five in the Democratic Republic of Congo could die within months without emergency intervention.

1708
02:37:17,931 --> 02:37:24,616
It said the crisis was due to a combination of violence, mass displacement of families, and slumping agricultural output.

1709
02:37:25,617 --> 02:37:25,838
U.S.

1710
02:37:25,978 --> 02:37:32,125
artists say the region around the North Pole shows no sign of returning to its once reliably frozen state.

1711
02:37:32,525 --> 02:37:42,176
An annual study warns that the Arctic is traditionally the refrigerator of the planet, but the door has been left open, leaving the cold to spill out and cascade through the northern hemisphere.

1712
02:37:43,117 --> 02:37:52,805
One of the largest annual pilgrimages in Latin America has been marred this year by the death of at least 11 pilgrims in a motorway crash between Mexico City and Puebla.

1713
02:37:53,126 --> 02:37:55,408
The victims were honoring the Virgin of Guadalupe.

1714
02:37:56,629 --> 02:38:02,714
Scientists in Britain have suggested that bumblebees are much more intelligent than had previously been supposed.

1715
02:38:03,134 --> 02:38:15,927
The bees were given the task of finding the most efficient routes between different sources of food and, far from bumbling, learned to avoid tempting traps and to refine their flight paths between flower feeding stations.

1716
02:38:16,888 --> 02:38:18,570
BBC World News.

1717
02:38:23,404 --> 02:38:26,007
We are going to start winning again.

1718
02:38:26,227 --> 02:38:29,330
I'm Katie Watson, and this is Make America Great Again.

1719
02:38:29,830 --> 02:38:35,856
We are going to make America so great again, maybe greater than ever before.

1720
02:38:35,956 --> 02:38:37,317
I love you all.

1721
02:38:37,618 --> 02:38:38,298
Thank you.

1722
02:38:38,378 --> 02:38:47,287
President Trump's campaign to make America great again was clearly effective, but pretty divisive.

1723
02:38:48,007 --> 02:38:50,388
It's not uncommon to hear people from the U.S.

1724
02:38:50,508 --> 02:38:53,209
say that America is the greatest country on Earth.

1725
02:38:53,649 --> 02:38:59,011
But for the millions of people living south of the U.S., the word America is problematic.

1726
02:38:59,671 --> 02:39:05,093
I've lived in Chile, Mexico, and now Brazil, and the view is shared across the region.

1727
02:39:05,474 --> 02:39:06,434
But although the U.S.

1728
02:39:06,454 --> 02:39:11,156
considers America a country, for Latin Americans, it's a continent.

1729
02:39:11,216 --> 02:39:13,276
It's not a question of being oversensitive.

1730
02:39:13,717 --> 02:39:16,938
It's about being politically and geographically correct.

1731
02:39:17,858 --> 02:39:19,599
It's one and the same.

1732
02:39:19,619 --> 02:39:20,180
Am I wrong?

1733
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:21,120
Is the U.S.

1734
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:22,321
different from America?

1735
02:39:22,341 --> 02:39:23,302
Is that something different?

1736
02:39:23,542 --> 02:39:30,426
First of all, America is a continent, not United States only.

1737
02:39:30,466 --> 02:39:33,148
There is some degree of confusion on that.

1738
02:39:34,048 --> 02:39:41,393
After the election of President Trump and while I was living in Mexico, the issue became more pronounced and highly politicized.

1739
02:39:41,873 --> 02:39:52,081
I wanted to find out why and how the word America became synonymous with the US to many, but at the same time excluding so many more.

1740
02:39:52,201 --> 02:40:02,128
There are some in the United States who share this idea of solidarity, who believe in a fundamental brotherhood of American republics, but they're really in a minority.

1741
02:40:04,689 --> 02:40:16,077
So I started my journey on a baking hot day in Washington, D.C., underneath one of the most famous museums in the U.S., in a tunnel.

1742
02:40:17,178 --> 02:40:27,865
We're in the Madison Building now, and where we're going is over to the Exploring the Early Americas exhibit, and we're going to take the tunnel underneath the street in order to get there.

1743
02:40:29,818 --> 02:40:31,919
This is the Library of Congress.

1744
02:40:32,139 --> 02:40:35,321
It houses what's known as the Birth Certificate of America.

1745
02:40:35,921 --> 02:40:42,604
And when I say America, I mean what we now think of as North and South America, the whole continent.

1746
02:40:42,865 --> 02:40:46,626
So this is the Exploring the Early Americas exhibit.

1747
02:40:46,646 --> 02:40:54,050
So this is where we display our archaeological objects and basically really tell the story of the earliest Americas, the pre-colonial Americas.

1748
02:40:54,150 --> 02:41:02,213
After walking through a huge marble hall, we came to a quiet, dark corner of the museum, the home of a map known as the Waldseemüller.

1749
02:41:02,733 --> 02:41:03,553
I'm John Hessler.

1750
02:41:03,613 --> 02:41:05,234
I'm the curator of the J.I.

1751
02:41:05,254 --> 02:41:10,076
Kislak Collection of the Archaeology and History of the Early Americas at the Library of Congress.

1752
02:41:10,456 --> 02:41:17,038
Behind glass, very dim light, there is a map with 12 sub-maps, if you like.

1753
02:41:17,258 --> 02:41:22,485
Basically, we're looking at the only surviving copy of the 1507 map by Martin Waldseemuller.

1754
02:41:22,845 --> 02:41:27,651
The map itself is a real radical vision of the geography of the world.

1755
02:41:27,931 --> 02:41:31,476
It's the first map that pulls the New World off of Asia.

1756
02:41:31,856 --> 02:41:34,600
It also is, of course, the first map that names America.

1757
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:38,042
It also shows America being a continent, not a country.

1758
02:41:38,062 --> 02:41:38,342
It does.

1759
02:41:38,582 --> 02:41:41,424
It shows America being a rather large continent.

1760
02:41:41,504 --> 02:41:49,690
And up on the top of the map, there are two portraits, one of Ptolemy, who's the ancient Greek astronomer, and the other one of Amerigo Vespucci.

1761
02:41:50,210 --> 02:42:00,873
And so, Waltseemuller, he was an explorer and was one of the first people to sail off to the New World, one of the first people to make landfall on the actual main continent.

1762
02:42:00,953 --> 02:42:16,397
In naming it after Vespucci, it's not Amerigo, it's America, and he uses America because the other four continents, Africa, Asia, and Europa in Latin, are all feminine, so he has to feminize Vespucci's Amerigo to make it America.

1763
02:42:17,037 --> 02:42:21,378
When you look at it, you feel as if you're looking at the modern world as opposed to the ancient world.

1764
02:42:21,838 --> 02:42:41,722
In the little piece of writing on the right-hand side, there's a long text in Latin, and to paraphrase what Walter Mueller says, he says, if you're looking at this map for the first time and you're unfamiliar with the new discoveries, don't be concerned or upset about what you see, because this is how you will come to see your world in the future.

1765
02:42:42,222 --> 02:42:48,246
The way people kind of envision this is that Columbus discovered America and Vespucci sold it.

1766
02:42:48,566 --> 02:42:51,708
When did the concept of America then shrink?

1767
02:42:52,308 --> 02:42:59,673
After this, Waltie Muller's map gets lost for some time and then you'll see a little bit later Ortelius, a famous Dutch mapmaker.

1768
02:43:00,013 --> 02:43:03,454
will basically separate it into a North and South America.

1769
02:43:03,894 --> 02:43:15,076
And so he will basically begin separating it, and it is really from him that you begin to get this proliferation in the mid-1600s of America as a name appearing on maps.

1770
02:43:15,116 --> 02:43:23,778
The landmass appears in 1508 and in maps that follow it, but the name really doesn't grab on until the real mid-17th century.

1771
02:43:23,798 --> 02:43:26,099
It's still quite far back, though.

1772
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:33,425
It becomes North and South and the whole continent sort of blends into the Americas as opposed to just America.

1773
02:43:34,085 --> 02:43:36,928
And why did the name America disappear?

1774
02:43:36,968 --> 02:43:38,449
Why have we got the New World instead?

1775
02:43:38,609 --> 02:43:39,089
No one knows.

1776
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:43,293
So the controversy of the word America started very early on.

1777
02:43:46,563 --> 02:43:55,066
It's worth skipping forward to another important part of history here, 1823, and the beginning of what is now known as the Monroe Doctrine.

1778
02:43:55,586 --> 02:43:57,187
Dr. David Sim is a U.S.

1779
02:43:57,227 --> 02:43:59,368
historian from University College London.

1780
02:44:00,962 --> 02:44:20,120
what changes in the early republic in the 1820s is the more conscious usage of the term south america to differentiate the area below the united states or up to the 1820s that term existed but it wasn't that common it comes into much more formal use in the 1820s and that's

1781
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:27,648
partly as a reaction to the successful American revolutions in South Latin American countries.

1782
02:44:27,728 --> 02:44:36,258
It's partly also a product of the era of the Monroe Doctrine and a sharper differentiation between North America, which comes to be understood as the domain of the United States.

1783
02:44:36,798 --> 02:44:37,919
We'll not talk about Canada.

1784
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:41,783
and South America, which is Catholic, which is Spanish-speaking.

1785
02:44:42,263 --> 02:44:50,349
What becomes known as the Monroe Doctrine is a message articulated by President James Monroe in December 1823.

1786
02:44:50,409 --> 02:44:53,412
It's part of his annual State of the Union Address.

1787
02:44:53,672 --> 02:44:59,176
And he, in that address, talks about the distinction between the old world and the new world.

1788
02:44:59,597 --> 02:45:06,242
The old world, he says, is monarchical, is Eurocentric, is riven with violence and conflict.

1789
02:45:07,063 --> 02:45:09,685
and ambitious aristocrats and monarchs.

1790
02:45:10,445 --> 02:45:18,211
And in the new world, all ambitions for European colonization need to be resisted by Americans, meaning U.S.

1791
02:45:18,251 --> 02:45:20,453
Americans, but also Americans as a whole.

1792
02:45:21,113 --> 02:45:29,039
It's only really in the 1840s and 50s that it begins to be thought of as a doctrine, as a set of fundamental principles.

1793
02:45:29,239 --> 02:45:32,382
And ironically, that's the point at which the United States becomes expansionist.

1794
02:45:32,822 --> 02:45:39,446
The Monroe Doctrine becomes a tool to squeeze out other European ambitions in the Americas.

1795
02:45:39,886 --> 02:45:43,548
Not so that Latin Americans can self-govern, but so that U.S.

1796
02:45:43,608 --> 02:45:46,390
Americans can open up that space for U.S.

1797
02:45:46,430 --> 02:45:48,291
American territorial expansion.

1798
02:45:48,631 --> 02:45:52,053
The concept of Pan-Americanism, says David, is important.

1799
02:45:52,793 --> 02:45:59,120
So, when Monroe articulates in December 1823, lots of Latin Americans are very excited, very pleased to see this.

1800
02:45:59,640 --> 02:46:13,154
They think it's a moment when US Americans are embracing their Latin American brothers, are committed to building a kind of Pan-American Union to resist Spanish, French and British colonialism in the New World.

1801
02:46:13,214 --> 02:46:15,457
And that's not really what Monroe is getting at.

1802
02:46:16,197 --> 02:46:18,579
When Latin American representatives asked the U.S.

1803
02:46:18,619 --> 02:46:28,686
government in the 1820s to make good that promise, to act on it, the Monroe administration and the John Quincy Adams administration, the Colossals, threw up their hands and said, you know, what are you talking about?

1804
02:46:28,706 --> 02:46:32,429
We didn't make a commitment to defend you against Spanish monarchy.

1805
02:46:33,049 --> 02:46:35,231
We were just articulating an idea.

1806
02:46:35,611 --> 02:46:41,155
There are some in the United States who share this idea of solidarity, who believe in a fundamental

1807
02:46:41,635 --> 02:46:45,038
Brotherhood of American Republics, but they're really in a minority.

1808
02:46:45,299 --> 02:46:51,684
Pan-Americanism becomes associated in Latin America with two things really.

1809
02:46:52,465 --> 02:46:54,667
One is a way of masking U.S.

1810
02:46:54,727 --> 02:46:55,708
imperial ambitions.

1811
02:46:55,968 --> 02:46:59,812
So the United States uses the language of brotherhood, it uses the language of Pan-Americanism.

1812
02:47:00,212 --> 02:47:03,876
but really it's interested in extending its own economic and political interests.

1813
02:47:04,157 --> 02:47:08,882
So Latin Americans use Pan-Americanism as a means to counter the influence of the United States.

1814
02:47:09,223 --> 02:47:11,946
So it's a Pan-Americanism that excludes the United States.

1815
02:47:12,406 --> 02:47:17,392
And that really takes off really from the 1840s onwards, after the war with Mexico, of course, 1846 to 1848.

1816
02:47:19,354 --> 02:47:26,218
Pan-Americanism becomes, for many Latin American governments, a means of countering that aggressive northern neighbor.

1817
02:47:26,338 --> 02:47:31,080
And Latin Americans are using Pan-Americanism as a way of resisting the juggernaut of U.S.

1818
02:47:31,440 --> 02:47:32,821
economic and political might.

1819
02:47:33,521 --> 02:47:35,582
So history shows us how much the U.S.

1820
02:47:35,622 --> 02:47:36,803
has dominated the region.

1821
02:47:37,163 --> 02:47:40,525
And when it comes to language, it's also made things complicated.

1822
02:47:43,462 --> 02:47:45,763
Yeah, I mean, for a lot of people, this is America.

1823
02:47:46,083 --> 02:47:50,624
And as the political discussion has been, it's more lately.

1824
02:47:50,644 --> 02:47:55,845
This is America and make America great again has become a very popular slogan.

1825
02:47:56,325 --> 02:48:00,946
Back in Washington, a short drive from the Library of Congress, I met Maureen Meyer.

1826
02:48:01,246 --> 02:48:09,108
She's the Mexico and migrant rights director at the Washington Office for Latin America, which researches and advocates for the rights of Latin Americans.

1827
02:48:09,508 --> 02:48:21,000
Though it certainly is a question of inclusion, and for people in Latin America, they view LGBT as a concept that goes beyond Latin America, but much more encompasses North America as well.

1828
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:22,381
What's your nationality though?

1829
02:48:22,922 --> 02:48:23,863
That's where it gets tricky.

1830
02:48:24,023 --> 02:48:25,364
I would say that I'm American.

1831
02:48:25,524 --> 02:48:26,846
In Spanish though, I do not.

1832
02:48:27,006 --> 02:48:32,632
I would say Estadounidense, which is a very long way of saying United Statesian, which doesn't really exist in English.

1833
02:48:33,052 --> 02:48:39,574
And actually, when you're in Mexico, sometimes people will say, if you want to go to the American, they'll say the, you know, the Embajada Americana.

1834
02:48:40,074 --> 02:48:47,736
No, and they also have a very odd way of talking about the Gobierno de Norteamerica, the North American government, which, if you look at it, would actually include Canada and Mexico as well.

1835
02:48:47,996 --> 02:48:51,417
And Mexicans are the first to complain when people don't think they're part of North America.

1836
02:48:51,677 --> 02:48:54,937
So, I think there's a lot of language issues here.

1837
02:48:55,198 --> 02:48:56,798
Make America Great Again should be

1838
02:48:57,758 --> 02:48:59,718
making the whole region green again.

1839
02:48:59,838 --> 02:49:03,119
But it goes beyond that to issues like the Monroe Doctrine.

1840
02:49:03,159 --> 02:49:09,760
So the United States viewing Latin America as its backyard and that you were able to do a lot of things in the region because you could.

1841
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,761
So there's the context, but let's put it into practice.

1842
02:49:14,281 --> 02:49:17,222
In Los Angeles, I asked a few people where they thought they were.

1843
02:49:17,502 --> 02:49:20,282
Are we in the US or in America?

1844
02:49:21,102 --> 02:49:21,582
Right now?

1845
02:49:23,703 --> 02:49:24,823
That's a tricky one.

1846
02:49:26,093 --> 02:49:28,434
This is kind of like a melting pot of everything.

1847
02:49:28,454 --> 02:49:29,354
You know what I mean?

1848
02:49:29,434 --> 02:49:30,654
This is just a spot.

1849
02:49:30,734 --> 02:49:32,335
I feel like we're in Mexico.

1850
02:49:33,435 --> 02:49:36,095
We're doing a story about the word America.

1851
02:49:36,115 --> 02:49:39,936
So I'm just wondering, when you think about where you are, are you in America or are you in the U.S.?

1852
02:49:40,016 --> 02:49:40,897
I think U.S.

1853
02:49:41,897 --> 02:49:42,457
And why?

1854
02:49:42,477 --> 02:49:43,717
I'm not certain why.

1855
02:49:45,558 --> 02:49:46,518
Are we in the U.S.

1856
02:49:46,698 --> 02:49:47,598
or in America?

1857
02:49:49,979 --> 02:49:50,839
It's one and the same.

1858
02:49:50,859 --> 02:49:51,399
Am I wrong?

1859
02:49:52,159 --> 02:49:52,679
The U.S.?

1860
02:49:52,719 --> 02:49:54,440
The United States of America?

1861
02:49:55,697 --> 02:49:56,518
Is the U.S.

1862
02:49:56,538 --> 02:49:57,699
different from America?

1863
02:49:57,719 --> 02:49:58,880
Is that something different?

1864
02:50:00,222 --> 02:50:08,290
I headed down to Venice Beach, a place which in many ways epitomizes the American dream, where the sun shines and anything goes.

1865
02:50:11,677 --> 02:50:20,143
And where I stood on the bustling sidewalk watching skateboarders compete with t-shirt sellers was, in fact, Mexico just 150 years ago.

1866
02:50:20,804 --> 02:50:23,566
It's a beautifully sunny day and I'm walking along Venice Beach.

1867
02:50:23,626 --> 02:50:26,207
It's probably the most chilled out part of Los Angeles.

1868
02:50:26,247 --> 02:50:29,049
There's white sand, tall palm trees.

1869
02:50:29,330 --> 02:50:31,431
It's the epitome of U.S.

1870
02:50:31,531 --> 02:50:31,951
culture.

1871
02:50:31,971 --> 02:50:36,515
In fact, if you think of the word America, this might be what a lot of people think about.

1872
02:50:38,494 --> 02:50:41,856
So what do those who identify as Mexican but have lived in the U.S.

1873
02:50:41,876 --> 02:50:44,897
for years think of the use of the word American now?

1874
02:50:45,738 --> 02:50:53,302
In a building set back from the beach, I met the charismatic Raul Hinojosa in his flat filled to the brim with artifacts from Mexico.

1875
02:50:53,322 --> 02:50:55,523
You've never been here on the weekend?

1876
02:50:55,543 --> 02:50:57,924
50,000 people right in front of my place right here.

1877
02:50:58,185 --> 02:51:06,149
I mean, it's this tribal coming together of this whole notion of beach, utopian, a dream.

1878
02:51:06,609 --> 02:51:07,990
Frankly, I couldn't live anywhere else.

1879
02:51:09,832 --> 02:51:17,384
Raul is a leading figure at the UCLA Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies and an expert on immigration from Mexico.

1880
02:51:17,705 --> 02:51:23,574
It's a continent, of course, and especially here in California where

1881
02:51:24,254 --> 02:51:31,160
people still have this historical memory that this was obviously Mexico and Spain before then, right?

1882
02:51:31,220 --> 02:51:40,988
So we have a perspective that most of Latin America has, that there was this transition, that there was something before, and that it is coming back.

1883
02:51:41,529 --> 02:51:44,912
The Reconquista is in a sense on its way.

1884
02:51:45,352 --> 02:51:52,458
And that doesn't mean the land is going to be taken back, but that there's going to be a new culture, a new dynamic,

1885
02:51:52,898 --> 02:51:57,065
That's actually probably the original America dream.

1886
02:51:57,753 --> 02:52:02,097
So the idea that California is a much more real sense of the word America?

1887
02:52:02,538 --> 02:52:15,530
In many ways, because it has lived all these various aspects, you know, of indigenous, of conquest, post-conquest, and this very advanced demographic transformation that's occurring.

1888
02:52:16,031 --> 02:52:22,637
And I find that quite surprising, being Mexican, living in the U.S., how the word America has become so natural.

1889
02:52:22,857 --> 02:52:33,462
The history of the term America as a definition for the nation really actually doesn't occur until the middle of the 19th century.

1890
02:52:33,542 --> 02:52:37,223
I mean, before then, there wasn't even the United States as an identity.

1891
02:52:37,544 --> 02:52:44,807
People in Latin America are much more obviously conscious of the term America when you refer to it to the United States.

1892
02:52:44,987 --> 02:52:47,048
They're like, wait a second, we're Americans.

1893
02:52:47,568 --> 02:52:49,169
We're in the Americas.

1894
02:52:50,069 --> 02:52:58,058
When you get here, I mean, you now have a Chicano identity, right, which is an identity that emerged here in Southern California.

1895
02:52:58,178 --> 02:53:08,330
So I wouldn't be surprised, you know, the Chicano, Latino young person today, and is extremely comfortable in even using the term American.

1896
02:53:13,372 --> 02:53:21,466
So if Raul is right and California is as American as it gets, how do those in a very Mexican part of Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, feel?

1897
02:53:27,152 --> 02:53:29,495
You could easily think you were in Mexico.

1898
02:53:29,515 --> 02:53:31,417
You can hear the mariachis playing.

1899
02:53:31,497 --> 02:53:37,203
They're serenading a girl who's celebrating her quinceañera, which is her 15th birthday party.

1900
02:53:37,584 --> 02:53:44,631
She's in an elaborate red dress with a bouquet of flowers, dancing with probably what looks like her mother, and in tears.

1901
02:53:44,651 --> 02:53:48,455
And this is a really important day for many a Mexican teenager.

1902
02:53:51,104 --> 02:53:54,947
Here I met Evangeline Ordaz, a local with Mexican parents.

1903
02:53:55,247 --> 02:53:58,290
She's a lawyer, housing activist and script writer.

1904
02:53:58,990 --> 02:54:04,034
I wanted to know how people of Mexican descent in this Hispanic area have come to view themselves.

1905
02:54:04,375 --> 02:54:13,442
In a cafe overlooking the Mariachi bandstand, she told me about growing up in East LA and her life, which in many ways epitomises the American dream.

1906
02:54:14,222 --> 02:54:23,548
Well, we were raised with this idea of when they say American, they mean kind of this white mainstream sort of... American dream.

1907
02:54:23,608 --> 02:54:29,751
American dream, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, you know, the United States sort of co-opted this word.

1908
02:54:30,272 --> 02:54:32,133
I think it wasn't until I got to college

1909
02:54:32,653 --> 02:54:34,654
that I sort of like, I'm like, oh, well, wait a minute.

1910
02:54:34,714 --> 02:54:42,376
No, America is this whole thing, this whole area from, you know, Canada to Chile.

1911
02:54:42,737 --> 02:54:55,561
Do you feel that there is much more of a kind of Mexico versus the U.S., whereas when you talk about your mother being very much of a kind of border family, that your mother was that American in the true sense of the word, that she didn't really think of borders?

1912
02:54:55,861 --> 02:54:57,582
We feel, I think there's

1913
02:54:58,362 --> 02:55:20,785
Sort of belonging to both places or I should say this whole place like ignoring the border It's so crazy though, because there are places here in Los Angeles like where we're sitting That you walk down the street and you could be you know in Mexico City you could be in the estado de Mexico you it's like the signage the language the music and

1914
02:55:21,105 --> 02:55:22,446
All the words are in Spanish.

1915
02:55:22,486 --> 02:55:24,186
You're not accounting for the English, I guess.

1916
02:55:24,206 --> 02:55:24,467
Right.

1917
02:55:24,687 --> 02:55:28,928
All to say the immigrants have come and sort of recreated home here.

1918
02:55:29,649 --> 02:55:32,650
Or maybe not recreated it, but uncovered it.

1919
02:55:32,730 --> 02:55:38,953
Because we're sitting in a building right now that was built on a land grant.

1920
02:55:39,473 --> 02:55:40,574
from the Spanish crown.

1921
02:55:41,075 --> 02:55:50,905
The grant holder gave the land as a wedding gift to his daughter when she married an Anglo immigrant to Mexico, when this was Mexico.

1922
02:55:51,346 --> 02:55:53,829
So in a sense, you know, the East L.A.

1923
02:55:53,889 --> 02:56:00,336
that exists right now is really just an uncovering of those Spanish and Mexican roots.

1924
02:56:01,036 --> 02:56:03,679
And sitting opposite a mariachi band, since we are in Mexico.

1925
02:56:03,699 --> 02:56:05,140
Exactly, exactly.

1926
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:12,087
And that was like, you know, an attempt to truly create Plaza de Garibaldi in Mexico City, where, you know, the mariachis are known together.

1927
02:56:21,383 --> 02:56:26,766
I'm in Plaza Garibaldi, in the center of Mexico City, in the heart of Old Downtown.

1928
02:56:27,366 --> 02:56:33,730
Now, this was the place that Mariachi Plaza in Los Angeles was modeled on, but they're very different.

1929
02:56:34,050 --> 02:56:36,532
Here, it's a very open, big square.

1930
02:56:36,552 --> 02:56:50,580
There's no mariachi bandstand here, but what the two places do have in common are the number of mariachi bands dressed in their black suits and carrying guitars, all waiting for people to come along and pay.

1931
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:52,421
pay them to play a song.

1932
02:56:54,082 --> 02:56:58,524
I went to meet a former Mexican president who's been very vocal about Mr. Trump.

1933
02:56:58,764 --> 02:57:11,331
President Vicente Fox has gone on television and social media frequently mocking Mr. Trump, his comments about making Mexico pay for a wall between the two countries, and his audience has been very receptive.

1934
02:57:12,652 --> 02:57:17,955
Okay, first of all, America is a continent.

1935
02:57:20,501 --> 02:57:22,748
not United States only.

1936
02:57:24,102 --> 02:57:26,764
There is some degree of confusion on that.

1937
02:57:27,385 --> 02:57:32,048
So with this in mind, I move to the concept of making America great.

1938
02:57:32,388 --> 02:57:37,052
I think that is a very selfish, egoista proposal.

1939
02:57:37,712 --> 02:57:46,859
I think the greatest leaders and the greatest mind have compassion and generosity as part of their thinking.

1940
02:57:47,499 --> 02:57:52,463
I think the French president gave the correct answer.

1941
02:57:53,083 --> 02:57:53,623
Macron.

1942
02:57:53,923 --> 02:57:55,724
He said, let's make the world great.

1943
02:57:56,024 --> 02:58:00,786
Trump wasn't the first person to talk about this making America great again, or using the word America.

1944
02:58:01,246 --> 02:58:05,608
Yeah, but that's not the profound discussion.

1945
02:58:05,888 --> 02:58:11,851
I think what it implies, the way Trump is putting it, is absolutely wrong.

1946
02:58:12,191 --> 02:58:14,692
I know the US people

1947
02:58:15,432 --> 02:58:17,573
I know the people of that great nation.

1948
02:58:18,033 --> 02:58:19,554
I am part of that nation.

1949
02:58:19,614 --> 02:58:22,374
My grandfather was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.

1950
02:58:22,735 --> 02:58:31,358
If you're going to fight for United States' presence in the world, it has to be a compassionate presence.

1951
02:58:31,638 --> 02:58:33,698
That's the United States we all know.

1952
02:58:34,038 --> 02:58:44,242
That's the leader that moved in the last decades from being the imperial United States into a compassionate leader of the world.

1953
02:58:49,455 --> 02:58:50,316
Hola, Donald.

1954
02:58:51,116 --> 02:58:56,319
It is me, Vicente, coming to you from Mexico.

1955
02:58:57,039 --> 02:59:07,025
Under no circumstances will we pay for this stupid, useless, racist money.

1956
02:59:07,065 --> 02:59:07,605
Great again?

1957
02:59:07,625 --> 02:59:11,247
America, la tierra de las oportunidades.

1958
02:59:13,427 --> 02:59:20,272
Recent politics in the US has clearly touched a nerve, so much so that Corona ran a campaign addressing the problem.

1959
02:59:28,955 --> 02:59:36,661
It starts off with Mexican actor Diego Luna talking about how angry the war makes Mexicans feel, but the message has a twist.

1960
02:59:38,142 --> 02:59:41,445
Geronimo Avila is the man who created the campaign for the beer brand.

1961
02:59:41,485 --> 02:59:42,786
So tell me, how did the campaign start?

1962
02:59:51,792 --> 02:59:56,758
The campaign slogan is Desfronterizate, that it comes without frontiers.

1963
02:59:56,998 --> 03:00:01,243
So most of the branding campaign was built upon the wall theme.

1964
03:00:01,403 --> 03:00:07,650
At the end of the campaign, we decided to finish with a content that uses this

1965
03:00:08,290 --> 03:00:10,892
campaign slogan of let's make America great again.

1966
03:00:11,052 --> 03:00:15,915
But at the end, we wanted to end of this misconception that America is only the U.S.

1967
03:00:16,576 --> 03:00:17,837
and not the whole continent.

1968
03:00:18,217 --> 03:00:22,000
With that in mind, we made a manifesto of unity.

1969
03:00:22,300 --> 03:00:23,941
It was not a political message.

1970
03:00:24,181 --> 03:00:29,625
It was more like a positive message to the people, more than against Donald Trump.

1971
03:00:29,865 --> 03:00:31,546
It went viral on social media.

1972
03:00:31,786 --> 03:00:34,248
The advert was made in Spanish and English.

1973
03:00:34,688 --> 03:00:39,771
Later I met up with my friend Jeronimo Perez Correa, born in the US but also Mexican.

1974
03:00:40,151 --> 03:00:42,533
I asked him about his identity.

1975
03:00:42,613 --> 03:00:43,933
I have dual citizenship.

1976
03:00:44,374 --> 03:00:49,797
I am the proud father of two children who also have the double nationality.

1977
03:00:50,457 --> 03:00:52,478
They were both born in the US.

1978
03:00:52,598 --> 03:00:56,641
So do you see yourself as American or Mexican?

1979
03:00:57,181 --> 03:01:08,494
I think I mainly see myself as being Mexican, but for certain things I do admit to being a bit of a hypocrite, because it does have many comforts to be American.

1980
03:01:08,674 --> 03:01:14,080
You're talking about being American as in you're from the United States, whereas lots of Mexicans would also consider themselves American.

1981
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:16,662
When I talk about American, that is true.

1982
03:01:16,802 --> 03:01:18,964
I do think of people that come from the U.S.

1983
03:01:19,724 --> 03:01:25,669
And it does upset me, now that you mention it, when I ask somebody that's from the United States, I ask them, you know, where are you from?

1984
03:01:25,749 --> 03:01:27,730
And they say, oh, I'm from America.

1985
03:01:27,991 --> 03:01:34,215
But for some reason, I do feel that when referring to somebody that is from the United States, I call them American.

1986
03:01:34,296 --> 03:01:37,058
Because in Spanish, I don't say Americano, I say Estadounidense.

1987
03:01:37,578 --> 03:01:38,839
So it's like United States-ian?

1988
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:40,299
Yeah, United States-ian.

1989
03:01:40,319 --> 03:01:40,959
It doesn't really work?

1990
03:01:40,979 --> 03:01:41,880
Yeah, it doesn't really work.

1991
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:47,442
I'm able to enjoy the best of both worlds and for me that is a very privileged situation.

1992
03:01:48,522 --> 03:01:52,244
It's a constant battle for Mexicans living and working in the US.

1993
03:01:52,744 --> 03:01:55,405
Jorge Castaneda is Mexico's former foreign minister.

1994
03:01:56,173 --> 03:02:03,857
The Norteamericano thing is complicated because Mexico obviously doesn't know exactly where it is.

1995
03:02:04,878 --> 03:02:18,805
It fits very well in Latin America, but when we in Mexico use the term Norteamerica, we're generally referring to the United States, and when we use the term Norteamericanos, we're certainly referring to Americans.

1996
03:02:20,025 --> 03:02:27,668
At the same time, both geographically and economically, more and more and more so, we are part of North America.

1997
03:02:27,708 --> 03:02:29,709
That's the whole discussion now about Trump.

1998
03:02:30,109 --> 03:02:33,950
You really, you just have people in Mexico hating Trump.

1999
03:02:34,451 --> 03:02:35,451
But that's about it.

2000
03:02:36,091 --> 03:02:38,772
You haven't seen any demonstrations in the streets.

2001
03:02:38,852 --> 03:02:42,634
You haven't seen any huge protests against Trump.

2002
03:02:42,694 --> 03:02:48,416
You haven't had any real pressure on the government to be a bit more firm with him.

2003
03:02:49,216 --> 03:03:04,903
My impression, quite honestly, is that there is just a feeling of humiliation and of resentment against Trump, but I haven't seen a rise of anti-Americanism in Mexico or of greater nationalism in Mexico.

2004
03:03:05,404 --> 03:03:10,126
The whole debate about America, is it a continent or is it a country, points to something else.

2005
03:03:10,466 --> 03:03:12,107
Historian Dr David Sim again.

2006
03:03:12,767 --> 03:03:27,247
When we talk about US exceptions, the idea that the United States is in some way not just different, but fundamentally distinct from other nations, I think that's reflected in the way American history is talked about, not just in American schools, but in American popular culture.

2007
03:03:28,088 --> 03:03:35,954
And therefore it maybe comes as quite a surprise when other individual countries claim to label America and it's kind of jarring.

2008
03:03:36,514 --> 03:03:45,821
But I think it is a product of this kind of nationalist exceptionalist history where the United States of America comes to be not one republic amongst many, but the republic.

2009
03:03:47,089 --> 03:03:53,853
Back on Los Angeles' Venice Beach, Raul looks out over the white sand and palm trees and leaves us on a note of optimism.

2010
03:03:54,133 --> 03:03:58,255
The term America has a new resonance, right?

2011
03:03:58,495 --> 03:04:08,221
I think people can start genuinely start talking about America out of the California experience in a way that, again, redeems that history.

2012
03:04:08,301 --> 03:04:15,765
That's something that the United States population in general, I think people in California have already realized, that's a great asset.

2013
03:04:16,185 --> 03:04:17,206
That's a great story.

2014
03:04:19,627 --> 03:04:22,128
This is America, he says, in the best way.

2015
03:04:22,608 --> 03:04:23,489
And he might be right.

2016
03:04:23,909 --> 03:04:34,615
But for all the talk of America first and walls, for many, the rhetoric has made people focus on the cultural ties, not the divisions, and what American identity is all about.

2017
03:04:35,975 --> 03:04:40,878
Make America Great Again was presented by me, Katie Watson, and produced by Sarah Trino.

2018
03:04:49,905 --> 03:04:53,367
This is the BBC World Service, where science lives.

2019
03:04:53,947 --> 03:04:55,028
For the creative.

2020
03:04:55,248 --> 03:04:59,690
With drones, we can get blood anywhere in the country in 15 to 20 minutes.

2021
03:04:59,970 --> 03:05:00,811
And the curious.

2022
03:05:00,971 --> 03:05:07,974
When we looked at our twins, we found there were certain microbes that were always present in the skinnier twins than in the overweight twins.

2023
03:05:08,215 --> 03:05:10,416
For our remarkable world.

2024
03:05:10,496 --> 03:05:12,937
It's like releasing the valve on a pressure cooker.

2025
03:05:13,077 --> 03:05:17,980
Science on the BBC World Service at bbcworldservice.com.

2026
03:05:21,035 --> 03:05:23,536
And in 30 minutes, ocean stories.

2027
03:05:24,017 --> 03:05:30,880
Tourists love the stunning islands of the Pacific Ocean, but the beauty is fracturing under man's influence.

2028
03:05:31,401 --> 03:05:37,784
I'm Liz Bonnen and I'll bring you ocean stories diving into the biggest and deepest ocean of them all, the Pacific.

2029
03:05:38,245 --> 03:05:44,188
That's in 30 minutes after Hard Talk on the BBC World Service, the world's radio station.

2030
03:05:50,568 --> 03:05:55,533
Coming up after the news on the BBC World Service, it's Hard Talk with me, Stephen Sacker.

2031
03:05:56,033 --> 03:06:00,438
Not so long ago, British food was the laughing stock of the world.

2032
03:06:00,558 --> 03:06:03,200
Stodgy, badly cooked and flavourless.

2033
03:06:03,621 --> 03:06:05,743
And Brits didn't seem to care.

2034
03:06:06,163 --> 03:06:07,365
Well, that's all changed.

2035
03:06:08,025 --> 03:06:13,152
is now a country seemingly obsessed with cooking, baking and fine food.

2036
03:06:13,532 --> 03:06:21,102
Top chefs have become national, even international celebrities, and my guest is one of them, Marcus Waring.

2037
03:06:21,562 --> 03:06:25,287
But are we now too fascinated with fancy food?

2038
03:06:25,847 --> 03:06:40,830
I think that the world has changed and I think a chef cooking in a high street restaurant that's got 20 seats in and he's slaving away in the back of the kitchen with an open kitchen, that is as enjoyable in today's world as eating in a fine dining restaurant.

2039
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:44,471
It's all about what somebody wants from an occasion.

2040
03:06:44,891 --> 03:06:47,932
That's Marcus Waring on Hard Talk after the news.

2041
03:06:50,454 --> 03:06:52,855
Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.

2042
03:06:53,495 --> 03:06:57,958
Initial results in Alabama's election for a new representative in the U.S.

2043
03:06:57,998 --> 03:07:02,480
Senate suggest a tight race between the Republican and Democratic rivals.

2044
03:07:02,940 --> 03:07:10,244
With more than half of the state having declared results, the Republican Roy Moore is slightly ahead of the Democrat contender Doug Jones.

2045
03:07:10,764 --> 03:07:12,885
Gary O'Donohue explains what's at stake.

2046
03:07:13,410 --> 03:07:28,976
not just a seat in the US Senate from the state of Alabama, but also the potential balance of power in the Senate in the longer term, also the question of what to do about those accused of sexual harassment and assault, how will they be treated

2047
03:07:29,336 --> 03:07:30,217
in public life.

2048
03:07:30,577 --> 03:07:32,639
And, of course, the question of Donald Trump.

2049
03:07:32,999 --> 03:07:39,726
Will Alabama elect someone who's like him, an outsider, an insurgent, someone who's not necessarily politically correct?

2050
03:07:40,146 --> 03:07:44,910
Or will they go with a Democrat for the first time in a quarter of a century?

2051
03:07:45,711 --> 03:07:46,111
The U.S.

2052
03:07:46,172 --> 03:07:53,298
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says America is willing to hold direct talks with North Korea without preconditions.

2053
03:07:53,698 --> 03:07:55,240
More now from Barbara Platasher.

2054
03:07:56,610 --> 03:08:02,273
Secretary Tillerson said Washington was ready to talk whenever North Korea was ready, and about anything, even the weather.

2055
03:08:02,814 --> 03:08:04,474
He said it was unrealistic for the U.S.

2056
03:08:04,514 --> 03:08:10,438
to insist on negotiations only about containing Pyongyang's nuclear program because the regime was so invested in it.

2057
03:08:10,878 --> 03:08:14,040
Previously, Mr. Tillerson had not spelled out potential preconditions.

2058
03:08:14,420 --> 03:08:18,541
But his willingness for talks of any kind seemed to be an offer of a new diplomatic opening.

2059
03:08:18,961 --> 03:08:25,683
He said this would only be possible if there was a quiet period without weapons tests, and he remained clear about the goal, that the U.S.

2060
03:08:25,783 --> 03:08:28,624
ultimately could not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.

2061
03:08:29,084 --> 03:08:36,006
Mr. Tillerson also said the administration was in talks with China about securing Pyongyang's nuclear weapons if something happened to destabilize the regime.

2062
03:08:36,537 --> 03:08:44,021
Mr. Tillerson's offer appears to be a change from previous demands that Pyongyang must first agree to give up its nuclear weapons program.

2063
03:08:44,381 --> 03:08:48,904
But a White House statement said President Trump's views on North Korea had not changed.

2064
03:08:50,454 --> 03:08:59,037
United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman says North Korean officials told him they wanted to prevent war on the Korean peninsula.

2065
03:08:59,477 --> 03:09:08,080
He said they made their views known during the first in-depth political exchange of views in eight years between the UN and officials in Pyongyang.

2066
03:09:08,561 --> 03:09:11,942
Our United Nations reporter Neda Torfik has more details.

2067
03:09:12,514 --> 03:09:17,095
Jeffrey Feltman said he'd spent 15 hours discussing how to prevent war.

2068
03:09:17,595 --> 03:09:23,657
He urged North Korean officials to signal if they were prepared to discuss possible peace talks and offered the U.N.'

2069
03:09:23,617 --> 03:09:24,697
's help in that regard.

2070
03:09:25,057 --> 03:09:33,219
He also emphasized the importance of reopening technical channels of communications, such as a military-to-military hotline to reduce risks.

2071
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:38,841
Officials in Pyongyang didn't offer any commitments, but agreed the discussions should continue.

2072
03:09:39,401 --> 03:09:46,374
Mr. Feltman said he'd left with the door to a negotiated solution ajar and fervently hoped the door would now be wide open.

2073
03:09:50,561 --> 03:10:04,035
The United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF has warned that more than 400,000 severely malnourished children under the age of five in the Democratic Republic of Congo could die within months without emergency intervention.

2074
03:10:04,675 --> 03:10:13,624
UNICEF said the crisis unfolding in the region of Kasai was due to a combination of violence, mass displacement of families and slumping agricultural output.

2075
03:10:14,945 --> 03:10:21,831
A baby who was born with her heart outside her body has survived in what's thought to be a first in Britain.

2076
03:10:22,251 --> 03:10:30,958
The baby, Vanellope Wilkins, who is three weeks old, has undergone three operations to place her heart back in her chest, Fergus Walsh explains.

2077
03:10:31,578 --> 03:10:37,022
Vanellope was born with a very rare condition where the heart grows outside the chest.

2078
03:10:37,463 --> 03:10:43,827
In most cases, babies are stillborn and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival.

2079
03:10:44,348 --> 03:10:50,733
But after three operations, surgeons have succeeded in putting her heart back and covering it with skin.

2080
03:10:51,413 --> 03:10:56,679
Phenelope has no breastbone and will need more surgery to create one in years to come.

2081
03:10:57,240 --> 03:11:03,507
Doctors are considering using material from a 3D printer or something organic that would grow with her.

2082
03:11:04,544 --> 03:11:11,387
Scientists say the region around the North Pole shows no sign of returning to its once reliably frozen state.

2083
03:11:11,867 --> 03:11:13,548
The annual assessment by the U.S.

2084
03:11:13,588 --> 03:11:22,452
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the rapidly warming Arctic indicates that its environmental system had reached a new normal.

2085
03:11:22,793 --> 03:11:29,156
The report said the winter sea ice in March was the smallest extent on record and the rate of change was increasing.

2086
03:11:30,276 --> 03:11:38,927
The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has said continued subsidies of fossil fuel amount to humanity investing in its own doom.

2087
03:11:39,347 --> 03:11:47,838
Mr. Guterres told more than 50 heads of state gathered at the One Planet Summit in Paris, we are in a war for the very existence of life on our planet.

2088
03:11:48,478 --> 03:11:49,199
BBC News.

2089
03:11:50,211 --> 03:11:54,452
Welcome to Hard Talk on the BBC World Service with me, Stephen Sacker.

2090
03:11:54,952 --> 03:12:00,074
My guest today belongs in an elite club which didn't exist a generation ago.

2091
03:12:00,294 --> 03:12:13,477
He is a celebrity chef with a portfolio of television work, books, a media profile, oh, and a string of restaurants, including one bearing his name that has two Michelin stars.

2092
03:12:14,117 --> 03:12:20,327
Marcus Waring began life bagging up potatoes for his father, who was a fruit and veg trader.

2093
03:12:20,747 --> 03:12:24,934
Now he cooks for an exclusive clientele, including the Queen.

2094
03:12:25,334 --> 03:12:28,940
His story reflects a fundamental change in British culture.

2095
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:32,863
Fifty years ago, the country's cuisine was a laughingstock.

2096
03:12:33,263 --> 03:12:35,265
Stodgy, bland and flavourless.

2097
03:12:35,785 --> 03:12:40,289
Now, Brits watch endless cooking and baking shows on TV.

2098
03:12:40,669 --> 03:12:45,713
Chefs are lionised and the country seems fascinated by fancy food.

2099
03:12:46,173 --> 03:12:47,154
But is that healthy?

2100
03:12:47,635 --> 03:12:52,218
Or are there still some dodgy things going on in the British kitchen?

2101
03:12:52,679 --> 03:12:55,000
Well, Marcus Waring joins me now.

2102
03:12:55,221 --> 03:12:56,562
Welcome to Hard Talk.

2103
03:12:57,350 --> 03:13:06,035
There are an awful lot of chefs in the world, only a very few elite top chefs.

2104
03:13:06,155 --> 03:13:09,317
What distinguishes the very best from the rest?

2105
03:13:09,717 --> 03:13:11,558
I think, first of all, it's a mindset.

2106
03:13:12,218 --> 03:13:13,179
It's a work ethic.

2107
03:13:13,499 --> 03:13:23,825
And I think there is a type of sacrifice that a top chef has and wants to sort of drive themselves as an individual to excel.

2108
03:13:24,565 --> 03:13:25,945
head and shoulders above everybody else.

2109
03:13:26,526 --> 03:13:33,008
A lot of advice that I've ever had through the years coming through the ranks was, and it came from my father originally, was to stand out from the crowd.

2110
03:13:34,028 --> 03:13:35,669
And to do that, you need to do something different.

2111
03:13:35,689 --> 03:13:42,551
Most of the great chefs around the world started as apprentices to other truly great chefs.

2112
03:13:42,591 --> 03:13:45,852
And if we look at your CV, you work with Albert Roux.

2113
03:13:46,372 --> 03:13:49,153
You've obviously famously worked a lot with Gordon Ramsay.

2114
03:13:49,273 --> 03:13:52,074
They're both, in their different ways, great chefs.

2115
03:13:52,514 --> 03:13:55,876
So did you acquire skills and knowledge directly from them?

2116
03:13:56,556 --> 03:13:57,176
Oh, without a doubt.

2117
03:13:57,436 --> 03:14:01,978
Your travels, your working in kitchens is the foundation of who you are as a chef.

2118
03:14:02,458 --> 03:14:09,381
The most important thing about being a good chef, or trying to be a good chef, or someone who's going to be a little bit different, is working with some of the best chefs.

2119
03:14:09,901 --> 03:14:18,385
And when you work through all the different kitchens, you're inspired, you're energized, but you're also gathering knowledge, education, and discipline.

2120
03:14:18,845 --> 03:14:23,489
They're leaders of examples, and they're leaders of their industry, and they have something to offer.

2121
03:14:23,649 --> 03:14:25,411
They may not tell or talk to you every day.

2122
03:14:25,431 --> 03:14:34,358
They may not tell you an idea or recipe, but you have to go into their kitchens and feed off their energy, like a big battery that you're just sucking everything out of it.

2123
03:14:34,678 --> 03:14:36,279
You store it while you're training.

2124
03:14:36,620 --> 03:14:37,861
You go and train more.

2125
03:14:38,121 --> 03:14:39,042
You put it on the shelf.

2126
03:14:39,202 --> 03:14:40,403
You go and train in another kitchen.

2127
03:14:40,423 --> 03:14:41,744
You put all that information on the shelf.

2128
03:14:41,764 --> 03:14:46,508
And then when you become a head chef, you bring it all down, and you use all that experience.

2129
03:14:46,868 --> 03:14:54,275
I've got, as it happens, your menus from last night here at Marcus, your flagship two Michelin star restaurant.

2130
03:14:54,535 --> 03:14:58,398
And therefore, I'm looking at this, I mean, it all looks delicious.

2131
03:14:59,019 --> 03:15:12,131
I notice a very big emphasis on British produce, you know, from starters of wood pigeon and Portland crab and glazed ox tongue with Dorset snails through to your mains.

2132
03:15:13,131 --> 03:15:20,095
Herdwick lamb, one, Cumbrian rose veal neck, another, grouse, all of this very, sounds delicious, but very British.

2133
03:15:20,255 --> 03:15:20,456
Yes.

2134
03:15:20,536 --> 03:15:24,598
So what, you know, this who am I question, what are your menus saying about who you are?

2135
03:15:24,938 --> 03:15:32,903
So the way I look at my restaurants, and because the way in which industry has changed, and farming, and the way in which we receive our produce, I look at

2136
03:15:33,223 --> 03:15:37,346
the UK, the United Kingdom, as my local community of food.

2137
03:15:37,606 --> 03:15:41,769
Because I could put an order in this morning in Scotland and get it tomorrow morning.

2138
03:15:42,130 --> 03:15:44,251
Things move very quickly now around the country.

2139
03:15:44,551 --> 03:15:46,072
So local, United Kingdom.

2140
03:15:46,313 --> 03:15:53,378
Then I spread further afield into Europe for other different types of produce that are better, or farmed better, or just taste better.

2141
03:15:53,658 --> 03:15:55,840
And we're always searching for something really nice.

2142
03:15:55,860 --> 03:16:00,523
But I don't like to go too far across the world to gather food produce.

2143
03:16:00,623 --> 03:16:02,604
this idea of food miles matters to you?

2144
03:16:02,764 --> 03:16:03,265
Very much so.

2145
03:16:03,345 --> 03:16:09,589
I think now in the world we need to be very careful that we're not purchasing too much from all over the world.

2146
03:16:09,649 --> 03:16:12,471
I don't, you know, have Japanese flavors through my menu.

2147
03:16:12,551 --> 03:16:14,172
I don't have curries going through the menu.

2148
03:16:14,432 --> 03:16:20,136
There's certain things that I don't need to put in to this menu because it's not really a reflection of me as a person.

2149
03:16:20,476 --> 03:16:25,560
I've never trained in lots of different cuisines but I will never experiment them on my menu.

2150
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:28,642
So the reflection of the menu and the ingredients that you've talked about

2151
03:16:29,162 --> 03:16:35,088
are about a local lad from the northwest of England using the produce of this fabulous country, this island that we live on.

2152
03:16:35,369 --> 03:16:35,709
I love it.

2153
03:16:35,729 --> 03:16:41,074
The phrase, a local lad from Southport, wasn't it, in the northwest of England with a dad who was a market trader.

2154
03:16:41,214 --> 03:16:42,215
It's a great story.

2155
03:16:43,216 --> 03:16:43,577
Does it

2156
03:16:44,137 --> 03:16:53,921
sit uneasily with you in any way, that here we are in the very poshest, most expensive part of London, and all this fabulous food you're serving, it comes at a price.

2157
03:16:54,482 --> 03:16:56,102
Your tasting menu is £120 or roughly $140.

2158
03:16:56,142 --> 03:16:57,443
Your a la carte, I imagine, a main would be £60, £70.

2159
03:16:57,523 --> 03:16:59,184
Just a bit less than that.

2160
03:17:04,546 --> 03:17:06,507
But these are big numbers.

2161
03:17:06,928 --> 03:17:08,769
This is out of the reach of most people.

2162
03:17:08,929 --> 03:17:11,470
For a local lad from Southport, does that bother you?

2163
03:17:12,491 --> 03:17:17,054
No, it doesn't bother me because I think it's not about all men being equal.

2164
03:17:17,474 --> 03:17:18,595
It's about a matter of choice.

2165
03:17:19,315 --> 03:17:21,256
And I think what we do offer is choice.

2166
03:17:21,476 --> 03:17:27,697
There are tasty menus, there are a la carte menus, but there are also very good, reasonable lunch menus.

2167
03:17:28,137 --> 03:17:29,677
The wine is if you're choosing.

2168
03:17:29,938 --> 03:17:36,739
You can come to this restaurant and spend the same amount of money on a glass of wine than you would in a good bar or a good pub.

2169
03:17:37,219 --> 03:17:38,339
It's all a point of choice.

2170
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:44,381
So with the thousands of bottles that we have on our menu, when you come here, there is something for everybody.

2171
03:17:44,941 --> 03:17:48,542
So I don't look at it as this is a rich man's room or we're in Knightsbridge.

2172
03:17:49,542 --> 03:17:50,863
Anybody can come to my restaurant.

2173
03:17:51,083 --> 03:17:54,885
You can have some tap water, you can have a glass of house wine, and you can have a lunch menu.

2174
03:17:55,185 --> 03:17:58,987
And for two people, you could be out the door less than 100 pound, if that's how you wish.

2175
03:17:59,647 --> 03:18:03,809
But it's your choice to come and spend the value that you want to spend.

2176
03:18:04,249 --> 03:18:12,473
Isn't it nice, even from a northern lad, to maybe come with your girlfriend or your wife and dress up and come to Knightsbridge, come to London, do something different?

2177
03:18:12,813 --> 03:18:14,374
We're not on everyone's doorstep.

2178
03:18:14,394 --> 03:18:16,135
We just happen to be in the heart of London.

2179
03:18:16,595 --> 03:18:17,335
I sort of love it.

2180
03:18:18,276 --> 03:18:20,777
I'm proud to have worked my way from there.

2181
03:18:21,418 --> 03:18:23,479
It didn't arrive on a silver tray.

2182
03:18:24,059 --> 03:18:25,240
It was a lot of hard work.

2183
03:18:25,480 --> 03:18:26,900
And what about food snobbery?

2184
03:18:27,121 --> 03:18:28,761
I mean, you have two Michelin stars.

2185
03:18:28,781 --> 03:18:30,542
Not many chefs around the world do.

2186
03:18:32,043 --> 03:18:41,293
But there is something about this whole sort of fetishization of the Michelin star which sticks in some people's throats.

2187
03:18:41,373 --> 03:18:49,982
Do you sometimes feel that it's the wrong way to really judge the quality of food and restaurants?

2188
03:18:50,632 --> 03:18:51,132
No, I don't.

2189
03:18:51,673 --> 03:18:54,494
I think Michon are very, very important and very present.

2190
03:18:55,255 --> 03:19:00,858
I think their history determines how good they really are.

2191
03:19:01,498 --> 03:19:07,662
They are judging chefs as a guide and they're giving you a point of recognition and they're giving you an accolade.

2192
03:19:07,822 --> 03:19:09,003
It's not something you ask for.

2193
03:19:09,543 --> 03:19:13,385
it is given to you as almost a gift of your standards of what you do.

2194
03:19:13,445 --> 03:19:14,965
Yeah, but it puts you under enormous pressure.

2195
03:19:14,985 --> 03:19:25,089
I mean, some chefs have started saying to Michelin, even if they've had in the past one or two stars, they're now saying, I don't want to be part of your network.

2196
03:19:25,129 --> 03:19:26,630
I don't want to be judged by you anymore.

2197
03:19:26,670 --> 03:19:29,211
The pressure is too constant.

2198
03:19:29,331 --> 03:19:30,131
It's too immense.

2199
03:19:30,431 --> 03:19:35,353
The things you require of us in terms of the level of service, the presentation are just

2200
03:19:35,673 --> 03:19:38,796
actually making us a restaurant we don't want to be.

2201
03:19:39,217 --> 03:19:43,741
I completely disagree because I don't think it's the Michelin that are putting that pressure upon the chef.

2202
03:19:44,201 --> 03:19:47,685
It's the general public and the expectation of the general public.

2203
03:19:48,305 --> 03:19:52,029
In the last 10 years, social media has become a big part.

2204
03:19:52,530 --> 03:19:57,555
Everybody in your restaurants now can post their thoughts of the dinner, of the experience that they're eating.

2205
03:19:58,195 --> 03:19:59,917
So I think it's more than just me.

2206
03:20:00,017 --> 03:20:01,758
Every person at your table is now a reviewer.

2207
03:20:01,898 --> 03:20:02,238
Exactly.

2208
03:20:02,579 --> 03:20:03,840
They can post something on the internet.

2209
03:20:03,860 --> 03:20:04,901
Does that scare the hell out of you?

2210
03:20:05,021 --> 03:20:05,281
Oh, no.

2211
03:20:06,202 --> 03:20:06,342
No.

2212
03:20:06,602 --> 03:20:07,363
It's a challenge.

2213
03:20:07,803 --> 03:20:08,764
It sets standards.

2214
03:20:09,184 --> 03:20:11,966
It even tells me what my restaurant's doing when I'm not here.

2215
03:20:12,367 --> 03:20:14,508
You've got to embrace technology.

2216
03:20:14,548 --> 03:20:15,429
You have to embrace it.

2217
03:20:15,749 --> 03:20:18,632
Even if I don't like it and do it as well as the next chef.

2218
03:20:19,432 --> 03:20:23,155
I do have a team of people around me that can advise me and show me how to move forward.

2219
03:20:23,956 --> 03:20:31,301
But if I look down on that process and I look down and say Michelin delivers pressure, then I'd be a nervous wreck.

2220
03:20:31,401 --> 03:20:37,106
And you must always turn that pressure into positive thinking and positive energy and enjoy your job.

2221
03:20:37,626 --> 03:20:42,449
go back to your roots, think about those ingredients, stop worrying about what everyone's saying about you.

2222
03:20:42,669 --> 03:20:43,450
The late A.A.

2223
03:20:43,510 --> 03:20:55,197
Gill, I don't know if you knew him, but he was one of Britain's sort of best-known restaurant reviewers, and he rebelled against the Michelin spirit, the sort of smart, formal dining that it seemed to encourage.

2224
03:20:55,217 --> 03:21:00,480
He said this, he said, the guide appears to be wholly out of touch with the way that people now actually eat.

2225
03:21:01,220 --> 03:21:05,882
It's still rewarding, fat, conservative, fussy rooms.

2226
03:21:06,402 --> 03:21:17,125
Maybe he meant rooms like this, that use expensive ingredients with ingratiating pomp to serve glossy plutocrats.

2227
03:21:17,885 --> 03:21:18,966
Is that Marcus?

2228
03:21:19,386 --> 03:21:19,506
No.

2229
03:21:20,786 --> 03:21:21,926
Absolutely not.

2230
03:21:22,226 --> 03:21:24,367
And I don't think fine dining is that.

2231
03:21:24,887 --> 03:21:34,989
I think there are a lot of our food writers and our critics, maybe, that don't see the fun or the luxury or the enjoyment in fine dining because it is a homage to the chef.

2232
03:21:35,229 --> 03:21:37,210
And I think that the world has changed.

2233
03:21:37,270 --> 03:21:48,873
And I think a chef cooking in a high street restaurant that's got 20 seats in and he's slaving away in the back of the kitchen with an open kitchen, that is as enjoyable in today's world as eating in a fine dining restaurant.

2234
03:21:49,013 --> 03:21:49,893
It's all about what

2235
03:21:50,853 --> 03:21:52,494
somebody wants from an occasion.

2236
03:21:53,154 --> 03:21:56,776
And if I'm going to set up restaurants in this hotel, it's a five-star hotel.

2237
03:21:56,876 --> 03:21:58,076
It is known all over the world.

2238
03:21:58,096 --> 03:22:01,618
There's a level of luxury that I have to provide and I want to provide.

2239
03:22:01,858 --> 03:22:08,460
It strikes me that as you've become more successful, like so many, many top chefs, you've developed the brand.

2240
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:10,261
You've become a TV personality.

2241
03:22:10,281 --> 03:22:14,343
You're on the British MasterChef show, which has made you enormously popular in this country.

2242
03:22:14,643 --> 03:22:17,324
You also have opened other restaurants in central London.

2243
03:22:17,404 --> 03:22:19,145
So now you've got a stable of three.

2244
03:22:19,785 --> 03:22:30,468
It all means that you are not every single lunchtime and dinner actually in the kitchen here at your number one restaurant doing it yourself.

2245
03:22:31,008 --> 03:22:41,912
Now it strikes me that when people come here and they, as we've discussed, do pay a substantial amount of money for food from the Marcus restaurant, they expect Marcus Waring to be slaving away in the kitchen.

2246
03:22:42,052 --> 03:22:42,912
I think life has changed.

2247
03:22:43,632 --> 03:22:49,559
And up until four years ago, when I revamped this restaurant, I was in this kitchen every single day.

2248
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:52,882
I never looked for television.

2249
03:22:53,183 --> 03:22:54,224
It came and found me.

2250
03:22:54,644 --> 03:22:56,987
I never, ever woke up and wanted to write a cookery book.

2251
03:22:57,427 --> 03:23:01,111
And I never, ever wanted or needed to open two other restaurants on top of this.

2252
03:23:01,131 --> 03:23:02,553
I was very satisfied with what I had.

2253
03:23:02,573 --> 03:23:03,314
So why did you do it?

2254
03:23:03,594 --> 03:23:04,675
Why did you stretch yourself?

2255
03:23:04,755 --> 03:23:10,617
Because I found that I had some very talented people underneath me that I had to find opportunities for.

2256
03:23:10,897 --> 03:23:20,220
And what I see is, having those other restaurants and coming out of the restaurant, I've created opportunities for very talented people to become bosses within their own right, within my stable.

2257
03:23:20,260 --> 03:23:22,361
But what if you stretch yourself too thin?

2258
03:23:22,721 --> 03:23:28,063
What if the standards at this restaurant, to be honest, are not quite as good when you're not here?

2259
03:23:28,243 --> 03:23:28,643
I come back.

2260
03:23:29,483 --> 03:23:34,867
I say goodbye to television, I say goodbye to books, and I do the job that I'm paid to do, which is cook.

2261
03:23:35,327 --> 03:23:38,309
The rest is just purely a luxury item that is added onto my life.

2262
03:23:38,750 --> 03:23:40,091
Interesting you talk about the team.

2263
03:23:40,291 --> 03:23:56,082
There has been a lot of discussion recently about the workplace temperature in top kitchens, and there is a lot of discussion about, and there's no other word for it, bullying and abuse that happens in kitchens and is often driven

2264
03:23:57,423 --> 03:24:03,649
by the character of the number one chef, which in this case, of course, would be you.

2265
03:24:03,709 --> 03:24:05,931
Have you bullied your staff in the past?

2266
03:24:06,111 --> 03:24:09,574
I think bullying is a word that is dressed up in many different ways.

2267
03:24:10,115 --> 03:24:12,977
I was born in the 70s and bullying was something that was done in a playground.

2268
03:24:13,178 --> 03:24:15,780
It was a fight, it was a push, it was verbal.

2269
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:18,082
I don't think that happens in kitchens.

2270
03:24:18,302 --> 03:24:20,765
I've never experienced it myself in kitchens.

2271
03:24:21,285 --> 03:24:33,757
raise my voice, raise my voice, swear, shout and drive people very very hard through hard service, yes I've had it done to me and I have done it to my staff in the past.

2272
03:24:33,817 --> 03:24:44,507
There have been serious incidents in kitchens, I'm just looking at an incident in France where a station chef deliberately and repeatedly scolded his kitchen assistant

2273
03:24:44,987 --> 03:25:01,995
There were other incidents that came into light after that, with sous-chefs and assistants recounting tales of abuse ranging, and I'm quoting here from a slap, sounds absurd, but it's not, a slap in the face with a wet fish, being stabbed in the calves with a kitchen knife, all sorts of different burning incidents.

2274
03:25:02,555 --> 03:25:11,219
One ex-kitchen assistant told a report into this in France, because they took it very seriously, he said, quote, these torturers must be told that they are destroying lives.

2275
03:25:11,679 --> 03:25:13,540
What the heck is going on in some of these kitchens?

2276
03:25:13,660 --> 03:25:22,005
I think these are very few instances that are overshadowing a fabulous industry that's bigger than a handful of incidents or many, many more.

2277
03:25:22,365 --> 03:25:28,369
There are millions of people working in our industry and there are thousands and thousands of kitchens just running through London alone.

2278
03:25:28,869 --> 03:25:30,670
I think the kitchens are pressure cookers.

2279
03:25:31,370 --> 03:25:35,973
What has changed, and this is something we really must focus on, is that the kitchens have become very much open places now.

2280
03:25:36,413 --> 03:25:39,635
and the chef is very much part of the front of service as well as the back.

2281
03:25:39,735 --> 03:25:40,976
Chefs are now delivering food.

2282
03:25:41,297 --> 03:25:53,805
So I believe that the way in which we've changed... You actually come out here of an evening and... We can come out, any of my chefs can come out here and speak to customers, but what's changed is we the chef have now neutralised error in kitchen.

2283
03:25:54,225 --> 03:25:55,967
The pressure cooker of a kitchen was driven by

2284
03:25:56,867 --> 03:26:12,694
Hard cookery on top of a hot stove and inside the oven it was all cooked last minute So the science of food has allowed us to change the way in which we cook So we're actually taking sometimes the training out of our young chefs to actually make the job easier Because there's so much choice

2285
03:26:13,314 --> 03:26:16,698
and there's so few people wanting to necessarily work in our industry.

2286
03:26:16,738 --> 03:26:18,480
Maybe that's because you don't pay them enough as well.

2287
03:26:18,540 --> 03:26:18,900
That's wrong.

2288
03:26:19,220 --> 03:26:20,161
We do pay them very well.

2289
03:26:20,181 --> 03:26:22,644
We pay our staff minimum and above the minimum wage.

2290
03:26:22,824 --> 03:26:27,709
But that seems a bit, you know, minimum wage is a bit of a low bar you're setting yourself.

2291
03:26:27,789 --> 03:26:33,355
Minimum wage though is a point of if you work an eight-hour day you're going to find it tough to survive.

2292
03:26:33,875 --> 03:26:43,423
You know, some of my chefs in the kitchen do much, much longer days and can earn anything up to £25,000, £30,000 and be a commie chef, which is practically just above about being a trainee chef.

2293
03:26:43,863 --> 03:26:49,708
Yes, they'll put in a few... But the average wage in the UK is £27,000.

2294
03:26:50,288 --> 03:26:56,093
You're saying if they work ridiculously long hours, your guys might just get to that sort of threshold.

2295
03:26:56,833 --> 03:26:59,535
And yet you're one of the most luxurious restaurants in all of London.

2296
03:26:59,916 --> 03:27:02,618
But then we are also delivering a standard.

2297
03:27:02,938 --> 03:27:05,280
This is a school of education as well as a job.

2298
03:27:05,620 --> 03:27:10,964
And I think the difference, and we must identify this, is that you do not come into fine dining just for a job.

2299
03:27:11,304 --> 03:27:12,746
You have to want to be here.

2300
03:27:12,986 --> 03:27:14,267
The key thing here is choice.

2301
03:27:14,967 --> 03:27:17,869
And everybody that wakes up in the morning in this part of the Western world

2302
03:27:18,730 --> 03:27:19,911
can have a choice in life.

2303
03:27:19,951 --> 03:27:22,552
You can either get out of bed and go and look for a job.

2304
03:27:23,072 --> 03:27:27,694
You can work as many hours as you like and you can pretty much never ever be out of work.

2305
03:27:28,414 --> 03:27:33,756
But don't work in fine, fine dining at the top end if you want an easy life because it doesn't exist.

2306
03:27:34,276 --> 03:27:40,719
Brits, British people, spend three billion pounds a year on ready meals.

2307
03:27:41,139 --> 03:27:43,600
Now that's six times more than in Spain.

2308
03:27:45,100 --> 03:27:51,842
We still, whatever we do, when we switch the telly on and watch you cooking up fine food, we then go to the shop and buy a ready meal.

2309
03:27:52,142 --> 03:27:54,342
We're buying ready meals for one reason and one reason only.

2310
03:27:54,503 --> 03:28:02,444
They're there sitting on the shelves already available, there's more of them, and people are working harder and have less time and maybe don't want to cook when they get home.

2311
03:28:03,125 --> 03:28:05,405
School's finished later, the school runs different.

2312
03:28:05,805 --> 03:28:12,387
Everybody's lifestyle is changing, social media is changing everything, but if you want to look at food, go to supermarkets,

2313
03:28:12,707 --> 03:28:14,188
There's your problem of obesity.

2314
03:28:14,228 --> 03:28:15,629
There's your problem of convenience.

2315
03:28:15,869 --> 03:28:24,936
It's interesting to me that you talk about the obesity problem and you say that you believe you're part of a culture which is beginning to respect and understand food much better.

2316
03:28:25,497 --> 03:28:33,283
But you actually opposed your fellow top chef Jamie Oliver when he campaigned so long and hard

2317
03:28:33,843 --> 03:28:45,128
For a sugar tax to be put on, for example, the sugary drinks, the pop that so many kids still consume, you seem to think that was a very bad idea.

2318
03:28:45,228 --> 03:28:45,568
Why?

2319
03:28:45,848 --> 03:28:47,669
I don't think it was a bad idea.

2320
03:28:47,949 --> 03:28:49,870
My concern is what happens to that tax.

2321
03:28:50,510 --> 03:28:56,833
I think what Jamie Oliver has done over the years has really opened a lot of people up to how we cook at home.

2322
03:28:57,374 --> 03:28:59,475
And he's made people aware of lots of different things.

2323
03:28:59,515 --> 03:29:01,816
He's the one that put all the petitions together.

2324
03:29:01,856 --> 03:29:06,999
He's the guy that went to Downing Street and made a campaign for better quality school lunches for kids.

2325
03:29:07,059 --> 03:29:11,541
You can't just stop at the door of Downing Street, get the tax on there and then maybe just stop.

2326
03:29:11,661 --> 03:29:13,302
But his point about the tax isn't so much

2327
03:29:14,042 --> 03:29:22,889
What we do with the tax money is to send a price signal to people that they shouldn't be buying all these very sweetened fizzy drinks.

2328
03:29:22,969 --> 03:29:26,091
And if the price goes up a little bit, hopefully... They'll still buy them.

2329
03:29:26,111 --> 03:29:26,851
Do you think they will?

2330
03:29:26,911 --> 03:29:27,071
Yes.

2331
03:29:27,572 --> 03:29:29,453
Alcohol will go up in a bubble.

2332
03:29:29,473 --> 03:29:37,559
But you see, if I may say so, you seem to have a view that government and the authorities have no role to play in changing people's habits.

2333
03:29:37,599 --> 03:29:39,040
You said this not so long ago, you said

2334
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:41,883
It's not the responsibility of government, but of parents.

2335
03:29:41,923 --> 03:29:43,004
We're all human beings.

2336
03:29:43,024 --> 03:29:44,126
We can all read and write.

2337
03:29:44,166 --> 03:29:45,567
Let's not blame the government.

2338
03:29:45,588 --> 03:29:48,631
There are only two people to blame for the obesity crisis.

2339
03:29:49,172 --> 03:29:50,053
Mum and Dad.

2340
03:29:50,253 --> 03:29:51,615
Yeah, but doesn't it start at home?

2341
03:29:51,935 --> 03:29:54,939
Why should the government be responsible for what people purchase in a shop?

2342
03:29:55,319 --> 03:29:57,422
Why should we hold the government responsible?

2343
03:29:58,222 --> 03:29:59,243
for our choices.

2344
03:29:59,683 --> 03:30:05,488
They're not our teachers, they're not our guardians, they do a completely different role and a hard role at that.

2345
03:30:05,548 --> 03:30:12,793
And quite honestly, I think they've got more important things to worry about with the economy and with Brexit and what they're going to do with our taxes.

2346
03:30:13,153 --> 03:30:16,134
than worry about what we are consuming at home.

2347
03:30:16,734 --> 03:30:19,435
Is Brexit worrying you as a restaurateur?

2348
03:30:19,475 --> 03:30:21,216
Is it going to change your business?

2349
03:30:21,716 --> 03:30:23,377
Yes, on many ways.

2350
03:30:23,617 --> 03:30:25,117
I voted to remain.

2351
03:30:25,518 --> 03:30:29,019
I've learned more about Brexit since we voted to leave Europe.

2352
03:30:29,419 --> 03:30:30,719
I wish it had been the other way around.

2353
03:30:30,900 --> 03:30:33,921
But I'm really excited about the choice of leaving.

2354
03:30:34,321 --> 03:30:37,542
I was shocked the morning I woke up and I heard the result.

2355
03:30:37,782 --> 03:30:41,584
After 24 hours of thinking about it, it was a, do you know what, we've just got to get on with this now.

2356
03:30:41,944 --> 03:30:43,725
The Congress has made a decision, let's do it.

2357
03:30:43,765 --> 03:30:47,868
So what is the positive we can drive from leaving Europe?

2358
03:30:48,168 --> 03:30:51,169
And that is that we have to potentially build our own future.

2359
03:30:51,650 --> 03:30:56,112
Why I voted to remain was purely from the employment point of view.

2360
03:30:56,192 --> 03:31:00,794
Well I was going to say there are restaurateurs already going public saying that they are losing staff.

2361
03:31:01,134 --> 03:31:10,897
There are people saying the double whammy of losing key staff who are heading for home or not applying for jobs that have become vacant from Europe.

2362
03:31:10,937 --> 03:31:17,639
The pool of talented European staff who are available to British restaurants is diminishing.

2363
03:31:17,979 --> 03:31:23,341
But also the pound is much weaker and that's affecting you as you import some of your foodstuff.

2364
03:31:23,421 --> 03:31:26,082
So it's a double whammy and some restaurateurs are saying they may have to

2365
03:31:26,182 --> 03:31:26,542
close?

2366
03:31:26,843 --> 03:31:54,973
From a point of view of what we purchased, unfortunately the customers are going to probably get a hit on that because you have to pay your bills, you have to pay your wages, but there's a really interesting twist to not having more of the European community coming to the UK to work and that is that we the Brits have got to get out of bed and work maybe a little bit harder and I think it's going to make us better employers and I think we need to change our approach a little bit more because what quality we have we're going to have to really take good care of it and secondly
