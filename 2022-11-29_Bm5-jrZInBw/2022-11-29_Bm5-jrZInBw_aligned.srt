1
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:43,168
Great.

2
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:21,833
Hmm.

3
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:32,115
Recording in progress.

4
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:39,898
Welcome, everybody.

5
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,378
We'll get started in a minute.

6
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:44,720
We're just, as usual, letting people get all logged in.

7
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,182
Participants won't be able to unmute themselves until we go to breakout rooms, and then you'll be able to unmute yourself.

8
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:01,926
All right.

9
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,227
We're still letting people in.

10
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,149
I think we should probably get started.

11
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:09,412
I don't want to keep people waiting while their people are late.

12
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,040
Welcome, everybody.

13
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,581
Thank you for joining us.

14
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,824
Jeremy, are you ready?

15
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:27,746
You're going to do the slides?

16
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,007
Okay.

17
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,801
So welcome, we appreciate everybody for coming this evening.

18
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:39,944
Are you gonna... Do you have slides or should I talk first?

19
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:42,926
Oh, yeah, there's some slides.

20
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:50,609
Alicia, I thought we'd just cover some housekeeping bits before we get into the meaty stuff.

21
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,271
Yes, are there slides for the housekeeping?

22
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:54,891
I thought there were.

23
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,632
Oh yeah, are you not seeing them?

24
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,767
No, we are not seeing slides.

25
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,108
You're not seeing my slides.

26
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:00,808
Oh, okay.

27
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:07,172
Well, let me reshare my screen because, um, I thought that they, my screen was already being shared.

28
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:07,813
Sorry about that.

29
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:08,293
Everybody.

30
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:09,314
Great.

31
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:10,575
I'm glad I said something.

32
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:11,415
Me too.

33
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:18,460
Um, as Jeremy's resharing, um, my name is Alicia Hunt.

34
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,642
I'm the director of planning development and sustainability.

35
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:26,845
And along with Tim McGivern, who is here this evening, who was our DPW commissioner,

36
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:32,295
We are co-chairing this effort around our waste streams in Medford.

37
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:42,038
And we have, Jeremy, we are seeing the presenter's view because I can see the timer, the audience tools and speaker notes.

38
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,260
Let me fix that.

39
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,502
Yes, you're sharing your whole desktop and not just the one window.

40
00:06:53,947 --> 00:07:18,516
We have with us this evening Madeline Levin, who is a graduate student in planning from Harvard, who has been assisting us on our waste efforts, as well as Jeremy Drake and Gary Lease, who are consultants who are helping us with the waste assessment and request for proposals for a new waste contract.

41
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,757
We also have several members of the

42
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:26,546
Sustainable Waste Committee with us this evening as well.

43
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,907
Thank you guys for coming.

44
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:38,756
So we are holding this meeting to sort of to share some of the information that we've heard and to provide feedback, some housekeeping things for you.

45
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:41,919
We're actually going to mute everybody now.

46
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,660
Everybody can't unmute themselves.

47
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,021
You can type in the chat.

48
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,465
You can add questions and comments there.

49
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:54,646
We will be doing breakout sessions after each topic to really hear from people.

50
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,490
And when we do that, everybody will automatically be able to unmute themselves.

51
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,634
And we really encourage you to speak up and share your thoughts with us.

52
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:08,798
We are recording this, and this is being streamed live to YouTube this evening.

53
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:14,663
There are too many things going on, so it's not live on Medford's cable, but it will be rebroadcast there.

54
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,192
And there are also little indicators.

55
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,053
You can use reactions at the bottom.

56
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:27,156
It's not showing on this video to raise your hand if you want.

57
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:31,378
There's also a live transcript if you want closed captions.

58
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,699
There's a CC at the bottom of your screen.

59
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
You can click on that.

60
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,541
I think it says live transcript.

61
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:43,884
If you don't see it, you probably see three dots at the bottom of your screen.

62
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:49,549
You can click on that for more, and then you'll be able to see the captions as well.

63
00:08:53,672 --> 00:09:01,297
So, you know, Jeremy, we didn't discuss at what point I was turning this over to you, but I think up until the poll, right, I'm doing this part.

64
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,180
So, welcome this evening.

65
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,254
We are looking at our waste services here in Medford.

66
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:16,338
We've been hearing for a long time that people are dissatisfied with them, but also our waste contract is ending and we need a new contract.

67
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:20,440
And so as part of that, we said, well, we don't wanna just keep doing the same old.

68
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,201
The world of trash has changed.

69
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:25,743
The world of recycling has changed and Medford has changed.

70
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:33,626
And we need to evaluate what we want to have going forward and not just roll out a new contract for what we've had forever.

71
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:38,761
residents should know that it costs a lot of money to get rid of trash.

72
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,145
It also gets a lot of cost money to get rid of recycling too.

73
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:46,409
It's harmful, there are environmental difficulties with it.

74
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,451
We put a lot of things in the trash that aren't trash.

75
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:55,117
Recently, the state has just implemented a ban on putting fabric

76
00:09:55,792 --> 00:10:04,595
For example, in the trash that can be recycled, a lot of things that we currently throw away, and actually all our food scraps can be composted.

77
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:05,875
They don't have to be trash.

78
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:10,577
So anyhow, this is, we're gonna make some changes now.

79
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:20,180
So as I did mention, we've been hearing from residents, we've heard from businesses, and not just since we started this effort.

80
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,301
Residents have been telling me for the last eight years

81
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:27,066
that every other week recycling isn't enough, they have too much recycling.

82
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:32,308
They've been telling me for years that they want the city to roll out a composting program, right?

83
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:33,388
This is not new.

84
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,370
The regulations in Massachusetts have been changing around garbage disposal.

85
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:48,653
And as residents know, we have an issue with, not just Medford has an issue with rodents, this whole region has an issue with rodents, but we need to do what we can do about it.

86
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:55,644
So I wanna really thank the members of the task force who've been putting a lot of time into this.

87
00:10:56,164 --> 00:11:03,728
Many of these people are here this evening, but I will read out their names and my great thanks for being here and being on this committee.

88
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:16,033
Angelica Ortiz, Dina Smith, Jacqueline Torres, Jim Schuman, John Doherty, Kit Collins, Lois Grossman, and Yvette Wilkes.

89
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:19,494
So this evening,

90
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,090
We're going to have an attendee poll.

91
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:27,794
We're gonna have a presentation about where things currently stand.

92
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:33,177
We'll talk about, then we're gonna actually talk about basic services.

93
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:37,340
Jeremy will present about some things around it, and then we'll have discussion.

94
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,645
We'll present a bit about bulky items and have a discussion, and then we'll present about additional services and have a discussion.

95
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:49,308
And then we will have our next steps and closing.

96
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,801
So Madeline, take it away.

97
00:11:52,821 --> 00:12:05,791
I think we're gonna do two poll questions right now.

98
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,974
The first one we wanna, do you wanna talk about it, Madeline?

99
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:13,386
Sure, we're just asking who is here.

100
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:16,667
So if you see that box popping up, you can check all that apply.

101
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:25,390
If you're a resident or business owner or a resident and a business owner, we'd like to know who's here tonight.

102
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:47,930
All right, I'm gonna go ahead and end the poll.

103
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:57,434
I'm not seeing any, I don't know if I'm- I'm seeing the results.

104
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:05,938
I will tell you that 80% are a resident in a building with three or fewer units.

105
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,361
One is a four to 10 unit resident, or two are, one larger building,

106
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:19,613
One is a business with a smaller business, and one is a larger business, and two other.

107
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,995
Oh, I have to click the share results.

108
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:23,176
I'm so sorry, everybody.

109
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:30,381
We don't do a lot of polls in public meetings, so I'm not used to the poll feature.

110
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:34,224
All right, and I'm going to launch the other poll that we have.

111
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:35,405
Great.

112
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:45,018
So I don't know if you can all see that, but it says, would you be interested in moving to every other week's trash collection if you had weekly food scraps collection?

113
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,099
Yes, no, or maybe I need more information about that.

114
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,480
Can folks see that because I'm still seeing the old poll.

115
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,481
And I clicked away the old poll.

116
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:58,541
Madeline, can you try to launch it again?

117
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,862
Cause we're not seeing, oh, now I'm seeing it.

118
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:04,823
Can people see it now?

119
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,753
John and Dina, you're on my screen.

120
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:09,433
Can one of you nod your heads if you're seeing it?

121
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,394
Dina's not seeing it.

122
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,876
John, you're seeing it?

123
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:22,859
Actually, I have 20 people have answered.

124
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:25,420
Oh no, this is the who is here tonight.

125
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,241
I'm gonna close that one.

126
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,362
Now I'm seeing trash services.

127
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:40,809
So this question, would you be interested in moving to every other week collection if you had weekly food scraps collection?

128
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,514
So this is, we wanna know how you feel right now about this.

129
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,385
So let me share these results.

130
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:23,408
56% say yes, 10 out of 18, and six out of 18 say no, and two said maybe.

131
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:25,429
So great.

132
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:33,190
And now I'm gonna turn this over to Jeremy to present about where things stand.

133
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:39,392
Jeremy, you- Thank you, Alicia.

134
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:53,329
So we're going to talk now about Medford's status quo, what's currently happening with the existing solid waste and recycling system, what are the features and what could be some of the opportunities.

135
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,871
So the current collection services, I'm sure you're all familiar with them.

136
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:04,194
It's weekly trash collection in a 64-gallon cart, often referred to as a toter.

137
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,856
Some people call it a bin, some people call it a barrel.

138
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:09,297
It's a 64-gallon cart tonight.

139
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,306
Overflow bags are used by some folks, 33 gallon bags.

140
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,647
They cost $2 a bag on a per bag basis.

141
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:23,288
There's every other week recycling in a 96 gallon cart.

142
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,828
There's seasonal leaf collections.

143
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:28,629
Right now it's 15 weeks per year.

144
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,350
There's bulky items collection.

145
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,271
There's no cost and no real limit to what folks can throw out over the course of a year.

146
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:43,867
And then there's a white goods collection service for $26 per item.

147
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:53,836
So how does Medford compare to trash, to other communities in terms of trash disposal?

148
00:16:53,916 --> 00:17:03,245
This is a chart from MassDEP for 2021 data that was reported by communities all across Massachusetts

149
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:08,284
And this is average pounds per household per year of trash.

150
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:13,411
The different bars are different container sizes.

151
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:16,295
Bedford in green there is a 64-gallon cart.

152
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,886
The ones on the left are smaller, all the way down to just 33 gallon bags.

153
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:24,849
And the ones on the right are up to 96 gallon carts of trash.

154
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:35,416
So as you can see, Medford is kind of up on the higher end of Massachusetts communities in terms of how much trash is being disposed of.

155
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:37,878
One good point, though, is that

156
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:44,241
In terms of communities that use 64-gallon carts, Medford is on the low range of the average.

157
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:48,482
That blue bar to the right is other 64-gallon communities.

158
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,362
Jeremy, one second.

159
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:54,203
If anybody still has the poll in front of the screen, we can't close it for you.

160
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:57,444
You have to click the little button on it to close it yourself.

161
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:58,305
Sorry.

162
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:59,285
Thank you.

163
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:03,750
So let's take a look at what's in our trash.

164
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,791
So these are percentages by weight of materials going to disposal.

165
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,332
That's from the US EPA from 2018.

166
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,173
This is national data.

167
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:21,095
So it shows that across the nation, 48% of everything that we're throwing away, throwing the trash is recyclable.

168
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:28,697
34% of that is compostable and 15% of it is potentially reusable or recyclable.

169
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,539
A lot of people wonder, well, what happens to our trash in Medford?

170
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,319
Where does it go?

171
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:42,181
Well, this is a photograph of the Wheeler Braider Saugus Incinerator in Saugus, not too far from Medford.

172
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:48,923
And it's a place where all the trash and all the bulk items go to be incinerated.

173
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:58,124
There are problems with incineration that have been documented worldwide.

174
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,486
As you can see, the exhaust from this one is particularly bad.

175
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,727
There's a term toxics in, toxics out.

176
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:16,231
Whatever you put into a facility like this will come out in one way or another, either in ash or in fumes and exhaust.

177
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,332
What about our recyclables?

178
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,893
So right now, although waste management is the collector,

179
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:29,000
Our recyclables are going to the Casella Materials Recovery Facility in Charleston, Massachusetts.

180
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,023
And it looks a little something like this.

181
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:36,364
This is one of their facilities in another part of the state.

182
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,167
And finally, yard waste composting.

183
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:48,792
So all of the leaves and Christmas trees that get collected, they go to a yard waste composting facility where they're composted.

184
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:49,852
There's also about 1,600 households

185
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:56,635
that are part of food scraps collection, those go to another facility to be composted as well.

186
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:05,480
So let's take a look at how Medford is doing in terms of what is in Medford's disposal stream across the board.

187
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,383
So for trash, everything that Medford puts out on the curb, 69% of that is trash.

188
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:17,986
23% of that gets recycled through the single stream recycling and 8%

189
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:24,169
is composted through the yard waste program.

190
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:30,071
So if we look at that pie and we say, huh, 69% is trash.

191
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:38,915
But then we go back and we look at this EPA pie of what is in the trash, we see that, wow, almost none of that is actually garbage.

192
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:43,157
A lot of it we can recycle, we can compost, and we can even reuse.

193
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:46,733
So then we go back and we look at this and we see that there's a bit of disconnect.

194
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:52,995
It seems like there's some opportunity for Medford in terms of what we can do with the things that we throw away.

195
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,017
So that's our baseline understanding of the system.

196
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:09,962
Now we're gonna dig into some details in this first topic, basic services, of what we're proposing could be a future for Medford's collection services.

197
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:17,908
So as part of this conversation, we need to talk about who is included in the services moving forward.

198
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:29,197
So what we're considering for inclusion are one to three unit residences, K through 12 schools, houses of worship and all municipal facilities.

199
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:38,585
So also what we're considering for basic services are the services of trash collection, recycling collection,

200
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:54,882
and compost collection, in this case, food scraps, food soil paper, and that's tissues and tea bags, small yard trimmings, those sticks and leaves, and then also seasonal yard trimmings collection for the bigger stuff.

201
00:21:57,063 --> 00:22:06,348
So the foundation of this proposal is really weekly collection of the stuff that rots, stuff we compost, it's called putrescibles.

202
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:08,389
This would be collected every week,

203
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,034
in a 13-gallon cart with a locking lid like you see on the side there.

204
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:18,579
That's the cart that's currently used by the food scraps composting programs in Medford.

205
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,902
It's approved by the health department because it's rat resistant.

206
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:25,345
Materials that are accepted, as I mentioned, all food scraps.

207
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:33,492
We're talking about meat and bones and fish, your turkey carcasses, everything that came out of the ground can go into this stream.

208
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:43,800
So as a corollary to this, once we have all that stinky stuff out of the trash, part of this proposal is going to every other week trash collection.

209
00:22:43,940 --> 00:23:00,553
So trash collected every other week in a 64 gallon cart, the same cart you're using now, there would be the option to pay for more frequent collection if a resident wanted that, or if an entity wanted that, and overflow bags would still be available.

210
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:13,149
The benefits of this is that you're cutting the number of trucks for trash in half and the wear and tear and the reduced emissions and the lower cost for the service are benefits.

211
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:21,731
So we're also considering sticking with every other week recycling, sticking with that 96 gallon cart.

212
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:25,991
Again, you'd have the option to pay for more service if needed.

213
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,932
But the reason, the rationale behind this is that

214
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:37,424
We've done some research and it turns out that more frequent collection does not mean more recycling happens.

215
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:39,285
Let me show you what I mean by that.

216
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:44,547
So this is a comparison of Medford and various neighbors.

217
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:47,248
So Medford's the dark blue bar.

218
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,789
The other neighbors are the light blue bars.

219
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,891
And as you can see, Medford is the only community with every other week recycling collection.

220
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:59,112
All these other communities have weekly recycling collection.

221
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,492
but Medford's doing better than 75% of its neighbors in on this chart.

222
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:25,701
Um, this data is supported by national data, uh, by the recycling partnership that suggests the same thing that there really isn't a difference in the amount of materials recycled on a per household basis per year, uh, from weekly to every other week collection.

223
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,782
It's the fact that the service exists.

224
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:29,143
That's the key factor here.

225
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,691
So real barriers to recycling do exist though.

226
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:35,731
It's not the frequency of collection.

227
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:39,432
One barrier is recyclables are still going in the trash.

228
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,652
We know that because of the EPA data shows us that.

229
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:48,493
And we know that because in every community we can recycle better.

230
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:50,853
Another barrier is contamination.

231
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:55,254
This is the stuff that shouldn't be going in the recycling that does.

232
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:59,515
And it damages the materials in there that are actually recyclable.

233
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:07,890
So last piece of this topic before we shift into discussion.

234
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,570
Seasonal and yard and leaf collection.

235
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,352
So 15 weeks is what we're at now.

236
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:16,693
We're suggesting going up to 20 weeks.

237
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:23,196
And this would be same process as now resident owned pans or in paper bags.

238
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:31,321
Benefits to this is that there's, you know, more weeks that you have opportunities to keep stuff that's compostable out of the trash.

239
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:34,122
And that's, that's a good thing.

240
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:43,736
So as we're about to shift into breakout rooms, we have some questions we want you to keep in mind as we make the shift.

241
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:47,258
We're going to shift into two rooms and we're going to talk about that before we go.

242
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:51,461
But first, let's just review these quick questions here.

243
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:55,544
So what do you think of weekly composting collection?

244
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,127
What do you think of every other week trash collection?

245
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,342
How do you figure out what goes in recycling?

246
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:06,823
How do you know if it's the right thing or not the right thing?

247
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:20,030
And would you like to see four and greater unit buildings, residences and businesses included in this services that we just described?

248
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:31,182
So we'll get those questions in your discussion rooms in a moment, but before we do, just some breakout session etiquette here.

249
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:33,622
Raise your hand to speak.

250
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:38,723
This is the stuff that Alicia was talking about before with the raise hand button there.

251
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:48,365
And when you do speak, please introduce yourself, let us know your name, let us know if you're a resident or if you work in Medford or both and what area town you're in.

252
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,506
So I think we're breaking.

253
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:58,593
I just want to clarify, there were a bunch of questions in the chat, but there was one thing that I think was important because it was around sort of the rats and composting.

254
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:14,447
So one thing that we didn't think to include in the slides is that the containers that are used for composting, the small ones you see around their lids latch and our health department has approved those because it is dramatically harder for the rodents to get into those.

255
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,709
And it's actually easier.

256
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:23,220
for the rodents to get into our large garbage cans that don't latch than it is into the compost bins.

257
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:28,924
So that was part of why composting is actually better than that.

258
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:36,989
And I think that Jeremy and Tim and I are in the various breakout rooms and can probably answer all the rest of the questions in there.

259
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,511
I just wanted to make sure everybody had that information.

260
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,333
All right, I'm gonna go ahead and open all the rooms.

261
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:43,013
Sound good?

262
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:44,194
Yes.

263
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:56,344
Thank you very much.

264
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:02,768
Welcome everyone.

265
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,910
We've got a nice group here.

266
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,694
And we first wanted to have everyone just introduce themselves.

267
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm Gary Liss, a part of the Zero Waste Consulting Team, working with Jeremy Drake on the project.

268
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,461
Alicia, you've met already.

269
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:23,582
Lois?

270
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:29,867
If everyone could unmute.

271
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:31,668
I'm a Medford resident.

272
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:33,750
and a member of the task force.

273
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:45,793
I was a member of the mayor's commission that initially set up recycling in the program we have now.

274
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,294
So it's kind of interesting to take 11 years.

275
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:48,534
Great.

276
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:48,874
Thanks, Lois.

277
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:56,728
Hi folks, John Daugherty.

278
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:58,550
Sorry, I missed the last meeting.

279
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:10,839
I was in Italy studying the waste removal in Florence, Italy, which I'll provide some video maybe at one of our future meetings, but it's good to be back.

280
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:18,284
And I'm a lifelong resident of Medford and have a lot of interest in this particular area.

281
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:18,625
I was,

282
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:25,248
a main person in doing Boston Public Schools recycling program some years back.

283
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:28,730
So recycling is a near and dear to me.

284
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:30,231
Great.

285
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:30,971
Thanks, John.

286
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:32,372
Jacqueline?

287
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:35,594
Hi, I'm Jacqueline.

288
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,495
I'm also part of the task force.

289
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,036
I live in Medford in the Wellington area.

290
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:42,077
Great.

291
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:42,437
David?

292
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:45,559
Hi, I'm David.

293
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm a resident of Medford.

294
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:49,717
Fantastic, Christy.

295
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:52,758
Hi, I'm Christy Stone.

296
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,819
I live in West Medford.

297
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,319
I've been here over 20 years.

298
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,360
I'm just a resident.

299
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,662
I've never been involved in any committee or anything, but I have very strong opinions about trash and recycling.

300
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,443
So when I heard about it, I thought I'm in.

301
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,163
Fantastic.

302
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:07,224
Lara?

303
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:08,544
Lara?

304
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:12,505
Going on.

305
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:13,646
I need to unmute.

306
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,406
Or Eunice?

307
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:16,987
Unmute.

308
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:23,980
Hi, Eunice Brown, lifelong Medford resident from the Hillside area.

309
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:26,421
Great, Kathleen.

310
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:37,527
I'm a Medford resident and I'm on the Energy and Environment Committee and very interested in trash, how to reduce it and recycling.

311
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:38,027
Thank you.

312
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:41,809
Kit.

313
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,070
Hi there, my name is Kit Collins.

314
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,471
I'm on the Medford City Council.

315
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:47,352
I'm a member of the Solid Waste Task Force

316
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,448
Apologies for being off camera.

317
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:54,212
I'm recovering from COVID right now, so not looking my best, but really glad to see so many people on the call tonight.

318
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:54,632
Thank you.

319
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:58,536
Best wishes for better recovery soon.

320
00:30:59,476 --> 00:30:59,897
Karen.

321
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:04,580
Hi, I'm a Medford resident of five years.

322
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:12,727
I'm very interested in recycling and I currently compost with garbage, garden to garbage or whatever it's called.

323
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:15,313
Great, fantastic.

324
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:17,674
And Medford Community Media.

325
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:23,395
That's actually our TV station that is broadcasting.

326
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,456
So we don't need to talk.

327
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:29,857
So Madeline just shared with us the questions.

328
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:35,318
Yeah, Madeline can't hear me.

329
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:40,499
I'm gonna message her and ask her if she can message them so that I can post them in the chat so they don't disappear.

330
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:46,361
Okay, the first question is what do you think of the weekly composting collection?

331
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:57,648
And I'd like to ask first for people who are not on the task force to respond as we're trying to get additional input besides beyond that of the task force.

332
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:01,990
So what do you think of the idea of weekly compost collection?

333
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,933
Anyone raised hand, David?

334
00:32:07,914 --> 00:32:09,035
Or that's a thumbs up.

335
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:11,276
I'm for it.

336
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:14,746
I do it already, but so I'm forward continuing to do it again.

337
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:21,768
I think it's a great idea, but it will require a lot of education.

338
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:33,591
And that's actually my, I guess my view on all aspects of this is that it would, people don't, most people don't understand what it is and they'll think it's a lot of work.

339
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:36,972
So it will require a lot for us to make it successful.

340
00:32:38,576 --> 00:32:39,637
Okay, great.

341
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:47,524
And when you say it will take a lot of work, what do you envision that?

342
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:51,827
No, I think a lot of people don't know what it is.

343
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:53,809
A lot of people don't know what composting is.

344
00:32:54,449 --> 00:33:02,116
So it will require a lot for us to educate them and then to make sure they're doing it the right way, which I know is also an issue with recycling.

345
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:05,375
A lot of people don't do recycling very well.

346
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:17,726
So, I mean, education is really, that's like the big issue around all of this, is getting people to do it the right way so that we can be truly successful in how we're getting rid of things.

347
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:18,787
Right.

348
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:23,091
So when you say it will take a lot of work, you're referring to the city and the education.

349
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:25,713
Is that what you mean?

350
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:26,494
Yes.

351
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:29,096
I guess I also meant that I think

352
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:37,787
residents who aren't familiar with it will have the preconceived notion that it will take them a lot of work to do it right.

353
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,469
And they may just say, I don't wanna do it.

354
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,510
It's too much work.

355
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:44,832
Okay, great.

356
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:48,394
Other hands, Eunice?

357
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:52,197
Yeah, kind of jumping on what Christy had to say.

358
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:56,520
I don't know that I have an opinion on it yet because I really don't know

359
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,424
what it is and what it entails.

360
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:17,028
I mean, I think everybody in the city probably knows and understands what the recycle bins are for, whether or not they use them and recycle as they should is another story, but I think we all know what it's there and what it's for.

361
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:21,169
How do you, what do you do with a compost bin?

362
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,492
So, I mean, I, you know, I have no idea, so I don't know whether I'm for it or against it.

363
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:46,040
I think my purpose in being, you know, in tune to what's going on with this task force and so forth, I'm relatively happy with the way trash pickup is now, with the exception, my main interests are extending the leaf pickup and

364
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:57,220
doing something about bulk pickup of stuff and basement cleanouts and things, just getting rid of the crap that you find when you do a basement cleanout.

365
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:01,965
So I don't know if I'm for or against composting, because I have no idea what it is.

366
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:03,186
Great.

367
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:05,469
Very good input.

368
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:05,949
Kathleen.

369
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:12,304
If you could put your hand down, Eunice, when you're done.

370
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:13,445
Kathleen.

371
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:24,829
I agree with the education portion of it and just want to ask, is it, would that be all food scraps or just particular?

372
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,567
items that could go into composting.

373
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:40,749
I live in a place where we don't have any garbage disposal, so all of our food goes into the trash, which is, you know, aggravates me.

374
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,210
And we could definitely cut out the trash volume that way.

375
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,391
Thank you.

376
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:48,971
Great, fantastic.

377
00:35:51,594 --> 00:36:00,460
Are there any members of the task force that want to either respond to the comments made about those, like one or two of the task force members to respond?

378
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:02,661
Any comments?

379
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,482
And then we'll go on to the next question.

380
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:08,425
So any task force person want to respond?

381
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:21,413
I also want to make sure that people who walk away from this meeting understand that composting that when we're talking about it with from the task force in the city is the commercial composting.

382
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:30,376
So any food scraps, like as Jeremy was mentioning, you can put bones, you can put grease, you can put any foods cooked, uncooked.

383
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,897
You can also put all your paper towels, all your tissues.

384
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:36,658
They have to be processed at a facility

385
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:40,586
that reaches over 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

386
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,087
So everything gets broken down in that.

387
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:48,448
So it's not restricted to what you would do in backyard composting.

388
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:59,572
Most people find if they use this commercial composting, they've taken everything out of their waste that is smelly, except not diapers, animal waste, no animal poop.

389
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:01,792
Christy?

390
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:03,653
Great clarification, Christy?

391
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:11,081
Yes, my question is, you mentioned paper towel.

392
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:14,442
I use a service, I use a Black Earth composting myself.

393
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:29,188
And for that one, my understanding was you can only put paper towels in that have food on them, but if you'd use them for cleaning, like, you know, Windex or something like that, you couldn't put them in.

394
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:34,350
Is the service that Medford is considering, they can also take that sort of thing?

395
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:38,246
Do you know that level of detail?

396
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:42,349
That would be one of the outcomes of the RFP that we would find out.

397
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:49,755
We'll be soliciting a variety of vendors that could provide the different services, including the composting.

398
00:37:50,315 --> 00:38:02,245
And each of the composters will have different requirements and capabilities based on what type of technology they use, how they run the facility and so forth.

399
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:04,546
So at this point in time,

400
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:26,157
what we're highlighting for general commercial composting, what Alicia was talking about, the specifics will be when we get through the request for proposal period and have selected a vendor who will have clear guidelines on what they can accept and cannot.

401
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:34,280
I just think getting back to the education part of it, sometimes it might actually be

402
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:45,046
in our better interest to restrict some of those things, just because it will be harder for people to understand what is or isn't allowed.

403
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:50,730
So I had put this chat earlier about the whole tissues thing.

404
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:56,133
I wonder if that might be getting a little bit too...

405
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:05,048
I don't know how to say this delicately, but people could misinterpret that and end up putting in more things than are really allowable.

406
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:12,734
And I guess we don't need to get into all the details there, but tissues are one thing, but then people are like, oh, well, I'm gonna, yeah, I'll put the diapers in too.

407
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:15,176
And then there's a whole host of other things we could mention.

408
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:19,379
Again, it comes down to education.

409
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:21,481
And I think we need to keep those things in mind.

410
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:25,375
when we look at a contract and what is accepted and what isn't.

411
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:29,876
Like how are we really gonna teach people the right way to do this?

412
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:36,818
And if so many things are allowed, some things may be misinterpreted too easily.

413
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:38,819
So it's just something we keep in mind.

414
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:54,254
Right, I love the point about it's not just what the technology can accept, it's what the public can understand is a really great insight, really, really helpful.

415
00:39:54,734 --> 00:40:07,562
And we might be better off taking maybe a smaller step ahead and do it right and do it better than making a bigger step and have a lot of not

416
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:09,765
good results.

417
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:11,686
So it's just one.

418
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:13,788
Right.

419
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:16,570
Okay, Eunice.

420
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:18,872
Um, yeah, thanks.

421
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:37,626
Is there a place that we can go maybe another website or something or another communities website or something that we can see how this composting thing works in other communities or maybe other companies that like the Garden to Garbage and the Black Earth?

422
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:58,406
what they accept and don't accept so that, you know, we get an idea of what we might be, you know, facing when we, I would imagine that this will probably come to pass, but, you know, it would be nice to educate people beforehand how it actually works.

423
00:40:58,846 --> 00:41:02,207
Right, have you seen the Garbage Garden or Black Earth websites?

424
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:03,508
No, I have not.

425
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:16,022
So we will get you links for those and they have really good information on them that will begin that availability of information that you're looking for.

426
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:19,063
I just dropped the links to both of them.

427
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:22,104
So the city's recommended one is garbage to garden.

428
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:27,725
And that's the one that when we did an RFP, that's the one that we chose at that time.

429
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:32,249
drop the link to that there, frequently asked questions.

430
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:39,076
And I also just grabbed the Black Earth one and dropped it in this chat so you could have it this evening.

431
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:40,077
Thank you.

432
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:41,638
Great.

433
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:43,000
So why don't we move on to the...

434
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:49,218
Next question, which was what do you think of every other week trash?

435
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:55,640
We got a general sense of all those attending at the beginning of the workshop.

436
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:06,102
But now that you've heard some background and are understanding what's being proposed for composting, which could handle up to 20 to 30% of the average

437
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:14,725
household's current trash going to waste.

438
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:19,006
What do you think now about every other week trash?

439
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:29,129
Again, why don't we start with other than the task force and then we'll have one or two task force members respond to any comments that have been made.

440
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,750
So Karen.

441
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:36,712
I live in a triple decker and we have three trash, large trash barrels.

442
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:39,589
90% of the time, we only use one.

443
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,753
So I think we're totally fine with going for every other week.

444
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:48,935
I just wanted to say something about the other question is a lot of it's just a habit.

445
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:56,162
You have to hold different mindset to start doing the composting, just like bringing your recyclable bags to go grocery shopping.

446
00:42:56,403 --> 00:43:00,787
How many times do we walk out of your car and then go back to get your bags, right?

447
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:03,550
It's just really hard to remember.

448
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,294
So every time I throw something away, my daughter's like, mom, you got to put that in the compost.

449
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:13,298
don't do tea bags, they have a metal table, you know, there's all this reminding.

450
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:23,747
So if you did like a, I'm a designer, so I think visual, like if you did like a little poster or something that's easily accessible, also Garbage Garden has it printed on their barrel.

451
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,950
I have the older barrel, which is really helpful, do's and don'ts.

452
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,892
So that's all I wanted to say.

453
00:43:29,972 --> 00:43:34,395
So it's gonna be hard, but it's habit forming and it's definitely worth it.

454
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:36,877
Great, great suggestions.

455
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:37,638
Christy.

456
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,331
Okay, now I can't remember what my question was, sorry.

457
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,491
I'm just getting so many information here.

458
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:45,371
I'll think of it later.

459
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:46,412
No problem.

460
00:43:46,532 --> 00:44:03,335
I'll go back to Karen's comment about the daughter reminding you that educational programs in the schools can often be helpful to remind us at home.

461
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:05,376
So, Christy.

462
00:44:06,236 --> 00:44:07,657
Okay, now I remembered.

463
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:09,537
Do we have any sense?

464
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:19,226
of how many residences have full garbage on a frequent basis.

465
00:44:20,426 --> 00:44:28,069
Like, I guess I'm saying like what, I mean, those of us here in this room and at this meeting, we're probably in the minority of the city.

466
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:34,931
But then again, Alicia, you said that you hear so many people saying all these other things that they want in the city.

467
00:44:35,031 --> 00:44:39,433
But I just wonder how many people truly are interested in this

468
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:48,164
in reducing our trash and how many residences have full trash bins every week and like with a lot of scary stuff in it?

469
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:57,958
Alicia may have some insights, but I'd like to share this survey is a nice indicator.

470
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:01,539
I think it's up to about 800 survey responses, Alicia.

471
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:10,923
So that's a nice indicator that there's quite a few people that are tracking it.

472
00:45:11,383 --> 00:45:17,145
Everyone has comments about garbage and recycling, but how many people are actually willing to send back a survey?

473
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:22,369
Again, they may be predisposed to wanting to address these issues more positively.

474
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:28,074
And we've taken that into consideration, both at the task force and in staff discussions.

475
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:35,680
Alicia, do you want to respond to how frequent, how full the containers are?

476
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,321
Do you have any?

477
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,763
I don't think we know that.

478
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,925
What we can find out is the

479
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:53,692
pounds per household that get picked up just because that, so that's a number that we have available to us because waste management takes all the trash and it all gets weighed and we get charged by the pound.

480
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:57,373
for trash, and they know how many households we pick up from.

481
00:45:57,773 --> 00:46:01,414
So that is information that we have, and that is available from other communities.

482
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:03,615
So we can look at that, but we haven't.

483
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:05,595
That's different from the volume.

484
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:18,059
On the survey, 60% of the people said either yes, or maybe I need information, to would you be willing to go to every other week pickup.

485
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:30,042
for trash, which we thought given that those are people who have not received education on the costs and on the knowledge of some people from it were already composting.

486
00:46:30,102 --> 00:46:34,265
I didn't we didn't look at of that which ones were already composting.

487
00:46:35,178 --> 00:46:42,385
I think that we've heard very consistently that once people start composting, they really don't see the need for every week pickups.

488
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:47,929
Because the weight, and honestly, you would take out your compost every night.

489
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,453
If there's not smelly stuff in your garbage, you're not taking that out every night.

490
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:56,657
The one place where I do foresee a problem is people with diapers.

491
00:46:58,338 --> 00:46:59,940
Diapers fill up your trash.

492
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:10,251
And that would need to be some level of consideration that they might need weekly service or overfill flow bags, because that really does fill it up.

493
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:15,036
Of course, there's cloth diapering, but I don't expect everybody in Medford to go to cloth diapering.

494
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,762
A lot of people in Medford who have done it, but yeah.

495
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:24,279
So I'd like to explore that idea.

496
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:37,388
Show of thumbs up if you like the idea, if they've got diapers type of situation, being able to have an overflow of or weekly service.

497
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,372
Does that make sense to you if there's a diaper problem?

498
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:47,195
So thumbs up visually or by the reaction?

499
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:48,176
Okay.

500
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:50,918
That's great.

501
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:54,879
Okay, we're going to move on to the next question then.

502
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,502
How do you figure out what goes in recycling?

503
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:05,284
This is getting out the recycling right issue that some people have talked about.

504
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:08,326
Any comments about that?

505
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,707
Where do you go for information?

506
00:48:14,437 --> 00:48:24,760
And one person did already respond that they liked the garbage to garden old container because it had clear instructions on the container.

507
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:28,641
Any follow up on that, Christy?

508
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:36,844
Yeah, when I have a question about recycling, I look at the multi page brochure, you know, I have that in my kitchen.

509
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:40,665
And, you know, it's because it's got the calendar on it, too.

510
00:48:41,248 --> 00:48:43,169
which I'm always looking at every week.

511
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:45,950
So I look at that for more detail.

512
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:56,934
Occasionally I've looked on the website if I wanted more detail or I had some other question, but that's where I go for everything.

513
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:59,474
And it doesn't answer all my questions sometimes.

514
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:06,457
And then for my composting service, which I pay for Black Earth, I also have their,

515
00:49:07,565 --> 00:49:11,666
that they gave me, I have that in my kitchen too, right next to the other one.

516
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:12,627
So that's where I go.

517
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:14,527
Okay, anyone else?

518
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:18,288
Okay, Lois.

519
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:32,953
Is there any way that the recycling hauler can provide something that goes in the lid of the container?

520
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:39,107
I mean, is that done in some communities where it says it right on the bin?

521
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:43,592
Yes, it's best practice, definitely.

522
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:48,446
Okay, we're coming down the home stretch here.

523
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:55,430
Our last question is, would you like to see four plus unit residents and businesses included?

524
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,533
And that's included in the municipal system paid for by the city.

525
00:50:01,554 --> 00:50:08,077
So our four plus unit residents and businesses included, should they be included is the question.

526
00:50:08,978 --> 00:50:10,279
Any comments?

527
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:14,341
And then I'd like to see thumbs up or down on that.

528
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:21,482
So included four plus units in the municipal contract.

529
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:23,644
Any comments, Karen?

530
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:27,146
Well, why wouldn't they be?

531
00:50:27,186 --> 00:50:41,596
They're not currently universally, the current contract has a unique process by which they can get in or out at the discretion of the mayor.

532
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:47,846
Recording in progress.

533
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:03,414
Welcome back, everybody.

534
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:05,395
Take it away, Alicia.

535
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:07,936
You wanna facilitate the report back?

536
00:51:08,997 --> 00:51:14,220
Yes, so we were gonna have, if I remember correctly, our scribes had agreed that they would

537
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:18,323
report back, but I apologize.

538
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:19,743
I don't have the list in front of me.

539
00:51:19,783 --> 00:51:22,224
Would one of you just raise your hand and I'll unmute you.

540
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:27,426
I don't have the, the describes where Lois, you want to go first?

541
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:29,166
There you go.

542
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:35,248
There we go.

543
00:51:36,648 --> 00:51:38,169
Um, we didn't quite finish.

544
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:42,610
Um, but I'll tell you what we did do.

545
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,670
Um,

546
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,745
We talked a lot about compost.

547
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:52,288
We talked about the need for education.

548
00:51:54,029 --> 00:52:03,717
The fact that people don't even know what it is, much less why they should do it.

549
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:08,820
There's just a lot of unfamiliarity.

550
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:10,862
Your explanation helped.

551
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:16,170
but it raised questions about diapers and about tissues.

552
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:24,754
And a lot of people are gonna need help understanding what composting is.

553
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:31,578
On the every other week collection, I don't think we came to any conclusions.

554
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,243
Again, the diapers were an issue because they bulk up trash for some people.

555
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:54,202
Obviously, we have to think further about options for every week for some people, as opposed to every other week, if that's possible.

556
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,563
What goes in recycling?

557
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:09,665
People would appreciate more detailed information on how to recycle properly.

558
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:12,445
And we talked about having it

559
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:17,005
on the lid of the container the way it is for the compost.

560
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:22,410
And we never did finish voting on the four units.

561
00:53:24,031 --> 00:53:24,932
Units of four or more.

562
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:26,333
Great.

563
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:27,274
Thank you, Lois.

564
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:29,836
Dina, do you want to go next?

565
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:31,938
Wait, I have to find you to unmute you.

566
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,259
That's, there we go.

567
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:37,459
Sure, thank you.

568
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:58,888
We had some of the same concerns in our group that there's not a lot of communication and reinforcement about what's trash and what's recycling and all the more so if we move forward with composting, it's really gotta be clear and an ongoing thing of this goes in this bin and that goes in that bin and that goes in that.

569
00:53:59,808 --> 00:54:16,484
And then also the concern that even with separating the trash and the compost and the recycling that every other week trash pickup might not be enough and that the smell of what used to be in the whatever's in the trash could still attract rodents.

570
00:54:19,332 --> 00:54:33,840
And then there was some question around the options of dual stream recycling so that we separate glass and cardboard and paper and maybe get some money back for the city from those services.

571
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,102
I think that is about it.

572
00:54:38,962 --> 00:54:40,363
Great, thank you very much.

573
00:54:40,783 --> 00:54:41,443
Jacqueline.

574
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:48,127
Lois and I were in the same group, so I have the same notes as her.

575
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:49,484
Oh, okay.

576
00:54:50,364 --> 00:54:51,545
There were just two rooms then?

577
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:53,526
Or am I missing somebody?

578
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:54,988
Okay.

579
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:56,248
Great.

580
00:54:56,889 --> 00:54:57,389
Thank you.

581
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,612
And then, so I guess, Jeremy, do you want to take us to the next topic?

582
00:55:01,192 --> 00:55:01,832
Keep moving here.

583
00:55:02,373 --> 00:55:02,973
It's 655.

584
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:03,914
Uh-huh.

585
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:04,294
Great.

586
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:09,258
We were going to do the quick second poll question.

587
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,505
Madeline, can you launch that?

588
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,646
Everybody, this is not a trick question.

589
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,247
You've seen this one before already.

590
00:55:18,747 --> 00:55:25,089
We just wanna see if your opinion has changed at all after our discussion.

591
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:39,435
And while you're voting, I will mention that Madeline confirmed that this is streaming live on YouTube while we were in the breakout rooms.

592
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,701
Great, we have 20.

593
00:55:47,842 --> 00:55:48,162
Great.

594
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:51,544
I can share the results.

595
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:57,848
60% said yes, 25% no, and 15%, three people said maybe.

596
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:00,650
Great, thank you all.

597
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:09,376
Okay, I'm gonna stop sharing the results and then we're gonna shift to our next discussion topic.

598
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:12,038
Oh.

599
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:13,638
Everybody see this?

600
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,139
Topic number two, bulky items.

601
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,680
Okay, fantastic.

602
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:22,783
So topic number two, bulky items.

603
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:24,323
Here's our current situation.

604
00:56:25,104 --> 00:56:30,326
Bulky items are collected curbside by appointment at no cost to residents.

605
00:56:31,427 --> 00:56:38,150
The costs are paid by the city and they're paid whether the item is there when the truck arrives or not.

606
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:43,101
So it doesn't matter if somebody was like, nice chair, I'm going to grab that.

607
00:56:43,381 --> 00:56:46,142
City still pays if the truck is called and goes there.

608
00:56:48,224 --> 00:56:50,124
The cost is $25 per item.

609
00:56:50,905 --> 00:57:00,890
And year over year, the average is almost $400,000 as part of the current contract for the city to provide this service.

610
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:06,734
So this is a pie chart from the survey.

611
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:11,317
Maybe some of you took the Medford Talks Trash survey that's been open for a few months now.

612
00:57:11,837 --> 00:57:15,579
This is specifically around disposal of furniture.

613
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:25,524
And so what it shows here is that a lot of folks who answered the survey are donating or selling their furniture.

614
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:27,105
Some of them are

615
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,083
availing themselves of the bulky pickup service.

616
00:57:32,044 --> 00:57:34,627
And some folks are doing some other things as well.

617
00:57:34,747 --> 00:57:38,391
So the service is being used clearly $400,000 a year.

618
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:40,913
Other folks are not using it.

619
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:45,278
Just a little little window into current practice.

620
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:50,063
Some people are using the drop off at City Hall or the DPW yard too.

621
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:54,639
So these are the changes that are being considered.

622
00:57:54,699 --> 00:57:59,880
Again, and I didn't stress this maybe enough earlier, all of what you're seeing tonight are proposals.

623
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
They're ideas.

624
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,220
Nothing is set in stone.

625
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,881
This is why we're having the public workshop, because we want to get your input on these ideas.

626
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:10,262
So these are the changes that we're considering for bulky items.

627
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:12,983
That residents pay at least $5 per item.

628
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:22,873
That $5 is a threshold that kicks in from the state funding to support waste reduction programs.

629
00:58:23,394 --> 00:58:25,657
And so by doing that, the city would get $7,000 per year from the state.

630
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:34,349
Items would also go to reuse and recycling as possible.

631
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:39,170
Right now, they go into the trash and they are burned in the incinerator.

632
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:49,252
So this would be a rejiggering of the system to ensure that reusable materials are reused, recyclable materials are recycled.

633
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:53,493
And then another piece is to host seasonal

634
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,777
no-cost drop-off events.

635
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:59,358
So that picture on the side, Community Dump Day.

636
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:13,668
So that's from a community where twice a year, spring and fall, the contracted hauler sets up shop and takes a ton of different kinds of items that the community can go drop off at no cost.

637
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:19,853
So that's the basics for this particular

638
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:22,242
topic.

639
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:24,464
So here are the questions that we want to ask.

640
00:59:24,545 --> 00:59:28,328
And Madeline, if you can paste these into the chat before we go, that'd be great.

641
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:32,291
So what do you think residents sharing the cost of bulk item collection?

642
00:59:33,212 --> 00:59:37,876
What do you think is a reasonable price $5, $10, $15 an item?

643
00:59:38,737 --> 00:59:44,602
And would you be in favor of seasonal spring and fall free bulk drop off events?

644
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:52,959
So we're going to head back out into our breakout rooms and we have about eight minutes to discuss this topic.

645
00:59:53,799 --> 01:00:00,421
Uh, so we'll do the same thing that we did before, um, touching on these three questions and whatever other ideas you have.

646
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:03,302
So Madeline, go ahead and boot us.

647
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:04,002
Thank you.

648
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:06,183
See you all over in the breakout room.

649
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:31,574
And I will again post these three questions into our chat.

650
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:40,155
Let's start by asking, what do you think residents sharing the cost of bulk item collection?

651
01:00:42,016 --> 01:00:42,376
Chris.

652
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:45,516
I really don't have a problem with that.

653
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:48,177
The only concern I would have is that

654
01:00:49,496 --> 01:00:52,938
We already run into people who just dump stuff in the city.

655
01:00:52,998 --> 01:00:55,078
They try to find an area where they can just get rid of it.

656
01:00:56,999 --> 01:01:02,562
I remember that even when I was younger, that they used to take stuff and just throw it down by the river at night.

657
01:01:03,722 --> 01:01:05,383
That would be my only concern with that.

658
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:13,006
Having twice a year kind of places that you could just drop stuff off in bulk, that would be awesome.

659
01:01:13,046 --> 01:01:17,748
I mean, if we had a dump around here, I would have no issue with that.

660
01:01:19,253 --> 01:01:20,333
Great, thank you.

661
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:27,216
Anyone else have thoughts about these issues here?

662
01:01:27,236 --> 01:01:30,937
Are you willing to pay to get rid of your bulk stuff?

663
01:01:30,977 --> 01:01:31,377
Hey, Joan.

664
01:01:31,657 --> 01:01:35,859
Yeah, so I agree with Chris that, you know, already people are dumping bulk stuff.

665
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:46,503
I mean, we live in an area where there's a bunch of woods and we walk through and there's chairs here and computers there and, you know, that kind of thing that people just dump stuff.

666
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:54,551
So, um, I mean I think it's reasonable for the you know five or, you know, $5 or $10 an item.

667
01:01:55,171 --> 01:02:04,862
I like the idea of, you know, biannual free bulk drop off events, that's good I mean they already have the paint shed where you can drop off paint cans, you know, a couple times a year.

668
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:06,484
So the bulk items.

669
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:16,853
I'm concerned about the example that you gave about, you know, somebody puts a, you know, a table or something on the street for bulk pickup and then somebody comes by and says, oh, this is great.

670
01:02:16,993 --> 01:02:20,256
And they pick it up and they go to reuse it and the city is still paying for it.

671
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:26,241
So I feel like there's gotta be a way to, you know, circumvent that somehow.

672
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:33,568
I mean, we've got the Everything Free Medford Facebook group that a lot of stuff gets transferred and reused and switched on.

673
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:51,006
There's somebody that, you know, sponsors twice a year junk in the trunk, you know, over to Hormel Stadium you bring all your bulk items or whatever you have open up your trunk and it's a big free for all and everybody, you know, takes, takes, you know what they need and keeps it out of the landfill so.

674
01:02:51,907 --> 01:03:09,803
I feel like we need to, you know, look at those things before people go and I know it's on the website that says if you have something before you call it in to be disposed of, think about recycling, but it's the same thing with that I said about, you know, communicating about what's recyclable what's compostable, there's got to be a more effective

675
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:24,920
right in the moment communication like, you know, printing on the, you know, containers and like, like, like somebody had mentioned earlier, you know, what's recyclable, what's compostable, it's got to be right at the moment that they're looking to dispose that they get that communication.

676
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,625
Great, thank you for that great feedback, Joan.

677
01:03:29,228 --> 01:03:31,729
I just want to quickly add something, Jeremy, just for context.

678
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:36,850
I think we don't necessarily know that it's someone grabbing a chair and selling it or using it or whatever.

679
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,312
It's just the idea for $5 or $10 is that the resident has some skin in the game.

680
01:03:41,372 --> 01:03:45,013
So there's some accountability because we get a lot of ghosting on this too, we suspect.

681
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:51,295
So where folks say they schedule a pickup, but there's no skin in the game, so they forget to cancel it, et cetera.

682
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,115
So it's a high cost.

683
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:55,256
So you could cancel it before the pickup?

684
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:59,007
If you get skin in the game, the anticipation would be, yeah, you can cancel.

685
01:03:59,047 --> 01:03:59,388
Yeah.

686
01:03:59,428 --> 01:04:04,992
So I think a lot of folks, you know, that doesn't happen all the time while they forget to put it out.

687
01:04:05,553 --> 01:04:07,574
So anyway, a variety of reasons.

688
01:04:08,255 --> 01:04:08,515
I see.

689
01:04:08,535 --> 01:04:14,820
So you're saying that they would still have to pay the $5 or $10 pickup if the item was no longer there.

690
01:04:15,911 --> 01:04:18,512
Yeah, because we pay it anyway.

691
01:04:18,652 --> 01:04:19,532
That doesn't change.

692
01:04:20,252 --> 01:04:22,013
We pay the $25, the city pays it.

693
01:04:22,313 --> 01:04:25,254
It's just the city would be paying $15 and the resident pays 10.

694
01:04:25,614 --> 01:04:27,115
So there's both have skin in the game.

695
01:04:27,795 --> 01:04:29,115
I see.

696
01:04:29,335 --> 01:04:30,416
Now that's more clear.

697
01:04:31,996 --> 01:04:34,157
That's why I wanted to speak up just so everybody can understand.

698
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:35,137
I'm like, okay.

699
01:04:37,238 --> 01:04:37,798
Thank you, Tim.

700
01:04:38,098 --> 01:04:39,519
Great, great clarification.

701
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:43,440
So some good stuff going on in the chat.

702
01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:50,522
Lack of transparency for service informing the community would be helpful.

703
01:04:51,702 --> 01:04:53,083
Joyce, can you say more about that?

704
01:04:53,103 --> 01:04:59,727
Do you not have a microphone?

705
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:03,970
Well, we don't know.

706
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,850
We don't know.

707
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:13,055
So if someone, you know, when you called up for the service, if someone informed you, then people may be more mindful.

708
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:40,135
informed you about what the cost or the cost of the city or right all above all the information uh more people need more information okay gotcha i don't have a problem with people skin in the game but i think that the lack of information is a problem so that people can understand the impact of the actions that they're taking that's correct excellent

709
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:41,774
Okay.

710
01:05:43,175 --> 01:05:46,137
Oh, um, see here.

711
01:05:46,437 --> 01:05:47,478
What about hazardous waste?

712
01:05:47,498 --> 01:05:47,838
Deborah?

713
01:05:47,858 --> 01:05:50,601
That's our third topic that we're going to discuss in a few minutes.

714
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:58,007
So let's put a pin in that, um, bulk common shed where things can be dropped off, picked over a great.

715
01:05:58,407 --> 01:05:58,807
Okay.

716
01:05:58,887 --> 01:06:01,630
So that's another possible idea, right.

717
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:07,955
To have a, um, like a, a reuse shed somewhere.

718
01:06:07,975 --> 01:06:08,015
Um,

719
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:15,616
not necessarily a collection service or a seasonal event, but something that's permanent.

720
01:06:16,636 --> 01:06:17,977
Am I understanding that right, Deborah?

721
01:06:17,997 --> 01:06:29,960
So I know I'm supposed to be the note taker, but I do like the idea of a shed where you can drop off your stuff because you could also then pick up your stuff, right?

722
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,380
Or other people's stuff.

723
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:36,482
So it's like everything is free Medford, but a shed, which is not a bad option either.

724
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:37,302
Great.

725
01:06:39,024 --> 01:06:39,204
Great.

726
01:06:39,224 --> 01:06:40,505
So we've got one more minute.

727
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:42,306
We've got a couple more comments.

728
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,867
Chris, can you make it snappy?

729
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:45,808
Yeah.

730
01:06:45,828 --> 01:06:47,869
I was just going to say, I have skin in the game.

731
01:06:47,909 --> 01:06:55,333
I went out and bought all the stickers to get rid of old air conditioners and a scrapper knocked on my door and asked for them.

732
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:57,794
So I had skin in the game.

733
01:06:58,154 --> 01:07:02,817
I still have my stickers, but now people have picked them up.

734
01:07:02,957 --> 01:07:04,778
So now I have all these stickers that are $25.

735
01:07:04,818 --> 01:07:05,098
Fair point.

736
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:05,218
Yeah.

737
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:32,942
I think, I mean, even just, even just having like names of scrappers, like, like those things that every, all of us on everything is free know about, like that you call this guy for airplane ride or airport rides, and you call this person to come pick up your scrap metal, like having the city have a list of those more grassroots efforts to get rid of

738
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,650
Recording in progress.

739
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,531
Hey, welcome back, everybody.

740
01:07:50,574 --> 01:07:51,994
Great.

741
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:55,155
Dina, you wanna go first this time?

742
01:07:55,915 --> 01:07:58,316
Oh, wait, I have to find you and unmute you, sorry.

743
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:02,337
If you literally use the raised hand, there we go.

744
01:08:03,738 --> 01:08:05,018
There, try again, sorry.

745
01:08:06,403 --> 01:08:06,683
All good.

746
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:15,911
I think everybody in our group was pretty much on board with the idea of charging residents to have the bulk items picked up.

747
01:08:16,512 --> 01:08:22,437
The concerns there are, what about the people who continue to just leave stuff in the woods or on a vacant lot?

748
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:23,678
And how do we kind of...

749
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:25,729
curtail that.

750
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:31,313
And if anything, that could happen more often if we start charging people.

751
01:08:32,695 --> 01:08:39,100
And then there was a good bit of discussion about the Everything is Free Medford Facebook page and Junk in the Trunk events.

752
01:08:40,141 --> 01:08:42,063
The limitations of there being, of course, that

753
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:46,227
Not everybody's on Facebook, not everybody can get to the Junk in the Trunk events.

754
01:08:47,928 --> 01:08:55,956
It would be great to, our suggestion was to have a city yard or a shed or something for where people can drop off their bulk items.

755
01:08:57,177 --> 01:09:00,040
And then maybe even people could then pick up other bulk items.

756
01:09:01,661 --> 01:09:04,983
Like it would be an in-person, everything is free in Medford almost.

757
01:09:06,463 --> 01:09:12,427
Failing that seasonal bulk event pickups was, seemed to be a good idea.

758
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,668
I don't think anybody had any complaints about that.

759
01:09:19,751 --> 01:09:20,211
That's it.

760
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:20,671
We're done.

761
01:09:24,962 --> 01:09:32,267
So our group also liked the idea of, you know, having sharing the cost of the bulk item collections.

762
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:39,432
I think there was a broad consensus around having a day or two when it would be free so that people have the opportunity to put a lot of stuff.

763
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:47,027
the beginning of summer, end of summer time when there's just a lot of things to get rid of, household cleaning, things like that.

764
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,689
So to have an opportunity where that's possible.

765
01:09:51,690 --> 01:10:01,799
There was a concern around illegal dumping and around scheduling to make sure that, you know, people aren't, their stuff isn't being stolen before it's actually getting picked up.

766
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,982
People liked the idea of around five to $10 per item.

767
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,604
And then there was also talk around

768
01:10:08,308 --> 01:10:10,130
pricing it based on the size of something.

769
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:19,977
So if someone's putting out a couch versus a small chair, should there be, you know, people pay different amounts based on sort of the size of the item that they're putting out on the curb.

770
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,320
Excellent.

771
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,281
Thank you, Jacqueline.

772
01:10:25,642 --> 01:10:27,744
Let's move on to our final topic.

773
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:30,266
Topic number three, additional services.

774
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:34,529
So here's our current situation with additional services.

775
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:47,648
As Alicia mentioned before, MassDEP, the state has some bans on some materials, disposal of some materials, most recently mattresses and textiles.

776
01:10:48,429 --> 01:10:58,037
So the city of Medford currently has an agreement with a company called HandUp that residents can call to have mattresses and box springs taken away.

777
01:10:58,578 --> 01:10:59,699
It's a cost of $50 to $5 per item.

778
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:10,362
Textiles, uh, the city has an agreement with a company called help C and that's no cost for that pickup.

779
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:14,685
It's a collection service that you have to just go and schedule it through their website.

780
01:11:14,765 --> 01:11:17,227
So that's for any, any textile material.

781
01:11:18,447 --> 01:11:23,731
We also understand that there's currently no option for household hazardous waste now.

782
01:11:25,492 --> 01:11:26,673
So, um,

783
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:41,835
This is again the survey results that we looked at before around some of the stuff that would fall into sort of hard to recycle materials, household hazardous waste, mattresses, mercury products, textiles.

784
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:46,256
And this shows kind of how some of Medford is dealing with that.

785
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:57,018
So a lot of folks are donating, that's yellow, donating clothes, books, furniture, some computers, some mattresses, some dishwashers and stoves.

786
01:11:57,618 --> 01:12:05,180
A lot of folks are throwing some of that stuff in the trash, batteries, household hazardous waste, textiles.

787
01:12:07,221 --> 01:12:10,462
Just very few people are scheduling pickups for this material yet.

788
01:12:10,502 --> 01:12:12,943
So there's definitely room for improvement there.

789
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:23,806
So in terms of questions around this topic area, are the current services sufficient?

790
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:29,330
And if not, what are your highest priority for additional services?

791
01:12:30,592 --> 01:12:35,736
And would you be willing to pay for additional services if they were available to you?

792
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:41,397
So we're gonna break out into our final discussion group right now.

793
01:12:41,897 --> 01:12:46,879
Just as you do that, I'm gonna say, just so people know, I have to leave early.

794
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:48,599
So Tim is gonna close this out.

795
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:52,281
I'm gonna leave as our next breakout group ends.

796
01:12:52,381 --> 01:13:01,904
So thank you all for coming, but there's actually another public meeting downstairs and online that I have to be there a few minutes before they start this evening.

797
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:03,525
Thanks, Alicia.

798
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:07,409
Thank you all for coming and Tim will close us out after this breakout meeting.

799
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:41,985
That's recording in progress.

800
01:13:42,645 --> 01:13:44,306
What are examples of other services?

801
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:52,027
Well, um, so right now there's the mattress pickup.

802
01:13:52,727 --> 01:13:53,888
It's $55 an item.

803
01:13:54,468 --> 01:13:58,549
Maybe that, that could be a high price.

804
01:13:58,669 --> 01:14:00,709
Maybe it's possible that that price could be lower.

805
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:05,190
Um, if with a, with a different contract potentially, um,

806
01:14:08,242 --> 01:14:28,393
what other services, what other service, other collection, curbside collection of materials like electronics, for example, household hazardous waste collection, either events or a brick and mortar permanent location.

807
01:14:28,593 --> 01:14:30,414
Those are some ideas.

808
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:33,216
What kinds of services are you thinking?

809
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:34,397
I mean, light bulbs, right?

810
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:35,437
Like light bulbs and batteries.

811
01:14:35,477 --> 01:14:36,578
So like, I think that like,

812
01:14:37,048 --> 01:14:42,232
there's a sharps collection like in the hallway outside the health department and one at the police station.

813
01:14:42,252 --> 01:14:53,100
And then there's like, um, DP of the, um, public works office has some things like batteries and then Alicia's office had other things at one point.

814
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,282
And so you had, you have to go to all these different places to drop off.

815
01:14:56,302 --> 01:15:01,706
And like, I'm one of those people that does collect all the little things and try to find the right place for them to go.

816
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:02,307
And I'm in the,

817
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:12,814
TerraCycle pen thing and I'm collaborating with Trove Green Provisions on Boston Ave to like, I'm the one that sorts all the black plastic containers and people can drop them off at my house all the time.

818
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:17,856
So I'm that person, but it's a big pain in the butt.

819
01:15:18,656 --> 01:15:26,780
And it would be much better to be able to go to one place and say, here are my button batteries and here are my halogen light bulbs.

820
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,521
They're like, whatever, the light bulbs go here and this goes here.

821
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:34,345
and have one drop off and it would make it a lot more manageable for other people and for me.

822
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:47,962
support clubs like the rowing club and whatever other ones to electronics recycling events as a fundraiser, which is great.

823
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:52,224
I take advantage of that whenever I get them, but I don't always know that they're happening.

824
01:15:52,244 --> 01:15:57,126
And if I don't know, and I've got two kids in the public schools, lots of people don't know that those even happen.

825
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:01,467
So if the town wants to take that on, awesome.

826
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:06,189
And if not, then we should be promoting that somewhere at a higher level, I think.

827
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:13,833
They make a lot of money doing it, and it gets a lot of big, undisposable things out of the house.

828
01:16:17,135 --> 01:16:17,515
Excellent.

829
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,378
I like your idea, Shanina, about going to one place and not multiple places.

830
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:23,987
because you're right.

831
01:16:25,008 --> 01:16:26,489
And there's limits too.

832
01:16:26,589 --> 01:16:31,091
Like I have these four foot fluorescent light bulbs that I use in the basement shop lights.

833
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:42,096
And they go out from time to time and I collect them and I brought them to the recycling office and they tried to tell me, oh, you can only, you're limited to how many you can return.

834
01:16:42,116 --> 01:16:45,978
I'm like, that's gonna dissuade me from doing it.

835
01:16:46,078 --> 01:16:50,900
You know, other communities do styrofoam.

836
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,140
days.

837
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:55,222
And that's something that I think we really need.

838
01:16:55,242 --> 01:16:59,847
Especially around the holidays when all those gifts come.

839
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:01,529
Yeah.

840
01:17:02,169 --> 01:17:11,939
That's something that I've saved up, but I can't always get to Salem on their two styrofoam days a year and figure out who lives in Salem that I can give it to.

841
01:17:11,959 --> 01:17:15,783
And then I know Melrose also does a rigid plastics recycling event

842
01:17:17,038 --> 01:17:20,040
I think each fall because they go to the parks.

843
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:35,351
We also have a similar culture of like people bringing their, you know, little tykes, carts and stuff to the playgrounds, which adds a lot of play value to boring playgrounds, but also results in sometimes it being garbage instead of playable stuff.

844
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:41,855
And so the Melrose Parks Department will notify people like, hey, in two weeks is our big plastics recycling.

845
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:45,738
So like pick out the things that are garbage and leave them for us and we'll come get them.

846
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:50,511
but then you know that as much of those things as possible are actually being recycled.

847
01:17:51,172 --> 01:18:05,780
So I think that that's, and especially since the Medford Family Network swaps have stopped taking gear, there's a lot of baby gear that needs a home and that people don't know how to dispose of and don't know that they don't need to buy.

848
01:18:06,521 --> 01:18:13,425
So that's a major waste stream in this community since the swaps have shifted from equipment.

849
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:21,714
I want to say one thing about, um, the one-stop shop for all the hard to recycle stuff.

850
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:23,135
That is a thing.

851
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:31,882
Um, often it's called a charm, which is an acronym for center to hard recycle to center for hard recycle, to recycle materials.

852
01:18:32,623 --> 01:18:36,566
They have them scattered all across the country in different communities or different sizes.

853
01:18:37,347 --> 01:18:39,429
Um, but that's, that's definitely a thing.

854
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:40,790
Um, so, uh,

855
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:49,467
That's how I would characterize what you just described, Shanine and Joan.

856
01:18:54,097 --> 01:19:13,406
uh great i'm just looking at some chats here and we've got just a couple more minutes uh dollars is a lot of money to dispose of a mattress and a box spring that's a lot of money and i know that you know i mean for the beds that i bought you know you buy one they said we'll haul away your old so i haven't had to deal with it

857
01:19:13,946 --> 01:19:16,907
But I did have to deal with it in Cambridge at my dad's house.

858
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:18,087
We had a bed to get rid of.

859
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,888
And I just called Cambridge and put it on the sidewalk and they took it.

860
01:19:22,068 --> 01:19:24,749
So, you know, it's hard.

861
01:19:24,769 --> 01:19:38,112
You know, I know it costs money, but there's got to be, I feel like the communities around us need to come together and figure out, you know, is there a central place in the surrounding communities that we could create to put all these hard to recycle materials?

862
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:41,209
Yeah, a regional approach like we do with hazardous waste.

863
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:45,075
But also, can we get clarification on the hazardous waste being reopened?

864
01:19:45,776 --> 01:19:51,684
Like you can't go to Lexington right now either, so everybody's just putting it in the garbage or holding on to it, and then they're holding on to hazardous waste.

865
01:19:53,426 --> 01:19:54,627
Which is itself a problem.

866
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:58,892
We're trying to get that going again, Janine.

867
01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:00,192
So we're working on it right now.

868
01:20:00,373 --> 01:20:01,573
It's trickier than it sounds.

869
01:20:02,053 --> 01:20:04,494
And I will say that the mattress thing is new as of November.

870
01:20:04,574 --> 01:20:05,895
So DEP changed the rules.

871
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:08,896
So all the other municipalities are dealing with it too.

872
01:20:09,196 --> 01:20:14,558
And right now there's a premium, obviously, because the vendors out there know that it's a change in regulation.

873
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:18,880
So the idea would be to try to get some better prices in years ahead.

874
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:22,609
Anyway, the short of it.

875
01:20:22,969 --> 01:20:24,310
Happy to talk more with you guys.

876
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:25,410
No meeting again, not funny.

877
01:20:31,113 --> 01:20:31,473
Great.

878
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:42,097
Um, so, um, wanted to, we haven't talked really about paying for additional service outside of the mattresses.

879
01:20:42,677 --> 01:20:48,219
Um, what if there was a, um, styrofoam collection day or, um,

880
01:20:51,817 --> 01:20:59,360
a charm that had a user fee, like you paid $3 every time you go through the gate, those kinds of things.

881
01:21:01,581 --> 01:21:02,542
Chris, you'd love that.

882
01:21:02,662 --> 01:21:05,023
What was that, the Styrofoam Collection Day?

883
01:21:06,703 --> 01:21:08,344
Yeah, I think that's a terrific idea.

884
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,025
I hate throwing that stuff out.

885
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:17,568
Anytime you get a television or any big item, it's got all the Styrofoam in it, and I really just hate throwing that away.

886
01:21:19,011 --> 01:21:24,975
It fills up the trash barrel and it's just, I just, I feel like that shouldn't be going into the landfill.

887
01:21:25,515 --> 01:21:25,815
Yeah.

888
01:21:27,637 --> 01:21:31,719
And you'd be willing to pay for an extra day to have that stuff taken away once a year?

889
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,000
Absolutely.

890
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,502
If you're saying like $3 to go in and take care of it, that would be awesome.

891
01:21:37,983 --> 01:21:41,986
Well, that might be a drop-off option, but a collection.

892
01:21:42,006 --> 01:21:43,307
A drop-off would be great.

893
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:48,110
If we, you know, and it would depend on how much you're talking about charging, because it's like,

894
01:21:49,065 --> 01:21:51,087
If you're charging money, people aren't gonna do it.

895
01:21:51,827 --> 01:21:53,288
They're gonna just throw it in the trash.

896
01:21:56,651 --> 01:21:59,013
We have to talk about the demographics of our city too.

897
01:21:59,033 --> 01:22:02,396
It's like a good percentage of people that are here are younger.

898
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:14,786
There are some oldies like us, and Deb, I know you, but there's a lot of people that won't take part in that kind of stuff if they feel like they're being charged.

899
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:16,728
We also have to think about the,

900
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:18,942
people over 65 too.

901
01:22:18,962 --> 01:22:24,083
I don't think that Salem or whatever the community is in the North Shore.

902
01:22:24,123 --> 01:22:25,103
John, do you know which one it is?

903
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:27,604
We're seven seconds, but I don't think they charge.

904
01:22:36,805 --> 01:22:38,025
Recording in progress.

905
01:22:38,045 --> 01:22:46,987
Hi, welcome back everybody.

906
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:59,132
Great, Tim, you wanna take over where Alicia left off?

907
01:23:00,593 --> 01:23:01,254
Sounds good.

908
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:05,677
All right, so Dina, should we start with you?

909
01:23:05,697 --> 01:23:07,539
I got you here.

910
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:10,501
There you go.

911
01:23:11,462 --> 01:23:12,683
Thanks, yeah.

912
01:23:13,103 --> 01:23:23,352
Everybody's in favor of the city or the contractor picking up additional items that can't go in the trash or the recycling, right?

913
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,915
light bulbs, batteries, styrofoam.

914
01:23:28,316 --> 01:23:33,221
It would be great to have a single place for all of those drop-off.

915
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:42,050
Again, either the shed model or Jeremy introduced us or me anyway to a new acronym called CHARM, which is a Center for Hard to Recycle Materials.

916
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,534
So if we had a one-stop drop-off for things like that, that'd be great.

917
01:23:48,509 --> 01:24:00,621
A lot of school sports parents support groups or whatever do electronics recycling events as fundraisers, which are great, but they're not widely publicized.

918
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:06,606
So in a minimum, we should be publicizing those more unless the city wants to take on those events too.

919
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:13,073
And then lastly, the participants in our group seem to be willing to pay for

920
01:24:13,933 --> 01:24:21,297
either the charm model or a styrofoam recycling event, whether it's pick up or drop off.

921
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:25,680
But again, the caveat here is always that not everybody is willing or able to pay for that.

922
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,462
And so if they can't pay for it or they won't pay for it, it's just gonna end up in the trash.

923
01:24:30,502 --> 01:24:31,563
And so how do we mitigate that?

924
01:24:40,029 --> 01:24:42,150
Excellent, thank you, Dina.

925
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:47,352
Jacqueline or Lois, who took notes for your group?

926
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:51,773
It was Lois, right?

927
01:24:53,334 --> 01:24:57,235
So Lois, there you go.

928
01:24:58,516 --> 01:25:05,758
We didn't get too far on it, but the theme was, how do you clean out your basement?

929
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,941
So it was the same concern.

930
01:25:12,361 --> 01:25:15,143
What do you do with things that aren't any of the above?

931
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:30,969
And we never got too far in the discussion, but I sense that our group would go along with the same ideas that came up in Dina's group and look for the same solutions.

932
01:25:38,778 --> 01:25:39,098
That's it.

933
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:43,362
Thank you very much, Lois.

934
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:51,489
All right, and I'll just, I think this is it, right, Jeremy?

935
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,050
We're closing it down, right?

936
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:59,475
So I just want to thank everybody, another opportunity to thank everybody for coming tonight, helping out.

937
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:00,816
This is very important.

938
01:26:01,237 --> 01:26:03,799
This is one of the city's biggest contracts, if not the biggest one.

939
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:09,294
that we go into and it's multiple years so we want to get it as right as possible.

940
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:16,680
We're in that phase now where we're preparing all the pieces that go into a request for proposal.

941
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:26,688
So if you have additional feedback that you think about after tonight or you know someone who wants to give feedback, we will take comments right up to about December 6, and then

942
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:33,967
January is the target for the request for proposal, new contract July 23, new services July 24.

943
01:26:34,588 --> 01:26:41,154
So things are a ways away, but we have to do this very early to make sure we have everything done correctly.

944
01:26:43,035 --> 01:26:46,899
I heard lots of excellent information that I know is going to make this project better.

945
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:52,224
And, you know, I think that hopefully

946
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:58,312
folks realize that we're really trying to get as much public input as we can in various ways.

947
01:26:58,732 --> 01:27:00,614
So again, just thank you very much.

948
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:04,799
And if you need to reach out to me personally, you can feel free to do that.

949
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:11,806
And then there's some contact information here as well, ocd.medford-ma.gov for further information.

950
01:27:12,046 --> 01:27:13,608
So have a good night, everybody.

951
01:27:45,662 --> 01:27:46,003
All right.

952
01:27:46,023 --> 01:27:47,186
Good work, everybody.

953
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:52,782
We just get met for community media on there you guys could probably end it when I said goodbye.

954
01:27:52,802 --> 01:27:54,587
As far as your recording goes.

955
01:27:56,994 --> 01:27:59,882
It looks like we've got a vet wanting to come back in recording.
