We have seen a bunch of police here today, but students say they want to see more security in the bathrooms.

What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. I think they shouldn't be held accountable. I think there should be further investigation going on. Reaction from Medford High School students pouring in this afternoon. The day after, school officials say a student was stabbed in a bathroom here. This video showing the incident and what appears to be the knife dropping to the ground in the midst of a fight. Two under arrest, the victim recovering in the hospital.

I feel like the school has to focus more on student safety. There was an increased police presence here today, but students tell us the main problem is in the bathrooms. I can see how it is concerning. If you go to the school, you go to the bathroom, sometimes there's a lot of people in there, so you could get caught up in it, which could be scary, I guess. I think the bathroom situation, more security with the bathrooms and regulations with the students walking around in the hallways, because I think that's where most of the trouble is.

Students apprehensive about the idea of metal detectors, but parents at a school committee meeting last night saying more needs to be done. To let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that. You haven't. What happened to suspensions? What happened to just common sense dignity? It's gone. School committee needs to go. It's just not good enough. Now, luckily, the student who was stabbed is in stable condition this afternoon. We're live in Medford. I'm Peter Eliopoulos WCVB News Center 5.
