1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,590
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen a bunch of police here today, but students say they want to see more security in the bathrooms.

2
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:10,698
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened.

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:13,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they shouldn't be held accountable.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there should be further investigation going on.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Reaction from Medford High School students pouring in this afternoon.

6
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:24,622
[SPEAKER_01]: The day after, school officials say a student was stabbed in a bathroom here.

7
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:30,284
[SPEAKER_01]: This video showing the incident and what appears to be the knife dropping to the ground in the midst of a fight.

8
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Two under arrest, the victim recovering in the hospital.

9
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the school has to focus more on student safety.

10
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:42,553
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an increased police presence here today, but students tell us the main problem is in the bathrooms.

11
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:44,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how it is concerning.

12
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:51,602
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the school, you go to the bathroom, sometimes there's a lot of people in there, so you could get caught up in it, which could be scary, I guess.

13
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:58,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bathroom situation, more security with the bathrooms and regulations with the students walking around in the hallways, because I think that's where most of the trouble is.

14
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:06,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Students apprehensive about the idea of metal detectors, but parents at a school committee meeting last night saying more needs to be done.

15
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:09,517
[SPEAKER_01]: To let the kids know that they're safe, because you haven't done that.

16
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:10,478
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't.

17
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:11,639
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to suspensions?

18
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,061
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to just common sense dignity?

19
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:14,561
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.

20
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,562
[SPEAKER_01]: School committee needs to go.

21
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:18,684
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not good enough.

22
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, luckily, the student who was stabbed is in stable condition this afternoon.

23
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:25,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We're live in Medford.

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Peter Eliopoulos WCVB News Center 5.
