9
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:38,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

10
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you find those records in order and move approval?

11

14
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,730
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

15
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say that for parliamentary purposes, that doesn't count as a motion.

16
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

17
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:04,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job.

[SPEAKER_12]: You got it next time.

21
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:12,281
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Mulane to approve the record seconded by Councilor Leming.

22
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:12,962
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

23
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:13,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

24
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:14,123

[SPEAKER_03]: And the Planning and Purbaning Committee, myself and Councilor Tseng, who did most of the legwork on it, went over a proposed vacant building ordinance, presenting it to other members of the committee as well as city staff.

31
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:55,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We motion to continue it to another regular, another Planning and Purbaning Committee pending more public feedback.

32
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I motion to approve.

00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:01,840

35
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:03,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

36
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

37
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Refer to committee for further discussion.

38

[SPEAKER_05]: 26031 offered by Councilor Callahan.

00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:13,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Resolution to require law enforcement identification and protect fourth amendment rights.

40
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:23,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Be resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Health and Community Safety Committee meet to discuss ordinances, orders, policies, and resolutions to protect residents and secure basic constitutional rights on the following matters.

41
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Law enforcement identification and public trust.

42
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:36,200
[SPEAKER_05]: A law enforcement officer shall not wear a mask or personal disguise while interacting with the public in performance of their duties except for medical masks and as part of gear necessary to protect their faces from harm during the performance of operations.

43
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:38,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourth Amendment protections.

44
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:43,284
[SPEAKER_05]: All Fourth Amendment agencies exercising their authority within the city limits of Medford shall abide by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.

45
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:54,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically, no law enforcement officer shall seize prisons or property without a judicial court-ordered warrant, and no law enforcement officer shall enter a domicile or a privately-owned building without either permission from the property owner or a judicial court-ordered warrant.

46
00:11:55,231 --> 00:12:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first one we've had this session, but this is the refer to committee for further discussion section, so if you want to say,

47
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,621
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 seconds, and then we will move this to committee.

48
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,511
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how we prefer to handle these, because the discussion will happen in committee.

49
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:08,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

50
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:10,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

51
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:17,198
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I have to apologize, because when I sent this in, I really should have, I believe, listed Councilor Tseng as a co-sponsor.

52
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just double check in that you would like to be a co-sponsor.

53
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

54
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,802
[SPEAKER_09]: He was very helpful in this as well.

55
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:27,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, the purpose, I think, will not be a surprise to anyone.

56
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:32,470
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to ensure that our residents feel that their city is protecting them.

57
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:44,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first section on law enforcement identification and public trust is really pulled from some state legislation, and we expect that to become a little bit more full.

58
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:47,753
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll probably have some definitions and other things, but that will be worked out in committee.

59
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:57,175
[SPEAKER_09]: The last, the second section really is simply reiterating our constitutional Fourth Amendment rights, and I look forward to discussing this in committee.

60
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:06,819
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to refer this paper to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Lazzaro.

61
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,640
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

62
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

63
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:08,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

64
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:09,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

65
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:23,453
[SPEAKER_05]: 26032 offered by Councilor Tseng and President Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we meet in Committee of the Whole to discuss the implementation of our new city charter passed at the November 2025 election and now in effect.

66
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:29,558
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular, to review the sections of the new charter affecting the city council and to determine how the charter differs from past and current practice.

67
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:32,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, same quick summary to you.

68
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

69
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:42,067
[SPEAKER_04]: We met late last year with city admin leadership, school committee leadership, and with KP Law to talk about how we implement the new charter.

70
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:54,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Our recommendation at the end of that meeting was that we meet in the committee of the whole to look through the city council parts of the charter, things that would affect the city council, and see what we thought should be affected right now.

71
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:55,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

72
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:01,816
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to refer to Committee of the Whole, seconded by Councilor Callahan, I just want to say one thing.

73
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:07,478
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that changed is appointments, and I'm currently going back and forth with the administration.

74
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:14,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that appointments, basically, if the Council does not object, then appointments are implemented.

75
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,680
[SPEAKER_05]: My interpretation of that is that the

76
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:21,724
[SPEAKER_05]: These should go on our agenda and people should have, councilors should be able to object in session.

77
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:27,328
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration has suggested that they email all of us and none of us email them back, that that counts as an objection.

78
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:33,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to get everything on our next regular meeting agenda that we've received so far.

79
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:36,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can't, I think we have to do that in session.

80
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:41,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by councilor Callahan.

81
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

82
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:43,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

83
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:44,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

84
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearings 26025, petition for grant of location, National Grid.

85
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:53,411
[SPEAKER_05]: North Andover, Massachusetts, petition for a joint-owned pole at 57 Swan Street.

86
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,544
[SPEAKER_05]: National Grid Plan No.

87
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:58,425
[SPEAKER_05]: JO31197488.

88
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:18,644
[SPEAKER_05]: You are hereby notified that by order of the Medford City Council, the City Council hold a public hearing in the Howard F. Alden Chambers at Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hazlett Drive, Medford, and via Zoom on Tuesday, February 3, 2025, at 7 p.m., only to be posted no later than Friday, January 30, 2025, on a petition by Massachusetts electrical company DBA National Grid for permission to install a new joint-owned pole at 57 Swan Street.

89
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:27,335
[SPEAKER_05]: We're for a request that after due notice and hearing is provided by law be granted the location and permission to install a new joint own pole at 57 Swan Street j.o.

90
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:39,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 3 1 1 9 7 4 8 8 originally dated October 30th 2025 and received and filed in the office of the city clerk on December 12th 2025 and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk Medford City Hall room 103.

91
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:42,510
[SPEAKER_05]: 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, MA 02155.

92
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:45,473
[SPEAKER_05]: The following recommendations from the Engineering Division.

93
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:55,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Honorable City Council, the Engineering Division does not recommend the approval of a grant of location request submitted by National Grid for the installation of a new 40-foot joint utility pole at 57 Swan Street.

94
00:15:56,203 --> 00:16:02,245
[SPEAKER_05]: The proposed installation does not appear to serve a clear public need and would introduce additional private infrastructure within the public right-of-way.

95
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:14,769
[SPEAKER_05]: The engineering division has concerns regarding the impact to existing utilities, vehicular accessibility and overall streetscape aesthetics as the installation is intended to support one private service rather than a broader public benefit and is not an appropriate use of a municipal right-of-way.

96
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Accordingly, the engineering division recommends that this not be approved.

97
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,232
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we can hear from the petitioner and then we can hear from the,

98
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:30,591
[SPEAKER_05]: City Engineer, if he has anything, and we can also hear from Councilors, and then we can open the public hearing.

99
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:32,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a petitioner from National Grid.

100
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:40,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being here.

101
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:41,957
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to present on this paper.

102
00:16:53,256 --> 00:17:07,944
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, this job is to install a pole on Swan Street approximately 15 feet away from the existing pole 6724 and approximately 100 feet away from pole 716.

103
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,104
[SPEAKER_17]: The customer at 58 Swan Street.

104
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:22,525
[SPEAKER_17]: has a service with a voltage that does not currently exist anywhere on that street or that area.

105
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:29,568
[SPEAKER_17]: So the new pole is needed to install transformers to give him that voltage.

106
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:33,369
[SPEAKER_17]: And all the existing poles on that street are currently occupied.

107
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the presentation.

108
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions for the petitioner?

109
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:41,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

110
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,794
[SPEAKER_26]: The resident is going to affect this.

111
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:46,431
[SPEAKER_15]: was in front of the area.

112
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,596
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I think we're on.

113
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:10,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to reconvene by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by?

114
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Mullane.

115
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:15,024
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

116
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:16,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

117
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:17,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

118
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:22,289
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm going to go to Owen if he's still with us.

119
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing him now.

120
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:51,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we left off, we had heard from the petitioner about the proposed grant of location.

121
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm recognizing the city engineer.

122
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:08,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and were you able to hear any discussion with the petitioner from National Grid?

123
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,382
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I have nothing to add.

124
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:13,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ultimately your decision anyways.

125
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:25,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and I apologize that I couldn't hear them, but I provided a recommendation to you to not approve this.

126
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:29,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to you all to do what you want to do.

127
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:34,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you provide a little bit more context on to why you made the recommendation?

128
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:49,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that there's enough poles on Swan Street for them to use either their own structures or to provide use on private property, which they haven't done.

129
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:58,341
[SPEAKER_07]: They are going for the less expensive option for using public parcels and having a pole 15 feet away from another pole.

130
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:04,358
[SPEAKER_07]: is not optimal for the businesses that are there or for the private uses.

131
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:06,539
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to come up with a better decision.

132
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

133
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

134
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:15,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have, Councilor Lazzaro.

135
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:26,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Can the petitioner explain to me what is the business and what is the purpose of the transformers and why does it need to be exactly here and why can't it be

136
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:29,056
[SPEAKER_14]: on one of the current poles?

137
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,164
[SPEAKER_17]: The business is a auto shop, so they're gonna have equipment for that.

138
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:47,391
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of the other poles along Swan Street already have equipment, or national grade equipment on them.

139
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:54,237
[SPEAKER_17]: But none of them are the voltage that the business needs for their equipment.

140
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:08,821
[SPEAKER_12]: And just kind of following up on the statement from Owen, what exactly, like what part of it on the private piece of it would it not be able to fit?

141
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:13,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a reason why it can't be more on their property then for the business?

142
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:15,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Why does it have to be more on the public side?

143
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:27,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the pole line is on like the opposite side of the street of

144
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:44,540
[SPEAKER_17]: 58, like the pole line is like along 57 and the business is on 58, so we really couldn't have a pole on the 58 property because the pole line is on the other side.

145
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

146
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:53,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there another way to install this transformer and not on a pole and somehow on their building or on their private property?

147
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:01,929
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

148
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:08,632
[SPEAKER_17]: The cans are all pole-mounted.

149
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:11,553
[SPEAKER_17]: There's really no other way where to put them.

150
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:12,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

151
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:19,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess I'm just, personally, I'm just caught between understandings here.

152
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:27,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like our city engineer believes that there's an option that would have less public impact than what's been proposed.

153
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:31,961
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Vice President Lazzaro.

154
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:39,293
[SPEAKER_14]: We only have the input of our city engineer and the petitioner.

155
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:43,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the business owner here to speak for the, okay.

156
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:50,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll have the public hearing after this, so we'll have to hear from if there's anybody in favor or against it, and that's what we'll have to use to decide.

157
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:54,803
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, usually these are very cut and dry, but this one is a little bit less.

158
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:58,545
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sorry to be like talking this out.

159
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:01,427
[SPEAKER_14]: It's literally never been like this confusing to me before.

160
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:03,128
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all.

161
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:04,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your perspective.

162
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:06,851
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the perspective of the city engineer.

163
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:11,374
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm fine with just going with that.

164
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:14,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Councilor Scarpelli but can I ask one question.

165
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Engineer Wartella, what is the cheaper or what is the option that requires less impact on the public way that isn't being executed here?

166
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:31,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And you indicated that was a more expensive option.

167
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you just explain what that is and why?

168
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:44,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So the way I understand this is that they put structures, their structures, their equipment on the public

169
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,732
[SPEAKER_07]: property public right of way because it's free.

170
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:54,776
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no fee that we charge for a grant of location.

171
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:58,778
[SPEAKER_07]: We just go through a process with approval from you.

172
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:13,087
[SPEAKER_07]: If they decide to put equipment or a pole to feed this service on private property, they would have to pay

173
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: for the use of that private property.

174
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:36,577
[SPEAKER_07]: My only, Swan Street is already riddled with multiple, I think there's like six, maybe seven poles already and putting one 15 foot away without exchanging one that's higher

175
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:39,844
[SPEAKER_07]: because right now they're 30 foot poles.

176
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:44,986
[SPEAKER_07]: They can install 40 foot poles along the way without a grant of location.

177
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,807
[SPEAKER_07]: They just would need to swap it out.

178
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:49,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It would take time because they're all joint owned.

179
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:56,069
[SPEAKER_07]: They could build up higher on the grant of location that was already given to them.

180
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They're choosing not to do that.

181
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:07,633
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to install another structure on the private, on the public way because it is the least expensive option for them.

182
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:09,498
[SPEAKER_07]: in my opinion.

183
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:19,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we were to deny this grant of location then they would have to use an existing pole, replace an existing pole to provide the service.

184
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:30,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah but it's also joint owned so that means it would and you I mean it would be a long time for them to swap out the pole, put in a new pole, put in the thing.

185
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it's it's a process.

186
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:36,711
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I don't know.

187
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:41,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there are other quicker options for them.

188
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:46,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not an expert with, you know, electrical conduits and transformers.

189
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:54,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know that the poles that are right there right now cannot support the transformers due to

190
00:35:55,897 --> 00:36:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: like safety concerns, like you have to have transformers certain away, like they have to be a certain type of pole to hold the equipment that is there for safety reasons.

191
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:12,044
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if they need to add a pole, they could add a pole that is not on public property.

192
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:15,226
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just choosing not to do that.

193
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:19,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

194
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:22,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

195
00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:25,928
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for, like I said, to get more clarity on City Engineer.

196
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:45,981
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, we could go through the process and the table list and then get a better understanding because, you know, I don't think we've got clarity from National Grid and I think that our engineer is giving us a pretty detailed answer that there are options first.

197
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:51,312
[SPEAKER_26]: again that I didn't realize is 115 feet away.

198
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:56,833
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's a piece that I didn't realize in the documents.

199
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:03,135
[SPEAKER_26]: So I wouldn't support it, but I would table it so we can revisit it again once we have a little bit more information.

200
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:08,416
[SPEAKER_26]: And then maybe the business owner can chime in to see if there are alternative locations.

201
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:16,038
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that one option would ask if could you put a ground transformer in, but then again that would create more

202
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:21,658
[SPEAKER_26]: congestion in that 15-foot area that I wouldn't recommend.

203
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:28,123
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, so I would go through and then wait and see what we should do next, Mr. President.

204
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:28,884
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a tough one.

205
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:36,150
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could just go back to the petitioner, what would National Grid do if we did not approve the grant of location?

206
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:44,097
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't think the business wouldn't be able to open

207
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:50,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, again, there's no voltage that supports their equipment in that area.

208
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:54,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So National Grid wouldn't replace an existing pole with one that could hold the transformer?

209
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:57,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, no.

210
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:07,679
[SPEAKER_17]: All of the other poles already have either existing transformers that are different voltages or other equipment like capacitor banks on them.

211
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:12,222
[SPEAKER_17]: So we couldn't add additional transformers to those poles that already have

212
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,663
[SPEAKER_17]: our transformers on them.

213
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: But you couldn't replace one of the existing poles with something, a taller pole, and then put it on that?

214
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:21,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, no.

215
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:30,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if we were to add a taller pole, we wouldn't put an additional transformer on a pole that already has one on it.

216
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:32,096
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

217
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:33,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a capacitor bank.

218
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:36,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't use the existing infrastructure to?

219
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

220
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:39,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with a larger pole or something?

221
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,202
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

222
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

223
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:44,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no other option but putting another pole in?

224
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:45,946
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

225
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:51,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

226
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:56,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, this is a slippery slope when you're talking about the business commuter and the open storefronts.

227
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,976
[SPEAKER_26]: These are things that we're like, there's got to be other options.

228
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:05,621
[SPEAKER_26]: And if our city engineer is telling us that there are options, but they're more expensive, that's why I'm a little confused with the petitioner.

229
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:07,582
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you understand what the engineer is saying?

230
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:19,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Are there other avenues that National Grid can work with the petition, with the business to say, we're not going to put another pole on, but we can support a transformer if it was done this way?

231
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:45,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the poles are already occupied.

232
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:49,349
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a clear practice.

233
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:56,274
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a standard practice with National Grid, one pole for one piece of equipment.

234
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,496
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't matter how tall the pole is.

235
00:39:58,516 --> 00:39:58,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

236
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:02,059
[SPEAKER_26]: So the question is,

237
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:07,426
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think we're going to support it because you're talking about adding a pole 15 feet from another pole.

238
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:09,347
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think it's too congested.

239
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,488
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's been an issue in Medford for a while.

240
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:29,220
[SPEAKER_26]: A city engineer has just stated that there are other avenues that National Grid can work with the business to see if there's other options to put a transformer that would not put a pole 15 feet away, but

241
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:32,654
[SPEAKER_26]: service the customer.

242
00:40:33,054 --> 00:40:35,016
[SPEAKER_26]: If we're wrong, tell us we're wrong.

243
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:39,099
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just listening to the professional that we know that's our engineer.

244
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

245
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:47,886
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I mean, there really isn't another option.

246
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:00,084
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, did you mention the ground transformer?

247
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:03,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that's also like a lot of space that would be.

248
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:05,327
[SPEAKER_26]: Right, that's why it wouldn't work.

249
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:09,449
[SPEAKER_26]: But that's why I'm saying that maybe our engineer has a better idea.

250
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,230
[SPEAKER_26]: He said there's some options, right?

251
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, could a ground transformer be installed on the private property?

252
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:19,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Like off the sidewalk?

253
00:41:20,115 --> 00:41:22,136
[SPEAKER_05]: On the roof of the business, or?

254
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:23,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, those have to be on the ground.

255
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:25,357
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be on the ground?

256
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:26,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, yeah.

257
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:35,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they be in front of the business on their private property, in their lot, something like that?

258
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:48,184
[SPEAKER_17]: It could, but in order to support that, we would have to replace the pole.

259
00:42:00,669 --> 00:42:13,053
[SPEAKER_17]: 6724 in order to run overhead line across the street to their property and then from that pole go to the ground transformer.

260
00:42:13,273 --> 00:42:16,174
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know if there's space for that.

261
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:22,196
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other issue with that is that that existing pole, 6724, has equipment on it from a

262
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:35,168
[SPEAKER_17]: voltage that we no longer carry the parts for.

263
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:57,812
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've talked to the overhead field supervisor about this, and they don't want to touch that pole because if, like while they're transferring the transformer from that pole to the new one and something breaks, the customer that's fed from that would be out of power because we don't, again, we don't carry that.

264
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:01,583
[SPEAKER_17]: service voltage anymore.

265
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:05,184
[SPEAKER_26]: That's confusing.

266
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:09,885
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's an option, but the piece is so old that if it goes down, he's done.

267
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:11,046
[SPEAKER_26]: He'll never have electricity again.

268
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:12,586
[SPEAKER_26]: That's how it was presented.

269
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:13,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

270
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:22,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I mean, the customer would then have to redo their entire service in order to

271
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:26,788
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, honestly, Mr. President, yeah, I'm sorry.

272
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:33,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, and just before we do procedurally, we'll be continuing the public hearing to our date certain of February 24th, but Councilor Lazzaro.

273
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:37,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, that sounds like a National Grid problem to me.

274
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:45,192
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like that would be really expensive for National Grid to fix that person's electricity and then that would be y'all's responsibility.

275
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:54,656
[SPEAKER_14]: And that what I'm hearing is that it would be difficult to do something different for National Grid.

276
00:43:56,056 --> 00:43:58,718
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not impossible.

277
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:04,080
[SPEAKER_14]: And that this is a request for us to give a free thing

278
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:28,733
[SPEAKER_14]: to a private business instead of something that should be housed on private property because the free thing is too much for the public to take on and because the company that is like quasi-public but really not public, it is a utility,

279
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:41,173
[SPEAKER_14]: that sometimes we treat like it's a public organization but is not, may have to replace antiquated equipment, which they probably should be replacing anyway because it sounds dangerous.

280
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,697
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, that illuminates that there are options.

281
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:18,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I am comfortable with following the advice personally of the city engineer because it sounds to me like there are options.

282
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:21,948
[SPEAKER_14]: They may be more expensive for National Grid.

283
00:47:24,757 --> 00:47:28,020
[SPEAKER_14]: the business owner, but I think maybe primarily for National Grid.

284
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,042
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate that.

285
00:47:30,703 --> 00:47:32,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to hear, yeah, no, that's okay.

286
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:39,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hear the petitioner's response, President Perez, because he's got a response to that.

287
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:42,614
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it's a safety issue, I would want to hear that too.

288
00:47:43,475 --> 00:47:44,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for.

289
00:47:46,237 --> 00:47:46,618
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

290
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,833
[SPEAKER_17]: So it wouldn't solely be on National Grid.

291
00:47:54,473 --> 00:48:10,022
[SPEAKER_17]: As I mentioned, that customer at 35 Swan Street that has that outdated service, they would have to pay to redo all of their equipment.

292
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:11,663
[SPEAKER_17]: That wouldn't be us.

293
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:19,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have the name of the business.

294
00:48:21,395 --> 00:48:23,037
[SPEAKER_05]: At 35 at 57.

295
00:48:29,582 --> 00:48:32,044
[SPEAKER_17]: JNC Realty Corp.

296
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:34,746
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

297
00:48:37,857 --> 00:48:43,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my only other question is, how many outdated services, like what's that 35 SWAN are in the city?

298
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is your plan to address that if you're no longer providing electricity to that service?

299
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what if the transformer breaks tomorrow, what will happen?

300
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:58,907
[SPEAKER_17]: There aren't many.

301
00:48:58,927 --> 00:49:04,949
[SPEAKER_17]: We just don't touch them until the customer

302
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:13,730
[SPEAKER_17]: either cancel their service and has it canceled, and then we take it down.

303
00:49:16,812 --> 00:49:23,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Or if they want to pay to have everything upgraded, then we'll do that.

304
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:29,782
[SPEAKER_17]: But for now, until something goes wrong, we won't really touch it.

305
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:39,805
[SPEAKER_17]: until either, again, they cancel it or they request to have it upgraded and they upgrade all of their equipment on their side also.

306
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:45,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think at the very least we're gonna, sounds like we wanna continue this for a few weeks.

307
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it seems like it's the preference of this council that an alternative be developed.

308
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:51,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that fair?

309
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:53,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

310
00:49:54,836 --> 00:49:54,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

311
00:49:56,031 --> 00:50:06,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's possible, but maybe in consultation with the business owners and the property owners in the area, you might be able to go back to them and see if something else could be figured out.

312
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that that's okay.

313
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:13,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I do actually have to open the public hearing before we close it.

314
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:14,884
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything you want to say before I do that.

315
00:50:17,486 --> 00:50:17,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

316
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:19,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm opening the public hearing.

317
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:26,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone who'd like to speak in favor or in opposition or otherwise to this grant of location?

318
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing National Grid is in favor.

319
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:31,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

320
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:31,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

321
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:32,114
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

322
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:33,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like we have someone else who'd like to speak.

323
00:50:36,257 --> 00:50:39,639
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's Mikey Hessman, 499 Main Street.

324
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:50,367
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't totally understand why the cost of replacement would be on the customer for

325
00:50:51,774 --> 00:50:54,975
[SPEAKER_22]: National Grid upgrading the transformer to a standard voltage?

326
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Or why would it be super extensive?

327
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:04,739
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't expect you to necessarily have an answer to that, but that's something I think that should be looked at.

328
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:19,945
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, I just want to point out that National Grid is posting record revenue growth this quarter alone every year, and we can't really do a whole lot to engage

329
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:35,172
[SPEAKER_22]: with utility companies, but this kind of permitting stuff is the meager way that the city can actually engage and try and get utility companies to work with cities in a reasonable fashion.

330
00:51:35,413 --> 00:51:37,014
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's something to keep in mind.

331
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:39,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

332
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anyone who would like to speak as part of this public hearing?

333
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:49,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to continue this public hearing to February 24th, seconded by?

334
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:51,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Malauulu.

335
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,252

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

350
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:11,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the affirmative.

351
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:12,027
[SPEAKER_05]: None the negative.

352
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:12,708
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

353
00:52:12,748 --> 00:52:13,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

354
00:52:14,782 --> 00:52:20,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 26030, petition for a common victualer's license, Lighthouse Cafe.

355
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:36,414
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Royal King Corporation, DBA, the Lighthouse Cafe, who has presented a common victualer's license here, and we do have that they have received all of their necessary documentation.

356
00:52:36,975 --> 00:52:41,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a representative from Lighthouse Cafe here in person or on Zoom?

357
00:52:44,652 --> 00:52:46,473
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're here in person, please come to the podium.

358
00:52:46,594 --> 00:52:49,356
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're on Zoom, please raise your hand on Zoom.

359
00:52:49,376 --> 00:53:01,785
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm not seeing a representative from Lighthouse Cafe here.

360
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:02,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

361
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:07,929
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to table by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

362
00:53:08,149 --> 00:53:09,010
[SPEAKER_05]: To the next regular meeting.

363
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:14,784
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, motion to table the next regular meeting by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

364
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:15,725
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

365
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:17,347
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

366
00:53:18,388 --> 00:53:19,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, Vice President Lazzaro.

367
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:21,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I called Kit Councilor the whole time, too.

368
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:24,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nicole called me Councilor.

369
00:53:26,398 --> 00:53:27,058
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

370
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,419

371
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:29,499

373
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:39,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We have location, 49 High Street, Medford, MA.

374
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:41,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like we have all the paperwork in order.

375
00:53:41,704 --> 00:53:43,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a representative from Placida, Mexico?

376
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:45,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like we do, great.

377
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:52,389
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give a short presentation on your business and then I'll turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli once you've made your presentation.

378
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:57,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, so we're just looking to open our third location of Placita Mexico Tacos.

379
00:53:57,656 --> 00:54:00,456
[SPEAKER_10]: We're currently in Wakefield and in Watertown.

380
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:07,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a small Mexican restaurant, mostly takeout.

381
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Wakefield is 100% takeout.

382
00:54:10,738 --> 00:54:14,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Watertown has some seats, and this is sort of in the middle with about six to eight seats in it.

383
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:20,020
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, you know, homemade tortillas, very authentic, fresh, everything cooked, fresh ingredients.

384
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,200
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else you want to know.

385
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:23,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

386
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:24,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

387
00:54:25,806 --> 00:54:26,786
[SPEAKER_26]: I see everything in order.

388
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:29,346
[SPEAKER_26]: How many employees will be working?

389
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:35,948
[SPEAKER_10]: To start, usually about three people in the kitchen and one cashier in the front.

390
00:54:36,308 --> 00:54:37,268
[SPEAKER_26]: I see everything in order.

391
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:41,609
[SPEAKER_26]: There's nothing that stands out, Mr. President.

392
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:42,529
[SPEAKER_26]: I move forward for approval.

393
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

394
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:44,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

395
00:54:46,807 --> 00:54:48,347
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your vegetarian options like?

396
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:56,269
[SPEAKER_10]: We just today added a vegetarian tamale, but we have vegetable options on everything except the birria tacos.

397
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:57,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything else has a vegetarian option.

398
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:58,530
Cool.

399
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:58,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

400
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

401
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:05,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for going through the process, opening a business here in Medford.

402
00:55:06,072 --> 00:55:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: We're excited to have you in the square.

403
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:13,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Malayne.

404
00:55:15,654 --> 00:55:16,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

405
00:55:20,328 --> 00:55:20,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kelly?

406
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:21,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

407
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:23,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming?

408
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:23,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

409
00:55:25,211 --> 00:55:25,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Malauulu?

410
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:25,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

411
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

412
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:28,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

413
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:30,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng?

414
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:30,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

415
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:32,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Lazzaro?

416
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:32,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

417
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears?

418
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:34,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

419
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the affirmative, none in the negative.

420
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:36,598
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

421
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:37,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

422
00:55:37,158 --> 00:55:37,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

423
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

424
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 26024 offered by President Bears.

425
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:45,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I really should have put this in refer to committee.

426
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:47,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's on me.

427
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:51,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Resolution to schedule neighborhood ward meetings hosted by the City Council.

428
00:55:52,129 --> 00:56:00,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Council's Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee discuss a plan to schedule neighborhood ward meetings hosted by the City Council in 2026 and 2027.

429
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty self-explanatory.

430
00:56:04,182 --> 00:56:05,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck, Councilor Millane.

431
00:56:06,144 --> 00:56:09,128
[SPEAKER_05]: As the Chair, I will recognize you and then Councilor Tseng.

432
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for putting this forward.

433
00:56:12,487 --> 00:56:22,889
[SPEAKER_12]: This is definitely one of the things that the committee is very interested in doing and making sure that we're getting out in front of as many different community members as we can.

434
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:33,472
[SPEAKER_12]: So really looking forward to the conversations and setting these up and meeting with people and hopefully other people will want to join and help us to do this to get the word out.

435
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:39,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Tuesday, February 10th at 7 p.m.

436
00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:40,274
[SPEAKER_12]: is our first meeting.

437
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:43,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully others will join us to have this conversation.

438
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:44,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

439
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:47,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Malauulu and Councilor Tseng.

440
00:56:47,717 --> 00:56:50,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears for putting this on the agenda.

441
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:53,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm personally very excited for this idea.

442
00:56:54,597 --> 00:57:07,662
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a few years ago, something I said and something a lot of other councilors said was that we wanted to bring City Hall to the people and not expect that, you know, if you want something done in Medford, you have to come to City Hall.

443
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:11,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's a long way to go on that, for sure.

444
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:25,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm proud that over the last few years, the council has laid the groundwork for neighborhood meetings by having the listening sessions that we've been having at the senior center and with different stakeholder communities around Medford.

445
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:49,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we've gotten more practice with it, I think we've gotten even more eager and excited to get out there into the community and listen to voices who don't get heard, who don't have that chance to come to City Hall, who can't take that time out of their busy workdays or evenings to come here and feel like they've been heard.

446
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:54,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really important and incumbent upon us and our responsibility to go out there

447
00:57:55,554 --> 00:58:10,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially with so many big projects coming up, just getting the chance to listen to people and hear different perspectives, which oftentimes are different to what normal people think, you'd expect to hear from the public.

448
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a real exciting array of ideas, and sometimes the best ideas that we get on the city council come from them as well.

449
00:58:18,488 --> 00:58:24,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for this resolution, Mr. President, and thank you for your leadership, Councilor Milley.

450
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:26,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

451
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:27,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

452
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:28,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

453
00:58:28,856 --> 00:58:31,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to really echo a lot of what Councilor Tseng just said.

454
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:48,587
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in any city, as well as state and national districts, the truth is that really only about 5% or less of our city, or really of anywhere,

455
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:52,948
[SPEAKER_09]: will ever reach out to their elected officials and show up in City Hall.

456
00:58:53,329 --> 00:59:00,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to make sure that we're representing everyone and not just those people who happen to, you know, make it a part of their habit to show up here.

457
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:06,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Going into the community to where people already are rather than making them come to us is really, really important.

458
00:59:07,374 --> 00:59:08,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very excited about this.

459
00:59:08,554 --> 00:59:10,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate your leadership, President Bears.

460
00:59:11,235 --> 00:59:20,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also very happy that we've been doing these over the last couple of years and I've learned some things, so I look forward very much to approaching them in committee and making them as successful as possible.

461
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:21,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

462
00:59:22,404 --> 00:59:26,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan, and I'm really glad that we're moving forward on this.

463
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:29,770
[SPEAKER_05]: As Councilor Scarpelli noted, I'm really trying to

464
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:39,440
[SPEAKER_05]: work collectively, talk to all of the voices, you know, even across our disagreements and our differences, right?

465
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:52,430
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can communicate with each other, if we can be open, if we can be honest, if the answer is how do we get to yes, or explain why, or, you know, what are the decisions that we're making as a city and how can we talk about them together?

466
00:59:52,471 --> 00:59:54,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a really important thing.

467
00:59:55,673 --> 01:00:00,438
[SPEAKER_05]: for all of us to do, and I think we've all tried to do that in different ways, and this is another way to do that even more.

468
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:01,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

469
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:07,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like we have some public participation on this paper, so I'll go to the podium.

470
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:10,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

471
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,611
[SPEAKER_20]: Nick Jarleo, Forty Robinson Road.

472
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:19,613
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think definitely with our new city charter we're going to have to rethink how we do politics in Medford.

473
01:00:19,633 --> 01:00:26,036
[SPEAKER_20]: I think everybody agrees on that and I do agree with kind of this ward centric way of looking at it.

474
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:34,399
[SPEAKER_20]: My only reservation with the system that seems to be proposed here is this idea of the council kind of organizing it and running it.

475
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:41,182
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually would disagree with that and I think this should be run independently from residents otherwise I think

476
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:51,992
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're probably going to see is the council becoming or these meetings essentially becoming an extension of city council meetings which I don't think would be the most productive for our neighbors.

477
01:00:52,073 --> 01:00:56,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I think ultimately residents should really be kind of driving them as opposed to elected officials.

478
01:00:57,414 --> 01:00:59,794
[SPEAKER_20]: So hopefully I see it's getting referred to committee here.

479
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:02,315
[SPEAKER_20]: Hopefully there can be some discussion and debate about that.

480
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:06,658
[SPEAKER_20]: the extent to which these will be independent versus kind of extensions of the council.

481
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:13,239
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think if that ultimately isn't an option for independent meetings, I would suggest residents to start their own.

482
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:14,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

483
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

484
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:21,501
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

485
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:24,942
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's nothing further on the motion by Councilor Malauulu.

486
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:25,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, go ahead.

487
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:27,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address so I can give you three minutes.

488
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:28,962
[SPEAKER_22]: Mike Acosta, 1499 Main Street.

489
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:30,563
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to give sort of like a counter

490
01:01:32,536 --> 01:01:33,497
[SPEAKER_22]: view to what was just proposed.

491
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,180
[SPEAKER_22]: Residents can already start their own ward meetings.

492
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:49,247
[SPEAKER_22]: This can be done, and I think that's great if residents want to independently start regular ward meetings, which is something I was looking into before I saw this come on the agenda.

493
01:01:51,740 --> 01:02:06,839
[SPEAKER_22]: But I 100% like there should be an extension of the city council having an active presence in individual wards and showing that they're engaged with wards and the residents of those wards from the actual city council and from the city government in general.

494
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:20,825
[SPEAKER_22]: So what I would actually suggest is that I do hope that should you do these board meetings, however they're set up, hopefully you have them at locations in the wards, preferably at like maybe businesses in the wards too could host them.

495
01:02:20,845 --> 01:02:21,847
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be really dope.

496
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:26,192
[SPEAKER_22]: And also you make sure to have like city

497
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:46,107
[SPEAKER_22]: and other city officials come into each and every single one of those meetings, maybe not the same one, but have the city presence there so that the residents can directly address them and everything, because most residents don't care enough to come to this meeting, which is understandable, but they might come to that one.

498
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:47,328
[SPEAKER_22]: So, thanks.

499
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

500
01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:52,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have someone on Zoom, Robert Carney.

501
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:56,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, name and address for the record, please and you'll have 3 minutes.

502
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:01,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert Carney, 56 unit 6.

503
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:07,795
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just have to be honest, I'm echoing Nick G's points.

504
01:03:09,457 --> 01:03:15,923
[SPEAKER_06]: With this council-led initiative, under present circumstances, I'm just skeptical of how much these meetings are going to accomplish.

505
01:03:16,664 --> 01:03:23,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate this desire to engage deeper with residents, and I've had firsthand experience emailing.

506
01:03:23,989 --> 01:03:32,297
[SPEAKER_06]: in conversing with city councillors on issues of interest, some of which led to a pleasing response from the council as a whole.

507
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:41,406
[SPEAKER_06]: However, with the exception of George Scarpelli, I honestly question whether all the city councillors truly want to engage with residents of the community on all issues.

508
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:49,653
[SPEAKER_06]: More specifically, I'm concerned about how the majority affiliation with our revolution may limit open dialogue in diverse neighborhoods.

509
01:03:50,693 --> 01:04:00,357
[SPEAKER_06]: When elected officials are part of a specific policy platform, it raises questions for me about their ability to remain fully responsive to constituent input.

510
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:05,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help but question statements from councillors that say we want to represent anyone.

511
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:12,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a way for an Our Revolution councillor to respond to residents who may disagree with parts of the People's Platform?

512
01:04:13,192 --> 01:04:19,240
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, the Our Revolution endorsement process requires agreement to the entirety of the People's Platform.

513
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:29,789
[SPEAKER_06]: a detailed evolving document that establishes positions on everything from code enforcement officers to emergency response and extends into state and national issues.

514
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:39,017
[SPEAKER_06]: This means Councilors endorsed by our revolution have already committed to positions on issues like whether they think proposition two and a half

515
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he's good or not, there's something about that on the website.

516
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:49,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Restorative justice in schools, whether that should be favored or not, and rent stabilization before hearing from constituents.

517
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,062
[SPEAKER_06]: What concerns me most is the structural limitation this creates for constituent engagement.

518
01:04:55,622 --> 01:05:02,789
[SPEAKER_06]: If a councillor has pre-committed to a platform position, meaningful dialogue with residents who hold different views becomes difficult.

519
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:13,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, residents cannot contribute to or vote on the People's Platform unless they're already OR members who have agreed to the existing platform, creating a closed feedback loop.

520
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:20,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect that councillors have sincere convictions and that many residents share these values.

521
01:05:20,643 --> 01:05:32,348
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if the councillors want to see more meaningful engagement in the wards, I believe they should critically examine how organizational commitments may be perceived as barriers to open constituent dialogue.

522
01:05:32,908 --> 01:05:43,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Greater independence from any exclusive political structure would make these ward meetings more effective in my opinion, and I would feel more comfortable raising my ideas in a more independent format.

523
01:05:43,293 --> 01:05:43,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

524
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:46,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your comment.

525
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:49,523
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one more comment on Zoom.

526
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:54,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Muneer Jermanis, name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

527
01:06:00,433 --> 01:06:04,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Muneer Jermanis at 3 Summit Road.

528
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:12,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in full support of the elected members of this council.

529
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:28,184
[SPEAKER_01]: We elected you not because you are part of any organization, but because we support the values that you are supporting, and we give you full authority to act on our behalf.

530
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:29,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

531
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:32,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

532
01:06:33,686 --> 01:06:37,807
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, you have one minute.

533
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:41,909
[SPEAKER_22]: Michael Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

534
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:43,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Really quick, there's one reminder.

535
01:06:44,412 --> 01:07:02,653
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't ask for the city government and city electeds to have a close relationship to the wards and residents in the city, but then get suspicious and skeptical and pissy at them for trying to have a public, transparent, official way of directly engaging closer to the residents and

536
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:05,695
[SPEAKER_22]: and residents in the wards.

537
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:10,217
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, have your cake or eat it, right?

538
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:10,577
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

539
01:07:11,597 --> 01:07:15,638
[SPEAKER_22]: Just want to remind people of that and to like think about this a little bit rationally and less reactively.

540
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:16,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

541
01:07:19,819 --> 01:07:21,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your comment.

542
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

543
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,680
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion.

544
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,421
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

545
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:24,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

546
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:25,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

547
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:26,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

548
01:07:26,761 --> 01:07:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

549
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:33,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions is to refer to Resident Services and Public Inventory by Councilor Millan, seconded by?

550
01:07:34,545 --> 01:07:35,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you seconded it.

551
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:36,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

552
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:37,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe so.

553
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:39,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember.

554
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:41,410
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

555
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,471
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two motions on ambulance.

556
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:44,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to join them?

557
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:52,237
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to join papers 26026 and 26027, seconded by Councilor Leming.

558
01:07:52,297 --> 01:07:52,978
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

559
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:54,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

560
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:55,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

561
01:07:56,629 --> 01:08:01,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read 26026 and then 26027, and we'll just call this a co-sponsorship.

562
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:25,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the City of Medford has entered into a new ambulance service contract representing significant change in public safety service delivery, and whereas the City Council held meetings on January 6th and January 13th to discuss the transition and submit a number of questions to the Mayoral Administration, and whereas the City Council has not yet received a response from the Mayoral Administration to these questions and has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure taxpayer funds are used efficiently and public safety standards are maintained,

563
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:33,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Now therefore be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request answers to the questions submitted by the administration by the City Council on January 13th.

564
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:41,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the City Council request copies of any and all communications sent by the city or received from Armstrong Ambulance regarding the termination of the contract.

565
01:08:42,646 --> 01:08:45,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have here, this is the second one.

566
01:08:46,236 --> 01:08:50,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the City of Medford recently transitioned emergency ambulance services to Cataldo Ambulance.

567
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:56,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas emergency medical services are a core public safety function directly impacting resident health, safety, and response times.

568
01:08:57,362 --> 01:09:03,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas the prior proposals for ambulance services included differing levels of transporting resources, supervisory capabilities, and staffing models.

569
01:09:03,865 --> 01:09:09,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas questions have arisen regarding the reduction or modification of transporting supervisory services.

570
01:09:10,588 --> 01:09:23,463
[SPEAKER_05]: The use of Medford ambulances for mutual aid outside the city, the location and staffing of the behavioral health ambulance, training requirements for personnel assigned to Medford, the frequency of quarry background checks, and the availability and review of the full executed ambulance contract.

571
01:09:24,064 --> 01:09:27,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas the city council has a duty to ensure the transparency and accountability.

572
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:29,390
[SPEAKER_05]: One second.

573
01:09:31,972 --> 01:09:34,233
[SPEAKER_05]: and consistent standards in public safety contracting.

574
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:47,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Now therefore be it resolved that the Medford City Council formally request the administration provide written clarification and documentation regarding, one, whether and under what circumstances ambulances may be deployed for mutual aid outside the city under the Cataldo contract.

575
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:57,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, the operational differences between previously proposed transporting supervisor ambulances and the current non-transporting supervisory model, including the impact on transport capacity.

576
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:05,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, the physical stationing location of the behavioral health ambulance and the mandatory training requirements, including PAL or equivalent for personnel assigned to Medford.

577
01:10:06,754 --> 01:10:11,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Four, the frequency and contractual requirements for Corey background checks for Cataldo employees assigned to Medford.

578
01:10:12,357 --> 01:10:16,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And five, a full copy of the executed ambulances services contract with Cataldo Ambulance Service, Inc.

579
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:32,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that this information be provided to the city council in advance of any further deliberation regarding ambulance operations, performance metrics, or contract amendments, be it further resolved that the city council call for a committee of the whole meeting with city and public safety leadership team to review information requested.

580
01:10:33,207 --> 01:10:34,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will note we

581
01:10:34,832 --> 01:10:38,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it today or late yesterday received the Cataldo contract?

582
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:38,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It was today.

583
01:10:38,674 --> 01:10:44,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe we also received an email from Armstrong Ambulance, which I can read into the record.

584
01:10:46,378 --> 01:10:48,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, but at some point about.

585
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:49,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

586
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

587
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

588
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:53,721
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

589
01:10:53,821 --> 01:11:00,925
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, I, I've been listening to talking to residents and it's, it seems like, um,

590
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:11,292
[SPEAKER_26]: There's varying issues and varying thoughts of this, saying that this is the mayor's control and why is the council getting involved.

591
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:20,881
[SPEAKER_26]: We sent the mayor these questions that were concerning, and to Chief Evans and Mayor Lungo,

592
01:11:22,108 --> 01:11:27,894
[SPEAKER_26]: sending over a connection with Rob White from Cataldo to help answer these questions.

593
01:11:28,335 --> 01:11:29,136
[SPEAKER_26]: That was very helpful.

594
01:11:29,156 --> 01:11:30,157
[SPEAKER_26]: We had about a half hour.

595
01:11:30,477 --> 01:11:31,859
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish we had a little bit longer.

596
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:37,105
[SPEAKER_26]: And as I told Rob, Mr. White, as we talked today from Cataldo, he says one of the biggest

597
01:11:37,985 --> 01:11:49,290
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the things he wants to make sure we eliminate is any fear-mongering, because he's afraid, what was shared with him through administration is some sort of fear-mongering going on with this council.

598
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:59,255
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just want people to realize that the key for this, and as I told Cataldo's representatives, this isn't personal with Cataldo.

599
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:16,275
[SPEAKER_26]: This is truly what we're seeing contractually and us as a city council making sure that our leaders are making decisions, whether it's for the safety and health and well-being of the community or financially or so many other avenues.

600
01:12:16,335 --> 01:12:27,480
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think that I want everybody personally to understand that, and I told Mr. White I would say this, that we are not in any danger

601
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,885
[SPEAKER_26]: because Cataldo is our ambulance service.

602
01:12:31,606 --> 01:12:40,621
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's something that was expressed in a way possibly with questions that were brought up that might have set a separate dialogue.

603
01:12:40,641 --> 01:12:41,923
[SPEAKER_26]: So I want to make sure we're clear with that.

604
01:12:42,869 --> 01:12:56,592
[SPEAKER_26]: But we had a very deep conversation, and unfortunately, I talked to the representative from Cataldo before I received the contract from the mayor's office.

605
01:12:58,513 --> 01:13:11,976
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been working very closely with emergency response specialists that have shared their input where it's not one side or the other, just having me understand

606
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,132
[SPEAKER_26]: what the process is when it comes to contracts.

607
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:29,806
[SPEAKER_26]: And as we look forward, and I'll go over some notes real quick so I can share this with you, is that I found this bothersome because we still, I think what everybody asked in multiple meetings is the simple question, why?

608
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:33,069
[SPEAKER_26]: And we didn't get the answers why.

609
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:38,714
[SPEAKER_26]: And when you talk to people, whether they want to believe it or not tell the truth,

610
01:13:39,463 --> 01:13:46,747
[SPEAKER_26]: the dialogue that's saying that everybody was in agreement that's decision makers and they have to live with that.

611
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:59,873
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the dialogue that the mayor put out publicly that Councilor Scarpelli, she can't make a decision because I'm friends with Armstrong.

612
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:06,517
[SPEAKER_26]: So the point that I tried to make and the reason why I took ownership to was belittled to the fact that

613
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:15,877
[SPEAKER_26]: My energy wasn't behind what I lived with personally with my mother, but more the fact that this was a dialogue out of friendship.

614
01:14:16,978 --> 01:14:24,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Just to be clear with everybody, I didn't meet the CFO from Armstrong Ambulance until this process came forward.

615
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,240
[SPEAKER_26]: I want everybody to understand that.

616
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:33,262
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a relationship with one of their employees that happened to be, I was a soccer coach in high school.

617
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:36,543
[SPEAKER_26]: Has nothing to do in any other aspect.

618
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:43,682
[SPEAKER_26]: So as we talked to Cataldo today, there was some glaring questions that I had.

619
01:14:44,463 --> 01:14:59,248
[SPEAKER_26]: And we talked about Armstrong and understanding the supervisor's role, what's being offered apples to apples for coverages, and is there a huge difference between Armstrong and Cataldo?

620
01:14:59,268 --> 01:15:00,068
[SPEAKER_26]: Was that the reason?

621
01:15:00,548 --> 01:15:02,489
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'll show you that it really wasn't.

622
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:25,990
[SPEAKER_26]: The discussion with mutual aid and understanding mutual aid and still having meetings to help us understand mutual aid because what we heard from, I believe, the supervisor from 911, the biggest issue we had was the mutual aid that was going to Arlington.

623
01:15:26,991 --> 01:15:33,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong came and explained that 98% of the ambulance service, they never use mutual aid.

624
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,982
[SPEAKER_26]: conversations I had with Cataldo.

625
01:15:36,362 --> 01:15:39,105
[SPEAKER_26]: They explained to me the mutual aid is done differently.

626
01:15:39,765 --> 01:15:47,693
[SPEAKER_26]: And he explained that while they've been here already, they've used, I believe, 34 mutual aid calls that they had to share.

627
01:15:47,713 --> 01:15:50,215
[SPEAKER_26]: And I said, so we're taking mutual aid from Somerville.

628
01:15:50,856 --> 01:15:55,320
[SPEAKER_26]: I was curious because they said we take from Malden, Everett to Somerville because that's their partners.

629
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,821
[SPEAKER_26]: That's their communities as well.

630
01:15:57,281 --> 01:15:59,664
[SPEAKER_26]: And he said, no, he said they're on the line.

631
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:03,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, I wish I could get more into that, but I understand what that meant.

632
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:09,153
[SPEAKER_26]: Does that mean if it's on the line and that person, that ambulance has to go to a separate part of the city?

633
01:16:09,453 --> 01:16:10,754
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't understand that still.

634
01:16:11,394 --> 01:16:15,955
[SPEAKER_26]: So then the questions about response time.

635
01:16:16,436 --> 01:16:22,658
[SPEAKER_26]: It was great to hear that Cataldo told us that their response time is 3 minutes and 10 seconds so far.

636
01:16:23,398 --> 01:16:29,139
[SPEAKER_26]: which is really good, but it'll be interesting to see as we move forward and how this process goes.

637
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,681
[SPEAKER_26]: Believe me, I've learned so much how to measure response time.

638
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:42,403
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it out of the chute, that's a phrase that's used in this profession, that when does this clock start when they start creating data?

639
01:16:43,238 --> 01:16:48,685
[SPEAKER_26]: And you hear what Armstrong said, you hear what Cataldo said today, and both sound very good.

640
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:55,734
[SPEAKER_26]: But ultimately, as a Councilor, I want to go to the state authority that tracks that in the future.

641
01:16:55,774 --> 01:16:59,959
[SPEAKER_26]: So we know what what really what what those numbers really are.

642
01:17:00,633 --> 01:17:07,001
[SPEAKER_26]: I look at Cataldo and ask about housing their ambulances.

643
01:17:07,641 --> 01:17:09,283
[SPEAKER_26]: And that was one of the issues we asked the mayor.

644
01:17:09,303 --> 01:17:10,805
[SPEAKER_26]: We said, are we ready?

645
01:17:10,845 --> 01:17:13,929
[SPEAKER_26]: We asked our chiefs, are we ready for this transition?

646
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:14,830
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely.

647
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:20,717
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I shared with Cataldo and the mayor that I've been getting phone calls from private

648
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:26,315
[SPEAKER_26]: private businesses that said, why is Cataldo Ambulance parked in our lot?

649
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:27,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Why are they running?

650
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:28,779
[SPEAKER_26]: And I said to them, it's trivial.

651
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:31,302
[SPEAKER_26]: I said, are you having a rush?

652
01:17:31,903 --> 01:17:35,729
[SPEAKER_26]: And they were like, no, but we don't know why it's happening.

653
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:36,630
[SPEAKER_26]: We need clarification.

654
01:17:38,468 --> 01:17:40,330
[SPEAKER_26]: I guess that has to be clarified.

655
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:46,576
[SPEAKER_26]: Then we talked about, I asked our representative from El Salvador, I said, where are we being housed?

656
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:54,183
[SPEAKER_26]: And he said it was a shock that it really got his feet knocked out from under him because he assumed he was going to go into our fire stations.

657
01:17:54,203 --> 01:18:02,211
[SPEAKER_26]: And they've been trying super hard to find locations, but through the building department, they, locations haven't been cleared.

658
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:07,431
[SPEAKER_26]: to be capable to have ambulances in those locations.

659
01:18:07,471 --> 01:18:11,201
[SPEAKER_26]: So they did share, they have a three-person bay in Middlesex Ave.

660
01:18:11,893 --> 01:18:17,977
[SPEAKER_26]: And then they have, they're looking at a spot somewhere on Mystic Ave closer.

661
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:25,662
[SPEAKER_26]: The issues that I still have is as I talk to my, the professionals, they talk about response time and what's mandated.

662
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:33,948
[SPEAKER_26]: Hence one of the reasons why having our headquarters right in that area, it suits response time all over the city.

663
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:37,050
[SPEAKER_26]: And understanding, do we have a proper response time?

664
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:38,451
[SPEAKER_26]: The professionals shared,

665
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:40,191
[SPEAKER_26]: Can they get to the Heights?

666
01:18:40,711 --> 01:18:41,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Can they get to West Medford?

667
01:18:42,112 --> 01:18:42,852
[SPEAKER_26]: And what does that mean?

668
01:18:42,912 --> 01:18:46,933
[SPEAKER_26]: That means you would probably have to leave a running ambulance in those locations 24-7.

669
01:18:47,153 --> 01:19:07,158
[SPEAKER_26]: The other questions that were brought up that you looked at the union issue and say, well, Armstrong stated that if we have something that they don't have coverage, that their ambulance can't go out of service because by their union rules, they have to cover the position.

670
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:11,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong said, we cover it anyway.

671
01:19:11,536 --> 01:19:12,357
[SPEAKER_26]: That's their rule.

672
01:19:12,897 --> 01:19:15,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Be secure that they said that they're all set.

673
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:17,099
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't have to worry about it.

674
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:22,881
[SPEAKER_26]: As a matter of fact, I believe Mr. White said that he had an issue with an employee that was running late.

675
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:27,203
[SPEAKER_26]: He actually went and sat in an ambulance during the snowstorm.

676
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:31,885
[SPEAKER_26]: So they've given me some good input, but

677
01:19:32,925 --> 01:19:34,286
[SPEAKER_26]: There are still a lot of concerns.

678
01:19:34,346 --> 01:19:36,688
[SPEAKER_26]: We talked about the PALS program that was brought up.

679
01:19:37,068 --> 01:19:40,810
[SPEAKER_26]: The PALS program is a pediatric advanced life support care.

680
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:46,014
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a certification, and Cataldo's response was, it's not mandated by the state.

681
01:19:48,135 --> 01:19:53,199
[SPEAKER_26]: The perception that I got from Armstrong was, this is a higher level of care for pediatric care.

682
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:59,143
[SPEAKER_26]: When I asked the mutual party, and does it make a difference, the question is,

683
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:08,957
[SPEAKER_26]: The CATALDO representatives are certified to take care of pediatric care, but that certification is higher.

684
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,098
[SPEAKER_26]: It is a higher standard.

685
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:28,168
[SPEAKER_26]: We talked about, you know, different, the EMDs that were a big issue and who was going to, you know, the question was the EMD was a grant that the chief has to apply for,

686
01:20:29,018 --> 01:20:38,228
[SPEAKER_26]: through the 9-1-1 grant and then because Armstrong or the ambulance company that services Medford, they would get that money.

687
01:20:38,508 --> 01:20:40,671
[SPEAKER_26]: The grant wouldn't go to City of Medford, get that money.

688
01:20:41,351 --> 01:20:44,675
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong said they don't take that money.

689
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,438
[SPEAKER_26]: Cataldo said they won't take that money.

690
01:20:49,140 --> 01:21:02,076
[SPEAKER_26]: You're learning so much, but at the same time, then the question started coming about, okay, so let's look at the, so still questioning, okay, let's look at apples to apples when it comes to the contract.

691
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:04,939
[SPEAKER_26]: It was broken down very simply.

692
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:17,874
[SPEAKER_26]: Everything in the contract, in all the areas all the way to K, when you get to L, they talk about Armstrong Ambulance has agreed to do this.

693
01:21:18,354 --> 01:21:29,057
[SPEAKER_26]: When it comes to the behavior bus, now, that was one of the biggest things the mayor put forward to the public, saying, we have a mental health behavior bus, that we're going to have this, correct or not?

694
01:21:29,137 --> 01:21:30,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Was that not stressed that way?

695
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:33,718
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, there is no behavior bus.

696
01:21:34,018 --> 01:21:35,319
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't have a behavior bus.

697
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:37,220
[SPEAKER_26]: The behavior bus is in Lynn.

698
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:51,227
[SPEAKER_26]: And what the representative Cataldo told us, they are now in conversations with the chief of police to start the grant to process that apparatus in the future, hopefully.

699
01:21:51,527 --> 01:21:57,290
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you read the contract, it's very vague in how it's worded and the fact that

700
01:21:58,259 --> 01:22:00,904
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't specifically say that it will be done.

701
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:05,513
[SPEAKER_26]: So instead, what it is, is I've been told, and this is where I need more guidance.

702
01:22:06,767 --> 01:22:15,574
[SPEAKER_26]: Because what Cataldo said, they met with the chief and they would have, if there was an issue right now, they would contact the mental health provider that works with the police department.

703
01:22:16,155 --> 01:22:20,759
[SPEAKER_26]: That person would be called to the scene or with the ambulance.

704
01:22:21,299 --> 01:22:26,003
[SPEAKER_26]: They would go then and treat that resident, which that's a great plan.

705
01:22:26,604 --> 01:22:28,966
[SPEAKER_26]: But go a little bit deeper, the professional

706
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:40,030
[SPEAKER_26]: put a question to us, said, does that mean we're now taking an ambulance offline to deal with this instead of what was told to us that it was a separate behavior bus coming to Medford?

707
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:42,932
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, that was something Armstrong shared.

708
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:50,955
[SPEAKER_26]: That was a process that was asked that they started three years ago working with Elliott and neighboring communities that would be housed here in Medford.

709
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:58,581
[SPEAKER_26]: The other issues, if you look at the contract, you looked at the services.

710
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:06,243
[SPEAKER_26]: You had ambulances 24-7, three ambulances, two ALS, one BLS, same thing with Cataldo.

711
01:23:06,963 --> 01:23:10,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Then you talk about the supervisor process.

712
01:23:10,704 --> 01:23:15,825
[SPEAKER_26]: The supervisor process, standalone process, where it's not a transport vehicle.

713
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong's was 16 hours, 365 days.

714
01:23:21,959 --> 01:23:25,062
[SPEAKER_26]: In essence, that was a fourth ambulance, because the supervisor was in that ambulance.

715
01:23:25,623 --> 01:23:28,786
[SPEAKER_26]: In the contract, Cataldo had 12 hours, six days a week.

716
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:39,576
[SPEAKER_26]: But he said, if there was an issue off time or on that seventh day, the supervisor then will travel from Everett to Medford to cover that position.

717
01:23:40,417 --> 01:23:46,442
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, this was great information to understand that there is coverage.

718
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:52,062
[SPEAKER_26]: And then it says, and it says designated field supervisor says or fly car.

719
01:23:53,423 --> 01:23:57,586
[SPEAKER_26]: The transporting is a big issue and they wanted me to really understand that.

720
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:03,150
[SPEAKER_26]: Now Armstrong offer is more transportation heavy.

721
01:24:03,931 --> 01:24:06,453
[SPEAKER_26]: They also talked about having this provider.

722
01:24:06,933 --> 01:24:11,837
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong had that person that's worked closely with our chiefs for many, many years, maybe 20 years.

723
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:15,320
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a new process that Cataldo has to start.

724
01:24:16,202 --> 01:24:18,384
[SPEAKER_26]: Then you look at questions about the CORIs.

725
01:24:18,944 --> 01:24:25,769
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm happy to see that both organizations follow through with CORIs and automatically re-up every year.

726
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:32,053
[SPEAKER_26]: The process with the AEDs,

727
01:24:33,356 --> 01:24:49,162
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong had already donated at least 30, I believe, 25 to 30, and they were either servicing it or making sure that whatever the city needed, they would come, take one that needed to be serviced, and they would make sure that we always had it in place.

728
01:24:49,723 --> 01:24:52,524
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't see that in the Cataldo offer.

729
01:24:54,785 --> 01:24:57,446
[SPEAKER_26]: Then it comes to the funding, and this is the problem.

730
01:24:58,926 --> 01:25:00,747
[SPEAKER_26]: When I asked Cataldo, I said,

731
01:25:02,258 --> 01:25:03,599
[SPEAKER_26]: where is the funding mechanism?

732
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:17,186
[SPEAKER_26]: So in this contract that says operational funding, and it has a litany of different protocols and different aspects, and I said, okay, so and $75,000, because that's what we're losing a year.

733
01:25:17,887 --> 01:25:18,507
[SPEAKER_26]: And he said, no.

734
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:28,993
[SPEAKER_26]: He says, in actuality, he said, I believe in the three years, over a million dollars in three years that Armstrong will be providing in oxygen tanks,

735
01:25:29,855 --> 01:25:40,941
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe medical supplies like band-aids or bandages or, you know, and then classes and CPR courses and all that stuff.

736
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:47,144
[SPEAKER_26]: What was then on the other side, what Armstrong, Armstrong just, they did that.

737
01:25:47,425 --> 01:25:57,310
[SPEAKER_26]: It wasn't written in it, but that's what they did above and beyond all the other things we talked about, which was, I believe, $40,000 a year to community service support.

738
01:26:00,128 --> 01:26:03,349
[SPEAKER_26]: It was confusing to me that saying, well, it seems like we're losing money.

739
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:08,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Because if you look at the contract, it's very vague on what's being offered.

740
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:13,974
[SPEAKER_26]: And I asked Mr. White, why isn't that more, why isn't it spelt out?

741
01:26:14,014 --> 01:26:16,835
[SPEAKER_26]: Because these are the questions and these are the issues that I have.

742
01:26:16,855 --> 01:26:18,876
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know he was getting irritated and I was getting irritated.

743
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:21,797
[SPEAKER_26]: But again, I reinforce, it wasn't with Cataldo.

744
01:26:21,837 --> 01:26:22,958
[SPEAKER_26]: This isn't Cataldo's fault.

745
01:26:24,108 --> 01:26:33,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Cataldos, they're a reputable organization, but the question was, why did we change this contract?

746
01:26:33,752 --> 01:26:34,832
[SPEAKER_26]: What was the need for it?

747
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:40,474
[SPEAKER_26]: And I hate to say this, it's personal.

748
01:26:41,335 --> 01:26:45,817
[SPEAKER_26]: When you look at these issues and you keep going, moving forward, it's a cost for no

749
01:26:49,579 --> 01:27:03,832
[SPEAKER_26]: The issue, the other one was, remember, having the Armstrong not, the question was, I believe the Chief said, Armstrong said they wouldn't transport our first responders if they got hurt on the job.

750
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:07,376
[SPEAKER_26]: It wasn't, well, the writing that

751
01:27:08,367 --> 01:27:11,789
[SPEAKER_26]: is in the Cataldo is what Armstrong wanted in the contract.

752
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:12,409
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all they wanted.

753
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:16,512
[SPEAKER_26]: They wanted to say that this is what it is, and it's the same piece.

754
01:27:16,952 --> 01:27:26,478
[SPEAKER_26]: Because, again, with all the emails that were shared with me through Armstrong, I shared this with a professional, a mutual professional, which I won't say their names, but

755
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:29,904
[SPEAKER_26]: They want to really come in and revamp everything in Medford.

756
01:27:29,924 --> 01:27:32,227
[SPEAKER_26]: They want to go to 9-1-1 center, and I love them.

757
01:27:32,267 --> 01:27:38,234
[SPEAKER_26]: They're really energetic, but they shared a lot of apples to apples so we can understand it as city councilors.

758
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:47,985
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, the no payment or in-kind support may be used to induce a reward referral of patients and purchase a lease order and so on.

759
01:27:48,025 --> 01:27:48,646
[SPEAKER_26]: You could read that.

760
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:55,187
[SPEAKER_26]: Next is the most important piece, I think, that understanding the data.

761
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:56,867
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that we talked about that.

762
01:27:57,007 --> 01:28:02,989
[SPEAKER_26]: As we move forward, I told Mr. White that it's going to be important that for one Councilor, I'm going to do my due diligence.

763
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:07,169
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think that what Council President was saying, what's really bothersome right now is this.

764
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:18,972
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is, I know I'm winded, but Armstrong sent this correspondence letter, Rich Raymond,

765
01:28:19,884 --> 01:28:32,990
[SPEAKER_26]: the CEO of Armstrong, and I'll put it on the record that says, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, members of Medford City Council, Armstrong Ambulance has had the privilege of serving the City of Medford and its residents for more than 30 years.

766
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:41,614
[SPEAKER_26]: As a contractual relationship concludes, we remain appreciative of the opportunity to have partnered with the City in delivering emergency medical services to the community.

767
01:28:42,314 --> 01:28:47,857
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong will continue to maintain a base of operations in Medford and will remain available to the City as needed.

768
01:28:48,537 --> 01:29:03,448
[SPEAKER_26]: This correspondence serves as a formal request to ensure that both the City of Medford and Armstrong Ambulance remain fully compliant with the applicable state and federal laws, as well as the terms and conditions of the 2022 Emergency Medical Service Contract.

769
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:05,029
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the issue.

770
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,572
[SPEAKER_26]: All they wanted was protection.

771
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:21,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the 2022 contract, Armstrong respectfully requested the financial documentation detailing the expenditures of the funds paid to the City under the provisions.

772
01:29:22,152 --> 01:29:28,874
[SPEAKER_26]: As the provisions shared with Armstrong by the City's Finance Director of $36,972.30 has been expended to date prior to the end of the contract on December 2025, leaving a remaining balance of $188,027.70.

773
01:29:40,058 --> 01:29:47,602
[SPEAKER_26]: For clarity, the completeness of the record Armstrong made in good faith payment totaling $225,000 in 2025.

774
01:29:48,022 --> 01:29:57,986
[SPEAKER_26]: The first payment of $150,000 was posted to Medford in May 2, 2025, and the second of $75,000 posted November 26, 2025.

775
01:29:59,707 --> 01:30:08,031
[SPEAKER_26]: If the City is unable to provide detailed financial records documenting how the remaining funds were utilized prior to the end of the contract,

776
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:19,197
[SPEAKER_26]: records Armstrong must retain to defend against any potential federal or state audit, Armstrong respectfully requests that the unspent balance of $188,027.70 be returned to Armstrong.

777
01:30:19,217 --> 01:30:26,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Additionally, in accordance with Section 8 in the Contract 2022, Armstrong respectfully requests the return of the automated external defibrillators, all the AEDs that were provided by Armstrong

778
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:39,633
[SPEAKER_26]: Ambulance.

779
01:30:39,793 --> 01:30:43,816
[SPEAKER_26]: Armstrong respectfully requests these matters be resolved in 10 days of the receipt of this letter.

780
01:30:44,317 --> 01:30:52,582
[SPEAKER_26]: On behalf of Armstrong Ambulance employees, we extend a sincere appreciation for the opportunity to have served the City of Medford and its residents in the past 30 years.

781
01:30:53,043 --> 01:31:01,769
[SPEAKER_26]: We are proud to care delivered and lives touched and partnerships shared, and we wish the City continued success moving forward respectfully, Richard.

782
01:31:04,253 --> 01:31:17,082
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than understanding this process and why we're doing this, we're seeing a pattern of questionable management of contracts and processes.

783
01:31:18,623 --> 01:31:30,431
[SPEAKER_26]: When you look at what we went through and understanding the apples to apples, because that was a question a lot of people were asking, and why this is a problem, it seems, again, this is the mayor,

784
01:31:32,997 --> 01:31:40,901
[SPEAKER_26]: making something personal and moving forward with hurting a company that's done nothing but support Medford.

785
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:51,445
[SPEAKER_26]: And I can say that because the people I've talked to over this pattern lied to me to my face and then came to that podium and spelt mistruths.

786
01:31:52,546 --> 01:31:54,727
[SPEAKER_26]: And they hurt a lot of people and their families by doing that.

787
01:31:57,128 --> 01:31:58,408
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm tired of this happening.

788
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:01,430
[SPEAKER_26]: What's next?

789
01:32:02,978 --> 01:32:03,599
[SPEAKER_26]: What is next?

790
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:05,781
[SPEAKER_26]: Because right now it's the ambulance contract.

791
01:32:06,261 --> 01:32:08,363
[SPEAKER_26]: It was the process with the rezoning.

792
01:32:08,784 --> 01:32:15,990
[SPEAKER_26]: It was what we'll talk about later with what's going on with our DPW and snow removal process.

793
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:19,354
[SPEAKER_26]: We're talking about the trash contract.

794
01:32:20,114 --> 01:32:21,055
[SPEAKER_26]: What else are we missing?

795
01:32:22,497 --> 01:32:23,738
[SPEAKER_26]: So, Mr. President, if I can,

796
01:32:25,695 --> 01:32:29,436
[SPEAKER_26]: I would recommend that we ask for another committee of the whole to answer these questions.

797
01:32:29,816 --> 01:32:31,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, the city didn't answer these questions.

798
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:34,678
[SPEAKER_26]: A representative from Cataldo answered these questions.

799
01:32:35,118 --> 01:32:39,400
[SPEAKER_26]: And I explained to him, this isn't about really about what's on the contract.

800
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:43,261
[SPEAKER_26]: It's really why it was on the contract and why we made that decision.

801
01:32:43,701 --> 01:32:48,283
[SPEAKER_26]: Because what I read was an independent divide of what happened from one to the other.

802
01:32:49,603 --> 01:32:54,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Because now I want to know how we're going to pay this, bring in this behavior ambulance.

803
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:59,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Now I want to know what is being offered to us.

804
01:32:59,306 --> 01:33:02,170
[SPEAKER_26]: Now we have to know, how are we going to repay $188,000 if it was used somewhere else?

805
01:33:06,593 --> 01:33:09,216
[SPEAKER_26]: So there are questions now that are very, very concerning to me.

806
01:33:09,597 --> 01:33:12,080
[SPEAKER_26]: So, Mr. President, if I can, I would ask again.

807
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:19,749
[SPEAKER_26]: I would ask for the team that was part of the negotiations to be at this meeting to help us understand the process.

808
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:25,456
[SPEAKER_26]: I would ask that we reach out to the former city solicitor who was part of this process.

809
01:33:25,896 --> 01:33:26,737
[SPEAKER_26]: and invite him.

810
01:33:26,757 --> 01:33:47,527
[SPEAKER_26]: I would also ask the attorneys from KP Law that were part of this process and bring them all to the table because I think it's important for this council to understand as we move forward and making sure we make decisions make fiduciary response decisions for this mayor and this administration that we know we're being listened to and things are being done the right way.

811
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
[SPEAKER_26]: not being done to hurt people.

812
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:59,339
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I've heard it over and over again for the last four years, how employees of the city are being hurt, how businesses that give everything to Method are being hurt.

813
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:02,620
[SPEAKER_26]: And it seems like it's personal instead of what is right.

814
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,280
[SPEAKER_26]: So I apologize for my passion.

815
01:34:06,681 --> 01:34:08,441
[SPEAKER_26]: But again, let me reiterate.

816
01:34:12,543 --> 01:34:17,208
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know who was the CEO of Armstrong Ambulance.

817
01:34:17,709 --> 01:34:21,733
[SPEAKER_26]: I had no personal relationship with those people before this contract.

818
01:34:22,094 --> 01:34:27,600
[SPEAKER_26]: I never talked or even met this CEO until this situation started.

819
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:49,278
[SPEAKER_26]: So when the mayor can go publicly and put it out there that this is the reason why Councilor Scarpelli, and belittle the fact why I really did it, because something that really pained me in my life, in my family's life, to be belittled and say that this issue is really coming forth because she can't give contracts just because they're Georgia's friends.

820
01:34:51,559 --> 01:34:52,119
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you know what?

821
01:34:52,439 --> 01:34:55,240
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's time that this council puts this mayor

822
01:34:56,301 --> 01:35:05,904
[SPEAKER_26]: feed to the fire, and really start bringing issues to the forefront to make sure that we're getting what we deserve and people stop getting hurt.

823
01:35:07,184 --> 01:35:08,085
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

824
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:15,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

825
01:35:23,469 --> 01:35:25,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you working with me

826
01:35:26,021 --> 01:35:35,770
[SPEAKER_05]: to join these resolutions together and just get the answers to the questions that we asked and that residents have been asking.

827
01:35:37,412 --> 01:35:45,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to really reiterate, 21 days ago now we asked for a copy of the new contract.

828
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:46,240
[SPEAKER_05]: We got that today.

829
01:35:47,723 --> 01:35:50,824
[SPEAKER_05]: City data on EMS response times, we haven't received that.

830
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:55,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Transition plan on how Medford's gonna be covered for EMS, we haven't received that.

831
01:35:56,966 --> 01:36:01,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Housing, ambulances in Medford, it sounds like you had to call Cataldo directly for that.

832
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:06,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And we asked for a going forward comparison.

833
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,885
[SPEAKER_05]: with the response times under the previous contract and now this new contract.

834
01:36:12,047 --> 01:36:18,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Requests for mutual aid comparisons over the next year, obviously couldn't provide those yet, but

835
01:36:18,878 --> 01:36:27,400
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we could at least take a look at the first month, compare, in a few days, we could compare that first month to the month last year.

836
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:48,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And information on the Armstrong payments, including written opinions or advice of council regarding Armstrong's payments, when invoices were submitted by the city to Armstrong since 2020, documentation to prove the expenses or communications to commit to produce expenses, documentation before Armstrong was invoiced, we haven't received any of that.

837
01:36:51,325 --> 01:37:03,988
[SPEAKER_05]: We did receive, within a day, from Armstrong 10 years of response time data, which showed that 97% of their responses were under the federal average in 2015.

838
01:37:04,288 --> 01:37:06,668
[SPEAKER_05]: 75% of them were under five minutes.

839
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:09,769
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2020, that was 96% under eight minutes 59, 79% under five minutes, and in 2025, you know,

840
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the response times were going down.

841
01:37:19,141 --> 01:37:26,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 95% under 8 minutes 59 and 76% under 4 minutes 59.

842
01:37:26,766 --> 01:37:31,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So all within a range of 1 or 2% for 10 years of service.

843
01:37:32,489 --> 01:37:34,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took a day to get that information.

844
01:37:34,871 --> 01:37:37,852
[SPEAKER_05]: We still haven't received it from the city after 21 days.

845
01:37:39,897 --> 01:37:47,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to be honest, I'm really disturbed by the city's response to pretty simple questions.

846
01:37:49,825 --> 01:37:52,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty simple questions, requests for documentation.

847
01:37:52,187 --> 01:37:59,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the city's spin that Armstrong is George's friend and that's why he's fighting for it was pretty gross.

848
01:38:00,934 --> 01:38:03,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty clear to me that's not what the issue is.

849
01:38:03,576 --> 01:38:06,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I can certainly tell you this, I'm not Armstrong's friend.

850
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:10,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know anyone from that company before a month ago.

851
01:38:10,972 --> 01:38:15,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's mostly because I'm lucky I've never had to call an ambulance.

852
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:24,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, again, you know, I've just heard from a lot of people these statements saying, well, we really just shouldn't talk about this.

853
01:38:26,283 --> 01:38:31,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, well, we know the data, but we don't have the data.

854
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:36,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially just some stuff that,

855
01:38:39,192 --> 01:38:41,113
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really just made me really sad.

856
01:38:42,234 --> 01:38:47,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That was said to me online for asking some really simple questions from people who represent this city.

857
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:50,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It just made me sad.

858
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this city.

859
01:38:54,141 --> 01:38:58,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that everyone behind this rail loves this city.

860
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:00,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I know so many residents love this city.

861
01:39:01,885 --> 01:39:05,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anyone, you know,

862
01:39:06,692 --> 01:39:10,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's Armstrong or Cataldo, I just want to understand why.

863
01:39:12,834 --> 01:39:17,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never thought an EMS contract would just make me sad.

864
01:39:18,657 --> 01:39:34,583
[SPEAKER_05]: The legal process and the contract process and the way it's communicated, you know, would talk about people's friends and people's family and people's ambitions and, you know, become so personal and so political when

865
01:39:35,616 --> 01:39:40,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like send us the contract and show us the data and let us understand why this decision was made.

866
01:39:43,723 --> 01:39:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do look forward to receiving the simple answers and information that we requested.

867
01:39:49,508 --> 01:39:50,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope we do.

868
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:59,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine that this council for the first time in my six years would have to use our legal authority to subpoena information.

869
01:39:59,496 --> 01:40:03,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope that's not what we would have to do to just get these simple documents.

870
01:40:07,091 --> 01:40:25,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think really just the things that I saw online that made me just the most disappointed about all of this were folks who said, you know, I thought it was a reasonable decision, you know, it could have gone either way, but then I saw how the city reacted and now I have to wonder why this happened at all.

871
01:40:26,285 --> 01:40:29,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have concerns and I wonder if it was above board.

872
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:33,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, like that's wild.

873
01:40:34,012 --> 01:40:36,712
[SPEAKER_05]: When you just ask, what happened to the response times?

874
01:40:36,812 --> 01:40:37,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we see the contract?

875
01:40:37,913 --> 01:40:39,013
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the transition plan?

876
01:40:40,093 --> 01:40:41,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And three weeks later, we don't know.

877
01:40:42,674 --> 01:40:47,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are still wondering why we can't produce simple answers.

878
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope that we can get them.

879
01:40:51,996 --> 01:40:53,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we can have another meeting.

880
01:40:53,938 --> 01:40:58,499
[SPEAKER_05]: and that this documentation can be provided, and we can go from there.

881
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:18,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the decision's been made, and it's very clear that this body's position and viewpoint on the issue was not considered at all, but I really, I'm just deeply, deeply concerned that the response was to be personally attacking people.

882
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:19,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

883
01:41:20,579 --> 01:41:21,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't get it.

884
01:41:21,539 --> 01:41:28,704
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for working with me on this and I hope that we can get these simple answers.

885
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:29,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.

886
01:41:29,844 --> 01:41:33,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Leming.

887
01:41:37,168 --> 01:41:37,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Lazzaro.

888
01:41:38,089 --> 01:41:38,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

889
01:41:39,110 --> 01:41:43,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just like to say I really appreciate this coming forward.

890
01:41:45,561 --> 01:41:49,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, if I may, through the chair, never apologize for your passion.

891
01:41:51,344 --> 01:41:55,547
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an important issue, obviously, but it is personal.

892
01:41:55,587 --> 01:42:10,875
[SPEAKER_14]: It's personal for everybody who has to take an ambulance somewhere, but it's also personal for the people who work at these organizations, and it's personal for the people that we represent to want to be able to trust their city to make the right decisions and the most

893
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:19,823
[SPEAKER_14]: The just the decisions for good reasons and not for pettiness, not for personal reasons.

894
01:42:20,063 --> 01:42:21,944
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's not how we govern the city.

895
01:42:22,044 --> 01:42:25,086
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate that this is coming forward.

896
01:42:25,146 --> 01:42:33,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we've had a lot of long discussions about this, but we just have to keep going until we uncover what we need to uncover.

897
01:42:33,329 --> 01:42:34,430
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate it.

898
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:41,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we're doing it, I'm glad it's moving along, and your continued persistence is appreciated.

899
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:42,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

900
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Lazzaro.

901
01:42:44,845 --> 01:42:45,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

902
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:52,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just like to say I think that this body has

903
01:42:54,221 --> 01:43:03,506
[SPEAKER_03]: engaged in these sorts of investigations, lines of inquiry, whatever you want to call them, for political purposes.

904
01:43:03,746 --> 01:43:05,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this is that.

905
01:43:06,107 --> 01:43:13,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people, and I've been pretty outspoken when I think that that's been happening in the past.

906
01:43:14,452 --> 01:43:16,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that this is one of those times.

907
01:43:16,593 --> 01:43:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when my colleague is bringing forward and keeping on this particular

908
01:43:24,797 --> 01:43:31,699
[SPEAKER_03]: line of inquiry, trying to get answers to these questions.

909
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:38,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to put it out there that I fully support him.

910
01:43:39,441 --> 01:43:40,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you.

911
01:43:43,042 --> 01:43:43,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

912
01:43:43,362 --> 01:43:48,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any further discussion on this paper, this joint paper from members of the council?

913
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:52,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

914
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:59,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just, maybe I missed it, but I'm not exactly sure how they're being merged.

915
01:44:00,012 --> 01:44:01,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we just asking for all of the information, or?

916
01:44:01,532 --> 01:44:09,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we joined the, sorry, we joined the resolution, and we're asking for all the information included in both pages.

917
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just be the text of both things will get sent up.

918
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:12,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

919
01:44:13,799 --> 01:44:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

920
01:44:20,363 --> 01:44:21,183
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Chief Evans is here.

921
01:44:21,203 --> 01:44:22,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want to speak to this, Chief.

922
01:44:26,022 --> 01:44:27,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool if, yes, sir, your call.

923
01:44:28,523 --> 01:44:28,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

924
01:44:30,884 --> 01:44:37,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not seeing any other representatives from the administration for this paper, so we'll go to public participation.

925
01:44:37,527 --> 01:44:42,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

926
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:58,706
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll speak in support tonight of both of these resolutions and call on the Mayor to provide the public an answer here on why she didn't respond to the Council's request for information.

927
01:44:59,066 --> 01:45:02,487
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes, I understand that maybe this request wasn't legally enforceable.

928
01:45:02,507 --> 01:45:03,928
[SPEAKER_20]: She didn't have a legal obligation.

929
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:05,989
[SPEAKER_20]: to respond.

930
01:45:06,309 --> 01:45:10,793
[SPEAKER_20]: But regardless, just because you don't have to do something doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't do it.

931
01:45:11,313 --> 01:45:19,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, the mayor has demonstrated, I think at this point almost brazenly, just her complete unwillingness to be transparent here on why we switched providers.

932
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:31,088
[SPEAKER_20]: And for members of the public who maybe aren't aware, when the CEO of Armstrong spoke at that lengthy Committee of the Whole meeting, he quoted from an email that was sent to the mayor.

933
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:36,419
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't see the email personally, so I can't verify that he was reading it correctly or it was accurate.

934
01:45:36,459 --> 01:45:47,735
[SPEAKER_20]: But from what he said, you know, representing to all of you here, he quoted the mayor as saying this, quote, we don't want to go public on the reasoning on why we are going in another direction.

935
01:45:48,277 --> 01:46:02,883
[SPEAKER_20]: To me, that was just so mind-blowing that I had to write it down when I heard it, because she's saying openly in writing, like, I don't want the public to know, which is really appalling when you think of yourself as an elected leader who's supposed to be transparent to the people, to this body, to the whole city.

936
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:08,826
[SPEAKER_20]: We heard a similar comment from the mayor's chief of staff at the meeting before that.

937
01:46:09,867 --> 01:46:14,629
[SPEAKER_20]: She talked about concern and fear if the public knew, the public would know what's going on here.

938
01:46:15,986 --> 01:46:19,148
[SPEAKER_20]: And at that meeting, sorry, the committee, the whole meeting, the mayor wasn't there, right?

939
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:31,357
[SPEAKER_20]: You would think other city officials showed up, the police chief, the fire chief, but the mayor herself didn't show up, which is really just stunning, given that we really needed information, and this was really an important topic of public interest.

940
01:46:31,378 --> 01:46:35,401
[SPEAKER_20]: So the fact that you wouldn't show up and comment really, to me, is something to be ashamed of.

941
01:46:36,756 --> 01:46:43,598
[SPEAKER_20]: And we only heard from the city, too, notably, you know, when they're put on the spot, when we called them to come to that committee, the whole meeting, and provide some information.

942
01:46:43,618 --> 01:46:45,578
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it wasn't like they were going to do this voluntarily.

943
01:46:46,258 --> 01:46:49,879
[SPEAKER_20]: And we did get a few, you know, people show up and give some answers.

944
01:46:49,919 --> 01:46:52,120
[SPEAKER_20]: But still, you know, we're really not seeing enough.

945
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:53,380
[SPEAKER_20]: Overall, we're seeing crickets.

946
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,340
[SPEAKER_20]: We're seeing radio silence.

947
01:46:55,680 --> 01:47:02,162
[SPEAKER_20]: And it really amounts, in my opinion, to just a dishonesty, a dishonesty to the whole of the public and to this body as well.

948
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,008
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll call on the mayor.

949
01:47:04,088 --> 01:47:06,809
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I think it's never too late to change your ways.

950
01:47:07,089 --> 01:47:10,091
[SPEAKER_20]: So hopefully she does that and we get some more transparency here.

951
01:47:10,151 --> 01:47:10,772
[SPEAKER_20]: We see a pivot.

952
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:12,613
[SPEAKER_20]: We see a willingness to work this out.

953
01:47:12,913 --> 01:47:14,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, you're just going to drag on, right?

954
01:47:14,534 --> 01:47:16,135
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's so much else going on in the city.

955
01:47:16,155 --> 01:47:17,816
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be great to move on to other topics.

956
01:47:17,876 --> 01:47:19,897
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not going there because we're dealing with this.

957
01:47:20,117 --> 01:47:21,578
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's my call.

958
01:47:21,878 --> 01:47:22,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

959
01:47:24,139 --> 01:47:24,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

960
01:47:26,661 --> 01:47:27,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll stay at the podium.

961
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:30,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

962
01:47:32,072 --> 01:47:33,594
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like a customer at 499 Main Street.

963
01:47:34,475 --> 01:47:35,856
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, hell has frozen over.

964
01:47:35,876 --> 01:47:39,919
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I agree with everything that has just been said.

965
01:47:39,939 --> 01:47:51,189
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this is sort of wild that it's this much trouble to get some really basic, really, really, really, really basic information, like for transparency purposes.

966
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:55,553
[SPEAKER_22]: This like isn't even a question of, you know,

967
01:47:56,653 --> 01:48:00,376
[SPEAKER_22]: whether it should, like, all of this information should be given to the City Council and the public.

968
01:48:00,436 --> 01:48:01,016
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, it's crazy.

969
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:12,244
[SPEAKER_22]: Though, the amendment, I like the resolutions.

970
01:48:12,304 --> 01:48:22,010
[SPEAKER_22]: I do want to suggest that there be an amendment or a call for the mayor to have the administration provide a written and cogent explanation of why they

971
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:31,297
[SPEAKER_22]: made the decision they made to do with articulable detail and reference to what's actually in the contracts and the history.

972
01:48:32,618 --> 01:48:33,940
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's really necessary.

973
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:42,768
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't see anything regarding an actual written explanation coming from the administration in the asks, and I think that's also a really important part of this.

974
01:48:43,148 --> 01:48:44,970
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is really, this is buck wild.

975
01:48:45,491 --> 01:48:47,773
[SPEAKER_22]: And, I mean, you're seeing everyone who's like,

976
01:48:50,513 --> 01:48:57,999
[SPEAKER_22]: totally on polar opposite sides of almost everything in the city, 100% on board and shoulder to shoulder on this.

977
01:48:58,299 --> 01:48:59,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, this is crazy.

978
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:13,010
[SPEAKER_22]: And from what everything Councilor Scafelli has described, honestly, like, I'm really beginning to suspect that there is, if not malfeasance involved, like, just

979
01:49:14,743 --> 01:49:23,407
[SPEAKER_22]: like negligence involved because of the amounts of money that we're talking about that have just, you know, vanished into the ether and aren't being accounted for.

980
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:26,548
[SPEAKER_22]: This is crazy and it needs to be fixed.

981
01:49:26,888 --> 01:49:32,430
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mean, yeah, like you have legal authority to explore this.

982
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:44,195
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's really on the administration to get their asses in gear and actually do their job and be transparent and communicative and collaborative for once in their goddamn career in the city.

983
01:49:45,023 --> 01:49:46,704
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for this.

984
01:49:46,744 --> 01:49:58,709
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, I strongly recommend an amendment just to include that ask for a written cogent explanation from the administration so that you have something in detail in writing that you can look at and drill them on and to ask them about.

985
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:04,212
[SPEAKER_22]: And they have a chance to defend and explain themselves, too, because I do think that that is also owed to some degree.

986
01:50:07,848 --> 01:50:08,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

987
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:12,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go to Jess H on Zoom.

988
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:14,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Jess, name and address for the record, please.

989
01:50:14,611 --> 01:50:15,411
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three minutes.

990
01:50:23,054 --> 01:50:23,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jess.

991
01:50:25,615 --> 01:50:26,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hello.

992
01:50:27,256 --> 01:50:29,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, sorry.

993
01:50:29,797 --> 01:50:37,620
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to say that I don't agree with you guys a lot of the time, but I do agree with the speaker that was just out.

994
01:50:38,207 --> 01:50:49,795
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to say that I appreciate you holding the mayor responsible for her actions that seem to be, for better or worse, out of control recently with different things that she's doing.

995
01:50:50,476 --> 01:51:00,163
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to thank you for holding her responsible and questioning of why a lot of different things seem to be happening recently in Medford.

996
01:51:01,604 --> 01:51:03,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to thank you all for that.

997
01:51:05,627 --> 01:51:05,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

998
01:51:12,937 --> 01:51:13,297
[SPEAKER_22]: One minute.

999
01:51:14,038 --> 01:51:14,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, sorry.

1000
01:51:15,939 --> 01:51:18,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I am Mikey from 499 Main Street.

1001
01:51:18,141 --> 01:51:37,998
[SPEAKER_22]: So just to Councilor Scarpelli's point about the housing for ambulance vehicles, that was really interesting for me to hear because like just today while I was picking up my kid from daycare down at Little Sprouts, in that parking lot, there is like an entire squad

1002
01:51:40,083 --> 01:51:52,877
[SPEAKER_22]: ambulance vehicles just sort of parked wherever the hell they wanted to be across multiple parking spots and everything, and just chilling there, which I thought was really weird, because I'd never seen that before there, and it was very strange.

1003
01:51:52,917 --> 01:51:58,403
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was actually... No one's gonna go to that hospital or...

1004
01:51:59,423 --> 01:52:00,644
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, go into a panic over it.

1005
01:52:00,724 --> 01:52:07,709
[SPEAKER_22]: But, I mean, it actually was inconvenient and not actually safe for the parking lot and the way you're supposed to drive through it.

1006
01:52:07,789 --> 01:52:11,432
[SPEAKER_22]: So, like, it was actually problematic and not a good thing.

1007
01:52:11,472 --> 01:52:13,574
[SPEAKER_22]: So, like, it is actually happening around the city too.

1008
01:52:13,834 --> 01:52:15,816
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I appreciate you bringing that up.

1009
01:52:17,217 --> 01:52:17,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1010
01:52:17,617 --> 01:52:21,600
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1011
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,543
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Andrew Castagnetti on Zoom.

1012
01:52:25,583 --> 01:52:27,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record.

1013
01:52:27,204 --> 01:52:27,985
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have three minutes.

1014
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:38,163
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we have every person on Zoom.

1015
01:52:38,223 --> 01:52:40,105
That's me, you're going to have to mute your TV.

1016
01:53:01,799 --> 01:53:02,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I've changed my mind.

1017
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:03,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no comment.

1018
01:53:04,462 --> 01:53:04,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1019
01:53:04,902 --> 01:53:06,783
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1020
01:53:07,024 --> 01:53:07,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1021
01:53:07,484 --> 01:53:10,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1022
01:53:10,587 --> 01:53:11,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1023
01:53:12,108 --> 01:53:17,072
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I do want to reinforce, Mr. President, to the community that we are safe.

1024
01:53:17,912 --> 01:53:24,658
[SPEAKER_26]: Cataldo, you know, I know that that was what Mr. White was expressing to me, that there was some sort of

1025
01:53:25,972 --> 01:53:29,414
[SPEAKER_26]: Fairmongering going on and making people uncomfortable.

1026
01:53:29,735 --> 01:53:31,316
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not my intention at all.

1027
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:33,557
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry.

1028
01:53:33,717 --> 01:53:41,382
[SPEAKER_26]: Cataldo services neighbor communities and they have qualified staff on their ambulances.

1029
01:53:41,822 --> 01:53:46,305
[SPEAKER_26]: But again, this issue isn't about Cataldo.

1030
01:53:47,105 --> 01:53:50,227
[SPEAKER_26]: This issue is really about the process and why we're here.

1031
01:53:50,737 --> 01:53:58,240
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, thank you for everybody for your input and your support with this.

1032
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:58,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

1033
01:54:01,221 --> 01:54:02,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1034
01:54:02,281 --> 01:54:05,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I do have Nick to that email.

1035
01:54:05,802 --> 01:54:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: It reads, with that being said, we do not want to go public on the reasoning of why we are going in another direction.

1036
01:54:13,265 --> 01:54:15,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was not able to get that from the city.

1037
01:54:17,732 --> 01:54:28,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's really, really disingenuous to say that we just want to understand what changed about response times, what's changed about response times, what's changed about response times, and what's changed about response times.

1038
01:54:38,483 --> 01:54:47,649
[SPEAKER_05]: how we're not gonna have ambulances parking across parking lots so people can't drive through parking lots and the other basics of the reasoning that you laid out.

1039
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:51,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really, really disingenuous to call that fear mongering.

1040
01:54:52,152 --> 01:54:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And at this point, it's not even about the service.

1041
01:54:54,974 --> 01:54:55,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the process.

1042
01:54:56,215 --> 01:54:58,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And over and over and over again, that's what it's been about.

1043
01:55:01,338 --> 01:55:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: It just hasn't been good.

1044
01:55:06,201 --> 01:55:06,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

1045
01:55:10,477 --> 01:55:13,521
[SPEAKER_05]: on the motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

1046
01:55:30,772 --> 01:55:34,873
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's important we get a true indication of what happened that afternoon through that process.

1047
01:55:35,013 --> 01:55:35,533
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1048
01:55:35,553 --> 01:55:35,773
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1049
01:55:36,053 --> 01:55:57,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So the motion by Councilor Scarpelli is to submit the questions to the administration and then to call for another meeting in Committee of the Whole, inviting everyone who was part of the negotiations to be present at that meeting, including any former staffs, former city solicitor who was part of that, as well as the ambulance companies.

1050
01:55:57,299 --> 01:55:57,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that?

1051
01:55:58,499 --> 01:55:58,759
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1052
01:56:00,073 --> 01:56:02,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

1053
01:56:03,536 --> 01:56:04,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded.

1054
01:56:04,197 --> 01:56:07,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to put a deadline, a request for response deadline?

1055
01:56:11,243 --> 01:56:14,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1056
01:56:16,008 --> 01:56:20,972
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like a response within by, for the agenda.

1057
01:56:21,032 --> 01:56:22,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So by February 20th.

1058
01:56:24,275 --> 01:56:24,556
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1059
01:56:25,296 --> 01:56:25,857
[SPEAKER_05]: On that motion.

1060
01:56:28,107 --> 01:56:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor, seconded by Councilor... Opposed, the motion passes.

1061
01:56:35,152 --> 01:56:39,074
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we have now Papers 26028 and 26029.

1062
01:56:39,254 --> 01:56:44,998
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion to join Papers 26028 and 26029 by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1063
01:56:45,018 --> 01:56:45,738
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1064
01:56:53,908 --> 01:56:54,989
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

1065
01:56:55,009 --> 01:56:57,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll read 26028 first.

1066
01:56:57,591 --> 01:56:59,832
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 26028.

1067
01:56:59,892 --> 01:57:13,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Resolution requesting for report regarding the January 2026 snowstorm response, whereas the city experienced a significant winter storm event in January 2026 that required an extensive municipal snow and ice removal response, and whereas the severity and duration of the storm

1068
01:57:14,499 --> 01:57:19,941
[SPEAKER_05]: resulted in substantial deployment of city resources, contracted services, parking enforcement actions, and towing operations.

1069
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:28,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas transparency, accountability, and preparedness are essential to ensuring the effective use of public funds and the continuous improvement of emergency response operations.

1070
01:57:29,185 --> 01:57:37,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And whereas a comprehensive review of the city's response will assist the city council, administration, and residents in evaluating operational effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement.

1071
01:57:38,008 --> 01:58:01,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the city council hereby request the administration prepare and submit a full written report detailing the city's response to the January 2026 snowstorm, including but not limited to one total cost summary, itemized accounting of storm-related expenditures, two, city equipment utilized, three, contracted snow removal operators, four, ticketing and towing activity, five, operational challenges and findings.

1072
01:58:01,583 --> 01:58:11,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Six next steps and ongoing snow removal efforts be a further result of the requested report be submitted to the City Council within a reasonable time frame and be made available to the public upon completion.

1073
01:58:12,097 --> 01:58:15,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And once we get there, Councilor Schell, I'll let you read the bullet points within that.

1074
01:58:17,372 --> 01:58:41,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from Councilors Milane and Tseng, we had be it resolved that the Medford City Council expresses its sincere appreciation to the public works staff as well as contracted crews and residents for their responsiveness, professionalism, and around-the-clock efforts during and after the major winter storm on January 25th and 26th, including working extended hours under challenging conditions such as staffing and equipment constraints, limited snow storage capacity, and ongoing communications with city councilors.

1075
01:58:42,698 --> 01:59:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: and be it further resolved that the City Council acknowledges the concerns raised by residents regarding snow and sidewalk clearing during the storm, particularly with respect to the timeliness, consistency, and equity of street and sidewalk clearing, including impacts on pedestrian safety, accessibility, and snow being placed onto sidewalks already cleared by residents in accordance with City ordinances, and affirms that these concerns warrant careful review and follow-up.

1076
01:59:03,025 --> 01:59:10,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And be it further resolved that the City Council recognizes that snow and ice removal in Medford depends in part in coordination with state-managed roadways and snow removal work,

1077
01:59:10,668 --> 01:59:15,390
[SPEAKER_05]: and the performance and timing of those operations can directly affect local streets, sidewalks, and pedestrian conditions.

1078
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:38,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And be it further resolved that the Committee on Public Works and Facilities work with the Department of Public Works and City Administration to conduct a post-storm evaluation of snow and ice removal operations during this event, including an assessment of service provision, equity, and accessibility, staffing, equipment, and capacity constraints, snow storage and disposal limitations, coordination with state-managed roadways and crews, and communication with residents before, during, and after major storms.

1079
01:59:39,600 --> 02:00:02,773
[SPEAKER_05]: and be it further resolved that this evaluation be undertaken with a shared goal of strengthening service delivery going forward, recognizing workforce and fiscal realities, supporting those doing the work, and improving preparedness for future winter events, and be it further resolved that the City Council reaffirms its commitment to working collaboratively with city staff and leadership, using resident feedback constructively to improve public services while maintaining respect for labor and professionalism of municipal workers.

1080
02:00:03,393 --> 02:00:06,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Mullane.

1081
02:00:09,702 --> 02:00:22,031
[SPEAKER_26]: First, let me start by saying we should all thank the men and women that work for our DPW for what they had to endure this past snowstorm.

1082
02:00:22,491 --> 02:00:33,399
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that making it clear to our community to understand that this storm had nothing to do with the efforts of our DPW team.

1083
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:38,383
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that unfairly, talking to a few of the members,

1084
02:00:39,628 --> 02:00:46,911
[SPEAKER_26]: that they were really beaten up through social media to the point that, you know, that's their job, and they know that's their job.

1085
02:00:46,971 --> 02:01:01,477
[SPEAKER_26]: But when you arrive at work at 10 in the morning, day of a snowstorm, and you don't leave for two days later, and you're doing everything in your power to make sure that you hit the marks that this city deserves, it's very difficult.

1086
02:01:01,537 --> 02:01:09,380
[SPEAKER_26]: So I want to make that clear, I think, that our DPW crews worked their tails off and did the best they could.

1087
02:01:11,408 --> 02:01:15,750
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, this was one of the biggest storms we've seen.

1088
02:01:16,651 --> 02:01:33,262
[SPEAKER_26]: There are so many variables when you look at what happened and understanding this storm, and that as you talk to different stakeholders, talk to Mr. McGibbon, express to him that I had 57 phone calls.

1089
02:01:33,782 --> 02:01:34,463
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a record.

1090
02:01:35,123 --> 02:01:39,146
[SPEAKER_26]: I had 57 phone calls dealing with concerns with the storm.

1091
02:01:40,715 --> 02:01:56,698
[SPEAKER_26]: Some more serious than others, but the concerns I have is making sure that people know why and how it happened and what the solution will be moving forward.

1092
02:01:56,878 --> 02:01:58,438
[SPEAKER_26]: What are we going to do with the next storm?

1093
02:01:59,818 --> 02:02:08,600
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that the biggest cause we received was the impact to the business district and our main streets.

1094
02:02:10,692 --> 02:02:26,355
[SPEAKER_26]: A glaring issue was not understanding that there was a huge event at Chevalier that our businesses on the Salem Street, Main Street, and area of Medford Square really count on these nights.

1095
02:02:27,395 --> 02:02:32,116
[SPEAKER_26]: And not having the capability to park is damaging to their businesses.

1096
02:02:33,376 --> 02:02:35,637
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think what we, what,

1097
02:02:36,507 --> 02:02:40,812
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, what people were really upset were those issues.

1098
02:02:41,153 --> 02:02:47,100
[SPEAKER_26]: And the other piece was the lack of neighbors.

1099
02:02:48,752 --> 02:02:50,174
[SPEAKER_26]: shoveling their sidewalks.

1100
02:02:50,494 --> 02:02:53,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, I'm not blaming anyone because there are different various levels.

1101
02:02:54,097 --> 02:03:06,990
[SPEAKER_26]: I had a neighbor, 86 years old, that had a contractor come out, shovel out the walkway that's a mutual city sidewalk that she's been ticketed in the past, and she was so nervous.

1102
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,232
[SPEAKER_26]: She says, George, what am I going to do?

1103
02:03:08,992 --> 02:03:11,395
[SPEAKER_26]: And we called DPW, and they said, don't worry.

1104
02:03:12,163 --> 02:03:14,225
[SPEAKER_26]: and they came out and took care of it as they could.

1105
02:03:14,925 --> 02:03:28,155
[SPEAKER_26]: What I realize is understanding that do we have enough staff in a storm with that magnitude to go out and especially reach those habitual residents that don't

1106
02:03:29,373 --> 02:03:37,920
[SPEAKER_26]: shovel out their sidewalks that leave the rest of the community in danger, or the landlords that don't fulfill their responsibilities.

1107
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,001
[SPEAKER_26]: And they're not.

1108
02:03:39,041 --> 02:03:45,906
[SPEAKER_26]: We have two people that are doing their full-time job and then responding to hundreds of calls, hundreds.

1109
02:03:47,507 --> 02:03:54,133
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, the calls I got from the neighbors and friends and residents, I agree, I understand.

1110
02:03:54,873 --> 02:03:56,715
[SPEAKER_26]: You had every reason to be upset.

1111
02:03:58,332 --> 02:03:58,672
[SPEAKER_26]: You did.

1112
02:04:00,974 --> 02:04:01,934
[SPEAKER_26]: You really put out.

1113
02:04:04,216 --> 02:04:12,982
[SPEAKER_26]: But I want us to take a deep breath and understand that this was a top-10 storm that we haven't seen in years.

1114
02:04:14,203 --> 02:04:22,889
[SPEAKER_26]: And when it comes to staffing, we have had, within the last four years, a huge shift in DPW employees.

1115
02:04:23,529 --> 02:04:26,931
[SPEAKER_26]: On my street, I've been there for 27 years.

1116
02:04:28,612 --> 02:04:31,833
[SPEAKER_26]: And for 24 years, I've had the same person.

1117
02:04:31,873 --> 02:04:33,553
[SPEAKER_26]: He knew exactly how to plow a dead end.

1118
02:04:33,953 --> 02:04:34,753
[SPEAKER_26]: He was amazing.

1119
02:04:35,113 --> 02:04:36,574
[SPEAKER_26]: And everybody was happy every storm.

1120
02:04:37,654 --> 02:04:38,234
[SPEAKER_26]: He retired.

1121
02:04:39,254 --> 02:04:40,454
[SPEAKER_26]: We had a new driver come down.

1122
02:04:40,494 --> 02:04:42,375
[SPEAKER_26]: My neighbors came out and said, this is crazy.

1123
02:04:42,395 --> 02:04:48,056
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's someone that's done that probably the first time in that magnitude of a storm.

1124
02:04:49,316 --> 02:04:55,037
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think we have to give a little leeway because of the situation as a community.

1125
02:04:55,922 --> 02:04:56,722
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we have to.

1126
02:04:57,323 --> 02:05:07,808
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, that doesn't mean that I won't be calling Mr. McGivern and I won't be calling the code enforcement officers and saying it's time to move forward.

1127
02:05:09,068 --> 02:05:21,294
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I see a different variable with this because I work in a municipality and I'm on, I'm the program developer for the Parks and Recreation Department, but I'm on the emergency response team.

1128
02:05:21,894 --> 02:05:22,775
[SPEAKER_26]: It's 60 of us.

1129
02:05:23,604 --> 02:05:41,745
[SPEAKER_26]: that meet three days before a storm and we talk about everything from programming to understanding any different major events that are happening, weddings, you're talking about parking, you're talking about emergency response, you're talking about

1130
02:05:42,185 --> 02:05:58,591
[SPEAKER_26]: the fire chief explaining how he's going to respond and how we send out messages for this type of magnitude of a storm of carbon monoxide poisoning, to the police chief when he talks about ticketing, to the DPW crew that breaks down the plan of a storm.

1131
02:06:01,092 --> 02:06:06,314
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know this is going to, I'm piling on here, but there's a difference.

1132
02:06:06,934 --> 02:06:07,835
[SPEAKER_26]: What did we all see?

1133
02:06:08,235 --> 02:06:09,675
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're on social media, what did you get?

1134
02:06:10,155 --> 02:06:11,536
[SPEAKER_26]: You got, please be patient.

1135
02:06:12,933 --> 02:06:14,174
[SPEAKER_26]: Shovel out sidewalks.

1136
02:06:15,595 --> 02:06:16,975
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a big storm, right?

1137
02:06:17,396 --> 02:06:18,716
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the communication we got.

1138
02:06:20,377 --> 02:06:26,241
[SPEAKER_26]: In the neighboring communities, you have the leader of this community talking about the storm and talking about the process.

1139
02:06:27,521 --> 02:06:34,365
[SPEAKER_26]: The community next door knew what time the plows were coming out, what time the emergency started, when the cars were going to be towed.

1140
02:06:35,126 --> 02:06:37,207
[SPEAKER_26]: Then at the end of the storm, everybody knew.

1141
02:06:38,146 --> 02:06:39,247
[SPEAKER_26]: what was going first.

1142
02:06:39,787 --> 02:06:51,593
[SPEAKER_26]: It was main arteries, it was side streets, then it was this, then it was that, then it was the community path, then there was the bicycle paths, it was... Everything was spelt out, so everybody knew.

1143
02:06:52,714 --> 02:06:53,975
[SPEAKER_26]: Understand, this is the process.

1144
02:06:55,776 --> 02:06:58,797
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's funny, because people are saying, what a great job they did next door.

1145
02:07:00,578 --> 02:07:03,440
[SPEAKER_26]: They... For the most part, it's the same schedule.

1146
02:07:04,767 --> 02:07:07,849
[SPEAKER_26]: They started removing snow from their main squares last night.

1147
02:07:08,189 --> 02:07:09,190
[SPEAKER_26]: We're starting tonight.

1148
02:07:10,731 --> 02:07:16,394
[SPEAKER_26]: So I know we're agitated, and we were definitely put off, and it was difficult.

1149
02:07:16,474 --> 02:07:18,596
[SPEAKER_26]: It's been a tough couple of weeks, it seems like.

1150
02:07:19,036 --> 02:07:31,404
[SPEAKER_26]: But let's take a deep breath and thank the DPW workers that really killed themselves with this storm, and understand

1151
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:48,665
[SPEAKER_26]: My most important piece of my presentation is I would really love that our team work together with the communication team and put a plan together like we've asked for in our resolutions to what are we going to do next.

1152
02:07:49,445 --> 02:07:54,746
[SPEAKER_26]: If this happens again with three inches or four inches of snow, gloves are off, there's nothing we can do.

1153
02:07:55,867 --> 02:07:59,988
[SPEAKER_26]: But as a leadership team of this council that listens to constituents,

1154
02:08:00,828 --> 02:08:01,508
[SPEAKER_26]: We hear you.

1155
02:08:01,928 --> 02:08:04,770
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not belittling or saying we're not listening to you.

1156
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:06,350
[SPEAKER_26]: We understand.

1157
02:08:07,111 --> 02:08:24,578
[SPEAKER_26]: So moving forward, I want to make sure that through the motion that we have a plan in place, not just with our DPW commissioner, but also the communication team, that the message gets out so our residents understand what's going on and what the process is.

1158
02:08:25,567 --> 02:08:26,507
[SPEAKER_26]: I was getting phone calls.

1159
02:08:27,247 --> 02:08:28,428
[SPEAKER_26]: I live on Salem Street.

1160
02:08:28,988 --> 02:08:30,248
[SPEAKER_26]: When is the snow emergency lifted?

1161
02:08:30,448 --> 02:08:31,449
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to move my car.

1162
02:08:32,289 --> 02:08:35,710
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know where to move my car and how frantic these people were.

1163
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:37,470
[SPEAKER_26]: I put a 311 in.

1164
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:41,171
[SPEAKER_26]: These are things that we should know ahead of time.

1165
02:08:41,211 --> 02:08:49,173
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think that making sure that we have a plan in place and we communicate better, I think it's important for the next step.

1166
02:08:49,354 --> 02:08:54,555
[SPEAKER_26]: I urge my fellow residents to give everybody a pass on this one.

1167
02:08:55,557 --> 02:09:10,192
[SPEAKER_26]: When I hear nobody's been hurt, I know that, you know, I'll talk to the chief on a different issue, making sure that did we staff our fire trucks with that extra member and would that have helped?

1168
02:09:10,292 --> 02:09:18,281
[SPEAKER_26]: I will talk to traffic and parking to ask how that process went to make sure that did we tow people too early, too late?

1169
02:09:18,962 --> 02:09:23,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Why are cars in areas that our plow drivers are driving around?

1170
02:09:23,726 --> 02:09:24,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Why they weren't moved?

1171
02:09:25,047 --> 02:09:34,955
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a lot of variables that we can ask, and I think we put it forth in the resolution, but I think that let's all take a deep breath and say we survived.

1172
02:09:36,136 --> 02:09:38,438
[SPEAKER_26]: We appreciate the hard work that our teams are doing.

1173
02:09:39,098 --> 02:09:40,479
[SPEAKER_26]: We know we're understaffed.

1174
02:09:40,879 --> 02:09:41,460
[SPEAKER_26]: I gather that

1175
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:50,482
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, one of the things that in talking to, I talked to five, five different contractors that worked for the city in the past, but don't want to work here anymore.

1176
02:09:50,922 --> 02:09:56,484
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've talked to five contractors that worked the storm and shared a lot of great information.

1177
02:09:56,864 --> 02:09:59,825
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, and I talked to Tim, Tim was great.

1178
02:10:00,325 --> 02:10:01,045
[SPEAKER_26]: The rumors were.

1179
02:10:02,272 --> 02:10:03,253
[SPEAKER_26]: You probably heard them, right?

1180
02:10:03,733 --> 02:10:10,277
[SPEAKER_26]: That the contract was sent out in September and it was a 50-page contract and the contractors didn't want to complete it.

1181
02:10:10,797 --> 02:10:18,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Then it was that the new contract had that anybody that pushed snow for the city as a contractor had to have commercial plates.

1182
02:10:19,201 --> 02:10:19,722
[SPEAKER_26]: Then it was

1183
02:10:21,073 --> 02:10:25,617
[SPEAKER_26]: The contract stated that they had to get separate liability insurance.

1184
02:10:25,637 --> 02:10:31,681
[SPEAKER_26]: It would have cost that contractor an additional $5,000 to qualify to plow for Medford.

1185
02:10:31,701 --> 02:10:32,562
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why they all left.

1186
02:10:33,603 --> 02:10:34,644
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously, there is a reason.

1187
02:10:34,904 --> 02:10:42,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Five years ago, from what I've been told, we had 94 contracted snow plows or apparatus employees.

1188
02:10:43,551 --> 02:10:44,932
[SPEAKER_26]: This snowstorm, everybody, we had 24.

1189
02:10:47,313 --> 02:10:48,534
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's not including

1190
02:10:49,477 --> 02:10:58,649
[SPEAKER_26]: The newer staff that we have from the city and the fact that this is the first major storm that most people have seen that drive those blue trucks around the city every day.

1191
02:10:59,170 --> 02:10:59,290
[SPEAKER_26]: So.

1192
02:11:00,443 --> 02:11:07,105
[SPEAKER_26]: That's my that I hope I hope I didn't offend any of the residents that called me because you would listen to we made phone calls.

1193
02:11:07,605 --> 02:11:13,886
[SPEAKER_26]: I know DPW try to kill themselves to get to your homes to make sure that your families were safe.

1194
02:11:14,447 --> 02:11:15,947
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know they're still going to keep working.

1195
02:11:15,987 --> 02:11:18,548
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they're they came went home at four o'clock.

1196
02:11:18,568 --> 02:11:19,828
[SPEAKER_26]: A couple of guys told me

1197
02:11:20,527 --> 02:11:21,788
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to bed right now, George.

1198
02:11:21,868 --> 02:11:22,829
[SPEAKER_26]: We're waking up at 10.

1199
02:11:22,869 --> 02:11:28,072
[SPEAKER_26]: We're gonna be back at the city yard, and they're gonna be starting tonight, moving snow from the areas.

1200
02:11:28,092 --> 02:11:31,995
[SPEAKER_26]: The only thing I would ask is that that's the other thing people said.

1201
02:11:32,815 --> 02:11:34,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Other cities have this melter.

1202
02:11:35,597 --> 02:11:39,780
[SPEAKER_26]: The DPWs in three different communities that I talked to said the melters don't work.

1203
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:42,341
[SPEAKER_26]: They're more.

1204
02:11:42,441 --> 02:11:43,102
[SPEAKER_26]: They're not worth it.

1205
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:57,930
[SPEAKER_26]: What was shared with me is something that we used to have in Medford was a gigantic snow plow that went in the end of a truck, a snow blower, that took the snow right from the street, right from the sidewalks, right from the curb into a dump truck that they took off.

1206
02:11:58,910 --> 02:12:08,197
[SPEAKER_26]: And that eliminated a lot of time and overtime because we're getting contractors come in with front end loaders picking up, bobcats picking up dumping.

1207
02:12:09,491 --> 02:12:18,015
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a piece of apparatus that we should ask the city to, and Mr. McGiven to look at if that might be something we can help us as we move forward.

1208
02:12:18,055 --> 02:12:21,337
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, I've been very winded tonight and I apologize.

1209
02:12:21,457 --> 02:12:22,357
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I don't apologize.

1210
02:12:22,377 --> 02:12:24,098
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't apologize.

1211
02:12:25,639 --> 02:12:26,739
[SPEAKER_26]: My wife just sheltered me too.

1212
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,181
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

1213
02:12:30,421 --> 02:12:31,942
[SPEAKER_26]: But thank you.

1214
02:12:34,243 --> 02:12:36,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1215
02:12:36,484 --> 02:12:37,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Malayne.

1216
02:12:40,396 --> 02:12:46,463
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, first of all, Councilor Scarpella, thank you for kind of highlighting some of this.

1217
02:12:46,703 --> 02:12:50,467
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously, we all came at it in different ways.

1218
02:12:50,627 --> 02:12:54,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also want to reiterate again, as we said in our

1219
02:12:55,372 --> 02:13:08,155
[SPEAKER_12]: our piece as well of how much we appreciate and know the hard work that our DPW teams did over the past several days trying to get us through this massive storm.

1220
02:13:08,195 --> 02:13:16,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was the eighth largest storm we've had in Boston, and seeing how much snow came both Sunday and Monday.

1221
02:13:17,477 --> 02:13:21,578
[SPEAKER_12]: We felt it, and we know that people were out there working around the clock to try to get this done.

1222
02:13:21,618 --> 02:13:23,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I don't want to take away anything from the hard work.

1223
02:13:24,339 --> 02:13:29,544
[SPEAKER_12]: that has already been spoken about and mentioned, and I want to definitely highlight that.

1224
02:13:30,264 --> 02:13:47,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know, kind of going off of a little bit more what Councilor Scarpelli was saying, I think for me and the messages and the outreach that I had had a lot to do in terms of the communication, the transparency, what were the priorities, what are the priorities,

1225
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:50,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Where were we headed first?

1226
02:13:50,423 --> 02:14:02,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think just giving residents that knowledge base, that understanding, alleviates a lot of the stress and makes people understand that there are people out there working.

1227
02:14:02,398 --> 02:14:03,420
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a plan.

1228
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:04,942
[SPEAKER_12]: We have something in place.

1229
02:14:05,382 --> 02:14:11,107
[SPEAKER_12]: This was unprecedented for us in recent years and that we were trying to make up for it as best as we could.

1230
02:14:12,689 --> 02:14:24,040
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think even some of the messaging that did come out if you receive the e-mails or the text messages also you know telling residents you know you need to get out there and shovel again.

1231
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:25,851
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll be fine.

1232
02:14:26,011 --> 02:14:30,173
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time all of the snow is getting re plowed and put on top of their sidewalks.

1233
02:14:30,213 --> 02:14:31,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a lot of that from people as well.

1234
02:14:32,235 --> 02:14:36,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand as someone that was out there shoveling and knowing how difficult it was.

1235
02:14:37,098 --> 02:14:41,100
[SPEAKER_12]: So I too echo that we need to have a plan.

1236
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:42,561
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the process.

1237
02:14:42,601 --> 02:14:43,942
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the priority streets.

1238
02:14:44,542 --> 02:14:51,971
[SPEAKER_12]: even if those messaging through text or emails directs it back to the main website, because I understand that they're out there working.

1239
02:14:52,171 --> 02:14:59,600
[SPEAKER_12]: They might not be always able to update exactly where everyone is, but being able to direct to one source so that through social media,

1240
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:11,846
[SPEAKER_12]: through text messaging, through emails, through voice messages that go out, that there's directed to understand here's what the priorities are, here's where we're moving through, and here's what we're trying to do.

1241
02:15:11,866 --> 02:15:19,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would have alleviated a lot of that stress that people were going through and trying to figure out what was happening.

1242
02:15:20,691 --> 02:15:24,493
[SPEAKER_12]: And additionally, I do think we need to not only, here we are,

1243
02:15:25,583 --> 02:15:26,804
[SPEAKER_12]: We've passed through this storm.

1244
02:15:26,824 --> 02:15:28,164
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still clearing things up.

1245
02:15:28,204 --> 02:15:29,445
[SPEAKER_12]: People are still working through it.

1246
02:15:30,145 --> 02:15:31,266
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we going to do for next time?

1247
02:15:32,186 --> 02:15:33,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's be proactive.

1248
02:15:34,527 --> 02:15:41,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's work together to try to figure that out and take on that responsibility to say, here's what we're going to do.

1249
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:45,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the response that we've received from the city.

1250
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:46,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's some things that they could have used.

1251
02:15:47,373 --> 02:15:49,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Here are some things that we can address moving forward.

1252
02:15:50,334 --> 02:15:59,378
[SPEAKER_12]: and that we can be proactive, you know, hopefully we don't get another storm like this this winter, but certainly be even more prepared when we come into the next winter as well.

1253
02:15:59,859 --> 02:16:15,466
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I thank all the DPW staff and everyone out there working, all the residents that I know have had to go out numerous times to shovel out their sidewalks, parking spots, but hopefully we can take this information, move it forward,

1254
02:16:15,886 --> 02:16:27,694
[SPEAKER_12]: and come up with a better and I think strategic, transparent, and proactive communication plan for our residents to be aware of and that we can all be on the same page moving forward.

1255
02:16:30,696 --> 02:16:31,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Malauulu.

1256
02:16:32,517 --> 02:16:33,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

1257
02:16:33,437 --> 02:16:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1258
02:16:35,018 --> 02:16:38,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I very much agree with what my fellow councilors said.

1259
02:16:40,082 --> 02:16:42,443
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm 100% with you, Councilor Malauulu.

1260
02:16:44,314 --> 02:16:47,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And Councilor Scarpelli, you've been firing on all cylinders tonight.

1261
02:16:50,819 --> 02:17:06,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the most important thing is to start out with a message of thanks for all the hard workers, for our DPW crews who are really out there for days, who are still out there trying to clear the streets and sidewalks.

1262
02:17:07,912 --> 02:17:16,355
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was standing outside of my house, and I saw, you know, on one of the main streets, DPW vans going out all night.

1263
02:17:16,475 --> 02:17:25,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was staying up late that night, and I was just, you know, that is what we need to first and foremost recognize, right?

1264
02:17:25,319 --> 02:17:28,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That people were out all night.

1265
02:17:29,036 --> 02:17:37,918
[SPEAKER_04]: up until morning hours and the next day, plowing our streets, making sure that residents had a way to drive the next day.

1266
02:17:39,479 --> 02:17:47,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the result might not have been perfect, but there was a lot of work to do.

1267
02:17:47,201 --> 02:17:48,821
[SPEAKER_04]: There still is a lot of work to do.

1268
02:17:49,061 --> 02:17:51,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone in the DPW knows it.

1269
02:17:51,322 --> 02:17:52,302
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been working hard.

1270
02:17:53,002 --> 02:17:55,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a tough week for them.

1271
02:17:56,803 --> 02:18:00,400
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Scarpelli said, in all the, I think.

1272
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:07,605
[SPEAKER_04]: comments on social media to take it one step too far, not acknowledging the hard work that is being done there.

1273
02:18:08,346 --> 02:18:09,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That has to be recognized.

1274
02:18:10,087 --> 02:18:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, you know, that's why I wanted to start out our resolution with that note of thanks.

1275
02:18:16,972 --> 02:18:22,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Because not only is it hard work, they're doing it with so many challenges that they're facing, right?

1276
02:18:22,977 --> 02:18:24,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, where do we put the snow?

1277
02:18:24,919 --> 02:18:25,939
[SPEAKER_04]: There was so much of it.

1278
02:18:27,861 --> 02:18:28,942
[SPEAKER_04]: The, you know, our,

1279
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:32,491
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that the city is underfunded.

1280
02:18:33,172 --> 02:18:39,576
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the equipment that we need, the staffing that we need to deal with a storm this size.

1281
02:18:39,616 --> 02:18:48,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the cities that do have that, you know, faced very similar problems this storm as well.

1282
02:18:50,703 --> 02:19:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to thank the Commissioner McGivern as well for being really responsive to me throughout this whole process starting on the evening of the storm when residents reached out to me saying that their streets were unplowed and they needed to get out the next day.

1283
02:19:11,007 --> 02:19:14,848
[SPEAKER_04]: By the morning, those residents had their streets plowed and what I

1284
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:22,056
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would have to say to residents is, yes, be patient, but also contact us as your city councilors because maybe we can help.

1285
02:19:23,417 --> 02:19:27,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been trying my best to get back to all the emails.

1286
02:19:27,221 --> 02:19:28,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been a lot of emails.

1287
02:19:29,492 --> 02:19:33,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know DPW is trying their best to get to all of those cases as well.

1288
02:19:33,915 --> 02:19:37,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep on writing us so that we know which areas to flag.

1289
02:19:38,178 --> 02:19:46,863
[SPEAKER_04]: But in flagging those areas, I think there's a real question about, you know, what is the order of service?

1290
02:19:46,903 --> 02:19:48,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Which streets are going to be plowed first?

1291
02:19:49,584 --> 02:19:53,687
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that kind of plan has to be communicated to the residents.

1292
02:19:54,467 --> 02:19:58,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's more about just having a plan and communicating it.

1293
02:19:58,672 --> 02:20:02,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes to a very fundamental underlying problem of trust.

1294
02:20:03,477 --> 02:20:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: People need to trust that our city services are happening, that we are stepping up to the moment, that people are out there.

1295
02:20:10,444 --> 02:20:14,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And to have that trust, residents need to know the plan.

1296
02:20:15,689 --> 02:20:28,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I think, what Councilor Scarpelli is calling for, what Councilor Mullane is calling for, is us to communicate that plan and to make sure that we fortify that plan as well, that, you know, we do a post-storm assessment.

1297
02:20:30,166 --> 02:20:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: have a good idea of what went right, what went wrong, what could be improved going into the next storm.

1298
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:38,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we've all lived in Boston before.

1299
02:20:38,572 --> 02:20:42,094
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not going to be the last major snowstorm.

1300
02:20:42,335 --> 02:20:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, it is the last one of the season.

1301
02:20:45,097 --> 02:20:47,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not going to be the last major snowstorm we face.

1302
02:20:48,819 --> 02:20:49,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't jinx us.

1303
02:20:51,601 --> 02:20:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and even with climate change, it's just gonna get more extreme.

1304
02:20:56,263 --> 02:21:02,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We might be trending towards fewer cold winters like this, but when we do have a cold winter, it's gonna be extreme.

1305
02:21:03,506 --> 02:21:05,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have to be ready for that as well.

1306
02:21:07,328 --> 02:21:15,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, between the two resolutions that we've now merged, we've posed a bunch of questions that we'd like to get the information for.

1307
02:21:17,312 --> 02:21:18,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Commissioner McGiven reached out to me.

1308
02:21:19,033 --> 02:21:20,514
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a good conversation about it.

1309
02:21:21,875 --> 02:21:30,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in terms of what we could, what he could provide to us that would be useful for us to know and some proposals going forward.

1310
02:21:31,842 --> 02:21:33,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he made it known to me that

1311
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:44,534
[SPEAKER_04]: with the scale of everything going on right now, a written report might not be the most feasible, but he would be happy to come to a Public Works Committee meeting and answer our questions there.

1312
02:21:45,635 --> 02:22:03,802
[SPEAKER_04]: He also offered that going into the next winter season, holding a meeting in around November in front of the Public Works Committee to set us up to know what the plan is for that, for the upcoming winter, so we can communicate, we can help communicate that to residents as well.

1313
02:22:05,385 --> 02:22:14,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do, you know, going into budget, even before that November, I think we need to know going into budget season, what do we need for the city?

1314
02:22:14,534 --> 02:22:17,457
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the investments that we need to be making in our DPW?

1315
02:22:19,566 --> 02:22:24,048
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that they have the equipment they need to ply the roads, to make their jobs easier.

1316
02:22:24,508 --> 02:22:25,649
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the staffing levels?

1317
02:22:26,409 --> 02:22:29,210
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the staffing levels we need in that department as well?

1318
02:22:30,531 --> 02:22:33,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can City Council be a partner in the process?

1319
02:22:33,532 --> 02:22:44,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's really, at the end of, you know, this whole discussion, what it's really about is us being a partner to make sure that public services in the city run better than they have been running.

1320
02:22:44,976 --> 02:22:46,817
[SPEAKER_04]: even in really difficult situations.

1321
02:22:47,257 --> 02:22:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to belabor the point because there's so many specific questions that we've gathered between our resolutions and more that will come out as offshoots of those points that we brought up.

1322
02:22:59,601 --> 02:23:06,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it would be helpful to have a committee meeting on that so we can have that more fleshed out conversation there.

1323
02:23:06,692 --> 02:23:21,176
[SPEAKER_04]: But in this moment, I think this is about us thanking the DPW, this is about us telling residents, we not only see and hear you, we're doing something about it so that we can be proactive going forward.

1324
02:23:25,317 --> 02:23:26,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1325
02:23:26,217 --> 02:23:29,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any further comment by members of the council?

1326
02:23:29,898 --> 02:23:35,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just really like to thank you guys for bringing, oh, Councilor Callahan.

1327
02:23:38,852 --> 02:23:41,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I just look forward to having it in the Public Works Committee.

1328
02:23:41,913 --> 02:23:47,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me know if I need to specifically request that we schedule a Public Works Committee.

1329
02:23:47,136 --> 02:23:49,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I know sometimes these things get on the agendas and then the meeting never happens.

1330
02:23:49,718 --> 02:23:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And so great.

1331
02:23:50,999 --> 02:23:52,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just request that right now?

1332
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:58,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me schedule one.

1333
02:23:58,343 --> 02:23:58,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1334
02:23:59,083 --> 02:23:59,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1335
02:24:00,724 --> 02:24:00,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1336
02:24:05,678 --> 02:24:07,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to thank you all for bringing this forward.

1337
02:24:07,399 --> 02:24:14,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this was an incredible storm in the sense of incredibly snowy.

1338
02:24:15,243 --> 02:24:18,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that has had a really severe impact.

1339
02:24:18,224 --> 02:24:22,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's had an impact in my neighborhood and my parents' neighborhoods and all of our neighborhoods.

1340
02:24:25,067 --> 02:24:31,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I mean, I'm so thankful for our team for doing their best with what they have.

1341
02:24:32,227 --> 02:24:40,536
[SPEAKER_05]: really want to look into what it would mean to get them more, more resources, more support, and more communication to our residents.

1342
02:24:41,277 --> 02:24:51,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's really difficult to clear two feet of snow at any point, even harder to clear it when we have, you know,

1343
02:24:52,275 --> 02:24:54,896
[SPEAKER_05]: hyper-freezing temperatures after the fact.

1344
02:24:54,936 --> 02:24:55,777
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no melting.

1345
02:24:55,797 --> 02:24:57,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I think today we got to 32.

1346
02:24:58,038 --> 02:25:02,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a few drips of water, but I don't think any of those snow piles were budging.

1347
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:20,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really understand all of that, but at the same time, if we're having changes to our service, this is our first big storm in a few years, issues getting the equipment, personnel, time that we need to make sure that our streets and sidewalks are safe, we need to do that.

1348
02:25:21,907 --> 02:25:32,695
[SPEAKER_05]: four years ago now, this council drew up with then DPW Commissioner Karen's a priority sidewalk clearing plan.

1349
02:25:33,195 --> 02:25:39,780
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a map of over five miles, maybe even over 10 miles of priority sidewalks to be cleared.

1350
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:46,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that would be adding to an already significant workload for our DPW, but also

1351
02:25:47,145 --> 02:25:48,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really important.

1352
02:25:48,286 --> 02:26:03,141
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that, especially in big storms like this, it's really hard for residents to clear out the sidewalks, especially those priority sidewalks that our kids are using to go to school, that people are using to go to work, get on the bus, bus stops.

1353
02:26:04,141 --> 02:26:05,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd really like to see us move forward on that.

1354
02:26:06,003 --> 02:26:08,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that requires more resources.

1355
02:26:10,423 --> 02:26:17,738
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing, if you guys would be so amenable when you discuss the Public Works Committee, I led my first ever ordinance.

1356
02:26:18,828 --> 02:26:25,835
[SPEAKER_05]: that I worked on with Councilor Marks was our snow and ice removal ordinance, and we updated that.

1357
02:26:27,557 --> 02:26:41,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that it notes is that if a ton of snow gets dumped on your sidewalk by a plow, whether that's a municipal plow or a state plow or a private plow, that the code enforcement officers can say,

1358
02:26:41,936 --> 02:26:43,517
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way you could clear that.

1359
02:26:43,678 --> 02:26:44,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not writing you a ticket.

1360
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully coordinate with our DPW or someone else, especially if that's at a crosswalk or a bus stop or something like that, to get it clear.

1361
02:26:56,229 --> 02:27:08,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not reasonable to ask someone, a resident, to clear out an eight-foot pile of snow, because all of the snow from their entire street got put in one big pile, and then fine them for it if they don't do it.

1362
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:15,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ordinance reflects that, but I noticed that that was not actually in the snow policies on the city website.

1363
02:27:15,628 --> 02:27:20,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else from that ordinance pretty much made it in, but that wasn't on there.

1364
02:27:20,574 --> 02:27:22,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is in our city ordinances.

1365
02:27:23,742 --> 02:27:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I might even remember, it's like 74-511 or something.

1366
02:27:29,564 --> 02:27:47,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That code enforcement does have the discretion to not find someone if there's been a really unreasonable amount of plow put on their sidewalk or something that they have to replace.

1367
02:27:47,829 --> 02:27:48,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, 74-114.

1368
02:27:54,642 --> 02:28:09,774
[SPEAKER_05]: The owner, tenant, occupant, or agent thereof shall not be responsible for removing snow on an abutting sidewalk if an excessive amount of snow is plowed onto the sidewalk by private, municipal, or state vehicles in the course of plowing a public way, which cannot be reasonably removed as determined at the discretion of the code enforcement officer.

1369
02:28:10,315 --> 02:28:16,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it would be really good, especially in a big storm like this, for that to be part of our city's snow policies on the website as well.

1370
02:28:16,580 --> 02:28:21,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a note, when folks talk about it, that that might be a request that we could make.

1371
02:28:23,503 --> 02:28:23,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1372
02:28:25,925 --> 02:28:29,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussions by members of the council on this joint paper?

1373
02:28:31,108 --> 02:28:36,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we do have a few folks on Zoom who want to speak on this, and also someone in person.

1374
02:28:37,152 --> 02:28:38,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start at the podium.

1375
02:28:39,213 --> 02:28:42,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

1376
02:28:44,057 --> 02:28:45,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick Clerkin, 14 Bennett Place.

1377
02:28:46,868 --> 02:28:58,764
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was driving down Mystic Ave today and got onto the 93 North exit and saw the Great Wall of Snow right near the Herb Chambers dealership.

1378
02:29:02,018 --> 02:29:13,949
[SPEAKER_21]: It got me thinking, I like that idea of putting it near the highways, and I was thinking, what if the cloverleaf, unused land, unzoneable land, I don't know if it's owned by the Mass.

1379
02:29:13,969 --> 02:29:17,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Department of Transportation or Medford, but what if that became the excess snow lot?

1380
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:36,360
[SPEAKER_21]: The Medford Brooks Estate has a stump dump for old stumps, but what if the lot, the cloverleaf was developed and it basically didn't have grass in it, it was a sand pit, and that could help the snow drift melt faster.

1381
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:45,886
[SPEAKER_21]: You could have gutter systems that directed the water, the melt off towards, I don't know, storm drains, or maybe even into the river.

1382
02:29:48,121 --> 02:30:02,585
[SPEAKER_21]: But obviously, you would have, like back in 2014, near MIT, after Nemo, you had a giant snowberg that was still melting in August with parking meters and bikes and everything coming out of it.

1383
02:30:02,705 --> 02:30:09,726
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think better put it in one place than dump it in the river, better than leave it on the streets.

1384
02:30:09,906 --> 02:30:15,088
[SPEAKER_21]: If there was a designated sort of super collector location, then that might help our needs.

1385
02:30:15,568 --> 02:30:16,848
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

1386
02:30:19,775 --> 02:30:20,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1387
02:30:20,255 --> 02:30:23,217
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Jess H on Zoom.

1388
02:30:23,337 --> 02:30:26,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Jess, name and address for the record, please.

1389
02:30:26,819 --> 02:30:27,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll have three minutes.

1390
02:30:30,461 --> 02:30:32,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Jessica Haley, Lock Road.

1391
02:30:33,863 --> 02:30:39,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate the DPW and all the work they did.

1392
02:30:39,946 --> 02:30:46,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Just the issue with our area, Lock Road, Boylston Terrace, it's about eight houses that uses the streets.

1393
02:30:48,298 --> 02:30:52,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the residents, majority of the houses are between 70 to 90 years old.

1394
02:30:54,039 --> 02:30:58,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and we never got plowed ever.

1395
02:30:59,081 --> 02:31:04,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So eventually shoveled snowblowed the streets as best as we could.

1396
02:31:05,242 --> 02:31:10,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I did put in a C click fix thing.

1397
02:31:10,563 --> 02:31:11,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone else did also.

1398
02:31:11,784 --> 02:31:16,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then obviously everything iced over.

1399
02:31:17,628 --> 02:31:24,133
[SPEAKER_13]: And my son, who goes to out of district school with the van, they are then calling me because they can't get through.

1400
02:31:24,214 --> 02:31:24,914
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all ice.

1401
02:31:24,974 --> 02:31:25,775
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all snow.

1402
02:31:26,716 --> 02:31:28,277
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just not sure.

1403
02:31:28,397 --> 02:31:29,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried DPW.

1404
02:31:29,798 --> 02:31:31,019
[SPEAKER_13]: No one answered.

1405
02:31:31,039 --> 02:31:39,246
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure who to reach out to if we never get plowed or get sanded at all.

1406
02:31:40,126 --> 02:31:44,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure who to reach out to in that circumstance.

1407
02:31:47,775 --> 02:31:52,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if we email you guys or I'm just not sure where to go from there.

1408
02:31:52,797 --> 02:31:57,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it took about over five hours to clear out both streets.

1409
02:32:00,501 --> 02:32:00,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1410
02:32:01,521 --> 02:32:01,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1411
02:32:02,001 --> 02:32:04,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to, do you want to speak?

1412
02:32:11,065 --> 02:32:11,465
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry.

1413
02:32:11,786 --> 02:32:15,247
[SPEAKER_26]: If Jess can share her address, maybe we can, you know, accelerate it.

1414
02:32:15,527 --> 02:32:16,708
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, this is what we've been doing.

1415
02:32:17,704 --> 02:32:20,405
[SPEAKER_26]: DPW is doing a great job to respond as quickly as they can.

1416
02:32:20,485 --> 02:32:22,626
[SPEAKER_26]: So what number lock street is it again?

1417
02:32:23,506 --> 02:32:25,467
[SPEAKER_13]: It's for lock road.

1418
02:32:26,387 --> 02:32:32,489
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay now, but I'm just saying like another storm if it were to happen, like who should I reach out to?

1419
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:34,670
[SPEAKER_26]: Justin saying

1420
02:32:39,173 --> 02:32:43,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously though, we were fielding a lot of stuff.

1421
02:32:43,335 --> 02:32:59,920
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get in touch maybe with DPW, you know, that's the best answer I can give it is if you reach out directly to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Mullane, I know they were really on top of it.

1422
02:33:01,301 --> 02:33:05,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You just email all the city councilors and someone will respond.

1423
02:33:06,142 --> 02:33:06,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

1424
02:33:06,923 --> 02:33:07,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1425
02:33:07,343 --> 02:33:07,983
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

1426
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:09,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1427
02:33:09,651 --> 02:33:12,993
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're gonna stick on Zoom.

1428
02:33:13,013 --> 02:33:15,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Liz Doctor.

1429
02:33:16,275 --> 02:33:18,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Liz, name and address for the record, please.

1430
02:33:19,837 --> 02:33:21,939
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Liz Doctor, 17 Greenwood.

1431
02:33:21,959 --> 02:33:25,981
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I just wanted to touch on a couple of things.

1432
02:33:26,241 --> 02:33:31,584
[SPEAKER_19]: One, I think myself and any other folks I've talked to, there's certainly no,

1433
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:41,015
[SPEAKER_19]: There's nothing but adulation and acknowledgement of the hard work of the DPW.

1434
02:33:42,156 --> 02:33:45,780
[SPEAKER_19]: No one that I've spoken to doesn't think they've been doing the best they can with what they have.

1435
02:33:47,322 --> 02:33:53,789
[SPEAKER_19]: I think touching on the idea that knowing the plan moving forward is obviously going to be incredibly important.

1436
02:33:55,150 --> 02:33:55,750
[SPEAKER_19]: caution.

1437
02:33:55,770 --> 02:34:03,315
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I'm hearing a lot of talking about this as though it's past tense, and it still feels very real to the people in Medford right now.

1438
02:34:03,355 --> 02:34:05,537
[SPEAKER_19]: It still continues to be incredibly disruptive.

1439
02:34:06,877 --> 02:34:13,422
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of streets have become one-way streets that are somewhat unnavigable in this scenario.

1440
02:34:14,202 --> 02:34:23,465
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things that, even though we have a plan, I think there is a plan that is continuing to get communicated.

1441
02:34:23,485 --> 02:34:29,927
[SPEAKER_19]: I think what I don't feel comfortable with right now is understanding the standard.

1442
02:34:30,707 --> 02:34:32,728
[SPEAKER_19]: There are so many snow banks.

1443
02:34:34,288 --> 02:34:36,449
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an unprecedented amount of snow.

1444
02:34:39,290 --> 02:35:07,579
[SPEAKER_19]: I use this as an example and not necessarily because I'm specifically asking for my street but I live on a private way which is a whole other situation but we have snow banks and people are already kind of parking illegally across from my driveway and now they've made it like significantly more difficult to even get out of my driveway and I feel like scenarios like that abound in places that I drive through and see every day.

1445
02:35:07,979 --> 02:35:08,679
[SPEAKER_19]: They're still like

1446
02:35:09,975 --> 02:35:12,436
[SPEAKER_19]: know, just huge piles everywhere.

1447
02:35:12,496 --> 02:35:25,660
[SPEAKER_19]: And I guess what I'm trying to get at is understanding the standard of what can we expect is sort of the definition of done, or because I'm not sure like what the even like finalized plan is moving forward.

1448
02:35:31,568 --> 02:35:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your comment.

1449
02:35:32,329 --> 02:35:35,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli, and then we'll continue with public comment.

1450
02:35:35,712 --> 02:35:37,494
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1451
02:35:37,554 --> 02:35:47,084
[SPEAKER_26]: That's a great point, and I think that as we've had discussions with DPW, maybe that's something that sending a message tomorrow and explaining the path.

1452
02:35:47,144 --> 02:35:53,390
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that from what I've been told right now, they're going through the major thoroughways in the community, the main streets.

1453
02:35:53,951 --> 02:36:01,234
[SPEAKER_26]: to open those areas up and then going to the areas of emergency need.

1454
02:36:01,874 --> 02:36:18,320
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that's where we need some more clarification that maybe the mayor's team with communications, along with Commissioner McGiven, that can really help the path of the next week so our residents can understand.

1455
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:19,380
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's a great point.

1456
02:36:19,881 --> 02:36:22,121
[SPEAKER_26]: We appreciate that, to bring it all the way back.

1457
02:36:22,141 --> 02:36:23,262
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's something we missed.

1458
02:36:23,862 --> 02:36:24,203
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1459
02:36:25,265 --> 02:36:26,047
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we can do that.

1460
02:36:27,529 --> 02:36:28,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1461
02:36:28,792 --> 02:36:30,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stay on Zoom.

1462
02:36:30,215 --> 02:36:32,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Robert Carney.

1463
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:33,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

1464
02:36:33,982 --> 02:36:34,563
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three minutes.

1465
02:36:35,292 --> 02:36:43,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, Rob Carney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6, really appreciate all the discussion here and also just echo the appreciation for DPW.

1466
02:36:43,638 --> 02:36:47,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're really doing the best they can in general with the resources they have.

1467
02:36:49,062 --> 02:36:53,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like a few other just thoughts for consideration for the DPW here.

1468
02:36:54,465 --> 02:37:05,308
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is thinking about just general pedestrian access with respect to parks that service pedestrian cut-throughs and various other passageways.

1469
02:37:06,029 --> 02:37:08,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a specific example.

1470
02:37:08,309 --> 02:37:17,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Down in my neck of the woods in South Medford, Columbus Park walkways were not shoveled in a timely manner after the MLK storm.

1471
02:37:17,912 --> 02:37:18,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been

1472
02:37:20,333 --> 02:37:32,186
[SPEAKER_06]: There this week, but I understand from one of my neighbors that that park still hasn't been shoveled that, for example, the key pedestrian passageway, particularly for those to go to the Hindu tempo on rear mystic app.

1473
02:37:32,607 --> 02:37:40,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, thinking about things like that, to me, those passageways are just as important as the roads of the cars drive on.

1474
02:37:40,695 --> 02:37:41,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think.

1475
02:37:42,277 --> 02:37:58,067
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be also thinking about identifying those key pedestrian passageways and putting them on the same priority level as we do with any roads that cars go on, particularly for those who are in wheelchairs, pushing babies, in strollers, etc.

1476
02:37:59,668 --> 02:38:00,589
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing too is

1477
02:38:03,433 --> 02:38:19,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, shovel plowing significant amounts of snow onto shoveled sidewalks like days after a storm, I think, can be, you know, very, very kind of disruptive, especially for people who think, hey, I'm already done like shoveling my my sidewalk.

1478
02:38:19,102 --> 02:38:20,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to do it anymore.

1479
02:38:20,943 --> 02:38:38,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that actually happened, and I presume it was through a city worker, not a private worker, but, um, sidewalk on the even side of Pix Ave right before Main Street, suddenly there was a massive snow pile blocking pedestrian access that I noticed this weekend that just seemed to come out of nowhere.

1480
02:38:38,747 --> 02:38:49,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It did get cleaned up after I submitted it on CClickFix, but I just think if we're that far out after a storm, if we're going to be plowing snow off the road, we should just be careful not to

1481
02:38:50,770 --> 02:38:51,771
[SPEAKER_06]: where we're putting it.

1482
02:38:51,851 --> 02:38:57,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was like a five foot high pile of snow that just went over the entire sidewalk.

1483
02:38:57,732 --> 02:38:59,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So just a few thoughts there.

1484
02:38:59,353 --> 02:39:02,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I really appreciate all the work DPW has done.

1485
02:39:02,774 --> 02:39:03,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1486
02:39:06,595 --> 02:39:07,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1487
02:39:07,115 --> 02:39:07,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1488
02:39:08,495 --> 02:39:09,376
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks again, Mr. Carney.

1489
02:39:11,362 --> 02:39:18,628
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that's what we're asking for, because I think those areas are just as important.

1490
02:39:18,648 --> 02:39:32,678
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the other thing that we haven't touched upon that will also express to Mr. McGiven and his team is the communication with our state partners, making sure a lot of the streets people think that they're Medford streets, we can't touch.

1491
02:39:32,758 --> 02:39:37,662
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think having the communication with our state partners to make sure that's being done.

1492
02:39:39,971 --> 02:39:50,587
[SPEAKER_26]: And the other question was to the team about the confusion with odd even parking.

1493
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:55,063
[SPEAKER_26]: and the understanding where the snow was being pushed.

1494
02:39:55,123 --> 02:40:08,934
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it sounds simple, but someone that's grown up in Medford and understand the even-odd parking and had senior members driving plows in my street, they understood that.

1495
02:40:09,014 --> 02:40:16,761
[SPEAKER_26]: You knew that if you were on one side, you weren't going to get impacted as much, so then you could plan on where to put that snow.

1496
02:40:17,481 --> 02:40:24,087
[SPEAKER_26]: in having easier access for parking in the future or a walkable area.

1497
02:40:24,968 --> 02:40:41,462
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, that's one thing, one of the things that we did a lot of, at least I did, a lot of calls reaching out to DPW saying, hey, this is the address, the plows have just plowed in an area that's already been shoveled, the person is

1498
02:40:42,307 --> 02:40:46,871
[SPEAKER_26]: elderly or irritated, and to be honest with you, they're going down.

1499
02:40:46,911 --> 02:40:52,335
[SPEAKER_26]: I know up in the heights, they were up there actually removing snow from those areas that we had some complaints on.

1500
02:40:52,355 --> 02:41:09,209
[SPEAKER_26]: So just so you know, I want you to know that that has been shared, and the habitual business owners on the state roads that have been expressed to me that

1501
02:41:10,185 --> 02:41:16,009
[SPEAKER_26]: the code enforcement office is finding a way to work with the state to make sure those people are fined.

1502
02:41:16,109 --> 02:41:17,110
[SPEAKER_26]: So it hurts a little bit.

1503
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:22,534
[SPEAKER_26]: So they come out there a little bit earlier than what's mandated by our ordinances and rules.

1504
02:41:22,554 --> 02:41:24,335
[SPEAKER_26]: So I hope that helps.

1505
02:41:26,336 --> 02:41:27,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1506
02:41:27,497 --> 02:41:28,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

1507
02:41:28,578 --> 02:41:33,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Just being really brief, what Councilor Scarpelli said about state roads is really important.

1508
02:41:34,745 --> 02:41:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why we mentioned it in our resolution, because we heard, too, from residents that major state roads had lanes that weren't plowed, including Wellington Circle, and that can be really dangerous for traffic as well.

1509
02:41:48,875 --> 02:41:53,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard from city staff that it's gotten really hard to talk to MassDOT because

1510
02:41:54,318 --> 02:42:06,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Our contact, points of contact there keep moving on, but we do need to do something better in terms of forming that relationship and making sure that we can communicate this stuff really quickly in an emergency.

1511
02:42:07,087 --> 02:42:16,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And likewise, to the residents who've already spoken, you know, I think we all saw problems where certain streets were just fully not plowed, and I think we need to figure out what went wrong there.

1512
02:42:16,873 --> 02:42:21,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did that happen when they used to get plowed in the past?

1513
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:26,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1514
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:27,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go back to public comment.

1515
02:42:27,621 --> 02:42:29,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Andy Castagnetti.

1516
02:42:29,742 --> 02:42:31,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy, name and address for the record, please.

1517
02:42:31,102 --> 02:42:31,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three minutes.

1518
02:42:39,925 --> 02:42:40,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I unmuted?

1519
02:42:43,287 --> 02:42:43,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1520
02:42:45,427 --> 02:42:47,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Beres.

1521
02:42:47,748 --> 02:42:49,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a few words to say.

1522
02:42:50,889 --> 02:42:52,150
[SPEAKER_00]: This storm was a tough one.

1523
02:42:52,950 --> 02:42:54,791
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the top 10 list.

1524
02:42:55,498 --> 02:42:57,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it came in at number eight.

1525
02:42:59,082 --> 02:43:07,232
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nothing compared to when I remember the blizzard of 1978, which was the second highest total.

1526
02:43:08,293 --> 02:43:11,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole state was shut down for two weeks.

1527
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:17,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I want to actually commend the DPW workers.

1528
02:43:17,794 --> 02:43:23,258
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same crew we had 10 years ago, and you can never satisfy all the people.

1529
02:43:23,718 --> 02:43:25,600
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a tough, tough storm.

1530
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:28,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they did pretty good.

1531
02:43:28,502 --> 02:43:33,766
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't have my neighbor with a snowblower, I'd be in deep trouble at my age, let me tell you.

1532
02:43:34,386 --> 02:43:37,689
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it wasn't heavy, and it didn't freeze.

1533
02:43:38,149 --> 02:43:39,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lucked out on that.

1534
02:43:41,872 --> 02:43:46,795
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, I say they did a decent job considering.

1535
02:43:46,815 --> 02:43:50,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been really tough in the Fulton Heights with all the hills up there.

1536
02:43:51,058 --> 02:43:54,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last question is, whatever happened to global warming?

1537
02:43:59,964 --> 02:44:01,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your comments.

1538
02:44:02,005 --> 02:44:07,008
[SPEAKER_05]: We will go next to CB on Zoom.

1539
02:44:07,068 --> 02:44:08,949
[SPEAKER_05]: CB, name and address for the record, please.

1540
02:44:08,969 --> 02:44:09,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three minutes.

1541
02:44:11,703 --> 02:44:13,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Charles Bennett 19 Martin Street.

1542
02:44:14,549 --> 02:44:21,443
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to touch upon some stuff that wasn't spoken about about the proper plowing.

1543
02:44:23,548 --> 02:44:34,539
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you guys said that there was not as many plowing contractors as years past, but just in the time, I work for a utility company, so I have no days off.

1544
02:44:34,599 --> 02:44:35,199
[SPEAKER_23]: I got to get out.

1545
02:44:35,319 --> 02:44:37,201
[SPEAKER_23]: I drive a 2004 Honda Civic.

1546
02:44:38,162 --> 02:44:39,503
[SPEAKER_23]: They can barely make it in the snow.

1547
02:44:40,124 --> 02:44:43,367
[SPEAKER_23]: So I was out there all night previously getting it ready.

1548
02:44:45,189 --> 02:44:47,151
[SPEAKER_23]: But during that time, I think I only saw

1549
02:44:49,028 --> 02:45:05,553
[SPEAKER_23]: One plow, maybe 40 to 60 minutes making one pass, uh, which is kind of crazy because they used to, the plow would usually go in years past during other storms and, you know, clear out properly and take its time.

1550
02:45:05,573 --> 02:45:08,734
[SPEAKER_23]: There was one pass every 40 to 60 minutes.

1551
02:45:08,994 --> 02:45:16,917
[SPEAKER_23]: And not only that, but they had the blade of their, I plow sometimes for my work and they had the blade of their plow pushing toward the cars, which made no sense to me.

1552
02:45:18,011 --> 02:45:24,535
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, so I have no problem with the DPW, but maybe the contractors need to be spoken to on how to properly plow.

1553
02:45:25,635 --> 02:45:30,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, my other problem was Columbus Park.

1554
02:45:30,238 --> 02:45:31,298
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone mentioned that earlier.

1555
02:45:31,319 --> 02:45:38,362
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, my daughter goes to the mistletoe and a lot of times the whole pathway leading up to the mistletoe is never plowed.

1556
02:45:38,783 --> 02:45:41,764
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was last year when she attended the school during storms.

1557
02:45:42,505 --> 02:45:46,087
[SPEAKER_23]: So I feel like that all those parks also have to be attended to.

1558
02:45:47,364 --> 02:45:48,345
[SPEAKER_23]: especially near schools.

1559
02:45:49,386 --> 02:45:56,171
[SPEAKER_23]: And my other problem was the parking during the parking ban right in Medford Square there.

1560
02:45:57,132 --> 02:46:05,938
[SPEAKER_23]: I passed through there many times in a large truck for work and people are already parked in the middle of Medford Square while there's still a ban.

1561
02:46:06,699 --> 02:46:10,182
[SPEAKER_23]: No one was being ticketed to toad and it was pretty outrageous.

1562
02:46:10,222 --> 02:46:11,843
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw so many bashed mirrors off.

1563
02:46:12,884 --> 02:46:14,465
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, so that's it.

1564
02:46:18,566 --> 02:46:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1565
02:46:19,026 --> 02:46:26,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any further comment from members of the public on this resolution?

1566
02:46:30,213 --> 02:46:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1567
02:46:40,379 --> 02:46:42,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we also want to send to DPW?

1568
02:46:44,846 --> 02:46:53,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to refer the papers to DPW to request a written report and have a meeting in the Public Works Committee.

1569
02:46:54,689 --> 02:46:56,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Malayne.

1570
02:46:56,109 --> 02:46:58,370
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a motion by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Malayne.

1571
02:46:59,670 --> 02:47:00,271
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1572
02:47:01,051 --> 02:47:01,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

1573
02:47:01,531 --> 02:47:02,651
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

1574
02:47:06,512 --> 02:47:09,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Communications from the Mayor.

1575
02:47:09,113 --> 02:47:11,314
[SPEAKER_05]: 26033, Capital Stabilization Fund Appropriation Request.

1576
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:21,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following appropriation from the Capital Stabilization Fund for the replacements at Engine 5 on Main Street in the amount of $97,500.00.

1577
02:47:21,762 --> 02:47:27,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Evans will be available for questions on the above request.

1578
02:47:28,123 --> 02:47:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Capital Stabilization currently has a balance of $10,231,346.

1579
02:47:32,184 --> 02:47:33,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1580
02:47:33,584 --> 02:47:35,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

1581
02:47:36,165 --> 02:47:37,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Evans, you wanna present on this?

1582
02:47:41,395 --> 02:47:41,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1583
02:47:41,775 --> 02:47:42,776
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

1584
02:47:44,237 --> 02:47:50,442
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, so we were looking for the funding to replace the heating system at Engine 5.

1585
02:47:51,243 --> 02:47:58,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, right before the brutal cold rolled in, the heating system decided to give up on us.

1586
02:47:59,049 --> 02:48:10,357
[SPEAKER_25]: So we were able to get this company to come in there quickly, and they were actually able to get the job done fast enough for us

1587
02:48:12,323 --> 02:48:29,157
[SPEAKER_25]: We borrowed a mobile diesel heater to kind of blow air into the station and try to keep, just trying to keep the pipes from freezing in the building while they were doing this transition and getting this new heating system up and running here.

1588
02:48:29,197 --> 02:48:36,803
[SPEAKER_25]: So they came through for us pretty quickly and got us through the situation there.

1589
02:48:37,483 --> 02:48:39,345
[SPEAKER_25]: So we appreciate that.

1590
02:48:40,862 --> 02:48:45,384
[SPEAKER_25]: So in that, that ended up being the total for the job there.

1591
02:48:46,204 --> 02:48:54,167
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's a couple little more tweaks that have to be done there electrically, but the heat is running again.

1592
02:48:54,247 --> 02:48:58,928
[SPEAKER_25]: So some, there were a couple community room interruptions also.

1593
02:48:59,108 --> 02:49:01,309
[SPEAKER_25]: Engine 5 is where the community room is down there.

1594
02:49:01,869 --> 02:49:09,412
[SPEAKER_25]: So some programs were disrupted for maybe a week or so also, but it looks like,

1595
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:11,821
[SPEAKER_25]: Things are operational again.

1596
02:49:13,222 --> 02:49:13,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1597
02:49:14,403 --> 02:49:15,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Chief.

1598
02:49:15,584 --> 02:49:16,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

1599
02:49:18,687 --> 02:49:22,210
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to approve by, oh, we got a question from Vice President Lazzaro.

1600
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:23,010
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a question.

1601
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:23,991
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to motion to approve.

1602
02:49:24,251 --> 02:49:24,591
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1603
02:49:24,692 --> 02:49:27,894
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1604
02:49:27,974 --> 02:49:28,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1605
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:36,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kelly.

1606
02:49:37,882 --> 02:49:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming.

1607
02:49:39,996 --> 02:49:40,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Malauulu?

1608
02:49:40,698 --> 02:49:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1609
02:49:42,021 --> 02:49:42,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1610
02:49:42,843 --> 02:49:42,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1611
02:49:43,966 --> 02:49:44,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng?

1612
02:49:44,688 --> 02:49:45,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1613
02:49:45,811 --> 02:49:46,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Lazzaro?

1614
02:49:46,693 --> 02:49:46,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1615
02:49:47,636 --> 02:49:48,277
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears?

1616
02:49:49,466 --> 02:49:51,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

1617
02:49:52,469 --> 02:49:52,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1618
02:49:52,749 --> 02:49:55,211
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I know you got one more, we'll try to be quick.

1619
02:49:55,231 --> 02:50:10,224
[SPEAKER_05]: 26034, submitted by Mayor Brandon Legal Kern, fiscal 26 CPA appropriation requests are on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully and recommend that your honorable body approve the fiscal year 2026 recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee.

1620
02:50:10,764 --> 02:50:19,654
[SPEAKER_05]: We reviewed these in Committee of the Whole on January 20th, I believe, and we asked questions of the petitioners.

1621
02:50:19,734 --> 02:50:22,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have CPA Manager DuPont here.

1622
02:50:22,898 --> 02:50:24,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Teresa, if there's anything you want to add.

1623
02:50:28,923 --> 02:50:31,183
[SPEAKER_11]: At this time, I don't have anything to add.

1624
02:50:31,564 --> 02:50:41,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to publicly say, just really quickly, I do have one thing to add that I want to thank the Community Preservation Committee for their tireless work for this to get to this point.

1625
02:50:41,665 --> 02:50:44,666
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they're resident volunteers, and I want to thank and acknowledge their time.

1626
02:50:45,146 --> 02:50:50,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And also take this moment to invite the public to our March 10th annual hearing.

1627
02:50:50,247 --> 02:50:53,648
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be hybrid here in City Hall, as well as over Zoom.

1628
02:50:54,008 --> 02:50:55,268
[SPEAKER_11]: So we welcome

1629
02:50:55,854 --> 02:51:16,740
[SPEAKER_11]: members of the public to come and learn more about cpa give us some feedback and share some of their priorities and um but back to this motion here um like you said we did discuss at the committee of the whole and ask i ask for your approval and support thank you theresa i do have a couple questions from the council councillor scarpelli

1630
02:51:17,597 --> 02:51:18,738
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1631
02:51:18,778 --> 02:51:19,158
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Ms.

1632
02:51:19,178 --> 02:51:19,538
[SPEAKER_26]: DuPont.

1633
02:51:19,598 --> 02:51:37,285
[SPEAKER_26]: I know I'm redundant with this question, but it's come up with residents that, I guess, brought it up on social media, then called me to help them understand again what the CPA tax is and where our priorities fall.

1634
02:51:37,545 --> 02:51:39,146
[SPEAKER_26]: And I tried to explain it.

1635
02:51:39,966 --> 02:51:44,428
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe one of the questions that we talked about publicly, and you've

1636
02:51:45,247 --> 02:51:49,689
[SPEAKER_26]: shared the answer multiple times, but I'll ask you again.

1637
02:51:49,709 --> 02:52:11,980
[SPEAKER_26]: The process when a church like the Shiloh Baptist requests for funding for a historical piece of restoration, that falls under the criteria, and that is part of the CPA that was voted in by our community, correct?

1638
02:52:12,934 --> 02:52:13,776
[SPEAKER_11]: That is correct.

1639
02:52:13,976 --> 02:52:22,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to elaborate on that Shiloh Baptist Church, as well as all of our churches across across our great community here are community gathering spaces.

1640
02:52:22,933 --> 02:52:24,797
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where folks can gather to

1641
02:52:25,458 --> 02:52:28,739
[SPEAKER_11]: to pray, to talk, to support each other.

1642
02:52:29,519 --> 02:52:39,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Shiloh has been great in that they are bringing on a childcare tenant that will serve the Medford community at large, which is a great need for Medford here.

1643
02:52:40,542 --> 02:52:47,264
[SPEAKER_11]: As well as I want to also share that this past growing season, they held a free food pantry.

1644
02:52:48,164 --> 02:53:08,166
[SPEAKER_11]: um for folks in partnership with sanctuary church so yes uh but it is eligible under the historic preservation eligibility under the community preservation act it is a historic building it's significant and it serves a community purpose thank you because i think that that that says a lot miss dupont when

1645
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:21,971
[SPEAKER_26]: when I bring that question up, because that's the question that people, well, what happens if a church in Rare Mystic Ave says that they need a new elevator and it doesn't equate?

1646
02:53:21,991 --> 02:53:32,160
[SPEAKER_26]: And I tried to explain to them that it's a huge difference when you're talking about an establishment that's been such part of our history and our community.

1647
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:34,020
[SPEAKER_26]: like the Shiloh Baptist.

1648
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:40,982
[SPEAKER_26]: I know the criteria that they'll call and say, well, we do a food pantry, why can't we get a new door or somewhat?

1649
02:53:41,322 --> 02:53:51,024
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think that the criteria that you stated speaks volumes and I hope our residents understand that this is what the Community Preservation Act is.

1650
02:53:51,904 --> 02:53:59,526
[SPEAKER_26]: The requests are asked, presented by these organizations that qualify under

1651
02:54:00,166 --> 02:54:06,008
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's important for us to make sure that we're doing the right thing and that we're doing the right thing.

1652
02:54:24,660 --> 02:54:44,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Presentation by Theresa DuPont was exceptional this year especially and graphics were on point and excellent font choices and that all of the applications were really, really beautiful and very deserving and I was very impressed with the whole process and I moved to approve.

1653
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:51,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Lazzaro.

1654
02:54:51,101 --> 02:54:56,084
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Vice President Lazzaro to approve the fiscal 26 CPA request, seconded by?

1655
02:54:57,005 --> 02:54:58,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1656
02:54:58,186 --> 02:54:59,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1657
02:55:02,889 --> 02:55:03,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kelly?

1658
02:55:05,091 --> 02:55:05,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming?

1659
02:55:05,671 --> 02:55:05,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1660
02:55:06,932 --> 02:55:07,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Malauulu?

1661
02:55:07,552 --> 02:55:07,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1662
02:55:08,893 --> 02:55:09,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1663
02:55:09,714 --> 02:55:09,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1664
02:55:10,935 --> 02:55:11,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng?

1665
02:55:11,555 --> 02:55:12,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1666
02:55:12,816 --> 02:55:13,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Lazzaro?

1667
02:55:13,657 --> 02:55:13,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1668
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:17,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Teresa.

1669
02:55:17,743 --> 02:55:24,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to the CPC and thank you to all of our applicants for your work here in our community.

1670
02:55:24,855 --> 02:55:25,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for your support.

1671
02:55:25,957 --> 02:55:26,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good evening.

1672
02:55:30,459 --> 02:55:33,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper 26035, submitted by Mayor Brian O'Connor.

1673
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:36,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Equipment acceptance from Leary Firefighters Foundation.

1674
02:55:36,301 --> 02:55:52,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your auto body approves under Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53A, equipment from the Leary Firefighters Foundation, specifically self-rescue equipment having a value of $19,573.00 to be used by the Fire Department.

1675
02:55:52,346 --> 02:55:54,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire Chief Todd Evans will be available on the above request.

1676
02:55:55,227 --> 02:55:56,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Evans.

1677
02:55:58,653 --> 02:56:01,776
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so this was some funding.

1678
02:56:01,796 --> 02:56:19,110
[SPEAKER_25]: This is actually the Leary Firefighter Foundation that will reach out directly to a vendor that we got them a quote for, in which they will purchase a certain number of bailout kits,

1679
02:56:21,800 --> 02:56:26,102
[SPEAKER_25]: basically self-rescue equipment for firefighters that they wear inside their gear.

1680
02:56:26,682 --> 02:56:35,685
[SPEAKER_25]: In which case, if the situation arises that they would have to actually bail out of a window and make a quick entry from an upper story level.

1681
02:56:37,406 --> 02:56:42,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically like a hook and ropes that's inside their gear that they can

1682
02:56:43,677 --> 02:57:00,714
[SPEAKER_25]: to attach on to something and actually escape from the building, so I believe this was something around 30-something bailout kits that will go to anybody that's missing any of that equipment right now.

1683
02:57:03,537 --> 02:57:04,098
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Chief Evans.

1684
02:57:04,118 --> 02:57:05,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions from members of the Council?

1685
02:57:09,690 --> 02:57:13,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, on the motion to approve by Councilor Tseng, seconded by?

1686
02:57:14,633 --> 02:57:15,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1687
02:57:15,674 --> 02:57:16,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1688
02:57:19,157 --> 02:57:19,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan?

1689
02:57:21,258 --> 02:57:21,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming?

1690
02:57:23,319 --> 02:57:23,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Malie?

1691
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:23,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1692
02:57:25,381 --> 02:57:26,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1693
02:57:26,141 --> 02:57:26,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1694
02:57:27,342 --> 02:57:27,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng?

1695
02:57:27,963 --> 02:57:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1696
02:57:29,083 --> 02:57:29,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Lazzaro?

1697
02:57:31,281 --> 02:57:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: President Pierce.

1698
02:57:31,961 --> 02:57:32,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1699
02:57:32,322 --> 02:57:34,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Having the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

1700
02:57:34,863 --> 02:57:35,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chief.

1701
02:57:35,824 --> 02:57:36,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1702
02:57:36,844 --> 02:57:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1703
02:57:37,945 --> 02:57:39,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We have public participation.

1704
02:57:39,526 --> 02:57:43,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Public participation on any matter that you'd like to talk about for three minutes.

1705
02:57:44,749 --> 02:57:46,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

1706
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:48,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

1707
02:57:49,632 --> 02:57:50,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilman 499 Main Street.

1708
02:57:51,601 --> 02:57:58,809
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually came out here tonight to give comments in support of Councilor Callahan's resolutions that were kicked to committee.

1709
02:57:58,849 --> 02:58:02,873
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't realize they were going to be sort of punted to committee so quickly.

1710
02:58:03,874 --> 02:58:05,916
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just want to say I do definitely support that.

1711
02:58:05,956 --> 02:58:07,197
[SPEAKER_22]: But I also want to emphasize that.

1712
02:58:09,613 --> 02:58:21,656
[SPEAKER_22]: A DHS internal memo was leaked from January 28th, very recently, that wildly expands ICE's so-called authority to perform warrantless arrests.

1713
02:58:22,536 --> 02:58:30,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, by expanding, I mean it just gives them unlimited authority to perform warrantless arrests.

1714
02:58:31,479 --> 02:58:32,259
[SPEAKER_22]: It is unchecked.

1715
02:58:33,181 --> 02:58:35,783
[SPEAKER_22]: not legally based in anything.

1716
02:58:35,843 --> 02:58:38,404
[SPEAKER_22]: It's unfounded, illegitimate, and absurd.

1717
02:58:39,065 --> 02:58:49,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Nevertheless, ICE and DHS are operating under the presumption that they have this legal authority, even though it is prima facie bullshit.

1718
02:58:51,392 --> 02:58:54,054
[SPEAKER_22]: That is just to say, and I know I'm very sorry.

1719
02:58:55,215 --> 02:59:01,919
[SPEAKER_22]: That is just to say that there is incredible urgency

1720
02:59:02,721 --> 02:59:15,951
[SPEAKER_22]: actually on the Fourth Amendment component of the resolution for an ordinance to be drafted by the Public Health and Safety Committee, I think, right?

1721
02:59:15,971 --> 02:59:17,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1722
02:59:18,793 --> 02:59:26,138
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, I'm going to just continue to encourage this council to come up with literally creative and effective and any

1723
02:59:27,033 --> 02:59:43,899
[SPEAKER_22]: ways to deal with this and engage against this clear, unlawful fascism that is creeping ever closer to our city and every city.

1724
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:51,102
[SPEAKER_22]: And that means, honestly, I really hope that every city council meeting should have at least one thing

1725
02:59:51,629 --> 02:59:56,553
[SPEAKER_22]: on the agenda dealing with this nonsense, because it's horrific and awful and abhorrent.

1726
02:59:58,955 --> 03:00:18,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I also wanted to ask, is there on the resolution that went to the PHSC about the administration working to sort of provide a policy, has that

1727
03:00:19,821 --> 03:00:25,340
[SPEAKER_22]: materialized in any context from the administration yet or work.

1728
03:00:26,598 --> 03:00:29,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a public health and community safety committee Councilor Tseng?

1729
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:31,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, saying something.

1730
03:00:31,662 --> 03:00:50,597
[SPEAKER_04]: This is less, this wasn't communicated to the city council, so chair Lazzaro might have more updates, but I do know that the mayor told me yesterday that she is meeting, convening a meeting with the police chief and a bunch of other people in city hall and outside this week to develop a policy that kind of

1731
03:00:51,397 --> 03:01:01,124
[SPEAKER_04]: that she says explore the policy, but she definitely said that, she said to me that she supports it and wants to see what we can do about it.

1732
03:01:01,144 --> 03:01:06,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we'll have a role on city council to push her to actually adopt a policy.

1733
03:01:07,568 --> 03:01:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the update I got yesterday.

1734
03:01:10,250 --> 03:01:12,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chair Lazzaro might have more.

1735
03:01:13,232 --> 03:01:13,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.

1736
03:01:14,032 --> 03:01:16,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I was saying Chair Lazzaro, but then Councilor Tseng pressed his button.

1737
03:01:17,614 --> 03:01:18,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Lazzaro.

1738
03:01:18,965 --> 03:01:22,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I hadn't pressed my button because I didn't have an update.

1739
03:01:22,986 --> 03:01:28,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Tsengha's most recently had a meeting with the mayor.

1740
03:01:28,647 --> 03:01:36,649
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't spoken to her, but I wasn't expecting there to be an update, but I'm glad to hear about that.

1741
03:01:37,109 --> 03:01:47,991
[SPEAKER_14]: We will have a public health and community safety meeting soon, and we'll have to talk about Councilor Callaghan and Sangha's resolution that was in the agenda this week.

1742
03:01:49,020 --> 03:01:51,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's other issues to discuss as well.

1743
03:01:51,903 --> 03:01:57,287
[SPEAKER_14]: So for sure it'll be coming up shortly.

1744
03:01:57,847 --> 03:02:04,532
[SPEAKER_14]: The intention right now is that public health and community safety will convene about once a month for regular meetings.

1745
03:02:05,433 --> 03:02:09,416
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's a possibility to add additional meetings as well as needed.

1746
03:02:10,817 --> 03:02:17,162
[SPEAKER_14]: But those are scheduled now through the end of the spring.

1747
03:02:18,533 --> 03:02:19,193
[SPEAKER_22]: The monthly meetings.

1748
03:02:19,614 --> 03:02:19,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1749
03:02:19,954 --> 03:02:20,114
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1750
03:02:20,134 --> 03:02:21,055
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you can do ad hoc.

1751
