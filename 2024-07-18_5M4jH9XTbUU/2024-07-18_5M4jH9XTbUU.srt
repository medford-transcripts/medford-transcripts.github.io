85
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that thumbs up?

86
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:02,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

87
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:03,542

00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And Luke Prisner, absent.

00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:22,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So 11 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, five absent.

96
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:24,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion, minutes are approved.

97
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:33,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I actually think this meeting is gonna be very short and thank you for hopping on and making sure that we have a quorum.

98
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:47,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am really delighted to report that all of our feasibility, all of our eligibility phase deliverables and getting ahead of myself are complete and submitted.

99
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like a big deal.

100
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a quick rundown for all of you.

101
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,584
[SPEAKER_02]: The feasibility study,

102
00:04:56,328 --> 00:05:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: funding earmark is something that the council had to take up and vote on.

103
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:17,053
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that at the 625 meeting, and they voted to earmark or allocate $3 million for our feasibility study that has been moved into a special account that will sort of sit and wait for us to be ready to

104
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:24,556
[SPEAKER_02]: spend that money by a vote of six affirmative, zero negative, one absent.

105
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And that information has been transmitted over to MSBA.

106
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:29,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that.

107
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:33,701
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually had to approve the language up front.

108
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,942
[SPEAKER_02]: They were watching closely.

109
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,263
[SPEAKER_02]: They watched the meetings get posted.

110
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:42,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were very eager to hear our results.

111
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they know that that has been approved.

112
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really big deal.

113
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,449
[SPEAKER_02]: and very exciting.

114
00:05:51,269 --> 00:06:00,971
[SPEAKER_02]: The very next day, I finally hit submit on our chapter 74 form, which includes the expanded programs that we're looking to study in our feasibility study.

115
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:13,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to Dr. Cushing and Chad Fallon in particular, who helped flesh out that document, both from a like current capacity of programs,

116
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:35,299
[SPEAKER_02]: future capacity to demonstrate sort of where the wait list was at, to demonstrate that expansion was viable, as well as the work that they did in the lead up to all of that to bring forward to the school committee a proposal that would have us study five new programs as part of this feasibility study from a space perspective.

117
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:45,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that, and you all approved the submission of that form a couple of meetings ago, but all of that went in on the 26th of June.

118
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: The educational profile went in on 7-1 in the morning.

119
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: because I wanted to read it again with fresh eyes.

120
00:06:54,488 --> 00:07:11,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a 20-something page document that includes a lot of hard work from all of you and the administration in particular who worked hard to answer a lot of questions about teaching methodology and in particular some of the

121
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:22,464
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about early education and child care where we have an opportunity to be thinking about studying those things in our educational profile.

122
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:24,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So that went in on 7-1.

123
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:33,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You all have copies that Lisa Malone shared with you with this meeting agenda of those two deliverables.

124
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:41,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also working to update the website so that all of those deliverables are available to the public.

125
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:44,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look out for that on the public site coming up.

126
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:48,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But those deliverables have gone over to MSBA.

127
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,832
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing that we submitted on the 11th, which was last week, was our enrollment projection.

128
00:07:53,852 --> 00:08:07,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes through a series of questions around not just school enrollment, but verifying that their numbers that they get from DESE are correct, as well as asking a lot of questions about

129
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:17,146
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the development plans of the city in terms of housing, um, housing capacity, housing expansion, um, and all of that.

130
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the mayor's office was very helpful.

131
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:35,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia Hunt in particular, uh, was critical to collecting all of the information from a whole bunch of, um, different folks, um, across the administration, including like the number of building permits and the housing projects that are, that are sort of in permitting phase and how many units they're supposed to be, um,

132
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:47,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing we had to submit with our enrollment projection was a lot of information about our special education programs that Joan Bowen helped with.

133
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:57,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a big discussion around our early education and childcare programming that Dr. Pelosi was very integral.

134
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that went in on the 7th, sorry, on the 11th, and then

135
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:16,556
[SPEAKER_02]: On Friday evening, thanks to the help of john McLaughlin and in particular, Paul Rousseau and Dr. Cushing, we submitted our maintenance and capital planning documentation, which was

136
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:39,743
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a beast to submit because it covered everything from what are the job descriptions of your maintenance staff to what should your maintenance budget be and if there is a variance between your actual budget and what you think it should be, why is there a variance, and essentially like asking us to respond to how will we ensure good solid maintenance of the building.

137
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:40,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So it required

138
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:51,167
[SPEAKER_02]: a ton of exhibits and attachments and lots of work by the finance office under Jerry McHugh and Noel.

139
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:58,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that work, finally, finally, last finishing touches went in on the 12th.

140
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:19,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I did talk with MSBA last week, and at the time, what they indicated to me was that the next step for us would be a meeting where we essentially agree on a certified number of students that we would be studying the size of the building for.

141
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:26,537
[SPEAKER_02]: When I asked last week what she thought the timeline of that would be, she indicated that we should expect

142
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:30,877
[SPEAKER_02]: to set up that meeting either in late summer or early fall.

143
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:37,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And yesterday I got an email saying that they're available to talk to us as soon as next week.

144
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:52,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be having that meeting next week with MSBA and folks from the mayor's team and from the administration where they will go through sort of their deep dive into all of the information we submitted, the housing plans, everything.

145
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will talk about

146
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,372
[SPEAKER_02]: what that certified enrollment number should look like.

147
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:04,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the next piece in the puzzle and the next step for us.

148
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:14,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that is done, all of our information will have to go to the board for consideration and approval to move to what they call module two.

149
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:14,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And

150
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:36,253
[SPEAKER_02]: that according to the 270-day timeline that would have had us at the February board meeting, I am hopeful that we will make an appearance at a sooner board meeting than February, given that we're sort of moving quickly through our deliverables.

151
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:46,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure exactly where that will land or what the lead time is between the time when we say we're sort of all in agreement about this enrollment study and when

152
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:51,106
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonably, things can get to the board for consideration.

153
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll sort of learn more about that in the coming weeks.

154
00:11:56,212 --> 00:12:02,481
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is a wrap, as they say, for the eligibility phase.

155
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll stop and ask if anybody has any questions.

156
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how frequently the board meets?

157
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it quarterly or?

158
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:18,183
[SPEAKER_02]: They meet every other month.

159
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a December meeting.

160
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,388
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an October meeting.

161
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:29,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So they must have an August meeting is my guess.

162
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's like an every other month schedule.

163
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:37,119
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

164
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, seeing and hearing no other questions.

165
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:57,590
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I wanted to mention in terms of next steps is for this group to really start to think about immersing itself in what they call module two, which is officially called assembling the project team.

166
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we will put out a procurement to hire an owner's project manager.

167
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:06,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will bring that person on board.

168
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:13,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that OPM will help us craft our procurement to secure the architect.

169
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:24,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a process around the work that the OPM will do with us in order to inform that architect's bid or bid request.

170
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:33,971
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've started reading, there is a template that I believe MSBA requires us to use to secure the OPM.

171
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:41,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been in touch with the procurement office to make sure like we have a good understanding of what all is needed from the city side.

172
00:13:42,220 --> 00:14:03,294
[SPEAKER_02]: um for compliance purposes but between now and the next meeting if you all can find 40 minutes or so to immerse yourself in sort of that next module process I think that would be informative and educational for everybody in terms of like what we need to do but but briefly we will have to form a selection committee who will um

173
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:07,676
[SPEAKER_02]: who will pick the OPM essentially.

174
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:12,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's gonna be some work for us to sort of get that procurement ready to go out the door.

175
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:23,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once we receive those bids back, we among us will have to decide how the selection committee will be formed is my understanding.

176
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:32,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there may be some meetings with MSBA or like round tables that happen that they may require us to go to.

177
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:38,198
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a whole slew of other things that happen in module two because you move on to the architect.

178
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:49,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But like in my mind, once we have the OPM on board, it will be somebody who does this for a living with MSBA and they will be able to sort of help educate us along the way.

179
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:53,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a sort of to do for everybody.

180
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:57,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still like reading and diving through those documents myself.

181
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something we'll talk about and take up in our next regular meeting.

182
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:06,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions about that?

183
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Tracy?

184
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we find modulo 2?

185
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:20,955
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go onto the MSBA website, there's a section called building with us and it specs it out module one, module two, module three.

186
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:23,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you go in there, you can like really dive in.

187
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:25,698
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of help.

188
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,459
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of information out there.

189
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:37,863
[SPEAKER_02]: All the model documents are out there as well as, you know, there are documents around like really like what they see in terms of,

190
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:50,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Costs that other communities have incurred or over the course of this next phase, both for the OPM and the designer and then in construction.

191
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:57,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's hard to look at those and and really assess like how does that compare to what we will do.

192
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that MSBA was comfortable with the allocation of $3 million.

193
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:11,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't give communities numbers, but they are happy.

194
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:16,388
[SPEAKER_02]: They will tell a community if they have not allocated a sufficient amount of funds for the phase.

195
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're good there.

196
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, the procurement will have to support whatever we do from there.

197
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, all of that is on their website.

198
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of templates and information out there.

199
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Their board meetings are public.

200
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:41,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is welcome to join, as are all of their meetings.

201
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:47,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are meetings that you see out there, you're all welcome to just join and listen and be a participant.

202
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,941
[SPEAKER_02]: But there will be some formal things that we have to attend over the course of the next phase as well.

203
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll keep an eye on that.

204
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:05,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions about Module 2?

205
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:15,124
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

206
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:32,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the other thing that I wanted to make sure that I say out loud is that we originally had an August 14 meeting scheduled for the full committee via zoom, and we will not have that meeting as a full committee, because we are very much.

207
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,681
[SPEAKER_02]: in a mode of waiting to hear.

208
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:42,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't wanna take up your time in that next meeting if there is an action for this group to take.

209
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:49,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee will meet at that time on August 14th at 6 p.m.

210
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:55,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will help us fill the gap of the meeting that I needed to reschedule at the end of June.

211
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:02,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they will be, uh, working on the communications and community agent subcommittee.

212
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:17,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be working on some of the surveys to collect FAQs from, um, from residents, um, as well as, um, a survey that gets out to all our boards and commissions to help understand sort of who needs to be plugged into the process and when.

213
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:20,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that we'll be working on is, um,

214
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:31,592
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the start of what will become a little bit of like a roadshow kind of document that we can use to talk about where we are with the project.

215
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:42,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also am in touch with a couple of folks in a couple of districts about tours to be scheduled over the course of this summer.

216
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:45,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as I have those dates, I will let you know so you can mark your calendar.

217
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:52,891
[SPEAKER_02]: My contacts are just trying to like work with their contacts and navigate everybody's school vacation out of office time.

218
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So more to come on that, but as those get scheduled, I will keep you posted.

219
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:04,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are there any other questions?

220
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Or from the group about where we are and what we're doing anything.

221
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:19,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to say, I'm just so happy that we're making great progress.

222
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,783
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very optimistic about next week's meeting.

223
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:25,784
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you member Graham for all of your leadership.

224
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:30,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was a true team effort.

225
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,492
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of documentation, particularly on the maintenance capital planning.

226
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you for that reminder, though.

227
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: The enrollment projection and the maintenance and capital planning information gets submitted directly into a portal.

228
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:52,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not quite as easy to just pop it out to the site and link it there.

229
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:58,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm working through like how to make that information shareable.

230
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:06,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have working documents that we use to like get those answers ready and they're a hot mess like working documents are.

231
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:15,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna, I'm just working on like how to make sure like there can be a cohesive story there and then we will publish all of that stuff out to the website as well if people are interested.

232
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:18,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will share all of that with you all as soon as it's

233
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:21,097
[SPEAKER_02]: as soon as it's cleaned up.

234
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:33,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's on my to-do list over the coming days is just to figure out like, especially with the maintenance stuff, it's just, it's a lot and it's a hundred attachments and all kinds of things, so.

235
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:41,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions, comments, thoughts?

236
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, is there a motion to adjourn?

237
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:12,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just also thank you, Member Graham, for leading the charge and to the whole team, as you said, it's a team effort, but for getting this in and in so timely, it's exciting to see everything moving forward so quickly.

238
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, and with that being said, I'll move to adjourn.

239
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn by Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

240
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:20,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Seconded, Maria.

241
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:23,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Maria Dorsey.

242
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And one more painful roll call.

[SPEAKER_02]: Tracy Keene.

261
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:58,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

262
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily Lazzaro?

263
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]: Absent.

[SPEAKER_02]: So 12 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, three absent.

271
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,627
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the fastest meeting we'll ever have.

272
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:17,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.

273
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:18,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

274
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, everybody.
