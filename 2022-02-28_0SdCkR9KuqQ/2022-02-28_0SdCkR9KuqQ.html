    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=0.131s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=0.211s">Normandin</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1.112s">Small</a>  from the Mustang Guidance Department brought a group of our students to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth for a tour and to learn more about the College Now program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=14.901s">Students</a>  were provided with lunch in the dining hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=18.104s">Nine</a>  of our students attended as they have expressed interest in engineering, math, computer science, and physics. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=26.318s">and</a>  all were accepted to the university during on-the-spot admissions interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=32.783s">College</a>  Now is an alternative admissions program that helps to make college a reality for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=39.989s">We</a>  are very appreciative of our guidance department providing this amazing opportunity for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=47.495s">As</a>  we are slowly getting back to in-person events, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=51.192s">Our</a>  Mustang Italian language students were able to meet with the famous Italian chef, Lydia Bastianich at a book signing event at Italy in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=63.943s">The</a>  students were able to speak with the chef and discuss some of her recipes in our new cookbook, all in Italian, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=72.005s">Chef</a>  Lydia told the students how much she loved Boston and that they were truly lucky to live in an area that was so diverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=79.928s">The</a>  students found this to be an incredible experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=83.509s">Special</a>  thanks to teachers, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=85.749s">Canetta</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=86.87s">Odugadi,</a>  who accompanied the students on this great field trip opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=93.764s">I</a>  am also pleased to announce that the trustees of the James and Thelma Connors Foundation have decided to award 50 scholarships in the amount of $5,000 each to Medford students who plan to further their education in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=112.29s">In</a>  the past, the amount of the scholarship was 3,000 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=117.071s">We</a>  are so grateful for the foundation's support of all students in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=124.322s">We</a>  are grateful for the Foundation's support of all students in Medford since its inception three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=130.308s">The</a>  Connors Scholarship has been able to provide 150 Medford residents with scholarships that have totaled $450,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=142.541s">Applications</a>  are online only and close on March 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=147.663s">So</a>  please take advantage of this great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=150.804s">The</a>  application is available at www.jtconnorsfoundation.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=161.347s">Again,</a>  that's www.jtconnorsfoundation.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=169.786s">I</a>  do have a little bit of exciting athletic news to share that starting on March 8th, Medford Athletics, in partnership with the Special Olympics of Massachusetts, will be offering a unified middle school basketball clinic for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=187.535s">Our</a>  high school unified basketball program was a wonderful success, and we are looking forward to teaching basketball skills and drills for our middle schoolers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=198.817s">Last</a>  weekend, Mustang Junior Anna Casey of the indoor track team participated in the state's 600 meter race, racing against 350 girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=212.76s">Anna</a>  placed eighth in the division two with a time of one minute and 41 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=220.142s">Congratulations,</a>  Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=222.662s">Also</a>  last weekend, the Mustang basketball cheerleaders placed first in the co-ed division in the GBL competition held at Malden High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=233.549s">Additionally,</a>  senior Andrea Saraburi was named a GBL All-Star. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=239.532s">Congratulations,</a>  Andrea. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=243.735s">Earlier</a>  today, we had at the high school, a Black History Month celebration, where we got to see dance performance today by some of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=254.679s">I</a>  wanna thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Member Paul Rousseau, and Member Sharon Hayes, who were able to make it on campus to participate in that celebration in the gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=265.923s">Students</a>  Isaiah and Rena danced, and there were many volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=270.745s">We</a>  got on the floor and tried to do <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=273.546s">some</a>  dance routines with Mr. Gene Apollon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=276.107s">It</a>  was a really enjoyable event. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=279.869s">And</a>  I wanna just thank you for joining us and participating in that event today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=288.334s">Also</a>  this Friday, additional information to follow, but our CCSR students will be hosting a gathering in honor of what is happening right now in the Ukraine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=301.127s">So</a>  at each of your tables, you can see that there is a sunflower. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=308.23s">The</a>  national flower of the Ukraine is the sunflower. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=312.913s">As</a>  this quote states, sunflowers, even on the darkest days, stand tall and find the sunlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=321.717s">It</a>  is my hope that Ukrainians can find the light to help them get through these difficult and horrific days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=330.43s">Thank</a>  you and have a good evening.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=333.172s">Mayor,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=334.493s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=335.754s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=337.79s">What</a>  time is the CCSR event?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=339.912s">The</a>  event will be at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=343.355s">We</a>  are planning to host it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=347.578s">More</a>  information to follow most likely tomorrow, 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=351.741s">It</a>  will be a gathering. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=354.063s">Students</a>  are working on some written pieces that they would like to share and they would like it to be a fundraiser and all funds will go to support UNICEF. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=366.693s">So</a>  more information to come tomorrow, but we will get that out officially to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=372.139s">But</a>  I just wanted to make that announcement that if anyone is going to be available Friday night at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=380.389s">at</a>  the high school, more information to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=383.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=389.422s">Thank</a>  you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=390.202s">Next</a>  up, we have COVID update Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=397.044s">Avery</a>  Hines, Director of Health Services, who both will report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=405.427s">We</a>  also have Director of the Medford Board of Health, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=407.888s">Mary</a>  Ann O'Connor, who will report on the latest COVID data in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=411.969s">Mr.</a>  Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=413.536s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=414.376s">Good</a>  evening, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=416.197s">I</a>  did want to start tonight's public health update with a quick apology. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=422.021s">I've</a>  learned in the last few minutes that there was an inadvertent date stamp on some of the memos that you received, including tonight's public health memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=429.785s">So</a>  this is, as you know, not agenda item five eight on January 24th, 2022, nor any of the other memos from agenda item five eight on January 22nd or January 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=443.31s">That's</a>  a typographical error, and I just want to make sure that that was noted in the minutes in case there's some questions in the future about this particular event. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=450.554s">At</a>  least it's dated January 24th on my memo, maybe not on yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=454.796s">So</a>  with respect to tonight's public health update, as the superintendent referenced, the district has extended the superintendent's mask mandate for students and staff until March 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=468.244s">As</a>  the committee is well aware, the commissioner has lifted the mask mandate <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=473.106s">statewide</a>  as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=474.508s">And</a>  you have some diversity across the Commonwealth as to how different districts are either transitioning or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=484.097s">We've</a>  made the decision to transition on March 14th, two weeks after the school vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=491.699s">in</a>  part, first in consultation with public health officials, but also in part due to the historical trends of upticks following other school vacations. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=500.908s">We</a>  know that there's a lot of travel that takes place during those weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=505.073s">And</a>  I think the point, I'm happy to answer whatever questions, and I know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=509.397s">O'Connor</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=510.378s">Hines</a>  will as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=512.74s">But</a>  I think the sort of very short point that we wanted to make tonight is that we understand for people in the community and people in the Medford Public Schools community that there are strong feelings about if and or when to lift the mask mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=526.505s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=528.657s">The</a>  point that we wanted to convey is that there's an understanding within the school department that masking and perpetuity is not good for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=535.563s">We</a>  know that students from a social and emotional development perspective, wearing a mask for the remainder of their academic careers is not something that I think any public health officials are endorsing or that we think is a particularly good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=545.813s">At</a>  the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=547.134s">there</a>  is a responsibility on all of our part to be reasonable and to understand that after two years of living with some of the challenges and obstacles that this public health crisis has imposed, an additional two weeks of wearing a mask to ensure that some of our most vulnerable students and other members of our community have that added layer of safety and insulation is something that we think is both reasonable and appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=569.632s">And</a>  so we feel very comfortable about the timeline that we've established, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=575.087s">And</a>  we know that the various representatives of our school community will be able to handle this additional two weeks of the imposition of wearing a mask as part of a requirement with the same grace and aplomb that they've handled all the challenges that we as a society have experienced over the course of the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=592.78s">And</a>  we want to extend our gratitude for <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=595.442s">to</a>  the members of the community for their patience and cooperation during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=599.463s">Subsequent</a>  to March 14th, we know that there will be a responsibility to stay vigilant and to make sure that we're continuing to keep COVID out of our schools and keep students in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=608.506s">That's</a>  something that we've taken a great deal of pride in the work that we've done over the last two years, and that work will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=613.588s">And</a>  at the same time, the way in which we meet these challenges has to evolve with the evolving pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=619.91s">And</a>  so you've heard me say on a number of occasions that our widespread testing surveillance program is not something that was going to be sustainable in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=628.992s">As</a>  it happens, we've been given a phenomenal opportunity through the free rapid COVID take-home test that DESE has made available, and we are in the midst of that transition as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=640.198s">This</a>  will be the final week of our building-wide surveillance testing program, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=645.12s">Hines</a>  and her staff will still be in support of school communities through diagnostic testing for the foreseeable future. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=654.002s">So</a>  I think we've provided a lot of information, and not all of it has sort of constituted major shifts from week to week as we've met here, and so I think we'd be happy to take your questions, and if there's any other points that I could more fully flesh out, I'd be happy to do that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=673.445s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=674.366s">Member</a>  Hays.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=685.915s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=687.857s">Just</a>  to make sure that people understand, because there's a lot of terminology, diagnostic testing, can we go over exactly what will be in place after the pool testing is done this week so people fully understand the different</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=702.212s">Sure,</a>  so I'll define I'll defer to miss signs for a clinical definition of diagnostic testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=708.918s">But</a>  I will say that the first layer of insulation is the rapid at home test that will be available to test per kit one kit for every student and staff registers for the program distributed every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=720.149s">So</a>  that's the first line of defense from a testing perspective, is that rapid test distribution that Dessie has made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=726.116s">And</a>  then, as I said, our health services department will continue to be available, offering PCR and rapid tests through diagnostic testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=732.664s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=734.045s">Hines,</a>  would you want to expand upon that at all?</p>

    <p>[Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=737.941s">Sure,</a>  so diagnostic testing is something that diagnoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=741.343s">So</a>  it would be one of those rapid tests we would use in the office if a student came to us with symptoms and then confirmed with us, sent out PCR to the lab, which we don't run. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=751.147s">It</a>  takes about 24 hours on a good day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=753.929s">But</a>  again, a student has to have that first consent form that we sent home previously, which is the one that we do through Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=762.273s">It</a>  wouldn't count if they have the at-home rapid test consent form. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=766.995s">to</a>  be able to do that with them, we would have to have that initial consent form to be able to provide that service in school, but we are able to take same day consents. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=775.077s">A</a>  lot of times we get them over the phone with parents just to make it a little bit more convenient for them because we understand that maybe you didn't need testing prior, but now you know your students having symptoms and you want them tested, we can help test and diagnose them right there.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=787.42s">I'll</a>  just add, as we always do, that if you are symptomatic, you should not come to school.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=799.305s">Yes,</a>  Member Hays.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=800.706s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=803.348s">I</a>  know I've had several questions from people in the community about for families that may have someone living with them who is high risk for any number of reasons, immunocompromised or older or too young to have the vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=817.396s">And</a>  I think I already asked this personally of Avery Hines. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=821.899s">I</a>  just want to make sure that everyone gets to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=824.061s">Is</a>  there a way or how can families <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=828.339s">Since</a>  we're not doing contact tracing if they need to know if they if they really have a reason to need to know if there's someone in the classes test positive because they they want to have that information in terms of the person at home that's at risk, how can they or can they is there a way for them to go about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=846.76s">talking.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=847.22s">I</a>  think what nurse Hines had said was to have them talk to the school nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=849.982s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that kind of got out in a public forum.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=852.343s">No,</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=853.404s">I</a>  think that's important information to be shared, miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=855.525s">And</a>  so I appreciate that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=857.386s">I'd</a>  ask miss Hines to comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=859.727s">One</a>  point I want to add to something I said earlier, our transition on March 14th is to a mask optional period. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=865.47s">And</a>  so if families have specific circumstances that they are more comfortable with their children continuing to wear masks, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=872.874s">they</a>  are absolutely welcome to do so for the remainder of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=875.159s">But</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=875.981s">Hines,</a>  do you want to comment a little on the contact tracing?</p>

    <p>[Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=879.065s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=879.705s">So</a>  just as we've always done, contact tracing is very individualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=883.747s">And</a>  if you or someone you know, or someone you have at home needs to be extra vigilant, we just ask that you let your school nurses know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=892.25s">We</a>  think of every student in the building every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=895.051s">So</a>  if we hear of something that we feel that a family needs to know about, we will do our best, you know, while maintaining someone's confidentiality to make sure that someone that needs to know will know.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1077.435s">Thank</a>  you, so our official position is that the Medford Public Schools will continue to be fully masked until March 14th.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1084.72s">I</a>  understand what your policy is, but why are you doing it?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1087.242s">So</a>  what prompted us to extend the masking for an additional two weeks is that our data as a district demonstrated that each time we went on an extended break, whether it was Thanksgiving break and Christmas and the New Year's break, that we saw an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1105.554s">in</a>  COVID-19, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1107.054s">If</a>  you could let the superintendent finish, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1109.435s">Positive</a>  test, right?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1111.135s">Positive</a>  test.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1112.036s">If</a>  you could let the superintendent finish, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1114.776s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1116.897s">So</a>  as a result of the data, when we made the decision to have it in collaboration with our own board of health, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1125.868s">Our</a>  data showed that two weeks after an extended leave of time, that there was an increase and then there would be a decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1133.99s">And</a>  so based on the information that we had, that's what had us land on the date of Monday, March 14th, which is nine additional days of masking. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1144.271s">We</a>  have all been masking for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1147.772s">And</a>  so for us to have nine additional days of masking, we can handle the nine days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1154.706s">Thank</a>  you for your feedback.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1156.269s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1156.449s">And</a>  do you realize that the PCR test isn't valid? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1159.795s">And</a>  how many, do you have the data stating how many people that tested positive had gotten ill from it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1166.903s">Thank</a>  you for your feedback.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1168.084s">No,</a>  did you have that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1169.384s">I</a>  said, thank you for your feedback.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1171.065s">I</a>  asked you a question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1171.886s">Can</a>  you answer the question?</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1173.387s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1174.987s">Which</a>  data do we get that from? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1176.868s">Who</a>  do we get that from? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1177.889s">You</a>  just said you had a data that stated that the cases go up.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1181.471s">No,</a>  the superintendent gave you the reasoning for the nine additional days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1185.293s">And</a>  that's where she stands.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1186.234s">Right,</a>  I'm asking who do I ask to get the data that would state how many people actually got ill that tested positive? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1191.657s">We</a>  have the data on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1193.258s">The</a>  data is on the tracker.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1194.938s">The</a>  tracker is it.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1196.199s">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1197.58s">We</a>  have a COVID tracker out on the city website, as well as the school website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1201.322s">So</a>  people that tested positive with PCR tests, and then how many people actually got the disease from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1206.966s">Have</a>  you guys tracked that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1209.407s">Because</a>  you can be positive PCR and not have COVID, depending on how many times they cycle the test.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1218.192s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1219.973s">Mayor,</a>  there are four other hands up on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1223.103s">Yeah,</a>  we're gonna, I think there's multiple people, so we'll have to limit three minutes for, okay, so you're just gonna blow me off and not let me in here to find this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1233.488s">We</a>  don't have, I don't think that specific data, I don't know if Avery wants to comment, but that data, I don't believe we have, every data point that we have calculated is on one of the two websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1244.034s">Website,</a>  all right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1245.694s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1418.142s">Hi,</a>  this is Melanie Tringali from 116 Forest Street in Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1423.524s">And</a>  you, again, I'm going to reiterate that you have been saying that you're following the CDC guidelines all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1432.247s">Until</a>  now, you're no longer following the CDC guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1435.54s">The</a>  CDC came out with new guidelines based on when to mask indoors and when not to mask outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1442.425s">Masking</a>  indoors is based on a number of different criteria now based on the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1446.687s">And</a>  they're looking at hospitalization rates, the amount of beds that are being used and not being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1455.173s">And</a>  Middlesex County right now is considered to be low risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1458.895s">And</a>  according to the CDC guidelines, those are on low risk counties <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1464.76s">are</a>  not required to mask indoors anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1467.703s">Even</a>  those in medium risk, they don't even recommend that people mask indoors anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1473.468s">Okay,</a>  even on those counties with medium risk, their recommendation is only those that are vulnerable or who have serious complications from COVID mask, no one else. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1483.517s">And</a>  we're in low risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1485.739s">Secondly,</a>  you said the reason you're continuing your mask mandates is due to uptick <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1490.433s">after</a>  every single vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1491.934s">I</a>  like to know where that data is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1493.816s">I'm</a>  on the DESC website right now, and I am checking all the reported cases of positive cases after vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1505.066s">The</a>  only time there was really an uptick was during the January 2022 time when there was Omicron, when there was a high number of cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1514.467s">I'm</a>  looking here right now, 12-24 to 1-6-2021, four cases reported of students, one teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1522.949s">1-7</a>  to 1-13, zero cases reported for students, two teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1528.11s">February</a>  2021, five students, six teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1531.571s">So</a>  where is the data that there's an uptick? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1534.552s">There's</a>  nowhere near going through, if I'm looking at the correct data on the DESE website, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1539.725s">in</a>  an Excel document of all number of district students reported individual positive cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1545.708s">These</a>  are the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1547.149s">April</a>  of 2021, two students, zero teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1551.17s">All</a>  the data is right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1552.131s">So</a>  I'm curious, what data are you basing this information on? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1559.374s">Where</a>  are the upticks that you say are here? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1561.715s">Second</a>  of all, out of all these numbers, what is your data based on students? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1567.86s">You</a>  say you're not doing contact tracing anymore and no one else needs to mask, only the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1574.064s">Well,</a>  we know the majority of students are at least risk of any serious complications and schools have never been known to be a super spreader. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1584.63s">So</a>  again, I like to know where your documentation is and also the documentation that you've been tracking that mask has been preventing any <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1593.542s">and</a>  preventing spread within the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1596.063s">Where's</a>  your documentation on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1597.824s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1599.225s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1599.585s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1602.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1603.626s">I</a>  just wanted to note that <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1606.257s">Well,</a>  this is a difficult topic for many, and folks that are speaking now, we've gotten the same in emails from both folks who want to stay masked longer than lot 14, and folks who want to unmask, and numerous emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1625.281s">And</a>  I do wanna say that we are all parents here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1629.722s">And</a>  we all care about our children and we all care about your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1633.343s">And</a>  I would rather err on the side of caution for two more weeks after a vacation, when children have been finally together in public settings across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1644.447s">Additionally,</a>  you know, when people are talking about science and what science, I know that 941,044 people <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1654.33s">died</a>  in the United States of America in the past two years due to COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1659.514s">That's</a>  the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1660.755s">Is</a>  it worth one child? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1663.055s">Really,</a>  I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1664.436s">And</a>  I get that we're all heated about this and that this is a political cause, but for many, but I want to defer to the superintendent and say, I thought that this was actually a happy medium, if you will, between the two opposing sides that we are hearing so much from that will err on the side of caution after a vacation, when the children were all together publicly, finally, we were able to socialize with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1687.706s">Some</a>  without masks, some with. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1689.727s">I</a>  definitely have a student that is high needs and vulnerable, but also all the other families that I know that have high needs and vulnerable who are very much scared, and people can say what they want about that but it's legitimate and it's real and I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1705.542s">You</a>  know, the superintendent and the central administration have been working and the nursing staff and the teachers and everybody has been working so hard these past two years that when are we going to finally like join together and be like, we're almost on the way out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1721.568s">We're</a>  a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1722.849s">Let's</a>  get past this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1723.849s">Let's</a>  start to socialize with each other and stop fighting and start focusing on what's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1728.651s">And</a>  that's the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1730.452s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1733.195s">Thank</a>  you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1734.275s">We</a>  have three more people that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1736.596s">JF,</a>  name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1751.799s">JF,</a>  name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1753.799s">I</a>  believe that's unmuted.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1763.964s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1764.404s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1764.664s">Can</a>  you hear me now?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1766.525s">We</a>  can name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1767.626s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1768.747s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1769.107s">My</a>  name is June Falco Medford bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1772.009s">Um,</a>  I have first a statement because of the statement that was just made briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1777.612s">And</a>  then I have a question, um, which has not yet been answered to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1782.315s">So</a>  it was just stated that over 944,000 people have died in the United States of COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1792.775s">That</a>  is inaccurate and untrue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1794.996s">Even</a>  Fauci has said that people have died with COVID-19 and not from COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1802.597s">So</a>  hospitals are now starting to categorize that distinction, which is very, very important because the numbers we've been given all along are not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1810.799s">Now,</a>  to my other point, I am still waiting for an answer from Marianne O'Connor, the superintendent and you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1820.282s">These</a>  masks are under an emergency use authorization by the CDC and FDA. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1827.408s">Emergency</a>  use authorization devices come with the informed consent rules under federal law that they can be declined. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1836.935s">And</a>  that has not been given to our students, to our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1841.719s">We</a>  no longer have a state of emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1843.78s">DESE</a>  has dropped their mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1846.365s">The</a>  state has dropped their mandate and now even the CDC says that we should not be masking our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1851.748s">So</a>  under what medical authority are we refusing our children's right to decline wearing these emergency use authorization devices? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1861.852s">And</a>  I would like Marian O'Connor to answer me directly since she has not answered my email.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1870.596s">Hi</a>  June, I believe I answered your email more than once that <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1875.388s">I</a>  am in disagreement with your EUA statement that they are supported devices and they are not classified as medical devices.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1884.415s">Right,</a>  you disagree that is not a medical device.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1888.698s">But</a>  the Board of Health Director has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1891.04s">If</a>  we could mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1892.501s">So,</a>  the Board of Health Director could.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1896.716s">And</a>  I did seek out a medical, I'm sorry, legal opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1903.16s">And</a>  that was the legal opinion as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1905.361s">So</a>  they are not deemed medical devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1908.043s">They</a>  are supportive devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1910.505s">And</a>  I believe I answered you twice on that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1914.928s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1917.409s">Thank</a>  you, Director O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1920.011s">June,</a>  you have one more minute if you'd like to finish.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1925.137s">Thank</a>  you, I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1926.558s">Yes,</a>  you did answer me and we were going back and forth about what they were categorized as and you don't wanna refer to them as a medical device. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1935.264s">I</a>  don't really care what you call them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1938.507s">I</a>  gave you the direct link that states from the CDC website stating that cloth masks are under an emergency use authorization, full stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1949.054s">So</a>  if it's cloth masks are under an emergency use authorization, then those are <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1956.801s">informed</a>  consent masks and the children do have the right or parents as their caregivers to decline them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1963.643s">So</a>  whether or not we wanna say they're a medical device, quote unquote, or not, that point is moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1968.885s">They</a>  are, and I have sent you that picture and I'm happy to send it to whomever from the CDC website themselves and FDA stating that cloth masks are under an emergency use authorization. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1979.989s">That</a>  point is not up for debate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1983.356s">I'm</a>  sorry, June, I disagree, but we can take this offline. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1987.359s">Because</a>  to be under emergency authorization, they would have to be deemed a medical device and they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1993.223s">But</a>  we can take this, I can follow up with you tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2000.648s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2001.408s">Next</a>  up we have Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2007.012s">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2008.953s">Yes,</a>  your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Healy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2011.095s">Jessica</a>  Healy, Full Lock Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2015.03s">I</a>  just have a few questions about the masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2019.093s">Pretty</a>  much, I know you guys are saying that you're doing this after the February vacation, extending it two weeks for the uptick in cases that happen after break. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2029.138s">I</a>  just wanna know if we take them off our kids March 14th, a month later comes April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2037.323s">So</a>  after April vacation, do we mask our kids up for another two weeks, then take it off and go on summer break? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2044.182s">and</a>  come back in September and mask again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2046.543s">And</a>  also for the buses, it's saying that the kids still had to wear a mask on the bus for the federal regulation, but the CDC actually dropped that February 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2061.288s">And</a>  you guys have not said anything regarding the CDC dropping that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2066.23s">So</a>  I just wanted to know about those two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2068.751s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2071.902s">I</a>  don't know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2072.762s">Murphy,</a>  if you want to comment on the bus, but I know as far as April vacation is concerned, we're hopeful and confident that the case count will be on the decline and we will, by no means, hopefully, have to wear.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2083.828s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2085.249s">The</a>  rapid tests as well.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2087.13s">Yeah,</a>  the first layer of insulation is the rapid tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2090.712s">There's</a>  no plans to institute a mask mandate as of now after April vacation for the reasons that the mayor just referenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2098.661s">With</a>  respect to the buses, that guidance has obviously just come out very, very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2105.148s">We</a>  have begun conversations with our bus vendor with respect to how the mask mandate may change. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2111.515s">It's</a>  an ongoing conversation with a vendor that we have and would like to maintain a strong relationship with. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2117.74s">I</a>  expect we'll be able to update the committee on that next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2120.882s">But</a>  as of right now, that mandate, the local mandate, is extending until March 14th, and we'll report back to the committee next week as to whether or not that will change.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2211.565s">Thank</a>  you, Kim. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2213.846s">Allison</a>  Lied, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2218.279s">Hi,</a>  yes, Alison Lied, 31 Kilgore Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2222.862s">I</a>  just, like the last speaker, I just wanted to add an opposing viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2227.406s">I'm</a>  a medical scientist for the past 20 years, and this has been very hard meeting to listen to, as I'm sure it has been for the other scientists in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2236.532s">So</a>  I just wanted to thank the school committee, the school committee members, the school administration, and the Department of Public Health for keeping our children safe so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2246.201s">The</a>  testing program for the past two years has been fantastic and the masking protocols as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2253.143s">That's</a>  the reason why our children have been safe and people are only complaining about cold symptoms or none at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2259.324s">I</a>  have two children, one in first grade and one who's too young to be in school and who's too young to be eligible for the vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2267.226s">So</a>  not only are you keeping the children in school safe, you're keeping them from spreading it to our children who don't have a chance yet to be vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2275.355s">Thank</a>  you, I know it's hard to listen to these comments full of misinformation and scientific inaccuracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2283.297s">So</a>  thank you, that's all I wanted to say.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2287.057s">Thank</a>  you, next up is Christina McGordy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2294.839s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, Christina.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2297.519s">Hi,</a>  my name is Christina McGordy and my address is 24 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2306.906s">I</a>  just also wanted to speak, just after listening to the comments, I wanted to talk about the perspective that some other people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2318.552s">And</a>  for me, I'm also thankful that the mask mandate didn't end today and that there's two more weeks since we're coming back from vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2326.316s">But</a>  I also wanna urge the administration to think about extending it <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2335.145s">Beyond</a>  that, because we are having lots of changes right now with our surveillance testing program ending and switching to an at-home rapid test program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2348.957s">with</a>  results that will not be as reliable and accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2354.099s">I</a>  don't know, and I'm hoping we'll get more info about how many, like what the percentage is of participation in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2361.781s">I</a>  know it's gonna rely more on people having to opt in and do the test weekly and report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2370.464s">So</a>  I know we're keeping an eye on the cases when deciding about moving forward with ending the mask mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2379.128s">We</a>  don't have the same data, you know, it's one one variable that's changing, so it seems like too much to to take away masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2390.882s">Before</a>  we have more time, and the other things were. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2396.563s">Our</a>  vaccination rate in Medford is not that high with the five to 18 year olds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2405.678s">And</a>  so when some other places are considering lifting their mandates, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2412.331s">And</a>  their numbers are higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2414.172s">I</a>  think it's different than ending it here before we can get closer to that 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2420.596s">So</a>  I just feel strongly we should continue offering the clinics and monitoring the vaccination rates before we consider lifting the mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2431.201s">And</a>  also waiting for the under fives to get vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2434.523s">People</a>  are talking about vulnerable children at school and at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2438.825s">anyone</a>  who has younger siblings at home that haven't been able to be vaccinated yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2444.468s">Hopefully</a>  that will happen soon, but it feels like we should wait for them to have that chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2451.552s">And</a>  like others just said, like people keep saying, like Baker said, our schools are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2458.395s">We</a>  see that they're safe and people are talking about how safe our schools have been, but that's because the kids have been masked. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2466.84s">So,</a>  you know, we don't know what's going to happen when they're unmasked so it's it seems like premature to move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2478.66s">Like</a>  so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2480.761s">And</a>  the other thing is, I don't know, talking to someone today in another district, they talked about that they may be unmasking in the high school first. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2491.948s">And</a>  one of the things is, because I am the mother of elementary school children and a former elementary school teacher and I spend a lot of time in my kids elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2501.233s">I'm</a>  thinking of everything from that perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2504.874s">And</a>  so perhaps, you know, it's wiser to start with letting them go first since they understand personal space and they don't pick their nose and you know, all the things that little kids do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2518.917s">So</a>  sorry, that's all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2520.778s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2522.578s">Thank</a>  you, Christina. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2524.519s">Kerry</a>  Laidlaw.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2527.8s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2551.522s">I</a>  just have a basic yes or no question for you guys right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2557.544s">Because</a>  we can go back and forth all night with this whole thing with the debate everyone has their opinions and <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2563.268s">I</a>  know everyone's been working their hardest to keep everybody safe and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2567.171s">So</a>  having I, as a woman who could not wear a mask for two years and who has remained COVID unvaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2575.776s">Okay,</a>  so no, I'm not here to kill the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2577.678s">I'm</a>  not here to hurt children or hurt anybody like the things that have been said about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2582.601s">But</a>  I just have, like I said, a yes or no question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2585.463s">Will</a>  the children be discriminated against if they turn up to school without a mask before the 14th? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2592.468s">I</a>  was told no, and I just wanna confirm that with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2595.811s">My</a>  children did go to school today, mask free, as there is no longer a mandate in place in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2604.278s">And</a>  I appreciate that, and I thank the Roberts, and I thank everybody for being respectful about that, and I just wanna make sure that that's being clarified.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2611.464s">That's</a>  correct, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2613.886s">Laidlaw.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2614.246s">I</a>  know the superintendent did reply to you in email format saying the children will not be discriminated against.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2622.699s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2623.099s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that that was correct and that if the children chose to go to school without a mask before March 14th, that they would be allowed their education, not bullied, harassed, ridiculed, and made fun of by their peers, like some children who have had medical exemptions were. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2641.706s">I</a>  just need to make this very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2643.907s">Yes</a>  or no.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2645.928s">It</a>  will not be discriminated against and discrimination and bullying is not tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2650.81s">So</a>  I'm sure <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2652.565s">the</a>  administration will act accordingly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2655.087s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2656.108s">Great</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2657.689s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2658.39s">Next</a>  up we have Melanie Raylan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2664.855s">Hi,</a>  yeah, I'm on the record and you have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2669.118s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2669.919s">61</a>  Brewster Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2670.6s">Um,</a>  I just want to thank everybody for and particularly <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2676.092s">our</a>  school administration, the superintendent, our school committee, everybody for, you know, just everything you've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2683.081s">I</a>  just do want to actually say a lot of people were saying they don't see any data and there is a COVID tracker that honestly has been a great gauge of just how we're doing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2693.027s">And</a>  Medford's been doing better than a lot of other districts and communicating with parents of how many people had gotten coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2698.891s">I</a>  do wish that we everybody who was enrolled in the vaccination program in school was just automatically opted into the at home test program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2708.757s">because</a>  the numbers, it took so long to get the number of participation up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2712.86s">And</a>  now with the opt-in, I think a lot of parents don't realize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2716.502s">Honestly,</a>  I almost forgot to test my kid before sending them in this week, because there wasn't a reminder from the school administration, but luckily it was on our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2726.588s">That</a>  aside, there was a study that came out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2729.69s">It</a>  didn't come out today, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2731.651s">It</a>  came out on Monday, done by the New York Board of Health and the Albany Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2735.434s">They</a>  looked at over 1 million <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2737.795s">children</a>  between the ages of 5 to 17, so that's 852,384 12 to 17-year-olds who are fully vaccinated and 365,502 5 to 11-year-olds who are fully vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2742.878s">What</a>  they found was that the effectiveness of the vaccine went from 68 percent to 12 percent from the period of December 13, 2021 to January 30, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2768.131s">While</a>  in the same the same exact window it went from 66 to 51% in the 12 to 17 year olds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2775.833s">So</a>  I just want to read to you what the end of the study says was these results highlight the potential need to study alternative vaccinated dose of vaccination dosing for children and continued importance of layered protections including mask wearing to prevent infection and transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2792.407s">Also</a>  in that 5 to 11 range, the effectiveness so that this is against getting COVID and then there's the effectiveness of severe disease and that went from 100% to 48% in that six week period. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2804.236s">So</a>  the vaccines we've given our kids are helping them, but again, it's it does show that continuing mask wearing as it has kept our kids safe to this point and that is that is the frustration with what's happening is that the reason our kids have been so safe and transmission has been fairly low outside of the week of. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2821.841s">The</a>  first couple weeks of January when they came back from vacation and numbers went all the way up to 150 at the high school and 50 at our kids school at the Mississippi as well as the Roberts and other areas schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2834.106s">The</a>  the mask wearing was really a key part of that, and we also should all remember that mask wearing isn't about you wearing the mask protect yourself, but other people protecting you by wearing a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2844.234s">and</a>  you protecting them by wearing a mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2846.155s">So</a>  it's about helping each other, which I know we all know, but it's really key. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2850.636s">As</a>  a retail worker, even the lifting the mask mandate has been tough, but people have been very respectful and continue to wear masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2858.238s">And</a>  I've noticed that in many establishments, people continue to wear masks who work in the stores and who attend those stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2864.768s">because</a>  we are watching out for each other and we're a community that really cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2868.53s">Lastly,</a>  I know I'm almost running out of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2871.011s">In</a>  Worcester, they released the mask mandate, I believe last week right before vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2875.913s">And</a>  one of the parents wrote an update that they had to merge classrooms together because teachers were getting sick as well as students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2883.577s">So</a>  many that they had to, they had low staffing to the point where they had to put these large classes together. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2890.033s">and</a>  show them movies and come up with other ways to entertain them as opposed to teaching them because so many people had to go home from COVID infection. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2899.037s">And</a>  that's something we should be looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2900.418s">I'm</a>  sure you all are, but, you know, Worcester having already done this, we should look at that data and see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2906.221s">And</a>  obviously you're gonna look at the data from the people who lifted the mask mandate this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2911.103s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2911.963s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2913.164s">Thanks</a>  so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2913.644s">Thank</a>  you, Melanie.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2914.705s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2917.146s">Thank</a>  you for all who spoke out one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2920.63s">for</a>  the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2923.093s">And</a>  thank you, Director O'Connor and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2924.676s">Hines</a>  for being on Zoom to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2928.18s">We</a>  are on to number three, which is a request for approval of District Mural Principal DeLeva and Medford Family Network Director Marie Cassidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2937.98s">report</a>  on a community based mural project outside the West quarter of the Medford High School.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2943.021s">Good</a>  evening everyone evening Mayor current superintendent with Vincent and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2948.203s">It's</a>  wonderful to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2951.124s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2952.224s">I</a>  think you all have in your, in your packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2956.085s">Information</a>  about a new installation at the high school we propose it's a grant that was written by the arts Medford and supported by the metric family network through our five one c three process to support the funding for this project and I think it's going to offer some very special opportunities for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2977.338s">and</a>  our community to come together in ways that they haven't been able to in the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=2982.222s">It's</a>  a series of kits that will be brought together using the mosaic media and have a beautiful installation that's created by those families or groups of friends or adults who want to bring together their creative expression and bring it all together under the auspice of the Arts Medford program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3003.298s">So</a>  we're hoping that this can be a beautiful way to adorn our high school.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3009.004s">And</a>  there was a concern, Paul, about the... Yeah, so the reason why I'm also here to support Marie is going back to putting the mural at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3019.976s">There</a>  was a lot of discussion of making sure that we were able to not paint on the <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3025.812s">On</a>  the rocks, but make sure we could screw it in and we could take it down if we needed to just you know you never know what happens to a building and therefore we do it in the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3034.479s">reason</a>  why we're here is asking is we're planning to do the same thing with the mosaic of putting it on panels and screwing it into the building and then, if we need to take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3043.686s">For</a>  whatever plans for the high school I don't want to get ahead of myself, but for whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3047.71s">plans</a>  are going through the high school that we have the ability to keep the mosaic and utilize it, whatever new structures there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3054.033s">And</a>  even if we have to move it to a different area of the building, we can do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3058.214s">But</a>  you know, in following the steps and the protocol of putting something on the building, we're here to ask the committee for approval to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3066.798s">Maria</a>  has done a great job securing grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3069.079s">And</a>  I think going back to the days of when we did the mural outside of the Andrews and we had paint days, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3076.819s">things</a>  of that nature was great for the community to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3079.322s">And</a>  everybody, you know, myself included, we all found a piece and we all kind of put our heart and soul into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3084.747s">So,</a>  um, I think we're looking to do the same thing for this, uh, mosaic as well.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3090.013s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3090.353s">Principal</a>  Delaver and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3091.814s">Marie</a>  Cassidy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3093.196s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3117.473s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3121.294s">We</a>  can't wait to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3122.754s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3123.895s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3124.355s">Number</a>  four, we have math after school tutoring enrichment program, assistant superintendent of elementary education, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3138.519s">Suzanne</a>  Galussi, will report on an upcoming skill building math intervention program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3144.02s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3144.18s">Galussi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3149.79s">Did</a>  the little person with the amplified voice or Mr. McLaughlin can turn you on? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3155.072s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3155.472s">Okay,</a>  there we go.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3158.253s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3160.794s">In</a>  a minute, Dr. Cushing will display the brief slide deck I have just to explain the extended day math opportunity that we have for students at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3172.055s">Um,</a>  I'm, I know this goes without saying, but as a result of the coronavirus pandemic math instruction has taken a pretty big hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3183.586s">In</a>  a recent study from the NWEA, student performance in math when compared to any other content area has seen the largest deficit throughout these three years of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3195.414s">There's</a>  several reasons for that in relation to the other content areas, but some of them are highlighted here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3202.999s">So</a>  lost math instruction really cannot be duplicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3208.602s">So</a>  when students are absent for various reasons throughout this pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3212.605s">mostly</a>  quarantining, the direct instruction that they received from the teacher cannot be replicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3220.23s">So</a>  students really, many students struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3224.613s">And</a>  when they are not there for the direct lesson, and all of the learning that comes through during that lesson, it's not so easy as having parents work with them at home, or send a remediation pack at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3237.27s">that</a>  that instruction is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3241.034s">Unlike</a>  title one and remedial reading services in Medford, any tier two math supports are provided by the classroom teacher in in the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3253.607s">And</a>  I think oftentimes parents <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3258.367s">Not</a>  all, but I think some feel more comfortable maybe working with their students on reading and at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3265.758s">And</a>  so I think sometimes the math piece can be a little difficult for families to help their students while they're at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3274.671s">So</a>  therefore, we would like to offer an extended day opportunity for math for targeted students that have lost instruction due to various reasons, mostly quarantining, throughout these three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3292.896s">So</a>  we are going to, we're in the process right now, I'm in the process right now of working with educators to look at various data forms in order to target students that would benefit from this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3306.199s">So</a>  that includes our math data. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3310.1s">So</a>  for this year, we've had two rounds now of data that teachers have to be able to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3316.902s">We</a>  do have MCAS data for students that are currently in grades four and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3321.484s">We</a>  can't include grade three yet because they didn't take it last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3325.746s">I</a>  will say though a little like asterisk to that data point is that last year not every student took the MCAS and then some students were home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3336.571s">So</a>  in terms of like the validity of data we're really looking at like the math <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3341.097s">map</a>  data, as well as corresponding math data that teachers are using in terms of their curriculum assessments and associated work, along with attendance reports and quarantining reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3356.49s">All</a>  of that data, teachers are working through, they are providing student names for eligibility, and we're having a panel review to go over that data for eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3368.8s">Then</a>  letters and emails will be sent to families telling them that their child would probably benefit and inviting them to this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3383.304s">The</a>  format for this, we would like to start the week of March 14th and have it be twice a week after school until 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3394.226s">Knowing</a>  that dismissal is at about 2.35, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3397.981s">we</a>  would have a brief little transitional period with a snack and have a solid 60 to 70 minutes of math instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3407.246s">It</a>  would, and then the 4pm dismissal time families can come and pick their children up from school, and we are also going to provide a late bus for some families if they need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3419.412s">And</a>  or if some families attend if the students also attend other after school programming in Medford the late bus could bring them to you know the YMCA. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3430.196s">or</a>  some of the other locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3431.617s">So</a>  I'm working with Megan Fidlecari and David Murphy on the late bus transportation piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3438.523s">This</a>  is an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3441.005s">What's</a>  different from this than some of the other opportunities we've had that were like strictly focused a little bit on the MCAS, which was really just for grades two through five, this will be for grades K through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3452.734s">And</a>  we would like to keep the groupings somewhere between 12 to 16 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3459.628s">we</a>  are going to be using ESSER funds to pay for the stipends and the late busing and any associated materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3468.672s">So</a>  I've spoken a little bit about some of the data sets, but just so that you are aware in terms of like the content that we're going to be providing students, because this is also an interesting year in the fact that we're doing three math pilots. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3483.347s">And</a>  three math pilots that have three separate scope and sequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3487.489s">And</a>  so we have to look at at materials that are going to kind of align all three of those and really target where the students are, which is why that the map math data is so crucial because it gives us not only standard trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3504.355s">at</a>  each grade level for each school, which is what Carmen Williams and I have been working on, which I greatly appreciate her help. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3515.325s">That</a>  way we'll be able to provide teachers with the data trends at their school for their grade level, as well as the individual student needs that are gonna be in that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3527.736s">And</a>  that is gonna help us develop the lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3531.08s">And</a>  we will be using the current programs as well as pulling from illustrative math tasks, which really has students working on their problem solving and application skills and some Eureka math. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3544.504s">So</a>  if you have any questions about this opportunity, please let me know.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3549.586s">If</a>  we could just move to the last slide and keep that one up while we ask questions, if we have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3553.927s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3554.727s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3556.147s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3557.448s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3558.786s">Thank</a>  you, this is a great opportunity, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3560.387s">Glucy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3561.048s">Excited</a>  about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3562.128s">And</a>  when you said 12 to 15 students, I'm assuming you mean by school for the group size, or what did you mean by that?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3569.073s">Per</a>  grouping, so let's say at one of the schools for the fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3574.517s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3574.697s">We're</a>  looking for the fifth grade class.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3577.399s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3577.96s">It</a>  would be about somewhere from 12 to 16 students.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3581.262s">Great,</a>  so like a small group instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3582.943s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3583.223s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3584.468s">And</a>  I am assuming that obviously this is available to children with IEPs and English learners.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3589.37s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3590.171s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3590.731s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3590.951s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3591.311s">This</a>  is really exciting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3593.612s">And</a>  will it be, but we're going to try to like limit it to the, the 12 to 16 children per grade level that need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3602.097s">Or</a>  if there's 30, you'll have two teachers, two groupings.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3606.155s">Right</a>  now it we're using the data to inform our, our groupings, because we really want to target those students that had that lost instructional piece because, you know, math builds on one another and so if students are missing the foundational skills they're going to have a tremendous time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3624.875s">then</a>  moving to fractions, let's say, like fourth grade's very heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3628.616s">They're</a>  supposed to come to fourth grade with that solid number sense of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3635.299s">But</a>  for some of those students, they lost that in third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3639.02s">And</a>  so now when they're in fourth grade and they have to use that applied knowledge to do fractions, some students didn't feel that impact from the pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3654.09s">some</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3654.631s">And</a>  so we're trying to create a space for them to catch up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3659.575s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3661.236s">Member</a>  Ruseau and then member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3663.878s">I</a>  just want to let you know there are two people with their hands up online.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3666.801s">I</a>  was going to let the committee ask questions and then we'll go right to.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3671.625s">So</a>  my only question was whether you need a vote of approval from us to expend the ESSER funds.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3683.387s">I</a>  think it was in the budget last year so we've already proved it is the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3688.488s">Thank</a>  you for the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3693.409s">Oh</a>  met member haze.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3695.67s">Member</a>  of the stone and it's your just a quick question I don't in past years with after-school programs like the handshines <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3704.316s">that</a>  kids who did the YMCA afterschool program weren't available to, didn't have the transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3709.979s">Can</a>  kids who go to the YMCA at Chevalier be able to take a late bus there? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3714.881s">Just</a>  to make that clear to families.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3716.042s">Yes,</a>  that's right.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3716.482s">Each</a>  school will have one late bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3718.703s">And</a>  their own late bus to whatever stop they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.304s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.584s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3723.746s">Member</a>  Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3725.706s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify, because I thought your question had more to do with, if there's more than 16 kids identified that need the support, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3733.887s">will</a>  you only go with the lowest, you know, 16, or is there an opportunity to expand to two groups at a grade level?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3742.128s">I</a>  think that's going to be the piece of the panel review. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3744.189s">So</a>  we're going to wait and see where the data leads us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3746.729s">And</a>  if I'm able to staff it, then absolutely we can increase it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3750.55s">But</a>  I have to wait for the review piece of that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3753.05s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3754.571s">So</a>  on that, can we get an update when you review the data? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3757.511s">Cause</a>  it's two weeks away. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3758.931s">So</a>  I mean, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3763.072s">I'd</a>  love to know how many groupings in each school we have, so we can make sure everybody's getting serviced if they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3773.158s">We</a>  have two people, three people, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3776.2s">Oh</a>  yes, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3777.721s">Thank</a>  you, I actually had a question too. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3778.962s">Thanks</a>  to Member Hays, I do at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3782.044s">So</a>  I guess, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3783.83s">To</a>  get a little more specific, I just want to know that, you know, we've had this issue where the all the elementary schools are not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3791.071s">And</a>  we, I believe it's the title one reading, where effectively, you take the bottom from some tests, the bottom number of students, and they get the services. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3811.575s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3812.853s">the</a>  cutoff is per school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3816.536s">So</a>  if one school, the bottom is all the way up here, those students get services, because there's nobody down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3826.144s">And</a>  in another school, because there's so many students that are further down, they get services, but the kids at the same level as another school, they don't get services. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3837.553s">I</a>  wanna know that when we do these, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3840.126s">this</a>  math to determine what students need services, that it's the same across the district.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3847.033s">It</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3848.174s">So</a>  we won't have students who, had they been at a different school, they would have gotten services, but because they're at school X, they don't get it.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3856.822s">Yes,</a>  no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3857.923s">That's</a>  why I'm facilitating this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3860.646s">So</a>  it's going to be the same <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3862.727s">the</a>  same data sets, the same panel review, the same process, because I'm facilitating that process in conjunction with Faiza Khan, the math director. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3872.972s">The</a>  other piece, just because I just wanted to say, so one of the things that I've worked really hard to do as well is make sure that our reading department, like creating the elementary reading department, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3885.518s">which</a>  includes Title I, as well as remedial reading teachers, so that we're using the same criteria, even in buildings that don't qualify for Title I, so that we are servicing the students where the need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3900.123s">Just</a>  because we're just trying to tweak that process a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3905.024s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3905.504s">You</a>  know what I'm getting at, though, in that- I 100% do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3908.985s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3909.325s">That's</a>  all I'm going to- Yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3910.186s">It's</a>  complicated to talk about without specific data, and teachers, and schools, and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3913.947s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3916.35s">Mayor,</a>  I just have one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3918.312s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3919.432s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3920.753s">When</a>  you get the data back for the review that you'll share with the school committee once again, can we just get some indication of if it's not exposing children, for example, their privacy, some data of the collective, how many children with IEPs and how many English learners are in the category. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3943.531s">So</a>  disaggregated data by demographic.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3949.924s">Yes,</a>  I just want to make sure that I see what the groupings look like so that I'm not exposing the confidentiality piece.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3962.397s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3963.197s">We</a>  have a few questions on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3966.941s">Adam,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Healy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3971.826s">Just</a>  a healing fall off road. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3975.287s">I</a>  just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3976.468s">If</a>  a child that's on an IEP qualifies for it and they're not at their grade level for math, do you have IEP teachers that will be able to teach them after school or will they just be in with the group of 16 to 18 kids on their grade level?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3998.723s">So</a>  part of this, that kind of varies a little bit, Jessica, from school to school, because some of it was, this is an opportunity for staff as well to participate in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4011.146s">There</a>  is a stipend attached, but there are different staff that are participating within each of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4020.988s">But</a>  this is an opportunity to help students <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4025.248s">that</a>  have missed instruction due to quarantining and the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4030.531s">So</a>  this is open for students that are on IEPs, newcomer, EL. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4034.993s">We</a>  have to look at the data and to decide the eligibility for the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4040.036s">But</a>  it varies a little bit, Jessica. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4044.899s">If</a>  you want, I could reach out to you and have a conversation with you about that more specifically for your son.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4051.863s">All</a>  right, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4052.843s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4053.323s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4057.392s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4057.952s">Next</a>  up we have Christina McGordy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4059.974s">Hi,</a>  I'm Christina McGordy, 24 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4067.78s">I</a>  just wanted to know just when I was looking at the section about like the curriculum materials used, I think this would be like a wonderful opportunity for the kids to do more conceptual building and like doing games and hands-on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4086.874s">like</a>  I know will hopefully be happening more with the new curriculums we're piloting, but obviously with envisions don't happen, but having these like smaller groups where they, you know, can have a little more freedom and targeted on concepts with things like that, I think would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4105.32s">So</a>  I just wanted to note that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4107.961s">And</a>  then just the <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4109.381s">The</a>  point about the title one fund like the title one and making sure all the schools are equal I just, I do I feel like it's hard for me to let that go like if a school is title one. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4120.615s">It's</a>  because there is more need. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4123.039s">So</a>  there should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4124.93s">more</a>  support there and I know this is sort of like a nationwide problem where title one funds are going to meeting and it's complicated, but I just wanted to know that so like. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4135.796s">So</a>  I guess it's like important like maybe like with what Mr. so was saying is like that the baseline is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4144.197s">Vastly</a>  apart, you mean like that would be equal, but like they'll be more children probably that need the service at the Title I schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4153.183s">And</a>  so that should be taken into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4155.045s">The</a>  baseline should be the same, but obviously there'll probably be more support needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4159.568s">Like,</a>  you know, that was all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4163.23s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4164.929s">So</a>  just to clarify that is correct title one is supplement not supplant, which is why all of the schools have remedial reading teachers, and then the schools that qualify for title one services. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4176.558s">Additionally,</a>  have title one reading teachers, so that piece is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4182.523s">Thank</a>  you for that clarification just in case there are people at home that didn't understand that difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4188.007s">And</a>  I completely agree with the hands-on interactive, which that's the piece that the illustrative math tasks bring in to this program so that students can take some of the applied math skills that we're going to be remediating and enriching and use that to create or complete the hands-on tasks.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4214.695s">Nicole</a>  DeMonica, name and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4219.527s">Hello,</a>  Nicole DeMonica, 51 Burnside Street.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4228.633s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4230.414s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4231.315s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4232.856s">Question</a>  on the math? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4234.657s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4235.177s">No,</a>  I have a question regarding the math program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4238.88s">First</a>  of all, I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4240.021s">Thank</a>  you for organizing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4242.719s">I</a>  do have a child in the fourth grade and I can see how something like this would be very beneficial to him and his peers right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4249.983s">I</a>  do have a question about the children that are on IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4254.306s">I</a>  know you talked based on this, but would it matter if they only have IEPs in reading and not math to qualify?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4266.06s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4267.922s">The</a>  data that we're using is from, as I said previously, it's from the math curriculum that they are using in the classroom, the assessments and the associated work, as well as their performance on the math testing, which students have now gone through two rounds of that so far in their schooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4287.917s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4289.198s">and</a>  their attendance record to see if they've really been impacted by absences due to quarantining, maybe any other associated medical issues or any other reasons for absences.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4302.722s">So</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4305.842s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4306.683s">And</a>  then what about for, you know, their grade level, let's say <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4312.908s">were</a>  they within the 16 group of children, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4316.689s">Will</a>  they be with peers that are at their kind of level or would they be with, you know, just a whole group of level of people in their grade?</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4326.772s">But</a>  they will be with their grade level peers.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4329.993s">But</a>  like, let's say like my child is on IEP, would he be with other children that are in other IEPs or will he be with somebody who is a little more advanced in math, but maybe missed, you know, some school days? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4343.493s">And</a>  he'll be with his fourth grade peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4345.595s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4348.739s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4349.019s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4349.359s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4350.561s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4352.082s">Thank</a>  you, miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4353.544s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4356.467s">Next</a>  up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4356.868s">We</a>  have number five grant updates from assistant superintendent of secondary education. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4361.953s">Dr.</a>  Peter J. Cushing, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4367.723s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4369.805s">I</a>  really appreciate the opportunity to come and give you a quick report today on two grants that we have applied for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4377.412s">One</a>  is confirmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4378.452s">It's</a>  a financial literacy grant to help our students purchase some curriculum materials, as well as to support the credit for life program that former assistant principal Gail Treanor ran for much of the time that it was in existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4395.367s">The</a>  program predates me so I don't have the full history to share with you, but it is valuable program that is typically available to our junior class, but with the pandemic I know that we are looking at other classes that may have missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4410.457s">So</a>  that's one that is a grant confirmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4414.48s">Another</a>  one that we've applied for and we have high anticipation that we'll receive it just because of the way the grant is structured is a $55,000 grant for a 20 hour math academy for secondary students, grades six through 12 over April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4432.612s">I</a>  will let the committee know that I'm concerned about the challenges of recruiting staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4437.155s">just</a>  because of the stress, anxiety, and the challenges that many educators are facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4443.677s">But</a>  we are able to offer, I believe, $3,500 for the four days of work because there is a state holiday, Patriots Day, on that Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4454.34s">And</a>  while we could offer the program through Saturday, we plan to offer five hours of math instruction <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4463.803s">diversify</a>  it with some games, some other things to really help the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4468.247s">Everything</a>  will have a math focus, but we do want to make sure that you're aware that it will be a rigorous program and we should be able to get a number of teachers in for a really good stipend for those four days and some planning time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4485.072s">We'll</a>  provide breakfast and lunch for students, and we'll have about 10% of that total would be for any materials that we might need. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4494.818s">I</a>  would like to really thank Michelle Bissell and Faiza Khan as two people who stand out as for really helping us with both of these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4505.46s">I</a>  apologize to those people that I may have forgotten with the financial literacy grant, but I believe it was Mr. Fallon, Mr. Rose Walker and Mr. Delaver as well to help us get that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4516.362s">And</a>  every little bit helps to help our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4519.763s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4520.403s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4521.323s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4525.415s">Member</a>  miss stone, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4528.306s">How</a>  do students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4529.537s">Do</a>  they self-identify that they want to do the math program or would math teachers?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4533.819s">So</a>  we're going to work with math teachers as well as looking at our map growth data, looking at historic MCAS data, and just really trying to get an overall picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4544.963s">We</a>  don't want any one piece of data to really dictate, but to try to develop an entire picture of the student to be able to bring them to this and invite them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4556.436s">We're</a>  going to keep the groups small, about 12 to 15 students, so that we can get maximum impact.</p>
