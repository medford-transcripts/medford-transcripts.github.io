    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=0.131s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=0.211s">Normandin</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1.112s">Small</a>  from the Mustang Guidance Department brought a group of our students to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth for a tour and to learn more about the College Now program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=14.901s">Students</a>  were provided with lunch in the dining hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=18.104s">Nine</a>  of our students attended as they have expressed interest in engineering, math, computer science, and physics. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=26.318s">and</a>  all were accepted to the university during on-the-spot admissions interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=32.783s">College</a>  Now is an alternative admissions program that helps to make college a reality for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=39.989s">We</a>  are very appreciative of our guidance department providing this amazing opportunity for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=47.495s">As</a>  we are slowly getting back to in-person events, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=51.192s">Our</a>  Mustang Italian language students were able to meet with the famous Italian chef, Lydia Bastianich at a book signing event at Italy in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=63.943s">The</a>  students were able to speak with the chef and discuss some of her recipes in our new cookbook, all in Italian, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=72.005s">Chef</a>  Lydia told the students how much she loved Boston and that they were truly lucky to live in an area that was so diverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=79.928s">The</a>  students found this to be an incredible experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=83.509s">Special</a>  thanks to teachers, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=85.749s">Canetta</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=86.87s">Odugadi,</a>  who accompanied the students on this great field trip opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=93.764s">I</a>  am also pleased to announce that the trustees of the James and Thelma Connors Foundation have decided to award 50 scholarships in the amount of $5,000 each to Medford students who plan to further their education in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=112.29s">In</a>  the past, the amount of the scholarship was 3,000 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=117.071s">We</a>  are so grateful for the foundation's support of all students in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=124.322s">We</a>  are grateful for the Foundation's support of all students in Medford since its inception three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=130.308s">The</a>  Connors Scholarship has been able to provide 150 Medford residents with scholarships that have totaled $450,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=142.541s">Applications</a>  are online only and close on March 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=147.663s">So</a>  please take advantage of this great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=150.804s">The</a>  application is available at www.jtconnorsfoundation.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=161.347s">Again,</a>  that's www.jtconnorsfoundation.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=169.786s">I</a>  do have a little bit of exciting athletic news to share that starting on March 8th, Medford Athletics, in partnership with the Special Olympics of Massachusetts, will be offering a unified middle school basketball clinic for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=187.535s">Our</a>  high school unified basketball program was a wonderful success, and we are looking forward to teaching basketball skills and drills for our middle schoolers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=198.817s">Last</a>  weekend, Mustang Junior Anna Casey of the indoor track team participated in the state's 600 meter race, racing against 350 girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=212.76s">Anna</a>  placed eighth in the division two with a time of one minute and 41 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=220.142s">Congratulations,</a>  Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=222.662s">Also</a>  last weekend, the Mustang basketball cheerleaders placed first in the co-ed division in the GBL competition held at Malden High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=233.549s">Additionally,</a>  senior Andrea Saraburi was named a GBL All-Star. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=239.532s">Congratulations,</a>  Andrea. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=243.735s">Earlier</a>  today, we had at the high school, a Black History Month celebration, where we got to see dance performance today by some of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=254.679s">I</a>  wanna thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Member Paul Rousseau, and Member Sharon Hayes, who were able to make it on campus to participate in that celebration in the gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=265.923s">Students</a>  Isaiah and Rena danced, and there were many volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=270.745s">We</a>  got on the floor and tried to do <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=273.546s">some</a>  dance routines with Mr. Gene Apollon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=276.107s">It</a>  was a really enjoyable event. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=279.869s">And</a>  I wanna just thank you for joining us and participating in that event today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=288.334s">Also</a>  this Friday, additional information to follow, but our CCSR students will be hosting a gathering in honor of what is happening right now in the Ukraine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=301.127s">So</a>  at each of your tables, you can see that there is a sunflower. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=308.23s">The</a>  national flower of the Ukraine is the sunflower. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=312.913s">As</a>  this quote states, sunflowers, even on the darkest days, stand tall and find the sunlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=321.717s">It</a>  is my hope that Ukrainians can find the light to help them get through these difficult and horrific days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=330.43s">Thank</a>  you and have a good evening.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=333.172s">Mayor,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=334.493s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=335.754s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=337.79s">What</a>  time is the CCSR event?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=339.912s">The</a>  event will be at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=343.355s">We</a>  are planning to host it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=347.578s">More</a>  information to follow most likely tomorrow, 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=351.741s">It</a>  will be a gathering. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=354.063s">Students</a>  are working on some written pieces that they would like to share and they would like it to be a fundraiser and all funds will go to support UNICEF. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=366.693s">So</a>  more information to come tomorrow, but we will get that out officially to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=372.139s">But</a>  I just wanted to make that announcement that if anyone is going to be available Friday night at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=380.389s">at</a>  the high school, more information to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=383.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=389.422s">Thank</a>  you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=390.202s">Next</a>  up, we have COVID update Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=397.044s">Avery</a>  Hines, Director of Health Services, who both will report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=405.427s">We</a>  also have Director of the Medford Board of Health, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=407.888s">Mary</a>  Ann O'Connor, who will report on the latest COVID data in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=411.969s">Mr.</a>  Murphy.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=413.536s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=414.376s">Good</a>  evening, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=416.197s">I</a>  did want to start tonight's public health update with a quick apology. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=422.021s">I've</a>  learned in the last few minutes that there was an inadvertent date stamp on some of the memos that you received, including tonight's public health memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=429.785s">So</a>  this is, as you know, not agenda item five eight on January 24th, 2022, nor any of the other memos from agenda item five eight on January 22nd or January 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=443.31s">That's</a>  a typographical error, and I just want to make sure that that was noted in the minutes in case there's some questions in the future about this particular event. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=450.554s">At</a>  least it's dated January 24th on my memo, maybe not on yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=454.796s">So</a>  with respect to tonight's public health update, as the superintendent referenced, the district has extended the superintendent's mask mandate for students and staff until March 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=468.244s">As</a>  the committee is well aware, the commissioner has lifted the mask mandate <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=473.106s">statewide</a>  as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=474.508s">And</a>  you have some diversity across the Commonwealth as to how different districts are either transitioning or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=484.097s">We've</a>  made the decision to transition on March 14th, two weeks after the school vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=491.699s">in</a>  part, first in consultation with public health officials, but also in part due to the historical trends of upticks following other school vacations. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=500.908s">We</a>  know that there's a lot of travel that takes place during those weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=505.073s">And</a>  I think the point, I'm happy to answer whatever questions, and I know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=509.397s">O'Connor</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=510.378s">Hines</a>  will as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=512.74s">But</a>  I think the sort of very short point that we wanted to make tonight is that we understand for people in the community and people in the Medford Public Schools community that there are strong feelings about if and or when to lift the mask mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=526.505s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=528.657s">The</a>  point that we wanted to convey is that there's an understanding within the school department that masking and perpetuity is not good for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=535.563s">We</a>  know that students from a social and emotional development perspective, wearing a mask for the remainder of their academic careers is not something that I think any public health officials are endorsing or that we think is a particularly good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=545.813s">At</a>  the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=547.134s">there</a>  is a responsibility on all of our part to be reasonable and to understand that after two years of living with some of the challenges and obstacles that this public health crisis has imposed, an additional two weeks of wearing a mask to ensure that some of our most vulnerable students and other members of our community have that added layer of safety and insulation is something that we think is both reasonable and appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=569.632s">And</a>  so we feel very comfortable about the timeline that we've established, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=575.087s">And</a>  we know that the various representatives of our school community will be able to handle this additional two weeks of the imposition of wearing a mask as part of a requirement with the same grace and aplomb that they've handled all the challenges that we as a society have experienced over the course of the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=592.78s">And</a>  we want to extend our gratitude for <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=595.442s">to</a>  the members of the community for their patience and cooperation during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=599.463s">Subsequent</a>  to March 14th, we know that there will be a responsibility to stay vigilant and to make sure that we're continuing to keep COVID out of our schools and keep students in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=608.506s">That's</a>  something that we've taken a great deal of pride in the work that we've done over the last two years, and that work will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=613.588s">And</a>  at the same time, the way in which we meet these challenges has to evolve with the evolving pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=619.91s">And</a>  so you've heard me say on a number of occasions that our widespread testing surveillance program is not something that was going to be sustainable in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=628.992s">As</a>  it happens, we've been given a phenomenal opportunity through the free rapid COVID take-home test that DESE has made available, and we are in the midst of that transition as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=640.198s">This</a>  will be the final week of our building-wide surveillance testing program, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=645.12s">Hines</a>  and her staff will still be in support of school communities through diagnostic testing for the foreseeable future. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=654.002s">So</a>  I think we've provided a lot of information, and not all of it has sort of constituted major shifts from week to week as we've met here, and so I think we'd be happy to take your questions, and if there's any other points that I could more fully flesh out, I'd be happy to do that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=673.445s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=674.366s">Member</a>  Hays.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=685.915s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=687.857s">Just</a>  to make sure that people understand, because there's a lot of terminology, diagnostic testing, can we go over exactly what will be in place after the pool testing is done this week so people fully understand the different</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=702.212s">Sure,</a>  so I'll define I'll defer to miss signs for a clinical definition of diagnostic testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=708.918s">But</a>  I will say that the first layer of insulation is the rapid at home test that will be available to test per kit one kit for every student and staff registers for the program distributed every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=720.149s">So</a>  that's the first line of defense from a testing perspective, is that rapid test distribution that Dessie has made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=726.116s">And</a>  then, as I said, our health services department will continue to be available, offering PCR and rapid tests through diagnostic testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=732.664s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=734.045s">Hines,</a>  would you want to expand upon that at all?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=737.941s">Sure,</a>  so diagnostic testing is something that diagnoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=741.343s">So</a>  it would be one of those rapid tests we would use in the office if a student came to us with symptoms and then confirmed with us, sent out PCR to the lab, which we don't run. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=751.147s">It</a>  takes about 24 hours on a good day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=753.929s">But</a>  again, a student has to have that first consent form that we sent home previously, which is the one that we do through Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=762.273s">It</a>  wouldn't count if they have the at-home rapid test consent form. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=766.995s">to</a>  be able to do that with them, we would have to have that initial consent form to be able to provide that service in school, but we are able to take same day consents. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=775.077s">A</a>  lot of times we get them over the phone with parents just to make it a little bit more convenient for them because we understand that maybe you didn't need testing prior, but now you know your students having symptoms and you want them tested, we can help test and diagnose them right there.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=787.42s">I'll</a>  just add, as we always do, that if you are symptomatic, you should not come to school.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=799.305s">Yes,</a>  Member Hays.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=800.706s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=803.348s">I</a>  know I've had several questions from people in the community about for families that may have someone living with them who is high risk for any number of reasons, immunocompromised or older or too young to have the vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=817.396s">And</a>  I think I already asked this personally of Avery Hines. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=821.899s">I</a>  just want to make sure that everyone gets to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=824.061s">Is</a>  there a way or how can families <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=828.339s">Since</a>  we're not doing contact tracing if they need to know if they if they really have a reason to need to know if there's someone in the classes test positive because they they want to have that information in terms of the person at home that's at risk, how can they or can they is there a way for them to go about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=846.76s">talking.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=847.22s">I</a>  think what nurse Hines had said was to have them talk to the school nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=849.982s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that kind of got out in a public forum.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=852.343s">No,</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=853.404s">I</a>  think that's important information to be shared, miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=855.525s">And</a>  so I appreciate that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=857.386s">I'd</a>  ask miss Hines to comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=859.727s">One</a>  point I want to add to something I said earlier, our transition on March 14th is to a mask optional period. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=865.47s">And</a>  so if families have specific circumstances that they are more comfortable with their children continuing to wear masks, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=872.874s">they</a>  are absolutely welcome to do so for the remainder of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=875.159s">But</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=875.981s">Hines,</a>  do you want to comment a little on the contact tracing?</p>

    <p>[Avery Hines]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=879.065s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=879.705s">So</a>  just as we've always done, contact tracing is very individualized. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=883.747s">And</a>  if you or someone you know, or someone you have at home needs to be extra vigilant, we just ask that you let your school nurses know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=892.25s">We</a>  think of every student in the building every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=895.051s">So</a>  if we hear of something that we feel that a family needs to know about, we will do our best, you know, while maintaining someone's confidentiality to make sure that someone that needs to know will know.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=915.775s">We</a>  have a mayor member of Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=918.316s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that there weren't members of the audience who wanted to speak on this topic because this would be the opportunity for them to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=926.999s">Is</a>  there anybody who was wanting to speak on this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=930.36s">I'm</a>  not, you don't have to, if you don't want to, I just wanted to make sure that everyone knew that now would be the time for that.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=943.182s">Just</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=945.383s">I'll</a>  tell you, my name is Tiffany Bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=946.644s">I</a>  live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=948.726s">His</a>  daughter goes to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=952.809s">I'm</a>  just really confused as to where you get your science from. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=956.533s">If</a>  it's just the CDC, because I've called your office before and you said, Oh, we're just following the CDC's guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=963.238s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=963.418s">And</a>  now we're getting, we're going to wait two weeks to unmask our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=967.39s">They've</a>  had masks on that don't stop viruses, period, for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=975.154s">Why</a>  are we extending this? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=977.275s">You</a>  say there's gonna be an outbreak? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=978.996s">This</a>  virus is getting weaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=981.217s">Now</a>  it's just basically like a cold virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=983.899s">So</a>  did you guys throw the baby out with the bathwater when the flu came through all these other times? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=990.882s">No,</a>  you didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=993.137s">It's</a>  really, I'm just beyond frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=995.298s">I</a>  have a book here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=996.039s">All</a>  right, I have this, Cruz, masks don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1002.103s">These</a>  are studies, each individual thing, studies upon studies that says masks are not valid for the purpose that you're using them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1012.809s">People</a>  are, the kids are falling behind in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1016.995s">Even</a>  the little, little ones, you're saying, oh, we have to wait for the vaccine, but the vaccine does not prevent transmission nor someone from getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1025.638s">So</a>  what the hell are we waiting for? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1027.418s">It's</a>  time to strengthen their immunity with diet, exercise, good food, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1034.06s">You</a>  can prevent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1036.181s">I've</a>  worked this entire pandemic frontline, no mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1040.242s">Am</a>  I dead? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1041.142s">Do</a>  you guys see me? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1041.822s">I'm</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1043.663s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1045.315s">My</a>  80-year-old father just got COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1047.796s">Supplements,</a>  nutrition, no vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1050.637s">He's</a>  still here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1052.918s">This</a>  is sheer insanity, what we're doing to our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1057.4s">Where's</a>  the science? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1058.38s">What</a>  science did you use? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1060.121s">Where?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1061.382s">Avery</a>  too, I've spoken to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1063.823s">Oh,</a>  we're just following the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1065.543s">Well,</a>  they've changed their mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1066.864s">They</a>  say, take the masks off the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1069.165s">And</a>  yet you guys want to still muscle them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1071.026s">I</a>  don't understand what y'all are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1075.216s">I</a>  don't.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1077.435s">Thank</a>  you, so our official position is that the Medford Public Schools will continue to be fully masked until March 14th.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1084.72s">I</a>  understand what your policy is, but why are you doing it?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1087.242s">So</a>  what prompted us to extend the masking for an additional two weeks is that our data as a district demonstrated that each time we went on an extended break, whether it was Thanksgiving break and Christmas and the New Year's break, that we saw an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1105.554s">in</a>  COVID-19, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1107.054s">If</a>  you could let the superintendent finish, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1109.435s">Positive</a>  test, right?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1111.135s">Positive</a>  test.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1112.036s">If</a>  you could let the superintendent finish, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1114.776s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1116.897s">So</a>  as a result of the data, when we made the decision to have it in collaboration with our own board of health, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1125.868s">Our</a>  data showed that two weeks after an extended leave of time, that there was an increase and then there would be a decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1133.99s">And</a>  so based on the information that we had, that's what had us land on the date of Monday, March 14th, which is nine additional days of masking. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1144.271s">We</a>  have all been masking for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1147.772s">And</a>  so for us to have nine additional days of masking, we can handle the nine days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1154.706s">Thank</a>  you for your feedback.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1156.269s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1156.449s">And</a>  do you realize that the PCR test isn't valid? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1159.795s">And</a>  how many, do you have the data stating how many people that tested positive had gotten ill from it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1166.903s">Thank</a>  you for your feedback.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1168.084s">No,</a>  did you have that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1169.384s">I</a>  said, thank you for your feedback.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1171.065s">I</a>  asked you a question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1171.886s">Can</a>  you answer the question?</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1173.387s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1174.987s">Which</a>  data do we get that from? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1176.868s">Who</a>  do we get that from? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1177.889s">You</a>  just said you had a data that stated that the cases go up.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1181.471s">No,</a>  the superintendent gave you the reasoning for the nine additional days. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1185.293s">And</a>  that's where she stands.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1186.234s">Right,</a>  I'm asking who do I ask to get the data that would state how many people actually got ill that tested positive? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1191.657s">We</a>  have the data on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1193.258s">The</a>  data is on the tracker.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1194.938s">The</a>  tracker is it.</p>

    <p>[Bair]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1196.199s">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1197.58s">We</a>  have a COVID tracker out on the city website, as well as the school website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1201.322s">So</a>  people that tested positive with PCR tests, and then how many people actually got the disease from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1206.966s">Have</a>  you guys tracked that? <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1209.407s">Because</a>  you can be positive PCR and not have COVID, depending on how many times they cycle the test.</p>
