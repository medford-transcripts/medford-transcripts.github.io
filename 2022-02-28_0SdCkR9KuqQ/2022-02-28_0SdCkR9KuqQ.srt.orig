1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:00,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

2
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Normandin and Ms.

3
00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:13,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Small from the Mustang Guidance Department brought a group of our students to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth for a tour and to learn more about the College Now program.

4
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:17,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Students were provided with lunch in the dining hall.

5
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:25,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Nine of our students attended as they have expressed interest in engineering, math, computer science, and physics.

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:31,562
[SPEAKER_14]: and all were accepted to the university during on-the-spot admissions interviews.

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:39,008
[SPEAKER_14]: College Now is an alternative admissions program that helps to make college a reality for all students.

8
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,773
[SPEAKER_14]: We are very appreciative of our guidance department providing this amazing opportunity for our students.

9
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,877
[SPEAKER_14]: As we are slowly getting back to in-person events,

10
00:00:51,192 --> 00:01:02,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Our Mustang Italian language students were able to meet with the famous Italian chef, Lydia Bastianich at a book signing event at Italy in Boston.

11
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:11,125
[SPEAKER_14]: The students were able to speak with the chef and discuss some of her recipes in our new cookbook, all in Italian, of course.

12
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:18,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Chef Lydia told the students how much she loved Boston and that they were truly lucky to live in an area that was so diverse.

13
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:22,748
[SPEAKER_14]: The students found this to be an incredible experience.

14
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:25,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Special thanks to teachers, Ms.

15
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:26,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Canetta and Ms.

16
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Odugadi, who accompanied the students on this great field trip opportunity.

17
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:51,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I am also pleased to announce that the trustees of the James and Thelma Connors Foundation have decided to award 50 scholarships in the amount of $5,000 each to Medford students who plan to further their education in the fall.

18
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,031
[SPEAKER_14]: In the past, the amount of the scholarship was 3,000 per student.

19
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:02,213
[SPEAKER_14]: We are so grateful for the foundation's support of all students in Medford.

20
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:09,788
[SPEAKER_14]: We are grateful for the Foundation's support of all students in Medford since its inception three years ago.

21
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:18,617
[SPEAKER_14]: The Connors Scholarship has been able to provide 150 Medford residents with scholarships that have totaled $450,000.

22
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:27,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Applications are online only and close on March 30th.

23
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:30,063
[SPEAKER_14]: So please take advantage of this great opportunity.

24
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:40,787
[SPEAKER_14]: The application is available at www.jtconnorsfoundation.org.

25
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:47,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, that's www.jtconnorsfoundation.org.

26
00:02:49,786 --> 00:03:06,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have a little bit of exciting athletic news to share that starting on March 8th, Medford Athletics, in partnership with the Special Olympics of Massachusetts, will be offering a unified middle school basketball clinic for the very first time.

27
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:17,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Our high school unified basketball program was a wonderful success, and we are looking forward to teaching basketball skills and drills for our middle schoolers as well.

28
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:31,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Last weekend, Mustang Junior Anna Casey of the indoor track team participated in the state's 600 meter race, racing against 350 girls.

29
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Anna placed eighth in the division two with a time of one minute and 41 seconds.

30
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:41,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Anna.

31
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:52,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Also last weekend, the Mustang basketball cheerleaders placed first in the co-ed division in the GBL competition held at Malden High School.

32
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, senior Andrea Saraburi was named a GBL All-Star.

33
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Andrea.

34
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:13,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Earlier today, we had at the high school, a Black History Month celebration, where we got to see dance performance today by some of our students.

35
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:25,203
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna thank Mayor Lungo Kern, Member Paul Rousseau, and Member Sharon Hayes, who were able to make it on campus to participate in that celebration in the gymnasium.

36
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:30,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Students Isaiah and Rena danced, and there were many volunteers.

37
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,566
[SPEAKER_14]: We got on the floor and tried to do

38
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:36,007
[SPEAKER_14]: some dance routines with Mr. Gene Apollon.

39
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:39,069
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a really enjoyable event.

40
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:45,973
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanna just thank you for joining us and participating in that event today.

41
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:59,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Also this Friday, additional information to follow, but our CCSR students will be hosting a gathering in honor of what is happening right now in the Ukraine.

42
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:05,449
[SPEAKER_14]: So at each of your tables, you can see that there is a sunflower.

43
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,892
[SPEAKER_14]: The national flower of the Ukraine is the sunflower.

44
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:20,716
[SPEAKER_14]: As this quote states, sunflowers, even on the darkest days, stand tall and find the sunlight.

45
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:28,760
[SPEAKER_14]: It is my hope that Ukrainians can find the light to help them get through these difficult and horrific days.

46
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you and have a good evening.

47
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:33,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, thank you.

48
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:35,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

49
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

50
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,312
[SPEAKER_10]: What time is the CCSR event?

51
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,394
[SPEAKER_14]: The event will be at 7 p.m.

52
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:46,317
[SPEAKER_14]: We are planning to host it at the high school.

53
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:51,161
[SPEAKER_14]: More information to follow most likely tomorrow, 7 p.m.

54
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,363
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be a gathering.

55
00:05:54,063 --> 00:06:05,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Students are working on some written pieces that they would like to share and they would like it to be a fundraiser and all funds will go to support UNICEF.

56
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:12,039
[SPEAKER_14]: So more information to come tomorrow, but we will get that out officially to you.

57
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:20,349
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just wanted to make that announcement that if anyone is going to be available Friday night at 7 p.m.

58
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,412
[SPEAKER_14]: at the high school, more information to come.

59
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

60
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:29,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you again.

61
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:36,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up, we have COVID update Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy and Ms.

62
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:44,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Avery Hines, Director of Health Services, who both will report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Medford Public Schools.

63
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:47,848
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have Director of the Medford Board of Health, Ms.

64
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:51,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Mary Ann O'Connor, who will report on the latest COVID data in Medford.

65
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:52,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Murphy.

66
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:54,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mayor.

67
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:56,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, members of the school committee.

68
00:06:56,197 --> 00:07:00,420
[SPEAKER_24]: I did want to start tonight's public health update with a quick apology.

69
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:09,765
[SPEAKER_24]: I've learned in the last few minutes that there was an inadvertent date stamp on some of the memos that you received, including tonight's public health memo.

70
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:22,132
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is, as you know, not agenda item five eight on January 24th, 2022, nor any of the other memos from agenda item five eight on January 22nd or January 24th.

71
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:30,534
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a typographical error, and I just want to make sure that that was noted in the minutes in case there's some questions in the future about this particular event.

72
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:33,956
[SPEAKER_24]: At least it's dated January 24th on my memo, maybe not on yours.

73
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:47,643
[SPEAKER_24]: So with respect to tonight's public health update, as the superintendent referenced, the district has extended the superintendent's mask mandate for students and staff until March 14th.

74
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:52,586
[SPEAKER_24]: As the committee is well aware, the commissioner has lifted the mask mandate

75
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,488
[SPEAKER_24]: statewide as of today.

76
00:07:54,508 --> 00:08:03,356
[SPEAKER_24]: And you have some diversity across the Commonwealth as to how different districts are either transitioning or not.

77
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:09,422
[SPEAKER_24]: We've made the decision to transition on March 14th, two weeks after the school vacation.

78
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:20,868
[SPEAKER_24]: in part, first in consultation with public health officials, but also in part due to the historical trends of upticks following other school vacations.

79
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:24,212
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that there's a lot of travel that takes place during those weeks.

80
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:29,337
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the point, I'm happy to answer whatever questions, and I know Ms.

81
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:30,358
[SPEAKER_24]: O'Connor and Ms.

82
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Hines will as well.

83
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:46,064
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think the sort of very short point that we wanted to make tonight is that we understand for people in the community and people in the Medford Public Schools community that there are strong feelings about if and or when to lift the mask mandate.

84
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:46,885
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think

85
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:54,862
[SPEAKER_24]: The point that we wanted to convey is that there's an understanding within the school department that masking and perpetuity is not good for students.

86
00:08:55,563 --> 00:09:05,392
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that students from a social and emotional development perspective, wearing a mask for the remainder of their academic careers is not something that I think any public health officials are endorsing or that we think is a particularly good idea.

87
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:06,493
[SPEAKER_24]: At the same time,

88
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:29,611
[SPEAKER_24]: there is a responsibility on all of our part to be reasonable and to understand that after two years of living with some of the challenges and obstacles that this public health crisis has imposed, an additional two weeks of wearing a mask to ensure that some of our most vulnerable students and other members of our community have that added layer of safety and insulation is something that we think is both reasonable and appropriate.

89
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:33,995
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we feel very comfortable about the timeline that we've established,

90
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:52,720
[SPEAKER_24]: And we know that the various representatives of our school community will be able to handle this additional two weeks of the imposition of wearing a mask as part of a requirement with the same grace and aplomb that they've handled all the challenges that we as a society have experienced over the course of the last two years.

91
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,642
[SPEAKER_24]: And we want to extend our gratitude for

92
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:58,743
[SPEAKER_24]: to the members of the community for their patience and cooperation during that time.

93
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:07,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Subsequent to March 14th, we know that there will be a responsibility to stay vigilant and to make sure that we're continuing to keep COVID out of our schools and keep students in school.

94
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:13,088
[SPEAKER_24]: That's something that we've taken a great deal of pride in the work that we've done over the last two years, and that work will continue.

95
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:19,850
[SPEAKER_24]: And at the same time, the way in which we meet these challenges has to evolve with the evolving pandemic.

96
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:28,212
[SPEAKER_24]: And so you've heard me say on a number of occasions that our widespread testing surveillance program is not something that was going to be sustainable in perpetuity.

97
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:39,575
[SPEAKER_24]: As it happens, we've been given a phenomenal opportunity through the free rapid COVID take-home test that DESE has made available, and we are in the midst of that transition as well.

98
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:45,100
[SPEAKER_24]: This will be the final week of our building-wide surveillance testing program, but Ms.

99
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:53,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Hines and her staff will still be in support of school communities through diagnostic testing for the foreseeable future.

100
00:10:54,002 --> 00:11:09,747
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think we've provided a lot of information, and not all of it has sort of constituted major shifts from week to week as we've met here, and so I think we'd be happy to take your questions, and if there's any other points that I could more fully flesh out, I'd be happy to do that.

101
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:14,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

102
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes.

103
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:27,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me.

104
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:41,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to make sure that people understand, because there's a lot of terminology, diagnostic testing, can we go over exactly what will be in place after the pool testing is done this week so people fully understand the different

105
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:48,318
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, so I'll define I'll defer to miss signs for a clinical definition of diagnostic testing.

106
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:59,789
[SPEAKER_24]: But I will say that the first layer of insulation is the rapid at home test that will be available to test per kit one kit for every student and staff registers for the program distributed every other week.

107
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,776
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the first line of defense from a testing perspective, is that rapid test distribution that Dessie has made available.

108
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:12,624
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, as I said, our health services department will continue to be available, offering PCR and rapid tests through diagnostic testing.

109
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,025
[SPEAKER_24]: And Ms.

110
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:17,109
[SPEAKER_24]: Hines, would you want to expand upon that at all?

111
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:21,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so diagnostic testing is something that diagnoses.

112
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:30,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be one of those rapid tests we would use in the office if a student came to us with symptoms and then confirmed with us, sent out PCR to the lab, which we don't run.

113
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about 24 hours on a good day.

114
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:41,372
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, a student has to have that first consent form that we sent home previously, which is the one that we do through Tufts.

115
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:45,514
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't count if they have the at-home rapid test consent form.

116
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:54,657
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to do that with them, we would have to have that initial consent form to be able to provide that service in school, but we are able to take same day consents.

117
00:12:55,077 --> 00:13:07,400
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we get them over the phone with parents just to make it a little bit more convenient for them because we understand that maybe you didn't need testing prior, but now you know your students having symptoms and you want them tested, we can help test and diagnose them right there.

118
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,461
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll just add, as we always do, that if you are symptomatic, you should not come to school.

119
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:20,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Member Hayes.

120
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:21,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

121
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:36,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I've had several questions from people in the community about for families that may have someone living with them who is high risk for any number of reasons, immunocompromised or older or too young to have the vaccine.

122
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:41,819
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think I already asked this personally of Avery Hines.

123
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to make sure that everyone gets to hear it.

124
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:47,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a way or how can families

125
00:13:48,339 --> 00:14:04,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Since we're not doing contact tracing if they need to know if they if they really have a reason to need to know if there's someone in the classes test positive because they they want to have that information in terms of the person at home that's at risk, how can they or can they is there a way for them to go about.

126
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,160
[SPEAKER_18]: talking.

127
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,922
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what nurse Hines had said was to have them talk to the school nurse.

128
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to make sure that kind of got out in a public forum.

129
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,364
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I appreciate that.

130
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,105
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's important information to be shared, miss.

131
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,306
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I appreciate that opportunity.

132
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:18,947
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd ask miss Hines to comment on that.

133
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:25,410
[SPEAKER_24]: One point I want to add to something I said earlier, our transition on March 14th is to a mask optional period.

134
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:32,474
[SPEAKER_24]: And so if families have specific circumstances that they are more comfortable with their children continuing to wear masks,

135
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:35,139
[SPEAKER_24]: they are absolutely welcome to do so for the remainder of the school year.

136
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,961
[SPEAKER_24]: But Ms.

137
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:37,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Hines, do you want to comment a little on the contact tracing?

138
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:39,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

139
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:43,087
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as we've always done, contact tracing is very individualized.

140
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:50,950
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you or someone you know, or someone you have at home needs to be extra vigilant, we just ask that you let your school nurses know.

141
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,631
[SPEAKER_01]: We think of every student in the building every day.

142
00:14:55,051 --> 00:15:05,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we hear of something that we feel that a family needs to know about, we will do our best, you know, while maintaining someone's confidentiality to make sure that someone that needs to know will know.

143
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:08,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

144
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:11,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

145
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:11,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

146
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Hines.

147
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:17,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a mayor member of Graham.

148
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:26,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to make sure that there weren't members of the audience who wanted to speak on this topic because this would be the opportunity for them to do so.

149
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:29,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anybody who was wanting to speak on this topic?

150
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not, you don't have to, if you don't want to, I just wanted to make sure that everyone knew that now would be the time for that.

151
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Just name and address for the record, please.

152
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,624
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell you, my name is Tiffany Bear.

153
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:47,905
[SPEAKER_16]: I live in Medford.

154
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:51,669
[SPEAKER_16]: His daughter goes to the high school.

155
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:55,251
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just really confused as to where you get your science from.

156
00:15:56,533 --> 00:16:02,878
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's just the CDC, because I've called your office before and you said, Oh, we're just following the CDC's guidance.

157
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:03,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

158
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:06,681
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're getting, we're going to wait two weeks to unmask our kids.

159
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,293
[SPEAKER_16]: They've had masks on that don't stop viruses, period, for two years.

160
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:16,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Why are we extending this?

161
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,356
[SPEAKER_16]: You say there's gonna be an outbreak?

162
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,557
[SPEAKER_16]: This virus is getting weaker.

163
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's just basically like a cold virus.

164
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:30,422
[SPEAKER_16]: So did you guys throw the baby out with the bathwater when the flu came through all these other times?

165
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:31,843
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you didn't.

166
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,878
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really, I'm just beyond frustrated.

167
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,019
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a book here.

168
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,522
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, I have this, Cruz, masks don't work.

169
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:52,249
[SPEAKER_16]: These are studies, each individual thing, studies upon studies that says masks are not valid for the purpose that you're using them for.

170
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,871
[SPEAKER_16]: People are, the kids are falling behind in school.

171
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:04,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Even the little, little ones, you're saying, oh, we have to wait for the vaccine, but the vaccine does not prevent transmission nor someone from getting it.

172
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,398
[SPEAKER_16]: So what the hell are we waiting for?

173
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:13,280
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time to strengthen their immunity with diet, exercise, good food, that kind of thing.

174
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,880
[SPEAKER_16]: You can prevent it.

175
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,982
[SPEAKER_16]: I've worked this entire pandemic frontline, no mask.

176
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:20,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I dead?

177
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:21,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you guys see me?

178
00:17:21,822 --> 00:17:22,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here.

179
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:23,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

180
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:27,096
[SPEAKER_16]: My 80-year-old father just got COVID.

181
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Supplements, nutrition, no vaccine.

182
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:31,578
[SPEAKER_16]: He's still here too.

183
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,320
[SPEAKER_16]: This is sheer insanity, what we're doing to our kids.

184
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's the science?

185
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,541
[SPEAKER_16]: What science did you use?

186
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:40,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Where?

187
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:42,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Avery too, I've spoken to her.

188
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we're just following the CDC.

189
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, they've changed their mind.

190
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,325
[SPEAKER_16]: They say, take the masks off the kids.

191
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:50,886
[SPEAKER_16]: And yet you guys want to still muscle them.

192
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,667
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't understand what y'all are doing.

193
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:55,445
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

194
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:04,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, so our official position is that the Medford Public Schools will continue to be fully masked until March 14th.

195
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand what your policy is, but why are you doing it?

196
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:24,814
[SPEAKER_14]: So what prompted us to extend the masking for an additional two weeks is that our data as a district demonstrated that each time we went on an extended break, whether it was Thanksgiving break and Christmas and the New Year's break, that we saw an increase

197
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:26,834
[SPEAKER_14]: in COVID-19, yes.

198
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:29,315
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could let the superintendent finish, please.

199
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:30,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Positive test, right?

200
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:31,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Positive test.

201
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,736
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could let the superintendent finish, please.

202
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:35,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

203
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:44,119
[SPEAKER_14]: So as a result of the data, when we made the decision to have it in collaboration with our own board of health,

204
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:53,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Our data showed that two weeks after an extended leave of time, that there was an increase and then there would be a decrease.

205
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:03,651
[SPEAKER_14]: And so based on the information that we had, that's what had us land on the date of Monday, March 14th, which is nine additional days of masking.

206
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:06,872
[SPEAKER_14]: We have all been masking for two years.

207
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:12,833
[SPEAKER_14]: And so for us to have nine additional days of masking, we can handle the nine days.

208
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:15,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your feedback.

209
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:16,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

210
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,355
[SPEAKER_16]: And do you realize that the PCR test isn't valid?

211
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:26,568
[SPEAKER_16]: And how many, do you have the data stating how many people that tested positive had gotten ill from it?

212
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:27,984
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for your feedback.

213
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,244
[SPEAKER_16]: No, did you have that?

214
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,045
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, thank you for your feedback.

215
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:31,826
[SPEAKER_16]: I asked you a question.

216
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:33,166
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you answer the question?

217
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:34,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

218
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Which data do we get that from?

219
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:37,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Who do we get that from?

220
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:41,451
[SPEAKER_16]: You just said you had a data that stated that the cases go up.

221
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,953
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the superintendent gave you the reasoning for the nine additional days.

222
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,214
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where she stands.

223
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:51,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, I'm asking who do I ask to get the data that would state how many people actually got ill that tested positive?

224
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,037
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the data on the website.

225
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,898
[SPEAKER_16]: The data is on the tracker.

226
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:55,579
[SPEAKER_14]: The tracker is it.

227
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,140
[SPEAKER_16]: What's that?

228
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,162
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a COVID tracker out on the city website, as well as the school website.

229
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:06,545
[SPEAKER_16]: So people that tested positive with PCR tests, and then how many people actually got the disease from that?

230
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:08,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you guys tracked that?

231
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:15,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you can be positive PCR and not have COVID, depending on how many times they cycle the test.

232
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau?

233
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:22,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, there are four other hands up on Zoom.

234
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:32,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're gonna, I think there's multiple people, so we'll have to limit three minutes for, okay, so you're just gonna blow me off and not let me in here to find this stuff?

235
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:43,693
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have, I don't think that specific data, I don't know if Avery wants to comment, but that data, I don't believe we have, every data point that we have calculated is on one of the two websites.

236
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Website, all right, thank you.

237
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:46,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

238
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:58,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrea Porcaro.

239
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:04,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, if we can unmute.

240
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:05,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

241
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, thank you so much.

242
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:08,646
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Andrea.

243
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:09,706
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you all doing?

244
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record and you have three minutes.

245
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Andrea Porcaro 42 Guild Street.

246
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much for letting me speak.

247
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:32,512
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say quickly that while I heard the reasoning why you think masks for another nine days is important and no big deal.

248
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:41,459
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to point out the obvious that literally the Board of Health removed the mask mandate for everywhere indoors in Medford.

249
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,869
[SPEAKER_20]: So it appears as though school is the only dangerous place to be like the.

250
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,219
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean people again if it's mask optional after whatever date people who want to still wear them can.

251
00:21:53,347 --> 00:22:01,071
[SPEAKER_20]: But everyone else that doesn't want to wear them, they're living their lives going anywhere in Medford with no mask until they have to come to school.

252
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:04,593
[SPEAKER_20]: And you say, oh, it's only nine more days like it's no big deal.

253
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,455
[SPEAKER_20]: For some people, it's a huge deal.

254
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:13,859
[SPEAKER_20]: My children aren't even in school anymore because they were treated so poorly last year when they had a doctor's note to not wear their mask.

255
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:19,555
[SPEAKER_20]: They had a doctor's note and they were still secluded and isolated and everything from their friends.

256
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:22,657
[SPEAKER_20]: And they didn't get the same, they didn't get to pick their seat.

257
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,218
[SPEAKER_20]: They were pushed off into a corner.

258
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:27,860
[SPEAKER_20]: Kindergarten and second grade, this is how my children were treated.

259
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:34,304
[SPEAKER_20]: But you're telling me that school is so dangerous that for another nine days, we need to wear masks.

260
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:38,367
[SPEAKER_20]: I just literally cannot even fathom that the

261
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:44,147
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't understand where this comes from.

262
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:51,130
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think to say it's only nine more days is really condescending because for some people that's a huge deal.

263
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,493
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's been two years on these little innocent children who are not getting sick and who haven't gotten sick.

264
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:05,877
[SPEAKER_20]: And I too would like to see the data that shows not the positive test, because we all know a positive case means nothing unless you get sick.

265
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:10,099
[SPEAKER_20]: That's when we really need to be concerned if you're getting sick and if you're dying.

266
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:15,662
[SPEAKER_20]: So I too would like to see the data not only on the positive cases, but who actually got sick from those positive cases.

267
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:20,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if every single person in the school tested positive, but nobody actually got sick, who cares?

268
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,586
[SPEAKER_20]: So I too would like to see that data that you guys are basing that on.

269
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:24,867
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

270
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:28,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Andrea.

271
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,059
[SPEAKER_13]: We have M. Trinh.

272
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

273
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:42,483
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, this is Melanie Tringali from 116 Forest Street in Medford, Mass.

274
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:51,427
[SPEAKER_31]: And you, again, I'm going to reiterate that you have been saying that you're following the CDC guidelines all along.

275
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:55,028
[SPEAKER_31]: Until now, you're no longer following the CDC guidelines.

276
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,783
[SPEAKER_31]: The CDC came out with new guidelines based on when to mask indoors and when not to mask outdoors.

277
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:06,087
[SPEAKER_31]: Masking indoors is based on a number of different criteria now based on the CDC.

278
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:14,753
[SPEAKER_31]: And they're looking at hospitalization rates, the amount of beds that are being used and not being used.

279
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:18,315
[SPEAKER_31]: And Middlesex County right now is considered to be low risk.

280
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:24,219
[SPEAKER_31]: And according to the CDC guidelines, those are on low risk counties

281
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,682
[SPEAKER_31]: are not required to mask indoors anymore.

282
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:32,447
[SPEAKER_31]: Even those in medium risk, they don't even recommend that people mask indoors anymore.

283
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:42,957
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, even on those counties with medium risk, their recommendation is only those that are vulnerable or who have serious complications from COVID mask, no one else.

284
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,078
[SPEAKER_31]: And we're in low risk.

285
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:49,843
[SPEAKER_31]: Secondly, you said the reason you're continuing your mask mandates is due to uptick

286
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:51,914
[SPEAKER_31]: after every single vacation.

287
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:53,716
[SPEAKER_31]: I like to know where that data is.

288
00:24:53,816 --> 00:25:04,606
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm on the DESC website right now, and I am checking all the reported cases of positive cases after vacation.

289
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:13,894
[SPEAKER_31]: The only time there was really an uptick was during the January 2022 time when there was Omicron, when there was a high number of cases.

290
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:22,929
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm looking here right now, 12-24 to 1-6-2021, four cases reported of students, one teacher.

291
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:27,730
[SPEAKER_31]: 1-7 to 1-13, zero cases reported for students, two teacher.

292
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,231
[SPEAKER_31]: February 2021, five students, six teachers.

293
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,312
[SPEAKER_31]: So where is the data that there's an uptick?

294
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:38,913
[SPEAKER_31]: There's nowhere near going through, if I'm looking at the correct data on the DESE website,

295
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:44,927
[SPEAKER_31]: in an Excel document of all number of district students reported individual positive cases.

296
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:46,468
[SPEAKER_31]: These are the numbers.

297
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,790
[SPEAKER_31]: April of 2021, two students, zero teachers.

298
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,091
[SPEAKER_31]: All the data is right here.

299
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:55,392
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm curious, what data are you basing this information on?

300
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,695
[SPEAKER_31]: Where are the upticks that you say are here?

301
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:07,178
[SPEAKER_31]: Second of all, out of all these numbers, what is your data based on students?

302
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,044
[SPEAKER_31]: You say you're not doing contact tracing anymore and no one else needs to mask, only the students.

303
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:23,550
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, we know the majority of students are at least risk of any serious complications and schools have never been known to be a super spreader.

304
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:31,714
[SPEAKER_31]: So again, I like to know where your documentation is and also the documentation that you've been tracking that mask has been preventing any

305
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,643
[SPEAKER_31]: and preventing spread within the schools.

306
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,364
[SPEAKER_31]: Where's your documentation on that?

307
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:38,184
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

308
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:39,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

309
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:41,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

310
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:42,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

311
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:44,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to note that

312
00:26:46,257 --> 00:27:05,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is a difficult topic for many, and folks that are speaking now, we've gotten the same in emails from both folks who want to stay masked longer than lot 14, and folks who want to unmask, and numerous emails.

313
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:09,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do wanna say that we are all parents here as well.

314
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:12,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all care about our children and we all care about your children.

315
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:23,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would rather err on the side of caution for two more weeks after a vacation, when children have been finally together in public settings across the state.

316
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:29,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Additionally, you know, when people are talking about science and what science, I know that 941,044 people

317
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,014
[SPEAKER_10]: died in the United States of America in the past two years due to COVID-19.

318
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:40,255
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the data.

319
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:42,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it worth one child?

320
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:44,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, I don't understand.

321
00:27:44,436 --> 00:28:07,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And I get that we're all heated about this and that this is a political cause, but for many, but I want to defer to the superintendent and say, I thought that this was actually a happy medium, if you will, between the two opposing sides that we are hearing so much from that will err on the side of caution after a vacation, when the children were all together publicly, finally, we were able to socialize with each other.

322
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Some without masks, some with.

323
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:24,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely have a student that is high needs and vulnerable, but also all the other families that I know that have high needs and vulnerable who are very much scared, and people can say what they want about that but it's legitimate and it's real and I think that

324
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:41,368
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the superintendent and the central administration have been working and the nursing staff and the teachers and everybody has been working so hard these past two years that when are we going to finally like join together and be like, we're almost on the way out of this.

325
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:42,369
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a community.

326
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:43,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get past this.

327
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:48,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's start to socialize with each other and stop fighting and start focusing on what's important.

328
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:49,571
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the children.

329
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:50,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

330
00:28:53,195 --> 00:28:54,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

331
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,176
[SPEAKER_13]: We have three more people that would like to speak.

332
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,636
[SPEAKER_13]: JF, name and address for the record.

333
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,779
[SPEAKER_09]: JF, name and address for the record.

334
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:22,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's unmuted.

335
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:24,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

336
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:24,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

337
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me now?

338
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:27,606
[SPEAKER_13]: We can name it.

339
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:28,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

340
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:28,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

341
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:31,148
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is June Falco Medford bass.

342
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:36,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I have first a statement because of the statement that was just made briefly.

343
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:41,554
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I have a question, um, which has not yet been answered to me.

344
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:47,418
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was just stated that over 944,000 people have died in the United States of COVID-19.

345
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:54,736
[SPEAKER_21]: That is inaccurate and untrue.

346
00:29:54,996 --> 00:30:02,197
[SPEAKER_21]: Even Fauci has said that people have died with COVID-19 and not from COVID-19.

347
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:09,979
[SPEAKER_21]: So hospitals are now starting to categorize that distinction, which is very, very important because the numbers we've been given all along are not accurate.

348
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:19,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, to my other point, I am still waiting for an answer from Marianne O'Connor, the superintendent and you, Madam Mayor.

349
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:26,987
[SPEAKER_21]: These masks are under an emergency use authorization by the CDC and FDA.

350
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:35,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Emergency use authorization devices come with the informed consent rules under federal law that they can be declined.

351
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:41,359
[SPEAKER_21]: And that has not been given to our students, to our children.

352
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:43,440
[SPEAKER_21]: We no longer have a state of emergency.

353
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,702
[SPEAKER_21]: DESE has dropped their mandate.

354
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:51,287
[SPEAKER_21]: The state has dropped their mandate and now even the CDC says that we should not be masking our children.

355
00:30:51,748 --> 00:31:00,912
[SPEAKER_21]: So under what medical authority are we refusing our children's right to decline wearing these emergency use authorization devices?

356
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:06,294
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would like Marian O'Connor to answer me directly since she has not answered my email.

357
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:14,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi June, I believe I answered your email more than once that

358
00:31:15,388 --> 00:31:23,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I am in disagreement with your EUA statement that they are supported devices and they are not classified as medical devices.

359
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:28,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, you disagree that is not a medical device.

360
00:31:28,698 --> 00:31:30,579
[SPEAKER_13]: But the Board of Health Director has the floor.

361
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,700
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could mute.

362
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:33,942
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the Board of Health Director could.

363
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:43,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did seek out a medical, I'm sorry, legal opinion on that.

364
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the legal opinion as well.

365
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are not deemed medical devices.

366
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:49,484
[SPEAKER_06]: They are supportive devices.

367
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:53,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe I answered you twice on that email.

368
00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:55,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

369
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:58,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Director O'Connor.

370
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:02,933
[SPEAKER_13]: June, you have one more minute if you'd like to finish.

371
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:05,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, I would.

372
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:13,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, you did answer me and we were going back and forth about what they were categorized as and you don't wanna refer to them as a medical device.

373
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:17,926
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't really care what you call them.

374
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:28,534
[SPEAKER_21]: I gave you the direct link that states from the CDC website stating that cloth masks are under an emergency use authorization, full stop.

375
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:34,338
[SPEAKER_21]: So if it's cloth masks are under an emergency use authorization, then those are

376
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:43,303
[SPEAKER_21]: informed consent masks and the children do have the right or parents as their caregivers to decline them.

377
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:48,465
[SPEAKER_21]: So whether or not we wanna say they're a medical device, quote unquote, or not, that point is moot.

378
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:59,089
[SPEAKER_21]: They are, and I have sent you that picture and I'm happy to send it to whomever from the CDC website themselves and FDA stating that cloth masks are under an emergency use authorization.

379
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:02,730
[SPEAKER_21]: That point is not up for debate.

380
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, June, I disagree, but we can take this offline.

381
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Because to be under emergency authorization, they would have to be deemed a medical device and they're not.

382
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:18,186
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can take this, I can follow up with you tomorrow.

383
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:21,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

384
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up we have Adam.

385
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:27,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

386
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:30,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, your name and address for the record, please.

387
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:32,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Jessica Healy, Full Lock Road.

388
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a few questions about the masks.

389
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:48,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much, I know you guys are saying that you're doing this after the February vacation, extending it two weeks for the uptick in cases that happen after break.

390
00:33:49,138 --> 00:33:56,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanna know if we take them off our kids March 14th, a month later comes April vacation.

391
00:33:57,323 --> 00:34:03,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So after April vacation, do we mask our kids up for another two weeks, then take it off and go on summer break?

392
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:06,523
[SPEAKER_05]: and come back in September and mask again.

393
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:20,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for the buses, it's saying that the kids still had to wear a mask on the bus for the federal regulation, but the CDC actually dropped that February 25th.

394
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:25,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys have not said anything regarding the CDC dropping that.

395
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to know about those two things.

396
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:29,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

397
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:32,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, Ms.

398
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:43,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Murphy, if you want to comment on the bus, but I know as far as April vacation is concerned, we're hopeful and confident that the case count will be on the decline and we will, by no means, hopefully, have to wear.

399
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:45,149
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right.

400
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,430
[SPEAKER_14]: The rapid tests as well.

401
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,411
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, the first layer of insulation is the rapid tests.

402
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:58,180
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no plans to institute a mask mandate as of now after April vacation for the reasons that the mayor just referenced.

403
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:04,407
[SPEAKER_24]: With respect to the buses, that guidance has obviously just come out very, very recently.

404
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:10,374
[SPEAKER_24]: We have begun conversations with our bus vendor with respect to how the mask mandate may change.

405
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:17,540
[SPEAKER_24]: It's an ongoing conversation with a vendor that we have and would like to maintain a strong relationship with.

406
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,782
[SPEAKER_24]: I expect we'll be able to update the committee on that next week.

407
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:29,088
[SPEAKER_24]: But as of right now, that mandate, the local mandate, is extending until March 14th, and we'll report back to the committee next week as to whether or not that will change.

408
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:30,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

409
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Kim D., name and address for the record, please.

410
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:44,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Kim DeGregorio, 83 West Street.

411
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:51,940
[SPEAKER_32]: I am the mother of a fourth grade child and a sixth grade child.

412
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,301
[SPEAKER_32]: My fourth grade child has a chronic medical illness.

413
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:05,924
[SPEAKER_32]: I wanted to thank the superintendent and the school committee for extending the masking until the 14th.

414
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,365
[SPEAKER_32]: And for those of you that

415
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:20,831
[SPEAKER_32]: think that your children are more important than mine that is very disheartening.

416
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:27,278
[SPEAKER_32]: I think you should really start to think about the children who

417
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:32,798
[SPEAKER_32]: If they do get COVID, there may be lifelong consequences.

418
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:41,161
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not just a cold for everybody, just because it might be a cold for you or your children or your family or your friends.

419
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:47,584
[SPEAKER_32]: There are plenty of people that have died and could still die and have lifelong consequences.

420
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:48,524
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

421
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:52,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Kim.

422
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:57,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Allison Lied, name and address for the record, please.

423
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,962
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, yes, Alison Lied, 31 Kilgore Ave, Medford.

424
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:06,805
[SPEAKER_28]: I just, like the last speaker, I just wanted to add an opposing viewpoint.

425
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:16,032
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a medical scientist for the past 20 years, and this has been very hard meeting to listen to, as I'm sure it has been for the other scientists in the room.

426
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:25,599
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just wanted to thank the school committee, the school committee members, the school administration, and the Department of Public Health for keeping our children safe so far.

427
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:32,703
[SPEAKER_28]: The testing program for the past two years has been fantastic and the masking protocols as well.

428
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:38,524
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the reason why our children have been safe and people are only complaining about cold symptoms or none at all.

429
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:47,166
[SPEAKER_28]: I have two children, one in first grade and one who's too young to be in school and who's too young to be eligible for the vaccine.

430
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:54,748
[SPEAKER_28]: So not only are you keeping the children in school safe, you're keeping them from spreading it to our children who don't have a chance yet to be vaccinated.

431
00:37:55,355 --> 00:38:02,797
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, I know it's hard to listen to these comments full of misinformation and scientific inaccuracy.

432
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:05,317
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you, that's all I wanted to say.

433
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:09,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, next up is Christina McGordy.

434
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:16,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please, Christina.

435
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,941
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Christina McGordy and my address is 24 North Street.

436
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:37,672
[SPEAKER_27]: I just also wanted to speak, just after listening to the comments, I wanted to talk about the perspective that some other people have.

437
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:46,296
[SPEAKER_27]: And for me, I'm also thankful that the mask mandate didn't end today and that there's two more weeks since we're coming back from vacation.

438
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:54,581
[SPEAKER_27]: But I also wanna urge the administration to think about extending it

439
00:38:55,145 --> 00:39:07,610
[SPEAKER_27]: Beyond that, because we are having lots of changes right now with our surveillance testing program ending and switching to an at-home rapid test program.

440
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:13,799
[SPEAKER_27]: with results that will not be as reliable and accurate.

441
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:21,741
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, and I'm hoping we'll get more info about how many, like what the percentage is of participation in that program.

442
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:30,424
[SPEAKER_27]: I know it's gonna rely more on people having to opt in and do the test weekly and report it.

443
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:38,267
[SPEAKER_27]: So I know we're keeping an eye on the cases when deciding about moving forward with ending the mask mandate.

444
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:49,701
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't have the same data, you know, it's one one variable that's changing, so it seems like too much to to take away masks.

445
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:54,947
[SPEAKER_27]: Before we have more time, and the other things were.

446
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:05,397
[SPEAKER_27]: Our vaccination rate in Medford is not that high with the five to 18 year olds.

447
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:10,345
[SPEAKER_27]: And so when some other places are considering lifting their mandates,

448
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:14,052
[SPEAKER_27]: And their numbers are higher.

449
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:19,555
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's different than ending it here before we can get closer to that 80%.

450
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:30,741
[SPEAKER_27]: So I just feel strongly we should continue offering the clinics and monitoring the vaccination rates before we consider lifting the mandate.

451
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:34,463
[SPEAKER_27]: And also waiting for the under fives to get vaccinated.

452
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:38,205
[SPEAKER_27]: People are talking about vulnerable children at school and at home.

453
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:44,448
[SPEAKER_27]: anyone who has younger siblings at home that haven't been able to be vaccinated yet.

454
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:50,211
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully that will happen soon, but it feels like we should wait for them to have that chance.

455
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:58,335
[SPEAKER_27]: And like others just said, like people keep saying, like Baker said, our schools are safe.

456
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:05,499
[SPEAKER_27]: We see that they're safe and people are talking about how safe our schools have been, but that's because the kids have been masked.

457
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:15,495
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, we don't know what's going to happen when they're unmasked so it's it seems like premature to move forward with that.

458
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Like so quickly.

459
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:30,927
[SPEAKER_27]: And the other thing is, I don't know, talking to someone today in another district, they talked about that they may be unmasking in the high school first.

460
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:40,092
[SPEAKER_27]: And one of the things is, because I am the mother of elementary school children and a former elementary school teacher and I spend a lot of time in my kids elementary school.

461
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,294
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm thinking of everything from that perspective.

462
00:41:44,874 --> 00:41:58,577
[SPEAKER_27]: And so perhaps, you know, it's wiser to start with letting them go first since they understand personal space and they don't pick their nose and you know, all the things that little kids do.

463
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,758
[SPEAKER_27]: So sorry, that's all I wanted to say.

464
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:01,498
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you so much.

465
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:03,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Christina.

466
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:05,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Kerry Laidlaw.

467
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

468
00:42:31,522 --> 00:42:36,543
[SPEAKER_30]: I just have a basic yes or no question for you guys right now.

469
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:42,765
[SPEAKER_30]: Because we can go back and forth all night with this whole thing with the debate everyone has their opinions and

470
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:47,071
[SPEAKER_30]: I know everyone's been working their hardest to keep everybody safe and I appreciate that.

471
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:55,076
[SPEAKER_30]: So having I, as a woman who could not wear a mask for two years and who has remained COVID unvaccinated.

472
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:57,638
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, so no, I'm not here to kill the world.

473
00:42:57,678 --> 00:43:01,921
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not here to hurt children or hurt anybody like the things that have been said about me.

474
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:04,642
[SPEAKER_30]: But I just have, like I said, a yes or no question.

475
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:10,847
[SPEAKER_30]: Will the children be discriminated against if they turn up to school without a mask before the 14th?

476
00:43:12,468 --> 00:43:15,250
[SPEAKER_30]: I was told no, and I just wanna confirm that with you all.

477
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:21,876
[SPEAKER_30]: My children did go to school today, mask free, as there is no longer a mandate in place in the state of Massachusetts.

478
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:31,444
[SPEAKER_30]: And I appreciate that, and I thank the Roberts, and I thank everybody for being respectful about that, and I just wanna make sure that that's being clarified.

479
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:33,866
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct, Ms.

480
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:34,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Laidlaw.

481
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:41,792
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the superintendent did reply to you in email format saying the children will not be discriminated against.

482
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:43,039
[SPEAKER_30]: Correct.

483
00:43:43,099 --> 00:44:01,206
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to make sure that that was correct and that if the children chose to go to school without a mask before March 14th, that they would be allowed their education, not bullied, harassed, ridiculed, and made fun of by their peers, like some children who have had medical exemptions were.

484
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,247
[SPEAKER_30]: I just need to make this very clear.

485
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,487
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes or no.

486
00:44:05,928 --> 00:44:10,690
[SPEAKER_13]: It will not be discriminated against and discrimination and bullying is not tolerated.

487
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,570
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sure

488
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:14,306
[SPEAKER_13]: the administration will act accordingly.

489
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:15,848
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you very much.

490
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:16,628
[SPEAKER_30]: Great evening.

491
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:18,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

492
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up we have Melanie Raylan.

493
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:28,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, yeah, I'm on the record and you have three minutes.

494
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:29,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

495
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:30,580
[SPEAKER_00]: 61 Brewster Road.

496
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just want to thank everybody for and particularly

497
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:42,240
[SPEAKER_00]: our school administration, the superintendent, our school committee, everybody for, you know, just everything you've been doing.

498
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:52,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do want to actually say a lot of people were saying they don't see any data and there is a COVID tracker that honestly has been a great gauge of just how we're doing in Medford.

499
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:58,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And Medford's been doing better than a lot of other districts and communicating with parents of how many people had gotten coded.

500
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:07,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wish that we everybody who was enrolled in the vaccination program in school was just automatically opted into the at home test program.

501
00:45:08,757 --> 00:45:12,740
[SPEAKER_00]: because the numbers, it took so long to get the number of participation up there.

502
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the opt-in, I think a lot of parents don't realize it.

503
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:25,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I almost forgot to test my kid before sending them in this week, because there wasn't a reminder from the school administration, but luckily it was on our Facebook page.

504
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:29,670
[SPEAKER_00]: That aside, there was a study that came out today.

505
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,631
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come out today, sorry.

506
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:35,394
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out on Monday, done by the New York Board of Health and the Albany Board of Health.

507
00:45:35,434 --> 00:45:36,895
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at over 1 million

508
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:42,858
[SPEAKER_00]: children between the ages of 5 to 17, so that's 852,384 12 to 17-year-olds who are fully vaccinated and 365,502 5 to 11-year-olds who are fully vaccinated.

509
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:47,440
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found was that the effectiveness of the vaccine went from 68 percent to 12 percent from the period of December 13, 2021 to January 30, 2022.

510
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:15,213
[SPEAKER_00]: While in the same the same exact window it went from 66 to 51% in the 12 to 17 year olds.

511
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:30,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to read to you what the end of the study says was these results highlight the potential need to study alternative vaccinated dose of vaccination dosing for children and continued importance of layered protections including mask wearing to prevent infection and transmission.

512
00:46:32,407 --> 00:46:43,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in that 5 to 11 range, the effectiveness so that this is against getting COVID and then there's the effectiveness of severe disease and that went from 100% to 48% in that six week period.

513
00:46:44,236 --> 00:47:01,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vaccines we've given our kids are helping them, but again, it's it does show that continuing mask wearing as it has kept our kids safe to this point and that is that is the frustration with what's happening is that the reason our kids have been so safe and transmission has been fairly low outside of the week of.

514
00:47:01,841 --> 00:47:12,745
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple weeks of January when they came back from vacation and numbers went all the way up to 150 at the high school and 50 at our kids school at the Mississippi as well as the Roberts and other areas schools.

515
00:47:14,106 --> 00:47:23,770
[SPEAKER_00]: The the mask wearing was really a key part of that, and we also should all remember that mask wearing isn't about you wearing the mask protect yourself, but other people protecting you by wearing a mask.

516
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:26,115
[SPEAKER_00]: and you protecting them by wearing a mask.

517
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:30,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about helping each other, which I know we all know, but it's really key.

518
00:47:30,636 --> 00:47:38,098
[SPEAKER_00]: As a retail worker, even the lifting the mask mandate has been tough, but people have been very respectful and continue to wear masks.

519
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:43,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that in many establishments, people continue to wear masks who work in the stores and who attend those stores.

520
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:47,589
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are watching out for each other and we're a community that really cares.

521
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I know I'm almost running out of time.

522
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:55,333
[SPEAKER_00]: In Worcester, they released the mask mandate, I believe last week right before vacation.

523
00:47:55,913 --> 00:48:03,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the parents wrote an update that they had to merge classrooms together because teachers were getting sick as well as students.

524
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:09,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So many that they had to, they had low staffing to the point where they had to put these large classes together.

525
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:18,617
[SPEAKER_00]: and show them movies and come up with other ways to entertain them as opposed to teaching them because so many people had to go home from COVID infection.

526
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:20,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we should be looking at.

527
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:26,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you all are, but, you know, Worcester having already done this, we should look at that data and see what's going on.

528
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:30,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you're gonna look at the data from the people who lifted the mask mandate this week.

529
00:48:31,103 --> 00:48:31,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

530
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:32,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

531
00:48:33,164 --> 00:48:33,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.

532
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Melanie.

533
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:35,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

534
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:39,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for all who spoke out one way or another.

535
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,431
[SPEAKER_13]: for the administration.

536
00:48:43,093 --> 00:48:44,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you, Director O'Connor and Ms.

537
00:48:44,676 --> 00:48:47,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Hines for being on Zoom to answer questions.

538
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:57,173
[SPEAKER_13]: We are on to number three, which is a request for approval of District Mural Principal DeLeva and Medford Family Network Director Marie Cassidy.

539
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,741
[SPEAKER_13]: report on a community based mural project outside the West quarter of the Medford High School.

540
00:49:03,021 --> 00:49:07,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening everyone evening Mayor current superintendent with Vincent and members of the school committee.

541
00:49:08,203 --> 00:49:09,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful to be here tonight.

542
00:49:11,124 --> 00:49:11,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

543
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:14,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you all have in your, in your packets.

544
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Information about a new installation at the high school we propose it's a grant that was written by the arts Medford and supported by the metric family network through our five one c three process to support the funding for this project and I think it's going to offer some very special opportunities for families.

545
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:41,641
[SPEAKER_02]: and our community to come together in ways that they haven't been able to in the past two years.

546
00:49:42,222 --> 00:50:01,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a series of kits that will be brought together using the mosaic media and have a beautiful installation that's created by those families or groups of friends or adults who want to bring together their creative expression and bring it all together under the auspice of the Arts Medford program.

547
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:08,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping that this can be a beautiful way to adorn our high school.

548
00:50:09,004 --> 00:50:19,816
[SPEAKER_23]: And there was a concern, Paul, about the... Yeah, so the reason why I'm also here to support Marie is going back to putting the mural at the Andrews.

549
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:24,741
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a lot of discussion of making sure that we were able to not paint on the

550
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:33,698
[SPEAKER_23]: On the rocks, but make sure we could screw it in and we could take it down if we needed to just you know you never know what happens to a building and therefore we do it in the same.

551
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:42,545
[SPEAKER_23]: reason why we're here is asking is we're planning to do the same thing with the mosaic of putting it on panels and screwing it into the building and then, if we need to take it off.

552
00:50:43,686 --> 00:50:47,269
[SPEAKER_23]: For whatever plans for the high school I don't want to get ahead of myself, but for whatever.

553
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:54,013
[SPEAKER_23]: plans are going through the high school that we have the ability to keep the mosaic and utilize it, whatever new structures there.

554
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:57,514
[SPEAKER_23]: And even if we have to move it to a different area of the building, we can do that as well.

555
00:50:58,214 --> 00:51:05,618
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know, in following the steps and the protocol of putting something on the building, we're here to ask the committee for approval to move forward.

556
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,659
[SPEAKER_23]: Maria has done a great job securing grants.

557
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:15,982
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think going back to the days of when we did the mural outside of the Andrews and we had paint days,

558
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:19,302
[SPEAKER_23]: things of that nature was great for the community to come together.

559
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:24,667
[SPEAKER_23]: And everybody, you know, myself included, we all found a piece and we all kind of put our heart and soul into it.

560
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:28,511
[SPEAKER_23]: So, um, I think we're looking to do the same thing for this, uh, mosaic as well.

561
00:51:30,013 --> 00:51:30,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

562
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Principal Delaver and Ms.

563
00:51:31,814 --> 00:51:32,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Marie Cassidy.

564
00:51:33,196 --> 00:51:34,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

565
00:51:57,473 --> 00:52:00,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper passes.

566
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:02,074
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't wait to see it.

567
00:52:02,754 --> 00:52:03,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

568
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:04,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

569
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:18,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Number four, we have math after school tutoring enrichment program, assistant superintendent of elementary education, Ms.

570
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:23,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Suzanne Galussi, will report on an upcoming skill building math intervention program.

571
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

572
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Galussi.

573
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:34,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Did the little person with the amplified voice or Mr. McLaughlin can turn you on?

574
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:35,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

575
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:38,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, there we go.

576
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:40,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

577
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:50,957
[SPEAKER_11]: In a minute, Dr. Cushing will display the brief slide deck I have just to explain the extended day math opportunity that we have for students at the elementary level.

578
00:52:52,055 --> 00:53:01,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'm, I know this goes without saying, but as a result of the coronavirus pandemic math instruction has taken a pretty big hit.

579
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:14,673
[SPEAKER_11]: In a recent study from the NWEA, student performance in math when compared to any other content area has seen the largest deficit throughout these three years of the pandemic.

580
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:22,819
[SPEAKER_11]: There's several reasons for that in relation to the other content areas, but some of them are highlighted here.

581
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:28,062
[SPEAKER_11]: So lost math instruction really cannot be duplicated.

582
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:32,065
[SPEAKER_11]: So when students are absent for various reasons throughout this pandemic,

583
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:39,690
[SPEAKER_11]: mostly quarantining, the direct instruction that they received from the teacher cannot be replicated.

584
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So students really, many students struggle.

585
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:55,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And when they are not there for the direct lesson, and all of the learning that comes through during that lesson, it's not so easy as having parents work with them at home, or send a remediation pack at home.

586
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,092
[SPEAKER_11]: that that instruction is key.

587
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:12,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike title one and remedial reading services in Medford, any tier two math supports are provided by the classroom teacher in in the elementary schools.

588
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:17,371
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think oftentimes parents

589
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:25,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all, but I think some feel more comfortable maybe working with their students on reading and at home.

590
00:54:25,758 --> 00:54:32,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think sometimes the math piece can be a little difficult for families to help their students while they're at home.

591
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:51,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So therefore, we would like to offer an extended day opportunity for math for targeted students that have lost instruction due to various reasons, mostly quarantining, throughout these three years.

592
00:54:52,896 --> 00:55:05,579
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are going to, we're in the process right now, I'm in the process right now of working with educators to look at various data forms in order to target students that would benefit from this opportunity.

593
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:09,740
[SPEAKER_11]: So that includes our math data.

594
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:15,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So for this year, we've had two rounds now of data that teachers have to be able to work with.

595
00:55:16,902 --> 00:55:20,784
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have MCAS data for students that are currently in grades four and five.

596
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,406
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't include grade three yet because they didn't take it last year.

597
00:55:25,746 --> 00:55:35,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say though a little like asterisk to that data point is that last year not every student took the MCAS and then some students were home.

598
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:40,173
[SPEAKER_11]: So in terms of like the validity of data we're really looking at like the math

599
00:55:41,097 --> 00:55:55,089
[SPEAKER_11]: map data, as well as corresponding math data that teachers are using in terms of their curriculum assessments and associated work, along with attendance reports and quarantining reports.

600
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:07,680
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that data, teachers are working through, they are providing student names for eligibility, and we're having a panel review to go over that data for eligibility.

601
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:19,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Then letters and emails will be sent to families telling them that their child would probably benefit and inviting them to this opportunity.

602
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:33,666
[SPEAKER_11]: The format for this, we would like to start the week of March 14th and have it be twice a week after school until 4 p.m.

603
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:35,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowing that dismissal is at about 2.35,

604
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:45,330
[SPEAKER_11]: we would have a brief little transitional period with a snack and have a solid 60 to 70 minutes of math instruction.

605
00:56:47,246 --> 00:56:58,691
[SPEAKER_11]: It would, and then the 4pm dismissal time families can come and pick their children up from school, and we are also going to provide a late bus for some families if they need that.

606
00:56:59,412 --> 00:57:08,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And or if some families attend if the students also attend other after school programming in Medford the late bus could bring them to you know the YMCA.

607
00:57:10,196 --> 00:57:11,597
[SPEAKER_11]: or some of the other locations.

608
00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:18,483
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm working with Megan Fidlecari and David Murphy on the late bus transportation piece.

609
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:19,524
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an opportunity.

610
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:31,453
[SPEAKER_11]: What's different from this than some of the other opportunities we've had that were like strictly focused a little bit on the MCAS, which was really just for grades two through five, this will be for grades K through five.

611
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:37,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would like to keep the groupings somewhere between 12 to 16 students.

612
00:57:39,628 --> 00:57:47,011
[SPEAKER_11]: we are going to be using ESSER funds to pay for the stipends and the late busing and any associated materials.

613
00:57:48,672 --> 00:58:02,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've spoken a little bit about some of the data sets, but just so that you are aware in terms of like the content that we're going to be providing students, because this is also an interesting year in the fact that we're doing three math pilots.

614
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:06,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And three math pilots that have three separate scope and sequences.

615
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:23,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we have to look at at materials that are going to kind of align all three of those and really target where the students are, which is why that the map math data is so crucial because it gives us not only standard trends.

616
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:33,803
[SPEAKER_11]: at each grade level for each school, which is what Carmen Williams and I have been working on, which I greatly appreciate her help.

617
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:46,755
[SPEAKER_11]: That way we'll be able to provide teachers with the data trends at their school for their grade level, as well as the individual student needs that are gonna be in that group.

618
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:49,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is gonna help us develop the lessons.

619
00:58:51,080 --> 00:59:03,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will be using the current programs as well as pulling from illustrative math tasks, which really has students working on their problem solving and application skills and some Eureka math.

620
00:59:04,504 --> 00:59:09,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have any questions about this opportunity, please let me know.

621
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:13,907
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could just move to the last slide and keep that one up while we ask questions, if we have any.

622
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:14,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

623
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:15,247
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be great.

624
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

625
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:17,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

626
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:20,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, this is a great opportunity, Ms.

627
00:59:20,387 --> 00:59:20,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Glucy.

628
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:21,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Excited about this.

629
00:59:22,128 --> 00:59:28,513
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you said 12 to 15 students, I'm assuming you mean by school for the group size, or what did you mean by that?

630
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:33,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Per grouping, so let's say at one of the schools for the fifth grade.

631
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:34,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

632
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:37,219
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking for the fifth grade class.

633
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:37,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

634
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,122
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be about somewhere from 12 to 16 students.

635
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:42,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, so like a small group instruction.

636
00:59:42,943 --> 00:59:43,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

637
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:43,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

638
00:59:44,468 --> 00:59:49,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am assuming that obviously this is available to children with IEPs and English learners.

639
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:49,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

640
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:50,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

641
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:50,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

642
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:51,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

643
00:59:51,311 --> 00:59:52,192
[SPEAKER_10]: This is really exciting.

644
00:59:53,612 --> 01:00:01,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And will it be, but we're going to try to like limit it to the, the 12 to 16 children per grade level that need it.

645
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:04,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if there's 30, you'll have two teachers, two groupings.

646
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:23,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now it we're using the data to inform our, our groupings, because we really want to target those students that had that lost instructional piece because, you know, math builds on one another and so if students are missing the foundational skills they're going to have a tremendous time.

647
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:27,916
[SPEAKER_11]: then moving to fractions, let's say, like fourth grade's very heavy.

648
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:34,658
[SPEAKER_11]: They're supposed to come to fourth grade with that solid number sense of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

649
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,560
[SPEAKER_11]: But for some of those students, they lost that in third grade.

650
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:52,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now when they're in fourth grade and they have to use that applied knowledge to do fractions, some students didn't feel that impact from the pandemic,

651
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:54,471
[SPEAKER_11]: some did.

652
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:58,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're trying to create a space for them to catch up.

653
01:00:59,575 --> 01:00:59,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

654
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:02,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau and then member Graham.

655
01:01:03,878 --> 01:01:06,160
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to let you know there are two people with their hands up online.

656
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:10,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to let the committee ask questions and then we'll go right to.

657
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:18,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So my only question was whether you need a vote of approval from us to expend the ESSER funds.

658
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:28,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was in the budget last year so we've already proved it is the answer to that.

659
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:29,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the grant.

660
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:34,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh met member haze.

661
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:43,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Member of the stone and it's your just a quick question I don't in past years with after-school programs like the handshines

662
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:49,459
[SPEAKER_17]: that kids who did the YMCA afterschool program weren't available to, didn't have the transportation.

663
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:54,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Can kids who go to the YMCA at Chevalier be able to take a late bus there?

664
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:56,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to make that clear to families.

665
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:56,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's right.

666
01:01:56,482 --> 01:01:58,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Each school will have one late bus.

667
01:01:58,703 --> 01:02:00,944
[SPEAKER_17]: And their own late bus to whatever stop they need.

668
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:01,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

669
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

670
01:02:03,746 --> 01:02:04,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Hayes.

671
01:02:05,706 --> 01:02:12,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to clarify, because I thought your question had more to do with, if there's more than 16 kids identified that need the support,

672
01:02:13,887 --> 01:02:21,628
[SPEAKER_18]: will you only go with the lowest, you know, 16, or is there an opportunity to expand to two groups at a grade level?

673
01:02:22,128 --> 01:02:24,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's going to be the piece of the panel review.

674
01:02:24,189 --> 01:02:26,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to wait and see where the data leads us.

675
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:29,910
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm able to staff it, then absolutely we can increase it.

676
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,990
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have to wait for the review piece of that.

677
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:33,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

678
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:37,471
[SPEAKER_13]: So on that, can we get an update when you review the data?

679
01:02:37,511 --> 01:02:38,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it's two weeks away.

680
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:39,992
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, yeah.

681
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:51,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love to know how many groupings in each school we have, so we can make sure everybody's getting serviced if they need it.

682
01:02:53,158 --> 01:02:54,819
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two people, three people, okay.

683
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yes, Member Roussel.

684
01:02:57,721 --> 01:02:58,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, I actually had a question too.

685
01:02:58,962 --> 01:03:00,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks to Member Hayes, I do at least.

686
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:02,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess,

687
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:11,051
[SPEAKER_19]: To get a little more specific, I just want to know that, you know, we've had this issue where the all the elementary schools are not the same.

688
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:30,515
[SPEAKER_19]: And we, I believe it's the title one reading, where effectively, you take the bottom from some tests, the bottom number of students, and they get the services.

689
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:31,695
[SPEAKER_19]: And

690
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:35,375
[SPEAKER_19]: the cutoff is per school.

691
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:45,423
[SPEAKER_19]: So if one school, the bottom is all the way up here, those students get services, because there's nobody down here.

692
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:56,793
[SPEAKER_19]: And in another school, because there's so many students that are further down, they get services, but the kids at the same level as another school, they don't get services.

693
01:03:57,553 --> 01:03:59,215
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanna know that when we do these,

694
01:04:00,126 --> 01:04:06,432
[SPEAKER_19]: this math to determine what students need services, that it's the same across the district.

695
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:07,413
[SPEAKER_26]: It is.

696
01:04:08,174 --> 01:04:15,981
[SPEAKER_19]: So we won't have students who, had they been at a different school, they would have gotten services, but because they're at school X, they don't get it.

697
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:17,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, no, no, no.

698
01:04:17,923 --> 01:04:20,486
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm facilitating this.

699
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:21,847
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be the same

700
01:04:22,727 --> 01:04:31,891
[SPEAKER_11]: the same data sets, the same panel review, the same process, because I'm facilitating that process in conjunction with Faiza Khan, the math director.

701
01:04:32,972 --> 01:04:44,938
[SPEAKER_11]: The other piece, just because I just wanted to say, so one of the things that I've worked really hard to do as well is make sure that our reading department, like creating the elementary reading department,

702
01:04:45,518 --> 01:04:58,922
[SPEAKER_11]: which includes Title I, as well as remedial reading teachers, so that we're using the same criteria, even in buildings that don't qualify for Title I, so that we are servicing the students where the need is.

703
01:05:00,123 --> 01:05:05,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because we're just trying to tweak that process a little bit.

704
01:05:05,024 --> 01:05:05,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

705
01:05:05,504 --> 01:05:08,865
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I'm getting at, though, in that- I 100% do.

706
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:09,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

707
01:05:09,325 --> 01:05:10,086
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I'm going to- Yes.

708
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:13,747
[SPEAKER_19]: It's complicated to talk about without specific data, and teachers, and schools, and all that.

709
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:14,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

710
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, I just have one more.

711
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:19,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

712
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:19,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

713
01:05:20,753 --> 01:05:43,491
[SPEAKER_10]: When you get the data back for the review that you'll share with the school committee once again, can we just get some indication of if it's not exposing children, for example, their privacy, some data of the collective, how many children with IEPs and how many English learners are in the category.

714
01:05:43,531 --> 01:05:46,053
[SPEAKER_10]: So disaggregated data by demographic.

715
01:05:49,924 --> 01:05:58,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just want to make sure that I see what the groupings look like so that I'm not exposing the confidentiality piece.

716
01:06:02,397 --> 01:06:03,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

717
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:06,040
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a few questions on this topic.

718
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:10,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, name and address for the record, please.

719
01:06:11,826 --> 01:06:13,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a healing fall off road.

720
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:16,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a question.

721
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:36,148
[SPEAKER_05]: If a child that's on an IEP qualifies for it and they're not at their grade level for math, do you have IEP teachers that will be able to teach them after school or will they just be in with the group of 16 to 18 kids on their grade level?

722
01:06:38,723 --> 01:06:50,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So part of this, that kind of varies a little bit, Jessica, from school to school, because some of it was, this is an opportunity for staff as well to participate in the program.

723
01:06:51,146 --> 01:07:00,448
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a stipend attached, but there are different staff that are participating within each of the buildings.

724
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:04,069
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is an opportunity to help students

725
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:10,111
[SPEAKER_11]: that have missed instruction due to quarantining and the pandemic.

726
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:14,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is open for students that are on IEPs, newcomer, EL.

727
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:19,976
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to look at the data and to decide the eligibility for the program.

728
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,678
[SPEAKER_11]: But it varies a little bit, Jessica.

729
01:07:24,899 --> 01:07:30,822
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want, I could reach out to you and have a conversation with you about that more specifically for your son.

730
01:07:31,863 --> 01:07:32,803
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that'd be great.

731
01:07:32,843 --> 01:07:33,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

732
01:07:33,323 --> 01:07:34,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

733
01:07:37,392 --> 01:07:37,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

734
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:39,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up we have Christina McGordy.

735
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:46,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, I'm Christina McGordy, 24 North Street.

736
01:07:47,780 --> 01:08:05,493
[SPEAKER_27]: I just wanted to know just when I was looking at the section about like the curriculum materials used, I think this would be like a wonderful opportunity for the kids to do more conceptual building and like doing games and hands-on things.

737
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:25,260
[SPEAKER_27]: like I know will hopefully be happening more with the new curriculums we're piloting, but obviously with envisions don't happen, but having these like smaller groups where they, you know, can have a little more freedom and targeted on concepts with things like that, I think would be amazing.

738
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,680
[SPEAKER_27]: So I just wanted to note that.

739
01:08:27,961 --> 01:08:28,661
[SPEAKER_27]: And then just the

740
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:39,774
[SPEAKER_27]: The point about the title one fund like the title one and making sure all the schools are equal I just, I do I feel like it's hard for me to let that go like if a school is title one.

741
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:42,438
[SPEAKER_27]: It's because there is more need.

742
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:43,820
[SPEAKER_27]: So there should be.

743
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:54,475
[SPEAKER_27]: more support there and I know this is sort of like a nationwide problem where title one funds are going to meeting and it's complicated, but I just wanted to know that so like.

744
01:08:55,796 --> 01:09:02,660
[SPEAKER_27]: So I guess it's like important like maybe like with what Mr so was saying is like that the baseline is the same.

745
01:09:04,197 --> 01:09:13,103
[SPEAKER_27]: Vastly apart, you mean like that would be equal, but like they'll be more children probably that need the service at the Title I schools.

746
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:14,905
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that should be taken into account.

747
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:19,188
[SPEAKER_27]: The baseline should be the same, but obviously there'll probably be more support needed.

748
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:21,709
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, you know, that was all.

749
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:23,571
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

750
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:35,978
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to clarify that is correct title one is supplement not supplant, which is why all of the schools have remedial reading teachers, and then the schools that qualify for title one services.

751
01:09:36,558 --> 01:09:41,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, have title one reading teachers, so that piece is correct.

752
01:09:42,523 --> 01:09:46,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for that clarification just in case there are people at home that didn't understand that difference.

753
01:09:48,007 --> 01:10:09,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And I completely agree with the hands-on interactive, which that's the piece that the illustrative math tasks bring in to this program so that students can take some of the applied math skills that we're going to be remediating and enriching and use that to create or complete the hands-on tasks.

754
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:17,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicole DeMonica, name and address of the record.

755
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:22,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Nicole DeMonica, 51 Burnside Street.

756
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:28,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello?

757
01:10:30,414 --> 01:10:31,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we can hear you.

758
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:32,215
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

759
01:10:32,856 --> 01:10:33,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Question on the math?

760
01:10:34,657 --> 01:10:34,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

761
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:37,939
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have a question regarding the math program.

762
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,981
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I think it's great.

763
01:10:40,021 --> 01:10:41,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for organizing this.

764
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a child in the fourth grade and I can see how something like this would be very beneficial to him and his peers right now.

765
01:10:49,983 --> 01:10:54,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a question about the children that are on IEPs.

766
01:10:54,306 --> 01:11:04,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you talked based on this, but would it matter if they only have IEPs in reading and not math to qualify?

767
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,121
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.

768
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:27,517
[SPEAKER_11]: The data that we're using is from, as I said previously, it's from the math curriculum that they are using in the classroom, the assessments and the associated work, as well as their performance on the math testing, which students have now gone through two rounds of that so far in their schooling.

769
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:28,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And so,

770
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:41,581
[SPEAKER_11]: and their attendance record to see if they've really been impacted by absences due to quarantining, maybe any other associated medical issues or any other reasons for absences.

771
01:11:42,722 --> 01:11:44,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's fine.

772
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

773
01:11:46,683 --> 01:11:51,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what about for, you know, their grade level, let's say

774
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:56,169
[SPEAKER_04]: were they within the 16 group of children, right?

775
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:05,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they be with peers that are at their kind of level or would they be with, you know, just a whole group of level of people in their grade?

776
01:12:06,772 --> 01:12:08,472
[SPEAKER_11]: But they will be with their grade level peers.

777
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:22,316
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, let's say like my child is on IEP, would he be with other children that are in other IEPs or will he be with somebody who is a little more advanced in math, but maybe missed, you know, some school days?

778
01:12:23,493 --> 01:12:25,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll be with his fourth grade peers.

779
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

780
01:12:28,739 --> 01:12:28,979
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

781
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:29,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

782
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:29,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

783
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:30,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

784
01:12:32,082 --> 01:12:33,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, miss.

785
01:12:33,544 --> 01:12:34,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

786
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:36,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up.

787
01:12:36,868 --> 01:12:41,913
[SPEAKER_13]: We have number five grant updates from assistant superintendent of secondary education.

788
01:12:41,953 --> 01:12:44,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Dr. Cushing.

789
01:12:47,723 --> 01:12:49,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

790
01:12:49,805 --> 01:12:57,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate the opportunity to come and give you a quick report today on two grants that we have applied for.

791
01:12:57,412 --> 01:12:58,432
[SPEAKER_12]: One is confirmed.

792
01:12:58,452 --> 01:13:14,627
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a financial literacy grant to help our students purchase some curriculum materials, as well as to support the credit for life program that former assistant principal Gail Treanor ran for much of the time that it was in existence.

793
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:29,218
[SPEAKER_12]: The program predates me so I don't have the full history to share with you, but it is valuable program that is typically available to our junior class, but with the pandemic I know that we are looking at other classes that may have missed it.

794
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:34,360
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's one that is a grant confirmed.

795
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:51,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Another one that we've applied for and we have high anticipation that we'll receive it just because of the way the grant is structured is a $55,000 grant for a 20 hour math academy for secondary students, grades six through 12 over April vacation.

796
01:13:52,612 --> 01:13:56,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I will let the committee know that I'm concerned about the challenges of recruiting staff.

797
01:13:57,155 --> 01:14:03,137
[SPEAKER_12]: just because of the stress, anxiety, and the challenges that many educators are facing.

798
01:14:03,677 --> 01:14:13,900
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are able to offer, I believe, $3,500 for the four days of work because there is a state holiday, Patriots Day, on that Monday.

799
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:20,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And while we could offer the program through Saturday, we plan to offer five hours of math instruction

800
01:14:23,803 --> 01:14:28,087
[SPEAKER_12]: diversify it with some games, some other things to really help the kids.

801
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:44,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything will have a math focus, but we do want to make sure that you're aware that it will be a rigorous program and we should be able to get a number of teachers in for a really good stipend for those four days and some planning time.

802
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:53,748
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll provide breakfast and lunch for students, and we'll have about 10% of that total would be for any materials that we might need.

803
01:14:54,818 --> 01:15:04,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to really thank Michelle Bissell and Faiza Khan as two people who stand out as for really helping us with both of these grants.

804
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:15,922
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize to those people that I may have forgotten with the financial literacy grant, but I believe it was Mr. Fallon, Mr. Rose Walker and Mr. Delaver as well to help us get that in.

805
01:15:16,362 --> 01:15:19,622
[SPEAKER_12]: And every little bit helps to help our students.

806
01:15:19,763 --> 01:15:20,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

807
01:15:20,403 --> 01:15:20,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions?

808
01:15:21,323 --> 01:15:22,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

809
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:27,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Member miss stone, yes.

810
01:15:28,306 --> 01:15:29,029
[SPEAKER_17]: How do students.

811
01:15:29,537 --> 01:15:33,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Do they self-identify that they want to do the math program or would math teachers?

812
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:44,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to work with math teachers as well as looking at our map growth data, looking at historic MCAS data, and just really trying to get an overall picture.

813
01:15:44,963 --> 01:15:55,988
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want any one piece of data to really dictate, but to try to develop an entire picture of the student to be able to bring them to this and invite them.

814
01:15:56,436 --> 01:16:02,518
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to keep the groups small, about 12 to 15 students, so that we can get maximum impact.

815
01:16:03,098 --> 01:16:03,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

816
01:16:03,418 --> 01:16:15,901
[SPEAKER_17]: So students who struggle with math, and this is, I'm speaking as a parent of kids who struggle with math, it would be hard to sell them on five hours a day of math over a vacation.

817
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,822
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there some sort of incentive we can give to the students who participate?

818
01:16:21,205 --> 01:16:23,768
[SPEAKER_12]: So the grant would not be able to pay for incentives.

819
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,694
[SPEAKER_12]: I can go back and double check it from our reading of it initially.

820
01:16:28,615 --> 01:16:36,787
[SPEAKER_12]: There would not be any grant specific incentives, but we might be able to also look at what else we might be able to fund.

821
01:16:37,107 --> 01:16:37,327
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

822
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:38,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree with you.

823
01:16:39,267 --> 01:17:02,352
[SPEAKER_12]: As someone myself who struggled with math and had the misperception that there was a math brain and an English brain, I will say that thinking about 20 hours of math instruction, as beneficial as it may be over vacation, might not be the most appealing thing to students who might be looking at spring that has sprung.

824
01:17:02,732 --> 01:17:03,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

825
01:17:04,172 --> 01:17:04,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

826
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:06,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor.

827
01:17:07,088 --> 01:17:08,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

828
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:12,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we get an update on how many people did enroll and how?

829
01:17:12,554 --> 01:17:12,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

830
01:17:13,035 --> 01:17:13,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

831
01:17:15,293 --> 01:17:15,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

832
01:17:15,993 --> 01:17:16,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushman.

833
01:17:16,934 --> 01:17:17,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, Member Graham.

834
01:17:17,954 --> 01:17:20,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Do either of these grants need our approval?

835
01:17:21,135 --> 01:17:21,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

836
01:17:21,315 --> 01:17:21,415
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

837
01:17:21,435 --> 01:17:22,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to make sure.

838
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:27,157
[SPEAKER_12]: We just, at a previous meeting, mentioned about knowing about grants.

839
01:17:27,637 --> 01:17:30,298
[SPEAKER_12]: So as they come up, I know that we've done back-to-back now.

840
01:17:31,278 --> 01:17:35,500
[SPEAKER_12]: That won't necessarily be, but wanted to give you the information as it comes.

841
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't have formal approval on the second one.

842
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:44,023
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to make sure that everyone knows that the way it's set up, we highly anticipate

843
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:46,005
[SPEAKER_12]: But just wanted to make everyone aware.

844
01:17:46,806 --> 01:17:48,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just one more question.

845
01:17:48,107 --> 01:17:50,891
[SPEAKER_08]: When will middle school families get their map assessment scores?

846
01:17:51,211 --> 01:17:57,799
[SPEAKER_12]: We are closing out the last 30 students at the McGlynn tomorrow for a test, and then we'll close the window.

847
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:58,560
[SPEAKER_12]: We will print.

848
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:00,223
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be out in the next week.

849
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:01,204
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, thank you.

850
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:02,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you, Doctor.

851
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:10,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Number six, we have consideration of school year 22-23 before and after school care fee schedules.

852
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:17,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy, and Director of Student Family Engagement, Ms.

853
01:18:17,615 --> 01:18:22,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Megan Fidler-Carey, will report on proposed fees for fiscal year 22-23.

854
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:23,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

855
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Fidler-Carey, how are you?

856
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, how are you?

857
01:18:26,898 --> 01:18:27,839
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you again, Mayor.

858
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:35,767
[SPEAKER_24]: So in your packets, members received our presentation along with a memo from Ms.

859
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:36,849
[SPEAKER_24]: Fidelicari and myself.

860
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:44,877
[SPEAKER_24]: This is our annual consideration of fees that we'll be charging for after-school programming and

861
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:53,650
[SPEAKER_24]: Similar to when we presented before you last year, we said that we were maintaining pretty much all the structure policy and fee schedule for the before school.

862
01:18:53,710 --> 01:19:03,136
[SPEAKER_24]: So the remainder of our presentation tonight will focus on after school programming and some of the changes that we're proposing as well as the fee structure.

863
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,598
[SPEAKER_24]: So this really is a continuation of the presentation we made last year.

864
01:19:06,638 --> 01:19:07,379
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll recall that

865
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:14,610
[SPEAKER_24]: We have reviewed the fee schedules and other communities as well as some of the other structures that were in place.

866
01:19:15,211 --> 01:19:19,097
[SPEAKER_24]: And we had some, some goals coming into this year some of which were realized some of which were not.

867
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:28,209
[SPEAKER_24]: But one of the points and we'll talk about this in a moment, but Medford is generally comparable or below with respect to the tuition that we charge for after school.

868
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:39,512
[SPEAKER_24]: And that has an impact with respect to how we can potentially expand participation and provide greater service to the Community, so we want to take a quick look at the after school deck that we have.

869
01:19:40,212 --> 01:19:43,475
[SPEAKER_24]: The two goals that we'll be talking about tonight are to establish the tuition fees.

870
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:48,618
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a recommendation to you that's in your packet, as well as a few shifts with respect to strategy.

871
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:49,539
[SPEAKER_24]: So Ms.

872
01:19:49,559 --> 01:20:00,046
[SPEAKER_24]: Finley-Curry, who's been leading this program, as part of her broadened portfolio for this year, will walk us through some of the recommendations and work that we have this evening for you.

873
01:20:00,266 --> 01:20:00,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

874
01:20:01,887 --> 01:20:04,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent, School Committee.

875
01:20:04,849 --> 01:20:05,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to see you all.

876
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you had a restful break.

877
01:20:10,193 --> 01:20:16,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you know, our before and after school programs offer much needed child care for many families in our community.

878
01:20:17,135 --> 01:20:24,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The demand, as we've admitted and acknowledged, is higher than we have capacity for, but we are always constantly looking at that.

879
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:29,879
[SPEAKER_07]: We're meeting with other districts to find out best practices, to find out how they're addressing those challenges.

880
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:32,580
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hearing from families and we're hearing from you all.

881
01:20:34,677 --> 01:20:41,905
[SPEAKER_07]: So just for anybody new before school program is for an hour at the beginning of the day after school is every day from dismissal until six o'clock.

882
01:20:42,826 --> 01:20:53,298
[SPEAKER_07]: We've attempted to expand the number of seats available to families in many different ways we've, we've tried to go into job fairs we last year as you

883
01:20:54,374 --> 01:21:04,099
[SPEAKER_07]: awarded us the opportunity to, we increased salaries for afterschool staff, which helped and is also been happening across the commonwealth too.

884
01:21:04,299 --> 01:21:07,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a lot of afterschool programs recognize that was part of the problem with staffing.

885
01:21:09,962 --> 01:21:19,848
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, however, despite the more, much more attractive hourly wages that we offered, we faced the same staffing challenges that are in many, many different industries.

886
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:22,889
[SPEAKER_07]: The challenges for workforce,

887
01:21:24,523 --> 01:21:25,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

888
01:21:27,622 --> 01:21:31,944
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a conundrum that's on NPR every day, so it's nothing unique to the afterschool program.

889
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:43,750
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I wanna talk about when we're looking at the data right now is thinking about terms, changing the terms to seats, thinking about this in terms of number of seats instead of number of students served.

890
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:49,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I typically talk about the number of students served because that's something we're really proud of is how many families we can help.

891
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:56,477
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we're thinking about this, as you know, some families sign up for five days a week while others sign up for maybe only two or three days a week.

892
01:21:56,877 --> 01:22:02,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So the number of seats are a typical five day seat in the afterschool program.

893
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:05,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So that number obviously is much lower.

894
01:22:05,562 --> 01:22:14,228
[SPEAKER_07]: That's at about 270, what we have capacity for across the district versus the 400 plus students that we actually serve.

895
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:19,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's when we're thinking about increasing seats, we should think about it in those terms.

896
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:22,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as always,

897
01:22:23,311 --> 01:22:27,534
[SPEAKER_07]: strive to maintain a healthy 10 to one ratio of staff to students.

898
01:22:27,955 --> 01:22:35,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this is qualified staff to students because we've got, you know, we do have some high school students that work with us, which is wonderful.

899
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:42,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are our best employees, but we don't count them in our student counts because we can't leave them alone with children.

900
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So that has been challenging when we think about our staff ratios, thinking about how many more students we can let in.

901
01:22:54,544 --> 01:22:54,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm.

902
01:22:55,634 --> 01:23:00,056
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, we strive to make this affordable for families who really need it.

903
01:23:00,836 --> 01:23:12,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But we also have recognized that if it's too affordable, if we're not charging kind of market rate for it, then people might sign up for it as a nice to have who don't actually need it.

904
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:18,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really thinking about, I mean, and the fact that we need to be able to pay our staff competitive rates.

905
01:23:18,983 --> 01:23:21,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to be able to afford the cost of the program.

906
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:24,306
[SPEAKER_07]: So thinking about all of those costs

907
01:23:26,498 --> 01:23:27,379
[SPEAKER_07]: and expenditures.

908
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:31,881
[SPEAKER_07]: We're thinking about what the rates should look like and reviewing that for you this year.

909
01:23:35,503 --> 01:23:36,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I think that's.

910
01:23:43,027 --> 01:23:45,349
[SPEAKER_22]: This is what it's all last year has changed.

911
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,471
[SPEAKER_22]: Therefore we can decide who's going to talk about it.

912
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:52,453
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much.

913
01:23:54,935 --> 01:24:12,881
[SPEAKER_24]: So this year, as we talked about last year, because our rates are on the low end, because to the point that Megan makes about, we want this to be accessible at the same time, what we don't want is people paying to hold seats that they don't actually need, because that just essentially diminishes the service we're able to offer to the community.

914
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:21,544
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we essentially said this last year, and we're reiterating tonight that we do believe that we need to see an increase in the fee structure.

915
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:37,044
[SPEAKER_24]: And at the same time we're making some proposals tonight from a strategic perspective to try to maintain that accessibility and the equity of access that we know is important so the for this year the increase we've tried to keep it modest although, again, it's sort of with the foreshadowing

916
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:43,929
[SPEAKER_24]: there's a likelihood of subsequent recommendations in the years ahead of continuing to increase so that we can maintain with market.

917
01:24:43,949 --> 01:24:47,311
[SPEAKER_24]: Because other services and communities are also raising their fees.

918
01:24:47,731 --> 01:24:53,775
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we're already on the low end, even as we put in these modest increases, we're still going to end up being below.

919
01:24:54,155 --> 01:25:06,023
[SPEAKER_24]: And that has an impact on the operations of the program and the extent to which we're able to staff the program and expand the seats, as we've said both last year and this year, is a goal, at least at current.

920
01:25:06,463 --> 01:25:10,005
[SPEAKER_24]: So the last year we upped it from about 24 and change to $25.

921
01:25:10,065 --> 01:25:23,031
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a per day rate, meaning that a family that was receiving the service five days a week for the duration of the school year, it would be about a $4,500 tuition.

922
01:25:23,731 --> 01:25:31,975
[SPEAKER_24]: This year, the proposed increase is 2,639, which if you do the math equates out to 4,750 for a full one year, five day, 180 day tuition.

923
01:25:36,516 --> 01:25:45,821
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a little, there's some rationale to that in terms of why we want to make sure that that revenue stream stays strong that I will reference in a moment.

924
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:50,944
[SPEAKER_24]: I also want to be very clear from a financial perspective that there are a number of unknown variables.

925
01:25:51,504 --> 01:25:54,106
[SPEAKER_24]: that come into play when we talk about our after school program.

926
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:59,709
[SPEAKER_24]: The biggest of which is we don't know how many, how much service individual families are going to take on a given year.

927
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:01,930
[SPEAKER_24]: And because of that, there's some fluctuations.

928
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:03,150
[SPEAKER_24]: And so as Ms.

929
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:12,576
[SPEAKER_24]: Fidler-Carey and I have gone back and forth about this in recent weeks, we sort of have our strategic goals in mind where we want to expand seats so that we can provide greater access.

930
01:26:13,356 --> 01:26:14,697
[SPEAKER_24]: We also know that we have to

931
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:22,002
[SPEAKER_24]: improve our staffing in a way, not individual staff members, but improve our staffing structure if that's going to be a possibility.

932
01:26:22,423 --> 01:26:30,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Last year, we tried increasing rate of pay, which I think did help us to maintain the level of service, generally speaking.

933
01:26:30,349 --> 01:26:34,912
[SPEAKER_24]: But given those other challenges, it essentially didn't really allow us to expand seats.

934
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:39,996
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've got a few other strategic options, some of which, though, may very well have cost implications.

935
01:26:40,317 --> 01:26:44,500
[SPEAKER_24]: And because of that, it continues to be a priority to raise that fee

936
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,820
[SPEAKER_24]: in a responsible way.

937
01:26:46,261 --> 01:27:08,810
[SPEAKER_24]: That second bullet, and this is something that I know there's been a lot of conversations about, but I honestly don't know if we've spoken about in this forum before, but we currently make available to families, or I should say we are enrolled in a program with the state, that makes available to families vouchers through the Department of Early Education and Care.

938
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:24,271
[SPEAKER_24]: And those vouchers have the purpose or the intended purpose of creating access to families who have economically disadvantaged children to be able to get into the program.

939
01:27:25,352 --> 01:27:33,138
[SPEAKER_24]: And so it sounds like that's something that should advance our goal with respect to equitable access.

940
01:27:33,858 --> 01:27:47,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, one of the things that we found in looking at the percentage of families that are economically designated as economically disadvantaged and the percentage of families that are actually enrolling in and receiving the benefits of this voucher program is that there's a clear inference.

941
01:27:47,502 --> 01:27:49,663
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm editorializing a little bit.

942
01:27:50,023 --> 01:27:58,886
[SPEAKER_24]: And certainly, again, I want to stress that we think EEC has great intentions and that the intention of the voucher programs are good ones, the ones that we share.

943
01:27:59,426 --> 01:28:02,567
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's evidence, or at least inferences, that

944
01:28:03,998 --> 01:28:08,259
[SPEAKER_24]: We're actually creating a barrier for families who want to have this access.

945
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:21,543
[SPEAKER_24]: And that problem is compounded by the fact that if we were to institute a hardship application in which we could discount the tuition for families based on being economically disadvantaged.

946
01:28:22,388 --> 01:28:41,229
[SPEAKER_24]: or other extenuating circumstances, the voucher program would then reduce our rate of reimbursement, which would then sort of have the double problem of being administratively burdensome for families and not really providing a financial incentive for the district, which again is necessary in order for us to maintain the staffing to maintain and expand the seats.

947
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:43,511
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's sort of a domino effect where

948
01:28:44,312 --> 01:28:46,913
[SPEAKER_24]: The state's intention is to create access.

949
01:28:47,393 --> 01:28:53,294
[SPEAKER_24]: But because they're so administratively burdensome, our families aren't accessing them in significant numbers.

950
01:28:53,434 --> 01:28:56,695
[SPEAKER_24]: It's also extremely administratively burdensome for the district.

951
01:28:57,075 --> 01:29:07,598
[SPEAKER_24]: And so if the floodgates opened and all of a sudden everyone applied for the vouchers, we would have difficulty under our current staffing structure to be able to complete our administrative work and to be in compliance with the vouchers.

952
01:29:08,178 --> 01:29:10,779
[SPEAKER_24]: So essentially, they're not particularly advantageous.

953
01:29:11,419 --> 01:29:12,580
[SPEAKER_24]: And so our proposal,

954
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:28,932
[SPEAKER_24]: looking ahead is to well again we don't think they're beneficial now and I think it is something that the committee would could and should consider is exactly how much longer you want us to continue to use these vouchers that we think are putting families at a disadvantage.

955
01:29:29,513 --> 01:29:47,345
[SPEAKER_24]: But assuming that we want to continue that, at least for the next school year, what we would recommend, and Megan could speak to how many districts have exercised a similar option in terms of backing out of the use of vouchers, what we would recommend is families have this school year, 22-23, to enroll in the voucher program.

956
01:29:48,306 --> 01:29:58,673
[SPEAKER_24]: If they enroll in the voucher program and they have a voucher, they would essentially be grandfathered in to have their tuition waived for the remainder of their time in the afterschool program.

957
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:07,543
[SPEAKER_24]: That would ensure that we are at least not reducing access by way of moving away from the use of the vouchers.

958
01:30:08,243 --> 01:30:16,226
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we would institute our own hardship program, which would then provide for discounts for families that are facing extenuating circumstances.

959
01:30:16,746 --> 01:30:22,648
[SPEAKER_24]: And then that is how we would, on a local level, maintain that equity of access.

960
01:30:23,448 --> 01:30:25,769
[SPEAKER_24]: So that is a proposed change that we would make.

961
01:30:25,869 --> 01:30:31,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, if the committee would like us to accelerate that change, that is something that we're prepared to do.

962
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:51,938
[SPEAKER_24]: But for tonight, our proposal would be to increase the rate of tuition, maintain the voucher program for this coming school year, with the understanding that if you've never signed up for the voucher before, signing up for the 22-23 school year can grandfather you in for a waived tuition for the remainder of your child's time in the afterschool program.

963
01:30:53,011 --> 01:31:10,023
[SPEAKER_24]: And then also again implement the harsher program so that we could then discount rates as as necessary at the local level so again, I know that's a complicated multi-pronged provision or proposal and where we can certainly answer some questions about that.

964
01:31:10,043 --> 01:31:15,808
[SPEAKER_24]: But then this really carries and walk us through a few of the other bullet points and then we'll get back to rates of pay and then take your questions.

965
01:31:17,169 --> 01:31:17,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

966
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:21,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So thinking through this, because as Mr. Murphy said currently,

967
01:31:21,941 --> 01:31:26,725
[SPEAKER_07]: only 14 students from our 400 plus have vouchers.

968
01:31:27,045 --> 01:31:28,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a very small percentage.

969
01:31:29,307 --> 01:31:33,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And historically that has been partially because there were long wait lists to get a voucher.

970
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:39,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Second of all, you have to go in and have a meeting with a counselor to qualify for a voucher.

971
01:31:40,435 --> 01:31:50,462
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest downside from my perspective is when we participate in the voucher program, we can only charge the least amount that we charge voucher.

972
01:31:51,938 --> 01:31:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: to any other families.

973
01:31:52,899 --> 01:32:02,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's a hardship, if there's an emergency, we and we charge anybody zero, then we actually cannot ask the voucher system to reimburse us because somebody has received less than that.

974
01:32:02,707 --> 01:32:11,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that doing away with the voucher and instituting our own sliding scale or our own fee system will just gives us more autonomy on

975
01:32:12,995 --> 01:32:15,497
[SPEAKER_07]: deciding for ourself what's best for our students.

976
01:32:15,677 --> 01:32:17,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one way to look at it.

977
01:32:17,338 --> 01:32:28,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And like Mr. Murphy said in the network of extended day directors that I reference every time I'm here, they've all done away with the voucher program because it's so burdensome from an administrative perspective.

978
01:32:28,685 --> 01:32:29,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that's not an excuse.

979
01:32:29,846 --> 01:32:35,850
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had all of our students that were using it and they really needed it and it was what was best for kids, then we would find a way to get the work done.

980
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:40,553
[SPEAKER_07]: But for only 14 students, it just doesn't compute.

981
01:32:41,888 --> 01:32:49,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was one recommendation we were looking at the other was just thinking about the free and reduced lunch programs that we asked families to fill out and.

982
01:32:50,424 --> 01:32:59,988
[SPEAKER_07]: ways that we determine who is economically disadvantaged and thinking about really providing support for those families and thinking about what our scale would look like.

983
01:33:00,048 --> 01:33:11,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So we thought about for next year, we're proposing increasing the tuition, but for the students that have turned in those forms and are proven that we know are economically disadvantaged, we won't raise the rates for them.

984
01:33:12,014 --> 01:33:13,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It will stay at the current $25 a day rate.

985
01:33:15,596 --> 01:33:26,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And then another thing, and this was a suggestion from the community, from a parent who is trying to help us think through getting, you know, improving our seats, doing away with the four-day option.

986
01:33:27,005 --> 01:33:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, we offer two, three, four, or five days a week as an option.

987
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:34,952
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, if we're thinking in terms of seats and not in terms of students,

988
01:33:35,865 --> 01:33:41,808
[SPEAKER_07]: There can't be, since we don't offer a one-day option, you can't have a complete seat when you offer a four-day option.

989
01:33:42,188 --> 01:33:43,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So that makes a lot of sense.

990
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:52,874
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if there's three-day Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you can add a student who's Tuesday, Wednesday, I mean, Tuesday, Thursday, and create a complete seat, or you can't do that with the four-in-one.

991
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:55,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was great advice from the community.

992
01:33:55,095 --> 01:33:59,998
[SPEAKER_07]: We propose making that change for next year, doing away with the four-day option.

993
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:03,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other, our personnel changes.

994
01:34:06,206 --> 01:34:08,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Our last two proposals here.

995
01:34:09,909 --> 01:34:14,413
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is sort of looking ahead to our FY 23 budget picture.

996
01:34:14,433 --> 01:34:29,127
[SPEAKER_24]: You've, you've heard me speak on a number of occasions this year about the expanded level of responsibility role and leadership role that Mr. Kerry has taken on this year and I will say as the person that leads the team that she's on.

997
01:34:30,068 --> 01:34:37,937
[SPEAKER_24]: her work in leading various components of the organization, the umbrella of the family and community engagement has been invaluable to the district.

998
01:34:38,478 --> 01:34:41,722
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been invaluable to me personally, frankly, and I'm tremendously grateful to her.

999
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:45,707
[SPEAKER_24]: But I also understand that as the role evolves, we've got to look at the staffing structure and

1000
01:34:46,617 --> 01:35:08,748
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the ways we think that currently you'll see in the next page with where we have the wage skills we have a system that's devised essentially by having a coordinator each school works a 5 hour shift and that the rest of the staff that generally work for our shift and what we're proposing is to have to essentially elevate one of those positions to a role that can help support.

1001
01:35:09,749 --> 01:35:12,210
[SPEAKER_24]: Mister carries management oversight program.

1002
01:35:13,363 --> 01:35:15,986
[SPEAKER_24]: which would be funded through the revolving fund.

1003
01:35:16,506 --> 01:35:21,912
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not something that from a budgetary perspective, it's something that we'll be able to absorb.

1004
01:35:21,952 --> 01:35:26,918
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think from a staffing structure, it'll just make a tremendous amount more sense.

1005
01:35:27,858 --> 01:35:32,421
[SPEAKER_24]: And hopefully, Megan will be willing to do this for as long as a result of doing stuff that makes sense.

1006
01:35:32,521 --> 01:35:34,502
[SPEAKER_24]: So that that's in there.

1007
01:35:34,522 --> 01:35:42,866
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, finally, and this is a piece that as we get into our negotiations with our partners in the Medford Power Professional Association.

1008
01:35:43,467 --> 01:35:51,056
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've communicated to them that one of our goals in those discussions will be to establish what in other districts would be called surround care paraprofessionals.

1009
01:35:51,436 --> 01:36:01,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Essentially, it is creating a paraprofessional position that begins work later in the day and then the responsibilities carry through the after school program.

1010
01:36:02,705 --> 01:36:05,487
[SPEAKER_24]: We think that would be very beneficial to the district.

1011
01:36:05,507 --> 01:36:06,968
[SPEAKER_24]: We think it would be a wise investment.

1012
01:36:08,089 --> 01:36:14,613
[SPEAKER_24]: There are some complexities to it and making sure that we need our professional staff in the morning as well.

1013
01:36:14,753 --> 01:36:24,139
[SPEAKER_24]: And as we've discussed in the past, the workforce depletion challenges that have played down to school have also had an impact on our paraprofessional ranks.

1014
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:27,761
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we first and foremost need to make sure that all those positions are filled and

1015
01:36:28,261 --> 01:36:43,545
[SPEAKER_24]: We have stability of staffing on that end, but we do think that it would be beneficial, ultimately, to look down the road toward that day-night split-shift duty so that we can have both a robust, and frankly, it's gonna help us in the school day as well.

1016
01:36:43,605 --> 01:36:47,086
[SPEAKER_24]: So last page, these are just our wage scales.

1017
01:36:47,126 --> 01:36:57,048
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're looking at, from the new position of the after-school care coordinator would be a salary position and a benefits-eligible position.

1018
01:36:57,988 --> 01:37:02,409
[SPEAKER_24]: All the other positions that are on the start of the same ones that you've seen previously, and they proposed.

1019
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:19,394
[SPEAKER_24]: It says proposed FY 22 which I apologize I should say proposed FY 23, but that's constitutes a 2% increase across the board with the exception of the high school positions, and it's not that we're, we're trying to forget about them as we raise their, their rate of pay.

1020
01:37:19,975 --> 01:37:22,536
[SPEAKER_24]: ahead of the statutory increase in minimum wage.

1021
01:37:24,217 --> 01:37:33,160
[SPEAKER_24]: We've raised 6 months ahead of time last time and we would anticipate this time raising it consistent with the statutory calendar and so they would see the increase effective January 1st.

1022
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:38,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1023
01:37:39,283 --> 01:37:39,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1024
01:37:39,643 --> 01:37:40,463
[SPEAKER_19]: Mister thank you.

1025
01:37:40,483 --> 01:37:45,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Mister don't think you can get lots of questions member so it was first.

1026
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:47,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't hear anybody else.

1027
01:37:47,202 --> 01:37:47,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any?

1028
01:37:48,623 --> 01:37:51,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin, then Member Kress.

1029
01:37:51,986 --> 01:37:52,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1030
01:37:54,288 --> 01:37:57,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you need motions on any of these things?

1031
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:00,612
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds like you want our opinion to be clear.

1032
01:38:11,688 --> 01:38:12,389
[SPEAKER_24]: to the tuitions.

1033
01:38:13,169 --> 01:38:20,854
[SPEAKER_24]: A vote to essentially approve these recommendations en masse would certainly be welcome, and then we'll have clear direction and move forward.

1034
01:38:21,214 --> 01:38:31,581
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the one sort of outstanding issue is our recommendation is to use the voucher program for one more year.

1035
01:38:32,061 --> 01:38:37,185
[SPEAKER_24]: But as you probably heard in the description, I hope you heard in the description,

1036
01:38:38,484 --> 01:38:42,233
[SPEAKER_24]: We have some reservations about that because we don't think it's actually what's best for families.

1037
01:38:42,353 --> 01:38:47,666
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a shift and I can fully understand why if someone would just sort of see a brief summary of it.

1038
01:38:48,602 --> 01:38:54,105
[SPEAKER_24]: doing away with the EEC vouchers could look as though we're closing off access.

1039
01:38:54,365 --> 01:38:56,225
[SPEAKER_24]: We actually think it's going to have the opposite effect.

1040
01:38:56,926 --> 01:39:02,948
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we're trying to be respectful with regard to the timing and the pace of that transition.

1041
01:39:03,969 --> 01:39:09,031
[SPEAKER_24]: But if we were to be on a polygraph as to when we think we should transition away from the vouchers,

1042
01:39:10,038 --> 01:39:12,559
[SPEAKER_24]: it would probably be on an accelerated timeline.

1043
01:39:12,959 --> 01:39:13,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1044
01:39:13,299 --> 01:39:14,780
[SPEAKER_24]: That is, I think ultimately up to the committee.

1045
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1046
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:23,422
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, just to put this EEC vouchers in context of Medford, you said we had 14 out of 400 students, that's 3.5%.

1047
01:39:24,403 --> 01:39:29,704
[SPEAKER_19]: If we had the correct percent adjusted for our economically disadvantaged students, we've got 160 students.

1048
01:39:29,724 --> 01:39:29,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1049
01:39:33,395 --> 01:39:39,537
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at 40.5%, but we are only servicing 3.5% of our students.

1050
01:39:39,637 --> 01:39:41,658
[SPEAKER_19]: I cannot imagine a reason to delay.

1051
01:39:41,678 --> 01:39:48,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I would certainly vote for, you know, patience is not my strong suit.

1052
01:39:50,462 --> 01:39:52,963
[SPEAKER_19]: And unless you told me that you felt that it would be

1053
01:39:55,482 --> 01:40:00,486
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, administratively, just too much to figure out in this short order.

1054
01:40:01,747 --> 01:40:16,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I would certainly motion to do away with the voucher program effective, the end of this current school year, it we really can't do much worse from an equity perspective serving 3.5% of our, our economically disadvantaged families we have 30%

1055
01:40:19,338 --> 01:40:22,119
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to add one thing, Mr. Rousseau.

1056
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:32,581
[SPEAKER_24]: So the 14 students who are on the vouchers, that's how many students in the total at the school pool whose families have opted into the voucher program.

1057
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:40,383
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a higher percentage of families who are designated as economically disadvantaged who are receiving the service.

1058
01:40:41,023 --> 01:40:48,991
[SPEAKER_24]: The inference we draw from that is we are providing the service, but the vouchers are not getting to the families and they're not receiving that benefit.

1059
01:40:49,031 --> 01:40:59,963
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not that we have, I don't know, frankly, that it's at 35% or whatever the economic disadvantage percentage is, but I don't want anyone to think that we've only got 3% of economically disadvantaged students in the after school program.

1060
01:41:00,283 --> 01:41:03,987
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a minuscule number who are actually using the voucher.

1061
01:41:04,287 --> 01:41:12,339
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's actually worse means that there are people who qualify who don't really have the resources, but we're making them pay anyways.

1062
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:19,691
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, I mean, and obviously the 14 students who already have vouchers as you pointed out will be grandfathered.

1063
01:41:20,857 --> 01:41:21,818
[SPEAKER_19]: And that would carry over.

1064
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:41,072
[SPEAKER_24]: If you were to vote tonight to end the voucher program, our recommendation would be that instead of grandfathering in anyone who's on the voucher for 22-23, that we institute the grandfathering for anyone on the voucher as of 21-22, as well as siblings in those families, and that would carry through for the duration.

1065
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:44,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, to be clear, I just want to be fully transparent about this.

1066
01:41:44,715 --> 01:41:47,217
[SPEAKER_24]: That might overshoot the number of families

1067
01:41:47,777 --> 01:41:57,285
[SPEAKER_24]: who would have otherwise been eligible for vouchers, right, because someone could be economically disadvantaged and then they're not, or there's a host of different circumstances that could play out.

1068
01:41:57,485 --> 01:42:10,276
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think when we're talking about a number as small as 14, that to me would be sort of like worth it, for lack of a better term, to get to get back to a place that we have more control, more autonomy.

1069
01:42:12,055 --> 01:42:12,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1070
01:42:12,355 --> 01:42:14,676
[SPEAKER_19]: So I do make a motion to end the EEC program.

1071
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:17,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we go to the questions there before?

1072
01:42:17,858 --> 01:42:19,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

1073
01:42:19,678 --> 01:42:26,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to know if we could go through the questions before moving to promotions, because there's definitely, I mean, I think this is, thank you for this report.

1074
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:27,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a lot of really exciting.

1075
01:42:27,982 --> 01:42:29,022
[SPEAKER_10]: One second, is that okay?

1076
01:42:29,082 --> 01:42:33,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I don't have a second anyways, so.

1077
01:42:33,845 --> 01:42:34,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1078
01:42:35,185 --> 01:42:36,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think this is really great.

1079
01:42:36,626 --> 01:42:38,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited about Ms.

1080
01:42:38,787 --> 01:42:41,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Fidler-Carey being in this role and,

1081
01:42:42,189 --> 01:42:46,614
[SPEAKER_10]: having recently been on a family and community engagement training with her.

1082
01:42:46,634 --> 01:42:48,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited about the opportunities that are here.

1083
01:42:48,636 --> 01:42:53,821
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess I'm really interested in the paraprofessional piece.

1084
01:42:53,961 --> 01:42:59,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that obviously accessibility for students on IEPs and English learners is

1085
01:43:00,124 --> 01:43:01,285
[SPEAKER_10]: is and has been a concern.

1086
01:43:01,305 --> 01:43:06,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know there was an anti-discrimination clause that was created, I believe last year.

1087
01:43:06,827 --> 01:43:17,052
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to ask if in the anti-discrimination clause, there's also a statement that says, if you need additional services or supports to let us know, because I know that's what Medford REC sort of is doing.

1088
01:43:17,112 --> 01:43:28,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need some consistency, I guess, around some of those just to make sure that we're getting those, but getting back to the voucher program, I guess my thoughts on this are a couple of things.

1089
01:43:30,405 --> 01:43:33,149
[SPEAKER_10]: how many families are aware of the voucher program, right?

1090
01:43:33,569 --> 01:43:43,843
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that the EEC is offering the voucher program, but do we as a community have a responsibility to make sure that families know about this voucher program, right?

1091
01:43:43,883 --> 01:43:48,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And how they access the voucher program, particularly when we're talking about grandfathering in people, right?

1092
01:43:48,947 --> 01:44:07,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would be really reluctant to vote yes on, you know, ending this right now and having the current folks grandfathered in because I want to give people the opportunity to be grandfathered in and get these vouchers through perhaps some, you know, outreach or education to families about the availability of the vouchers.

1093
01:44:07,834 --> 01:44:14,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess also because we don't have a clear delineation on what the hardship application that's going to be developed looks like.

1094
01:44:15,431 --> 01:44:16,632
[SPEAKER_10]: it's all kind of ambiguous.

1095
01:44:16,672 --> 01:44:27,859
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that the intent here is, is really on point in terms of let's get rid of the bureaucracy and the paperwork and make sure that we're getting access to our students and really being there for them.

1096
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:36,364
[SPEAKER_10]: But in reality, at the same time, the EEC voucher, you know, is created for some reason to be able to get families, you know, access.

1097
01:44:36,384 --> 01:44:40,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can create a comparable sort of system without the bureaucracy, obviously,

1098
01:44:41,452 --> 01:44:55,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that's great, but we haven't yet, and so how do we how do we sort of make that bridge, I guess, is what I'm saying, so I want us to really be thoughtful before just just moving ahead, because I obviously don't want to and I know you don't want to.

1099
01:44:55,994 --> 01:44:58,736
[SPEAKER_10]: exclude folks who are economically disadvantaged.

1100
01:44:58,856 --> 01:45:04,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it is a real disappointment that so many of these families qualify, but they're not actually using the budget program.

1101
01:45:05,201 --> 01:45:12,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And knowing one of the directors at the EEC, I think, you know, she would be horrified to know that that's really what's happening on the ground level.

1102
01:45:12,206 --> 01:45:14,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure that the data bears that out for them.

1103
01:45:14,848 --> 01:45:19,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So they see that in some way, as we know, with the SNAP gap and other things, why aren't people applying?

1104
01:45:19,452 --> 01:45:19,552
[SPEAKER_10]: So

1105
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:25,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I guess I would just say, I would like to be a little bit more thoughtful and just sort of moving ahead with it.

1106
01:45:25,478 --> 01:45:28,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I, I, I do appreciate and understand the motive behind it.

1107
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:32,804
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just love to know, you know, and again, what families want.

1108
01:45:32,884 --> 01:45:39,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, whether it's a, the community engagement subcommittee or, or what, I don't know, but you know, what does the hardship application look like?

1109
01:45:39,889 --> 01:45:49,637
[SPEAKER_10]: How will it be developed and implemented with community input so that we're making sure that we're being thoughtful about this, but also really having an outreach program regarding the voucher program so that families know

1110
01:45:50,353 --> 01:45:56,798
[SPEAKER_10]: that they could be grandfathered in for the rest of their child's stay if they're in fact eligible.

1111
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:57,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1112
01:45:57,959 --> 01:45:58,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ms.

1113
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,000
[SPEAKER_24]: McLaughlin.

1114
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:17,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Your question about wanting to essentially double down on the communication to make sure that everyone who should be making that decision about whether to apply for vouchers and making an informed decision is the underlying basis for our formal recommendation to essentially use them for one more year.

1115
01:46:18,716 --> 01:46:19,157
[SPEAKER_24]: And so again,

1116
01:46:20,222 --> 01:46:22,883
[SPEAKER_24]: That makes sense, and I think it's perfectly rational.

1117
01:46:25,503 --> 01:46:30,104
[SPEAKER_24]: The only sort of concern, I guess there's two concerns.

1118
01:46:30,984 --> 01:46:33,725
[SPEAKER_24]: One would be, and I think one's a little more realistic than the other.

1119
01:46:34,105 --> 01:46:37,305
[SPEAKER_24]: First, I'll use what I think is more realistic concern first.

1120
01:46:38,006 --> 01:46:49,668
[SPEAKER_24]: If we just see the same rate of participation, even though we double down our communication, all we will have done is essentially create a greater burden

1121
01:46:50,161 --> 01:46:53,342
[SPEAKER_24]: that fewer people benefit and takes longer for the benefits to be realized, right?

1122
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:54,263
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a downside.

1123
01:46:55,363 --> 01:47:03,507
[SPEAKER_24]: The other downside, honestly, and again, I don't really, based on the numbers I've seen, I'm not particularly concerned about this, but I'm concerned enough where I feel like I have to mention it.

1124
01:47:04,527 --> 01:47:12,171
[SPEAKER_24]: If the floodgates open and we have a tremendous amount of interest in the voucher program, in order to maintain

1125
01:47:12,824 --> 01:47:33,317
[SPEAKER_24]: the revenue stream in order to implement some of these other recommendations, potentially the paraprofessional piece being one of them, we may have to come back next year and say, we're going to have to continue the voucher program, which if it's just based on an uptick, ultimately could lead to the same barriers being in place long-term.

1126
01:47:33,937 --> 01:47:37,499
[SPEAKER_24]: So that is a risk that I think has to be weighed.

1127
01:47:39,065 --> 01:47:46,331
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think ultimately, it's up to the committee about which of these two risks you want us to exercise.

1128
01:47:46,991 --> 01:47:47,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that make sense?

1129
01:47:47,892 --> 01:47:48,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1130
01:47:48,373 --> 01:47:50,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, with a follow-up question to that?

1131
01:47:53,517 --> 01:47:54,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair?

1132
01:47:54,417 --> 01:47:56,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, may I follow up with a question?

1133
01:47:56,519 --> 01:47:57,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1134
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:58,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1135
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:01,683
[SPEAKER_10]: So, thank you for that response.

1136
01:48:03,332 --> 01:48:13,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, you know, there's a lot of, you know, what ifs and ands, and I think that I would really like the data to drive the decision, as I know you all do in the long run as well.

1137
01:48:14,002 --> 01:48:29,375
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess, you know, again, reaching out to the, hopefully the LPAC that's being created, the CPAC, other organizations and entities, MFN, others that can really even have a voucher, you know, workshop program or something like that, that could, you know, help families, I think could be really useful.

1138
01:48:30,241 --> 01:48:33,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was something else that you had said that I just wanted to follow up on.

1139
01:48:33,662 --> 01:48:34,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that was it.

1140
01:48:34,723 --> 01:48:40,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and the other question is, and I know you said other districts are doing this and have been doing this through your afterschool network.

1141
01:48:41,505 --> 01:48:45,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So the other question is, what happens if a family comes in with a voucher?

1142
01:48:45,547 --> 01:48:51,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is it legal to say, well, we don't use those vouchers, we're gonna have to do this system through the vouchers?

1143
01:48:51,849 --> 01:48:52,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, how does that work?

1144
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:59,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there programs that, and we, so we have that right on our website right now, is that we accept vouchers from Child Care Circuit

1145
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our liaison that we use.

1146
01:49:02,182 --> 01:49:07,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there are programs that don't accept vouchers, but typically have their own system.

1147
01:49:08,066 --> 01:49:08,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Other districts?

1148
01:49:09,026 --> 01:49:09,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1149
01:49:09,787 --> 01:49:11,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, certainly, yes, other districts.

1150
01:49:11,068 --> 01:49:18,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you move in and you have a voucher, and the district doesn't accept it, then you get on their program.

1151
01:49:18,373 --> 01:49:21,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know any of the, just off the top, any districts that do that?

1152
01:49:22,936 --> 01:49:24,377
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, really most of them.

1153
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:25,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So Holliston got rid of it.

1154
01:49:26,258 --> 01:49:28,540
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the co-chair with me on NEDS.

1155
01:49:31,307 --> 01:49:40,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't wanna miss it, but really most of them, every time we're there, whenever we meet this topic, another person, another district has gotten off of it.

1156
01:49:44,517 --> 01:49:45,598
[SPEAKER_10]: EEC has some work to do.

1157
01:49:45,738 --> 01:49:46,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

1158
01:49:46,878 --> 01:49:57,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what, actually, I've met with my liaison from EEC and her supervisor, and I've voiced all these concerns, and that's certainly not the first time they heard it.

1159
01:49:57,663 --> 01:50:11,549
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I guess two years ago, I wasn't part of this at this time, but Ned sent a letter collectively suggesting to the district or to the department of how this could be done better for districts, you know, from that perspective.

1160
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:12,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1161
01:50:14,213 --> 01:50:18,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Mister governor you did also ask about the hardship waiver piece that that would obviously be pushed out.

1162
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,022
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition to the other districts we have a

1163
01:50:23,181 --> 01:50:30,623
[SPEAKER_24]: a program so much similar to the program that would sort of be our starting point I don't think we would make it identical in an identical fashion.

1164
01:50:30,963 --> 01:50:35,944
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there are a few variables that distinguish the service school service that we have to take into account.

1165
01:50:35,964 --> 01:50:52,728
[SPEAKER_24]: But we would certainly draw that up with a high level of specificity one of the pieces that I would imagine just to sort of an illustration as to what would be included is we would likely have temporary discounts or waivers in place so that the family is enrolled in that there's a financial burden.

1166
01:50:53,168 --> 01:51:02,470
[SPEAKER_24]: potentially we would waive the fee over a portion of the year, but not necessarily for the duration of the school year to provide for the flexibility that some families need with respect to afterschool care.

1167
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:06,411
[SPEAKER_24]: That's just sort of one facet that we could potentially develop.

1168
01:51:06,471 --> 01:51:17,534
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that we would have to develop for when the voucher system, I don't think there's a strong argument if EEC stays the same to continuing the voucher program in perpetuity.

1169
01:51:17,714 --> 01:51:20,895
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that we have to make a transition, at least that's our view.

1170
01:51:22,056 --> 01:51:27,659
[SPEAKER_24]: And when that happens, we just have to maintain equitable access to and so we're going to have to ramp up our.

1171
01:51:29,631 --> 01:51:32,294
[SPEAKER_24]: our system, our hardship application.

1172
01:51:32,794 --> 01:51:45,088
[SPEAKER_24]: And even in this proposal that we make tonight, there's a discount in that we would not, and we don't think we should, impose the modest rate increase on families that are direct certified as economically disadvantaged.

1173
01:51:45,969 --> 01:51:51,474
[SPEAKER_24]: And as I said, we think that tuition will ultimately have to go up in order to maintain competitiveness.

1174
01:51:52,115 --> 01:52:14,846
[SPEAKER_24]: And so you could sort of envision a world in which each year the administration is coming back to you, asking to raise the tuition to maintain the revenue to support the program, but either based on the data we can look at in the next year, increasing the discount or maintaining that rate of pay, which excuse me, rate of tuition, which would then sort of by definition expand this or increase the discount.

1175
01:52:15,266 --> 01:52:17,527
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's that's sort of the type of formula that we're looking at now.

1176
01:52:17,727 --> 01:52:18,828
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, the data will tell a lot.

1177
01:52:18,848 --> 01:52:19,168
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1178
01:52:20,058 --> 01:52:20,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1179
01:52:20,558 --> 01:52:21,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Kretz?

1180
01:52:21,379 --> 01:52:22,119
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, thank you.

1181
01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:26,422
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for the report, and I think it's great, the proposal that you have here.

1182
01:52:26,442 --> 01:52:32,065
[SPEAKER_29]: I just had a question, because you're going to preclude the four-day week option.

1183
01:52:33,045 --> 01:52:35,547
[SPEAKER_29]: Do we currently have families that are enrolled in that right now?

1184
01:52:36,565 --> 01:52:48,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We do, we do have a few I don't know the number off the top of my head, but it is very few, it's most you know mostly people really need the full five days, or, you know, just a couple days, the two or three day option works.

1185
01:52:48,733 --> 01:52:57,219
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there aren't that many who need only four, because at that point, you know either their kids love it and they sign up for all five or.

1186
01:52:58,998 --> 01:53:00,199
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, yeah.

1187
01:53:00,559 --> 01:53:05,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would be happy to look into that for you just to see how many families that would affect.

1188
01:53:05,941 --> 01:53:17,286
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I'm just curious like if we're gonna reach out to those families to just let them know that, you know, in advance, these are gonna be some changes and you can either drop down to three or increase to five.

1189
01:53:17,826 --> 01:53:23,168
[SPEAKER_29]: And then there's also the tuition, you know, application for a discount if needed.

1190
01:53:23,288 --> 01:53:23,889
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, yeah.

1191
01:53:24,289 --> 01:53:25,189
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, thank you.

1192
01:53:25,729 --> 01:53:26,030
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1193
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:26,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

1194
01:53:31,146 --> 01:53:44,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be in favor of shutting down the vouchers if you can tell us that you're confident that you can put a more equitable system in place before the start of the next school year.

1195
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:53,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that what you're saying is given the barriers that we're seeing in the lack of participation that I'm very confident that we can put something that's more equitable than the voucher system in place.

1196
01:53:54,395 --> 01:54:01,578
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's, I think, can we put the, are we going to hit the bullseye at the perfect system in place for hardship waivers.

1197
01:54:02,979 --> 01:54:13,848
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's something we'll have to look at year in and year out, look at what the access is, look at how the demographics of the school program compared to our overall population and make a determination as to whether or not there are additional tweaks.

1198
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:17,831
[SPEAKER_24]: But will we discount more than 14 families?

1199
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:20,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, my answer is yes.

1200
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:35,696
[SPEAKER_24]: And essentially, the reason I'm sort of I'm hesitating but ultimately I'm comfortable with this is that we are running our revenue and actual program is very strong.

1201
01:54:36,176 --> 01:54:46,383
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a surplus, we will have to look at that year in and year out to determine whether or not we have to offer a greater discount based on families circumstances.

1202
01:54:47,248 --> 01:55:04,884
[SPEAKER_24]: Because there are so many uncertainties and so many variables, I'm not comfortable going sort of further than the discount rate that we've discussed here tonight, because we're just sort of automatically discounted because of economic disadvantage, because I don't know what the cost of adding the surround care paraprofessionals is going to be.

1203
01:55:05,544 --> 01:55:11,690
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what it's going to take in order to truly expand seats and to staff up Megan's department the way we need to.

1204
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:19,654
[SPEAKER_24]: And so with those uncertain variables, there's sort of only so far that I would be comfortable going from a financial perspective.

1205
01:55:20,595 --> 01:55:29,140
[SPEAKER_24]: But if the question is, will more families who are designated as economically disadvantaged have access to afterschool program at a discounted rate?

1206
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:35,183
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the answer is definitely yes, just based on the minuscule number of families that are using vouchers.

1207
01:55:36,164 --> 01:55:40,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other good news is since other districts in the NETS program have done this,

1208
01:55:40,762 --> 01:55:43,946
[SPEAKER_07]: years before us, we've got a lot of models to check with.

1209
01:55:43,986 --> 01:55:54,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've actually collected all of the different options that are used in different districts and, you know, and included in that list, our MEEP program and how we determine need.

1210
01:55:54,519 --> 01:55:57,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I can happily go back to them and say,

1211
01:55:58,190 --> 01:56:03,774
[SPEAKER_07]: what didn't work from what you put in place in the past, and is there any tweaking that you've done since you put this in place?

1212
01:56:04,134 --> 01:56:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that from the list of different options that we've got, we will definitely be able to come up with something good for Medford.

1213
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:26,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And the idea behind the surround care paraprofessional that you're seeking our approval to bargain about, I assume, is that we're creating a pool of workers who,

1214
01:56:27,165 --> 01:56:40,254
[SPEAKER_08]: can provide support during part of the school day, but then explicitly for aftercare, and they would be part of the paraprofessionals union, which is not something our afterschool staff are part of today, is that correct?

1215
01:56:40,634 --> 01:56:44,797
[SPEAKER_24]: There are paraprofessionals who work in the afterschool program, but it's not part of their paraprofessional duties.

1216
01:56:45,277 --> 01:56:51,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but like the folks who work after school, just after school, they are not part of the paraprofessionals.

1217
01:56:52,242 --> 01:56:52,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would be,

1218
01:56:54,175 --> 01:57:01,878
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, creating it in addition to I'm assuming that part of the process here is to bargain around things like.

1219
01:57:02,464 --> 01:57:10,106
[SPEAKER_08]: health benefits, sick leave, all the things that are part of the paras contract would be- Not for all the afterschool staff though.

1220
01:57:10,126 --> 01:57:12,667
[SPEAKER_08]: But for these folks, these surround care paras.

1221
01:57:12,927 --> 01:57:13,227
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1222
01:57:13,247 --> 01:57:18,349
[SPEAKER_24]: So there would still be non-unit personnel who work at an hourly rate as afterschool employees.

1223
01:57:18,849 --> 01:57:23,210
[SPEAKER_24]: There would still be paraprofessionals who work the normal school day hours.

1224
01:57:23,631 --> 01:57:28,072
[SPEAKER_24]: And then there would be a new classification of position within the paraprofessional unit

1225
01:57:28,592 --> 01:57:37,375
[SPEAKER_24]: that would work a modified set of hours that encompasses presumably the second portion of the school day and the afterschool.

1226
01:57:37,495 --> 01:57:49,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Frankly, and this is something we'd have to negotiate, but there could be a scenario in which a paraprofessional works a morning shift, leaves, and then comes back, but their total work today encompasses the afterschool program.

1227
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:51,220
[SPEAKER_24]: That's something that we would need to negotiate.

1228
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:56,742
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to be very clear, because I know community members and staff members are probably watching this discussion.

1229
01:57:57,402 --> 01:58:02,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Typically, this is a conversation that we would have with the paraprofessional union.

1230
01:58:03,184 --> 01:58:05,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Perhaps we would negotiate a new provision, a new classification.

1231
01:58:05,945 --> 01:58:06,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Perhaps we would not.

1232
01:58:06,985 --> 01:58:08,586
[SPEAKER_24]: Perhaps we would unilaterally create one.

1233
01:58:08,906 --> 01:58:15,848
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it would be brought to the school committee as part of an MOA, or even potentially as part of the budget, not necessarily the focus of the conversation here.

1234
01:58:16,647 --> 01:58:31,116
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a strategic priority of the districts that will require bargaining, but has implications for the after school program that we both need your approval on rates of pay and tuition for, and we know there's interest in the community.

1235
01:58:31,196 --> 01:58:38,120
[SPEAKER_24]: So as I said, I did communicate to the paraprofessional union that this would be discussed, but the sequence is a little unorthodox.

1236
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:40,482
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to sort of spell that out for everyone.

1237
01:58:43,645 --> 01:58:47,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Your report doesn't talk about all the people on the wait list.

1238
01:58:48,148 --> 01:59:12,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I think, as you mentioned, the work that we did last year with the intention to create a more appealing rate of pay in an effort to expand seats did not exactly pan out because of what is happening, not just in Medford Public Schools, but literally everywhere in terms of the worker shortage.

1239
01:59:14,683 --> 01:59:17,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So that didn't pan out in terms of expansion of seats.

1240
01:59:17,745 --> 01:59:28,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's probably, I imagine if anyone looked at the agenda on the first day back from vacation, there's probably a lot of people really interested to know, are we expanding seats?

1241
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:30,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we do it for real this time?

1242
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:40,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they are still without the options that would be a better fit for their financial situation, their schedule, their families, and all those things.

1243
01:59:41,399 --> 01:59:44,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do we crack that nut?

1244
01:59:45,382 --> 01:59:52,928
[SPEAKER_08]: And do we think this is going to actually create space in the programs where there is a wait list?

1245
01:59:53,929 --> 01:59:55,590
[SPEAKER_24]: Which is, I think, just in one school.

1246
01:59:55,950 --> 01:59:59,033
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think what I could say is it's a shared goal.

1247
01:59:59,173 --> 02:00:04,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Our goal right now is to expand seats to provide that service to the community.

1248
02:00:05,338 --> 02:00:09,201
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a scenario in which we decided it's not our goal because we don't think we're gonna be able to do it.

1249
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:11,262
[SPEAKER_24]: and there are other avenues that we could explore.

1250
02:00:11,602 --> 02:00:12,663
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not our position.

1251
02:00:12,683 --> 02:00:14,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Our position is we want to expand the seats.

1252
02:00:15,004 --> 02:00:17,606
[SPEAKER_24]: If the question is, are we going to be successful this time?

1253
02:00:18,286 --> 02:00:19,287
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to be really honest.

1254
02:00:19,307 --> 02:00:20,928
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought we were going to be successful last time.

1255
02:00:20,948 --> 02:00:21,949
[SPEAKER_24]: We weren't.

1256
02:00:22,409 --> 02:00:26,411
[SPEAKER_24]: So what I can say is we're not just going to do the same thing over again and keep our fingers crossed.

1257
02:00:26,451 --> 02:00:27,592
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to try these other things.

1258
02:00:28,252 --> 02:00:29,433
[SPEAKER_24]: My hope is that we're successful.

1259
02:00:30,354 --> 02:00:38,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And how will that impact the infamous upcoming lottery, which people are waiting with bated breath on?

1260
02:00:40,313 --> 02:00:47,077
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of like, that's gonna happen before we know that we have staff to expand the program, right?

1261
02:00:47,277 --> 02:00:47,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1262
02:00:48,478 --> 02:00:56,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, the lottery is for our open seats and the open seats are typically mostly at the kindergarten level.

1263
02:00:56,724 --> 02:01:07,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the unfortunate hard news that I'm often sharing is that a lot of people, once they are on the wait list, it is hard to get off the wait list year after year.

1264
02:01:09,554 --> 02:01:21,221
[SPEAKER_07]: So for new kindergartners, it's not a totally fresh class because we have spots for current students and their incoming kindergarten siblings.

1265
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:24,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So the lottery is coming.

1266
02:01:24,403 --> 02:01:30,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And last year, it was just amazing at one of our schools how many incoming kindergarten siblings there were.

1267
02:01:30,626 --> 02:01:33,848
[SPEAKER_07]: There were so many that there were so few seats open.

1268
02:01:36,467 --> 02:01:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know yet we haven't we haven't asked families we're asking them in two weeks about when who's committing for next year and who has siblings so we'll have numbers of how many seats spots are available and then we'll run the lottery and then the lottery will take those seats first and I the other thing that I

1269
02:01:58,364 --> 02:02:11,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've mentioned to you in the past is this notion that like once you're on the list like that's your spot forever like there's like if you're, you know, low down on the list like basically hang it up for the next six years.

1270
02:02:13,736 --> 02:02:21,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there, can you do some thinking around how to create a better system for the families who are on the wait list, who?

1271
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:32,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if we, one thing that we could try is saying that you don't keep your space on the wait list from year to year and the wait list stops and goes back into the lottery.

1272
02:02:32,984 --> 02:02:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That's done by some districts, not most.

1273
02:02:36,565 --> 02:02:42,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I've, this is a, again, this is another conversation we have all the time with NEDS multiple times a year.

1274
02:02:44,257 --> 02:02:51,501
[SPEAKER_07]: what people have found to be most equitable and most comfortable for districts is to keep the spot on the wait list.

1275
02:02:52,642 --> 02:02:56,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as you kind of creep up, you've crept up.

1276
02:02:57,025 --> 02:02:59,726
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there is, you know, a lottery is about chance.

1277
02:02:59,886 --> 02:03:08,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we did away with the wait list, then people might have a chance to move to a higher spot if they go through a lottery than the year to year.

1278
02:03:08,452 --> 02:03:12,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that, you know, if directed, we could certainly explore.

1279
02:03:13,222 --> 02:03:22,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I'm sensitive to the fact that there's lots of folks who move into the district and they're like, forget about it they don't have a chance.

1280
02:03:22,605 --> 02:03:23,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1281
02:03:23,346 --> 02:03:29,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's also people whose circumstances change from, you know, over the course of six years and again like they just

1282
02:03:30,873 --> 02:03:35,974
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like not even an option for them to even win the lottery, so to speak.

1283
02:03:36,674 --> 02:03:47,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, as I've talked to people, what I've tried to impress upon people is that the answer to all this like lottery mumbo jumbo is actually to have enough seats.

1284
02:03:47,757 --> 02:03:51,217
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just don't expect us to be able to get there in one year.

1285
02:04:01,325 --> 02:04:20,335
[SPEAKER_07]: options in the city because when I call other districts to find out why, how did they not have as as long wait lists as we have, their reason is because they've got a very robust boys and girls club or they've got this, you know, all kinds of private, big, big afterschool options in their towns that we don't have in this city.

1286
02:04:22,836 --> 02:04:26,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like even if we can expand the seats, it won't be enough.

1287
02:04:26,578 --> 02:04:29,059
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll still, we still will be having this conversation.

1288
02:04:31,902 --> 02:04:37,882
[SPEAKER_24]: The way right now there are more fundamentals that we could look at, but the increase in the tuition.

1289
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:46,844
[SPEAKER_24]: and the attempt to expand the seats are two ways of mitigating the challenge of the waitlist, right?

1290
02:04:47,204 --> 02:04:58,010
[SPEAKER_24]: Because as we raise tuition, presumably there are families that see it as a slight preference as opposed to a necessity who should become less interested.

1291
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:02,652
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're trying to find sort of the right place in the market that will do that.

1292
02:05:02,712 --> 02:05:02,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Now,

1293
02:05:05,106 --> 02:05:17,716
[SPEAKER_24]: at least one school, arguably two, the wait lists are such that our modest increase in tuition and our desperate attempt to expand seats are probably gonna have mixed results.

1294
02:05:18,257 --> 02:05:25,743
[SPEAKER_24]: And at the same time, we've got other schools that like these two strategies alone might very well expand the seats in a way that could eliminate the wait lists, right?

1295
02:05:26,584 --> 02:05:29,867
[SPEAKER_24]: So in some ways we're sort of a tale of two cities in that respect.

1296
02:05:29,887 --> 02:05:31,788
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think we have to just keep plugging that.

1297
02:05:33,149 --> 02:05:35,792
[SPEAKER_24]: for as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1298
02:05:35,812 --> 02:05:38,554
[SPEAKER_24]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1299
02:05:38,574 --> 02:05:40,556
[SPEAKER_15]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1300
02:05:40,576 --> 02:05:42,538
[SPEAKER_15]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1301
02:05:42,578 --> 02:05:44,720
[SPEAKER_15]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1302
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:46,641
[SPEAKER_15]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1303
02:05:46,661 --> 02:05:48,923
[SPEAKER_15]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1304
02:05:48,943 --> 02:05:51,506
[SPEAKER_15]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1305
02:05:51,546 --> 02:05:55,129
For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1306
02:05:55,169 --> 02:05:58,352
[SPEAKER_08]: For as long as this is our strategic goal to expand the seats to just keep chipping away at it.

1307
02:05:58,372 --> 02:05:58,652
[SPEAKER_08]: For as long as

1308
02:06:00,253 --> 02:06:01,613
[SPEAKER_08]: because space is not an issue.

1309
02:06:01,673 --> 02:06:06,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we would solve the space problem if we were not held back by staffing.

1310
02:06:06,314 --> 02:06:09,655
[SPEAKER_24]: There may be some other hurdles we have to clear, but our issue is staffing, not space.

1311
02:06:09,795 --> 02:06:10,755
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a fair position.

1312
02:06:11,055 --> 02:06:13,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1313
02:06:13,976 --> 02:06:14,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1314
02:06:17,297 --> 02:06:19,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Hayes and then Member McLaughlin.

1315
02:06:20,798 --> 02:06:21,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1316
02:06:22,318 --> 02:06:22,798
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of

1317
02:06:23,308 --> 02:06:24,829
[SPEAKER_18]: hopefully quick questions.

1318
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:42,364
[SPEAKER_18]: One is, I feel like I remember this being discussed at a meeting, but I think it predated me, talk about a sliding scale to increase the revenue from those who maybe could afford a little bit more while still keeping it affordable for others.

1319
02:06:42,424 --> 02:06:44,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like that's been discussed.

1320
02:06:44,366 --> 02:06:46,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe there was a reason why it was dismissed.

1321
02:06:46,247 --> 02:06:46,708
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1322
02:06:47,068 --> 02:06:49,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I'll ask my other question into the boat,

1323
02:06:50,515 --> 02:06:55,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Given that we were just talking about how limited it is really difficult to find after school care.

1324
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:04,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Before school, I'm sure I know from experience after school care is very difficult to find, and given that especially it's hard to find anything affordable.

1325
02:07:04,306 --> 02:07:12,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we talk about or has there been talk about making sure that there are seats, some seats available?

1326
02:07:12,953 --> 02:07:14,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know at this point.

1327
02:07:14,074 --> 02:07:18,878
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you spoke earlier, but I'm not sure we talked about numbers of how many actual

1328
02:07:19,747 --> 02:07:35,761
[SPEAKER_18]: students that are from low income or economically disadvantaged families, and how are we making sure that not only it's affordable for them, but there are seats available for them, because it's going to be that much harder for them to find accessible, affordable child care than for some of the members of the community.

1329
02:07:37,187 --> 02:07:42,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, very good questions and very legitimate issues that we know families are facing.

1330
02:07:43,112 --> 02:08:02,347
[SPEAKER_24]: With respect to the sliding scale, this proposal tonight is a step in that direction because we're instituting a discount, despite whatever implications there might be for vouchers, we're instituting a discount for anyone who's direct certified as economically disadvantaged or low income.

1331
02:08:03,789 --> 02:08:04,109
[SPEAKER_24]: I think

1332
02:08:04,851 --> 02:08:15,795
[SPEAKER_24]: And I talked a little bit about sort of my concern around maintaining a healthy revenue stream, especially when we're potentially adding additional costs to the program and to the district.

1333
02:08:16,475 --> 02:08:28,220
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think this is this version of the sliding scale, a modest sliding scale, clearly Tier 1 and Tier 2, although with a hardship waiver that could sort of expand it to some degree.

1334
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:36,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, is essentially how that's as far as I am at the moment, comfortable going in terms of putting revenue at risk.

1335
02:08:37,094 --> 02:08:41,441
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, we have, we have a healthy surplus the fund the revolving fund finished.

1336
02:08:43,972 --> 02:09:02,027
[SPEAKER_24]: One with close to $800,000 that seems very robust but as we talked about last year we have to be prepared for a variety of circumstances that require us to maintain a robust revolving fund there and we absorbed.

1337
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:25,165
[SPEAKER_24]: going into this year we plan to absorb the costs of those increases that we put into place and we would be absorbing to some degree, whether it's through a hardship program through the diminishing value of the reimbursement of the voucher, or in this modest sliding sliding scale with the discounted for economically disadvantaged, we're prepared to absorb those costs.

1338
02:09:26,165 --> 02:09:29,548
[SPEAKER_24]: but at some point, you know, there's risk involved.

1339
02:09:30,148 --> 02:09:34,651
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think what we want to do is look at the data to see exactly how many discounts do we offer?

1340
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:38,113
[SPEAKER_24]: How many, what is the level of discount that we offer?

1341
02:09:38,553 --> 02:09:41,875
[SPEAKER_24]: What are the, what fees are waived because of grandfathering or anything else?

1342
02:09:42,256 --> 02:09:51,001
[SPEAKER_24]: Then we look at the revolving fund next year and determine, can we expand that sliding scale either by giving it a steeper discount or by increasing the cost or both?

1343
02:09:51,642 --> 02:09:53,943
[SPEAKER_24]: And so this is essentially the first step in that direction.

1344
02:09:57,067 --> 02:10:02,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there some way we can get more detailed information about what you're looking at?

1345
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:03,751
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if that's even appropriate.

1346
02:10:03,771 --> 02:10:03,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1347
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:13,336
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we can provide all of that, but the variables are essentially the demographics of the students in the program in terms of how many are low income and economically disadvantaged.

1348
02:10:13,756 --> 02:10:15,577
[SPEAKER_24]: What's the rate of discount that we would provide?

1349
02:10:16,058 --> 02:10:17,298
[SPEAKER_24]: What's the total number of students?

1350
02:10:18,259 --> 02:10:20,120
[SPEAKER_24]: What is the level of participation?

1351
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:21,961
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said, there's a variable with respect to how many days.

1352
02:10:22,461 --> 02:10:27,643
[SPEAKER_24]: people who are receiving service, and then what is the tuition that is established here with the committee.

1353
02:10:27,663 --> 02:10:33,326
[SPEAKER_24]: And we would have to factor all of that in to make a determination as to what is the level of risk that we can absorb.

1354
02:10:34,106 --> 02:10:36,487
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want anyone to think there's sort of a magical number here.

1355
02:10:36,527 --> 02:10:44,490
[SPEAKER_24]: We could say we can discuss this many kids at this rate, if this is the tuition, and so on and so forth, because that variable of how much service we're providing is so fluid.

1356
02:10:45,071 --> 02:10:47,932
[SPEAKER_24]: And also, without having bargained,

1357
02:10:48,652 --> 02:11:02,452
[SPEAKER_24]: the Surround Care Para proposal, if there's no way I can say this is exactly how much this will cost, all I can sort of give you is the best counsel I can sort of muster with respect to how much risk we should take on.

1358
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:14,201
[SPEAKER_18]: has there been consideration from the other end, looking at the data of how many people could afford more so that maybe this modest, very modest increase could be more of an increase to people who could afford more?

1359
02:11:14,221 --> 02:11:15,061
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a fair question.

1360
02:11:15,182 --> 02:11:19,406
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always much harder data to ascertain for a variety of reasons.

1361
02:11:27,624 --> 02:11:33,612
[SPEAKER_24]: low income and economically disadvantaged, we don't have a sort of parallel system to determine like what is the capacity of needs.

1362
02:11:34,733 --> 02:11:40,781
[SPEAKER_24]: And so, can we survey, yes, and I think collecting that data over the next year could be helpful.

1363
02:11:43,218 --> 02:11:46,779
[SPEAKER_24]: but there's always going to be an issue with asking people how much they can afford.

1364
02:11:47,379 --> 02:11:51,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'd argue a little bit that we did get that from the community.

1365
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:59,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So last year we had a lot of very vocal community members, and that was one of the recommendations.

1366
02:11:59,222 --> 02:12:04,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that came up in this body last year as well, thinking that that was something to consider because the community was

1367
02:12:05,002 --> 02:12:12,047
[SPEAKER_24]: suggesting and I think it's hard data it's totally anecdotal but it's going to be really honest like I am hesitant to draw.

1368
02:12:12,067 --> 02:12:18,291
[SPEAKER_24]: It's sort of your conclusions based off of like.

1369
02:12:21,753 --> 02:12:26,176
[SPEAKER_24]: Constituency coming for that exercise in their right to advocate right.

1370
02:12:26,456 --> 02:12:29,278
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know that that representative of the community I don't.

1371
02:12:29,833 --> 02:12:36,755
[SPEAKER_24]: And it also may be representative of the community within a particular school community, but not necessarily reflected in the city of Medford.

1372
02:12:37,315 --> 02:12:52,598
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I have great hesitation or reservations about drawing disproportionate inferences from what I think is, you know, firstly, very legitimate people expressing their own views and how it affects their families.

1373
02:12:53,059 --> 02:12:55,579
[SPEAKER_24]: But our responsibility is how does this affect families at large?

1374
02:12:56,379 --> 02:12:58,840
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that's what we need more data to really ascertain.

1375
02:12:59,829 --> 02:13:01,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have one more thing to to to address.

1376
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:26,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I do cross departmental plug right now is thinking about making sure that more families are bailing themselves of the service and more families that might see it is as you know we have engagement specialists now who are doing a better job of our who are there so that we as a district can do a better job of creating relationships with families to I just franchise for whatever reason and so and a common recommendation might be

1377
02:13:27,815 --> 02:13:30,576
[SPEAKER_07]: what's best for your child is to have somewhere to go after school.

1378
02:13:30,716 --> 02:13:34,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And isn't this great news, I can educate you and inform you about how you can afford it.

1379
02:13:34,837 --> 02:13:46,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So for families who might think that the afterschool is not for them because they could never afford it, we now have engagement specialists who can take the time to really inform them and educate the specific targeted community members.

1380
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:51,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So that might answer your question about reaching out to more low-income families.

1381
02:13:53,004 --> 02:13:53,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1382
02:13:56,205 --> 02:13:57,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

1383
02:13:59,838 --> 02:14:00,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1384
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:00,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, thank you.

1385
02:14:00,838 --> 02:14:01,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's on.

1386
02:14:02,198 --> 02:14:02,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1387
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:23,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just feel like you've obviously given a lot of thought to this and there's a lot of comparative data around what other folks are doing and your recommendation for waiting the year with a voucher program, your initial recommendation, I think is important as we think about these families and how they are accessing.

1388
02:14:23,083 --> 02:14:24,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that

1389
02:14:24,802 --> 02:14:26,764
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we go with your recommendation on that.

1390
02:14:26,904 --> 02:14:39,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that you're being very thoughtful in the step-by-step process of it, which I'm encouraged to see, especially with the thinking about and wanting to know more about what the hardship application process will be and what that will look like.

1391
02:14:40,199 --> 02:15:04,924
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, sort of the family engagement piece of this, like how are we engaging the community in this conversation to make sure that they're feeling ownership around this too, whether it's, you know, an ability to pay more or whether it's input on what the hardship application process looks like, or whether it's, let's continue the voucher for one more year, because we need to be able to apply and get the word out to folks that you can apply, because what I'm hearing from

1392
02:15:05,943 --> 02:15:19,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what I'm hearing from Mr. Murphy is that the risk piece of it around, you know, just our hardship application may be more than with the voucher application because of the reimbursement process.

1393
02:15:19,528 --> 02:15:21,628
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you guys are being really thoughtful about this.

1394
02:15:21,848 --> 02:15:24,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to take your recommendation that we wait on that.

1395
02:15:25,190 --> 02:15:28,991
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would like to make a motion that we approve the cost rate.

1396
02:15:29,711 --> 02:15:32,152
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe I was in the middle of a motion when that was interrupted.

1397
02:15:32,272 --> 02:15:35,033
[SPEAKER_19]: So can I have the floor again?

1398
02:15:37,267 --> 02:15:38,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin, thank you.

1399
02:15:39,088 --> 02:15:39,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo.

1400
02:15:40,568 --> 02:15:40,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1401
02:15:41,569 --> 02:15:45,651
[SPEAKER_19]: I made a motion to move the EEC up to 2021-2022 school year.

1402
02:15:45,711 --> 02:15:49,392
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if there was anybody interested in a second.

1403
02:15:50,493 --> 02:15:51,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you just repeat that, please?

1404
02:15:52,134 --> 02:15:52,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1405
02:15:52,474 --> 02:15:58,356
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion was to take the recommendation number two and change that to be the school year 2021-2022.

1406
02:15:59,597 --> 02:15:59,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1407
02:16:00,657 --> 02:16:04,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Member Russo, seconded by Member Graham.

1408
02:16:04,779 --> 02:16:05,560
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1409
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:05,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1410
02:16:07,225 --> 02:16:09,446
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed, paper passes.

1411
02:16:10,527 --> 02:16:11,027
[SPEAKER_13]: You opposed?

1412
02:16:12,248 --> 02:16:12,468
Sure.

1413
02:16:13,449 --> 02:16:15,109
[SPEAKER_10]: May we have a roll call vote on that, please?

1414
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:17,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to exclude families, thank you.

1415
02:16:17,631 --> 02:16:18,451
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to exclude who?

1416
02:16:18,571 --> 02:16:18,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it.

1417
02:16:19,312 --> 02:16:21,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we do a roll call vote on that, please?

1418
02:16:21,593 --> 02:16:21,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1419
02:16:21,873 --> 02:16:22,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1420
02:16:22,493 --> 02:16:22,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham?

1421
02:16:23,014 --> 02:16:23,154
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1422
02:16:23,194 --> 02:16:27,336
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, Mayor, before we do, we just need clarity on exactly what the motion is.

1423
02:16:27,376 --> 02:16:27,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Me too.

1424
02:16:28,297 --> 02:16:32,219
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion is to discontinue the use of EEC vouchers subsequent to the 2021-2022 school year.

1425
02:16:35,347 --> 02:16:36,348
[SPEAKER_13]: to get rid of the, yeah.

1426
02:16:36,848 --> 02:16:38,909
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to be clear.

1427
02:16:38,989 --> 02:16:42,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the motion solely on the issue of the vouchers?

1428
02:16:42,311 --> 02:16:42,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1429
02:16:42,692 --> 02:16:42,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1430
02:16:43,973 --> 02:16:44,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1431
02:16:44,513 --> 02:16:49,716
[SPEAKER_24]: And then just, regardless of what happens with this vote, we'll need a vote on everything else.

1432
02:16:49,896 --> 02:16:50,217
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1433
02:16:50,377 --> 02:16:50,597
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1434
02:16:51,277 --> 02:16:51,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1435
02:16:52,898 --> 02:16:53,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham?

1436
02:16:53,899 --> 02:16:54,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1437
02:16:54,819 --> 02:16:55,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Kratz?

1438
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:56,000
Yes.

1439
02:16:56,841 --> 02:16:57,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Member McLaughlin?

1440
02:16:58,202 --> 02:16:58,382
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1441
02:16:59,623 --> 02:17:00,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Mestel?

1442
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:06,372
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, member Hayes, excuse me, sorry.

1443
02:17:06,612 --> 02:17:06,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1444
02:17:08,775 --> 02:17:09,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Restone.

1445
02:17:10,637 --> 02:17:11,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Rossell, yes.

1446
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:12,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor Longo, correct?

1447
02:17:15,222 --> 02:17:16,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's in the affirmative.

1448
02:17:16,804 --> 02:17:17,565
[SPEAKER_13]: One in the negative.

1449
02:17:17,605 --> 02:17:18,506
[SPEAKER_13]: The paper passes.

1450
02:17:18,526 --> 02:17:19,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you just clarify?

1451
02:17:19,887 --> 02:17:22,771
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you did mention they would be grandfathered in.

1452
02:17:23,491 --> 02:17:25,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So was that included, the grandfathering in?

1453
02:17:26,330 --> 02:17:37,437
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, what I would recommend is if the committee is comfortable with the rest of the recommendations then you could vote on a motion to adopt all the recommendations with the exception of the change that you just direct us to make.

1454
02:17:39,318 --> 02:17:44,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve all the recommendations with the exception of the one change we just made.

1455
02:17:46,162 --> 02:17:49,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by member Graham second I would like to separate the motion actually.

1456
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:52,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I approve the pay rate increase.

1457
02:17:52,551 --> 02:18:00,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not for the voucher program decrease because I think we'll exclude families and not give them the opportunity for grandfathering.

1458
02:18:01,018 --> 02:18:04,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that we split the motion, please.

1459
02:18:04,821 --> 02:18:07,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Russo?

1460
02:18:07,983 --> 02:18:10,205
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion does not include the EEC part.

1461
02:18:10,305 --> 02:18:15,409
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the motion was made for bullet one, two, one, three, four, five, six.

1462
02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:20,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we've already voted on the EEC.

1463
02:18:22,335 --> 02:18:27,039
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion to approve bullets one, three, four, five, and six.

1464
02:18:30,942 --> 02:18:31,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1465
02:18:32,483 --> 02:18:32,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

1466
02:18:34,825 --> 02:18:35,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1467
02:18:35,525 --> 02:18:35,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1468
02:18:36,046 --> 02:18:36,286
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1469
02:18:37,106 --> 02:18:37,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1470
02:18:38,828 --> 02:18:39,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1471
02:18:39,228 --> 02:18:39,608
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1472
02:18:40,029 --> 02:18:40,249
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1473
02:18:40,969 --> 02:18:41,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven in the affirmative.

1474
02:18:42,310 --> 02:18:43,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Zero in the negative.

1475
02:18:43,351 --> 02:18:44,532
[SPEAKER_19]: One, three,

1476
02:18:51,251 --> 02:18:54,034
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, one, three, four, five, and six is approved.

1477
02:18:58,579 --> 02:19:01,141
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's implemented subsequent to the 21-22 school year, correct?

1478
02:19:01,161 --> 02:19:01,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1479
02:19:04,716 --> 02:19:18,044
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, so just to be clear, I think we will report back prior to the conclusion of this school year on the specifics with respect to the hardship waiver program and any other data we're able to establish with regard to demographics at that point.

1480
02:19:18,584 --> 02:19:30,711
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that, like I said, that will certainly, I don't think that's gonna come before the lottery or some of these other things that have to be in motion now, but certainly prior to the conclusion of the fiscal year, we will report back.

1481
02:19:32,192 --> 02:19:32,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1482
02:19:34,148 --> 02:19:34,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1483
02:19:35,189 --> 02:19:35,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, thank you.

1484
02:19:38,331 --> 02:19:42,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Presentations of the public, which is number seven, not to begin before 7 p.m.

1485
02:19:43,434 --> 02:19:51,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

1486
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:54,702
[SPEAKER_13]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

1487
02:19:55,242 --> 02:20:01,747
[SPEAKER_13]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but they're not an opportunity for dialogue with the committee.

1488
02:20:02,235 --> 02:20:10,303
[SPEAKER_13]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

1489
02:20:10,783 --> 02:20:17,770
[SPEAKER_13]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public.

1490
02:20:19,892 --> 02:20:24,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Pursuant to policy BEDH public comment and presentation to the public, any resident in the audience may give

1491
02:20:25,421 --> 02:20:29,882
[SPEAKER_13]: be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

1492
02:20:30,102 --> 02:20:33,283
[SPEAKER_13]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

1493
02:20:33,804 --> 02:20:39,125
[SPEAKER_13]: The speaker must begin their comments providing their full name and full Medford street address where they reside.

1494
02:20:39,145 --> 02:20:44,867
[SPEAKER_13]: A welcoming inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

1495
02:20:44,987 --> 02:20:48,408
[SPEAKER_13]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

1496
02:20:49,448 --> 02:20:51,489
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not have any continued business.

1497
02:20:52,249 --> 02:20:53,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Number nine is new business.

1498
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:54,510
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion

1499
02:20:56,510 --> 02:21:01,191
[SPEAKER_13]: 2022-15 offered by member Rousseau.

1500
02:21:01,211 --> 02:21:07,852
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent and her designee will provide a detailed description of bathroom closures, openings at Medford High School.

1501
02:21:08,392 --> 02:21:21,094
[SPEAKER_13]: The number of bathrooms at Medford High School will be presented, as well as the number of bathrooms open throughout the day, the timing of bathroom closures, openings, and who is responsible for this task will also be included in the details.

1502
02:21:21,174 --> 02:21:24,155
[SPEAKER_13]: The rationale for closing bathrooms will also be discussed.

1503
02:21:24,895 --> 02:21:27,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Meeting date requested, 2-28-2022.

1504
02:21:27,578 --> 02:21:30,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Submitted date, 2-2-2022.

1505
02:21:32,883 --> 02:21:33,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Rousseau?

1506
02:21:34,124 --> 02:21:34,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mayor.

1507
02:21:34,844 --> 02:21:38,408
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do apologize that we keep talking about bathrooms.

1508
02:21:38,488 --> 02:21:40,610
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like we talk about them every other meeting.

1509
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:42,472
[SPEAKER_19]: But this

1510
02:21:46,731 --> 02:21:50,954
[SPEAKER_19]: appears to be a continuing problem that bathrooms are not available where students expect them to be.

1511
02:21:51,434 --> 02:22:03,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm quite concerned about the ability of closures to be communicated to a student who discovers they have to go to the bathroom and then finds out that the closest bathroom is not actually open.

1512
02:22:04,063 --> 02:22:12,288
[SPEAKER_19]: I worry about the obvious, frankly, trauma of a student who would have an accident in high school, especially.

1513
02:22:12,308 --> 02:22:12,368
[SPEAKER_19]: And

1514
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:23,602
[SPEAKER_19]: I also, I worry about, do the teachers know that the bathroom close to them is closed at this moment in time?

1515
02:22:23,642 --> 02:22:27,143
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why the student took three times as long to get back from the bathroom.

1516
02:22:28,004 --> 02:22:37,346
[SPEAKER_19]: It just feels a bit kind of cruel that every bathroom is not just open all the time.

1517
02:22:37,847 --> 02:22:42,688
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm trying to understand the staffing requirements to have all the bathrooms open all the time.

1518
02:22:44,379 --> 02:22:49,584
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that we have a presentation, which I assume we're about to hear, right?

1519
02:22:50,284 --> 02:22:51,005
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a report.

1520
02:22:51,145 --> 02:22:52,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we just have a, do you want me to read this?

1521
02:22:57,251 --> 02:22:57,811
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be great.

1522
02:22:58,171 --> 02:22:58,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Briefly.

1523
02:23:05,404 --> 02:23:13,287
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you, the committee received a memo regarding the rotation of restrooms that are open and close at various points throughout the day.

1524
02:23:13,307 --> 02:23:21,770
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear Mr so's point being the importance of communicating that so that there aren't issues of timeliness that.

1525
02:23:22,277 --> 02:23:24,458
[SPEAKER_24]: are exacerbated by the current rotation.

1526
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:36,462
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's certainly something that we can we can do and we can make sure that there's more robust communication on that front, but also as a reference to the memo as our lunchroom operations resume.

1527
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:44,213
[SPEAKER_24]: more normalcy in the coming weeks or days, potentially, we should be able to see more open.

1528
02:23:44,493 --> 02:23:56,698
[SPEAKER_24]: And so it's not going to be the case that every restroom in the building is open because the building was built for three times as many students that currently are enrolled there and some of the bathrooms are no longer functional as restrooms.

1529
02:23:57,625 --> 02:24:03,190
[SPEAKER_24]: but we certainly can commit to more restrooms being open throughout the course of the day.

1530
02:24:03,451 --> 02:24:11,398
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll report back as to the specifics and make sure that that any type of schedule with regard to the closing, we can make sure that's communicated to staff and students.

1531
02:24:12,479 --> 02:24:12,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1532
02:24:12,799 --> 02:24:15,601
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I appreciate the memo.

1533
02:24:15,681 --> 02:24:18,384
[SPEAKER_19]: It's quite detailed and I was quite impressed by that.

1534
02:24:19,004 --> 02:24:21,467
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's also important to note that, you know,

1535
02:24:22,802 --> 02:24:25,724
[SPEAKER_19]: I gotta go pee is one scenario where you need a bathroom.

1536
02:24:26,765 --> 02:24:33,309
[SPEAKER_19]: We have students menstruating who have to find a nurse's office because we don't dispense these products in our bathrooms.

1537
02:24:36,631 --> 02:24:48,239
[SPEAKER_19]: It just seems like we have such a focus on social and emotional wellness and to risk traumatizing a student at such a socially challenging time of their lives as high school.

1538
02:24:51,442 --> 02:24:53,604
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess, like, do we need more custodians?

1539
02:24:54,145 --> 02:24:56,607
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we need at every bathroom?

1540
02:24:56,667 --> 02:25:07,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand we have far more bathrooms, the building was built for far more students than we have, but we have not closed off whole wings of the building and consolidated the students.

1541
02:25:07,798 --> 02:25:09,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Students are spread out all over the place.

1542
02:25:09,779 --> 02:25:15,225
[SPEAKER_19]: And just as if we had 5,000 students, the bathrooms are near where the students will be.

1543
02:25:16,771 --> 02:25:21,795
[SPEAKER_19]: So the number of students and the number of bathrooms to me is not really a very valid argument.

1544
02:25:22,696 --> 02:25:33,445
[SPEAKER_19]: And we didn't, when it was built for 5,000 students or whatever the number was, there wasn't like, let's build two or three bathrooms right beside each other.

1545
02:25:33,465 --> 02:25:34,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause there'll be so many kids.

1546
02:25:36,948 --> 02:25:44,935
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess I just want to know that we don't have kids who can't get to the bathroom.

1547
02:25:46,001 --> 02:25:47,023
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe that we do.

1548
02:25:47,603 --> 02:25:52,689
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, we can make sure that we're communicating in a more robust fashion as to exactly what the access is.

1549
02:25:53,250 --> 02:25:57,955
[SPEAKER_24]: And the problem should resolve to some degree, because more are going to be open in the very near future.

1550
02:25:58,256 --> 02:25:59,617
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, they're open right now.

1551
02:25:59,677 --> 02:26:02,180
[SPEAKER_24]: I just I just want to be very clear for the community.

1552
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:03,522
[SPEAKER_24]: It is not the case that

1553
02:26:04,603 --> 02:26:10,429
[SPEAKER_24]: we have a, you know, that we have a 650,000 square foot building and only two bathrooms that are open.

1554
02:26:10,789 --> 02:26:11,450
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not the case.

1555
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:17,116
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think you're suggesting it is, Mr. So, could there be a time where a student has to walk longer than they otherwise would?

1556
02:26:17,677 --> 02:26:18,597
[SPEAKER_24]: At the moment, yes.

1557
02:26:19,218 --> 02:26:25,200
[SPEAKER_24]: but that's something we're going to work on both in terms of increased communication and increased access to make sure that restaurants are there.

1558
02:26:25,580 --> 02:26:35,084
[SPEAKER_24]: To the point about the size of the building and the students, no, we don't have them spread, we don't have them consolidated in particular areas, but that's both for instructional purposes and for security purposes.

1559
02:26:35,124 --> 02:26:45,028
[SPEAKER_24]: So the real question is like, we need a better, we need a better layout for a building is how you address this, but that might be a conversation for a different day.

1560
02:26:45,803 --> 02:26:49,404
[SPEAKER_19]: so that we don't have any issues around keeping the bathrooms cleaned, correct?

1561
02:26:51,284 --> 02:26:54,805
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's a 650,000 square foot building, so it's a challenge to keep it clean.

1562
02:26:55,466 --> 02:27:01,347
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate the hard work of our custodians who do everything that they can to make sure that's the case.

1563
02:27:02,427 --> 02:27:12,370
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're also balancing, if I may, through the chair and then member Graham, I mean, security issues as well as the lack of monitors because of staffing issues, vaping issues, so I think

1564
02:27:12,845 --> 02:27:15,426
[SPEAKER_13]: The administration has a lot on their hands when it comes to the bathrooms.

1565
02:27:15,486 --> 02:27:20,288
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the only space for a student to maybe, yes.

1566
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:27,691
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to point that out that it's a balancing act and we understand that, but member Graham.

1567
02:27:29,752 --> 02:27:31,053
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually,

1568
02:27:32,716 --> 02:27:45,666
[SPEAKER_08]: talk to some students and I want to make sure that there are bathrooms in the building that are available, because what I hear from students is that those are the quote nice bathrooms and they are never open when students want to use them.

1569
02:27:47,505 --> 02:27:53,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and that could just be a timing issue of when these students happen to have science, but all students have science.

1570
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:57,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to make sure there are bathrooms available for them.

1571
02:27:57,733 --> 02:28:10,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked to students who I know to be very conscientious and they say, you know, I don't go to the bathroom in certain classes because I know that the bathrooms near my classroom are really closed almost all the time, but it's not clear.

1572
02:28:10,543 --> 02:28:11,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um,

1573
02:28:13,993 --> 02:28:27,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we just really need to think about how we like crack this nut and the and the thing that I think makes me the most irritated about this is that at the beginning of my term we had this discussion, the principal of the high school.

1574
02:28:28,187 --> 02:28:37,154
[SPEAKER_08]: stood at the podium, he told us that he would make sure that every student has a schedule, and there was not one single student that I talked to who said they knew what the schedule was.

1575
02:28:37,454 --> 02:28:39,295
[SPEAKER_24]: The schedule of when they're open and when they're closed?

1576
02:28:39,556 --> 02:28:39,956
[SPEAKER_24]: What's that?

1577
02:28:40,276 --> 02:28:42,218
[SPEAKER_24]: What was the schedule of, when they're open and when they're closed?

1578
02:28:42,278 --> 02:28:43,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Of where to find a bathroom, yes.

1579
02:28:44,539 --> 02:28:47,562
[SPEAKER_24]: We will increase the communication on this.

1580
02:28:48,362 --> 02:28:54,265
[SPEAKER_24]: My guess is we'll have to very shortly update the communication on this because it's going to change as the lunch operations change.

1581
02:28:55,625 --> 02:29:02,829
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think the committee has been heard loud and clear that we need more communication and more access to restrooms and we'll make sure that that's the case.

1582
02:29:03,149 --> 02:29:07,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would like to stop talking about whether the bathrooms are open or not because I think the

1583
02:29:08,698 --> 02:29:12,843
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation we should be having is whether the bathrooms are suitable or not.

1584
02:29:12,983 --> 02:29:15,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And I look forward to that discussion as well.

1585
02:29:16,147 --> 02:29:20,492
[SPEAKER_24]: There will be some in the building, this massive building, there will be some that are closed.

1586
02:29:20,933 --> 02:29:21,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1587
02:29:22,154 --> 02:29:24,757
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think what we need to get away from is the rotation.

1588
02:29:25,258 --> 02:29:27,540
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, but my guess is the students are having class

1589
02:29:28,101 --> 02:29:30,622
[SPEAKER_24]: that the science, I don't actually think it is the science class.

1590
02:29:31,523 --> 02:29:44,208
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not what was reported to me, but there are classes that the bathrooms in that area are closed because the bathrooms by the cafeteria are open, which is probably great if you're eating lunch and not so great if you're in any other lunch and in class down by the closed bathrooms.

1591
02:29:44,709 --> 02:29:52,072
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the rotation that's gonna end and we'll make sure that we have communication that articulates exactly what the schedules are, if schedules are necessary.

1592
02:29:52,404 --> 02:29:57,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the, the students that I talked to definitely said the problem is worse at lunch.

1593
02:29:57,346 --> 02:30:01,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully that change will will help.

1594
02:30:02,408 --> 02:30:05,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I, there was a student who also told me that

1595
02:30:07,044 --> 02:30:13,689
[SPEAKER_08]: she was headed to a bathroom that was open and she was kicked out because the bathroom was going to be closed and she was sent off in search of another bathroom.

1596
02:30:13,729 --> 02:30:20,875
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, if there's students actively trying to use the bathroom, I would just ask that we hold off on closing the bathroom for five minutes it takes.

1597
02:30:20,895 --> 02:30:22,116
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it should be the same as voting.

1598
02:30:22,156 --> 02:30:24,278
[SPEAKER_24]: If you're online, you should get in.

1599
02:30:24,598 --> 02:30:25,639
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems really reasonable.

1600
02:30:25,759 --> 02:30:27,501
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could do that, that would be great.

1601
02:30:27,921 --> 02:30:28,141
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1602
02:30:28,161 --> 02:30:28,922
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1603
02:30:29,002 --> 02:30:29,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1604
02:30:29,542 --> 02:30:30,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1605
02:30:32,786 --> 02:30:34,648
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not have any reports requested.

1606
02:30:35,829 --> 02:30:38,771
[SPEAKER_13]: So next up is number 11, which is our condolences.

1607
02:30:39,732 --> 02:30:47,939
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee extends its sincere condolences to the family of Lorraine Miller, aunt to Medford High School resource officer, Richard Ziobro.

1613
02:31:32,355 --> 02:31:35,217
[SPEAKER_13]: If we all may rise to take a moment of silence.
