[SPEAKER_11]: None absent.

00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,168
[SPEAKER_11]: All please rise and salute our flag.

20
00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:05,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:20,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Prior to the commencement of the meeting, under the open meeting law, the chair must announce to all attendees in the audience that this meeting is being filmed, and I just want to make you aware of that.

22
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:22,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

23
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,712

[SPEAKER_11]: Report of secretary.

48
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:03,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of committees.

49
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,239
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an item for community participation, I believe.

50
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:28,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Medford School Committee.

51
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:30,311
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Joe Villione.

52
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I reside at 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

53
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,474
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you for hearing the public.

54
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, education.

55
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:46,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Over at Somerville TV, we're now taping my TV show inside my radio show, so we have a TV program and a radio program.

56
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:54,949
[SPEAKER_13]: My goal for Medford, of course, is to expand access TV for all the residents so that we're not restricted to certain times

57
00:02:56,393 --> 00:03:08,921
[SPEAKER_13]: at the high school, and I believe, as Arlington has, we need to have a satellite station somewhere centrally located, as Mayor McGlynn's tribunal suggested, and I want to help the school.

58
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to help the mayor.

59
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:23,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to help the community in this endeavor because I started in Access in 1979, and I think it's unarguable I have more experience and more memberships in Access than possibly anyone in the entire city of Medford.

60
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,671
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to help my community.

61
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:32,890
[SPEAKER_13]: So my question to the city school committee is, what is the hard date for opening?

62
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it the end of April?

63
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I was talking to Mr. Belson and Ms.

64
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:42,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot, and they informed me that it would probably be finished by the end of April.

65
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:55,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to know when we can implement this for the community, when we can bring in the educational component so that citizens can learn computers, be it Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro,

66
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:58,855
[SPEAKER_13]: whatever, this is the amazing thing we've been missing.

67
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:07,841
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been missing it in Medford for the entirety of the time we've been paying for AXS TV because at the old station it was never properly taught.

68
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:13,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And now with the station being shut down from around July of 2014, I believe,

69
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:25,117
[SPEAKER_13]: We've now had three years in limbo where our football games, our athletics, our political speech, everything has just been kind of in the dark.

70
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:29,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to help open the light, open the door, bring some transparency.

71
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,560
[SPEAKER_13]: So can anyone tell me?

72
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:32,423
[SPEAKER_13]: what our next phase is.

73
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:36,105
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have a set date when we will be doing our ribbon cutting.

74
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:40,127
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we do anticipate the contract to be completed at the end of April.

75
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,689
[SPEAKER_11]: However, as people are aware, there's generally a punch list that goes with those.

76
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So once we finish off the punch list, then we will determine a date.

77
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,093
[SPEAKER_13]: And can we expand it a little so that we have a satellite?

78
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,134
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not school committee purview.

79
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:54,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

80
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:55,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

81
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:58,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of superintendent.

82
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:00,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on SBIRT program.

83
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Superintendent.

84
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:14,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor and members of the school committee, uh, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services is with us this evening for three different reports.

85
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:23,899
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular report is particularly significant since you may have seen some items in the newspaper today is latest today about opiate issues in Massachusetts.

86
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, Tony has prepared a report based on our initial screening on this pilot program.

87
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:33,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it should be of strong interest to us with regard to how we're looking at, uh,

88
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:35,102
[SPEAKER_00]: screening our young people.

89
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:36,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

90
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:36,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Venter, good evening.

91
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:40,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Mayor, Superintendent, and school committee members.

92
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:43,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm one of your main attractions tonight.

93
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:47,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm up for three reports, so I hope you find them interesting.

94
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:59,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So the SBIRT screening, we know in January of 2016, the governor enacted a law, signed a law, requiring all grade 9 and grade 7 students to be screened.

95
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:10,053
[SPEAKER_02]: The law stated that in the school year 2016 to 17, that all schools screen grade nine students and then the following school year at grade seven.

96
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:19,238
[SPEAKER_02]: The law is called an act relative to preventing adolescent substance abuse by expanding SBIRT.

97
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And SBIRT is a screening questionnaire.

98
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given you information in the past on that.

99
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses what is called the CRAFT tool.

100
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:39,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a preventative model looking at identifying students early who are starting to think about or use risky behaviors.

101
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:44,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year was our maiden voyage.

102
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We sent out information, a letter home to all grade nine parents.

103
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents had the option to opt out of the screening.

104
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:56,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of all of our students, only five parents opted out.

105
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were very encouraged by that.

106
00:06:58,935 --> 00:06:59,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt that was

107
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:03,313
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting an informational need that parents had.

108
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:06,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the screening in January.

109
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a team effort between school nurses, guidance Councilors, adjustment Councilors, and school psychologists.

110
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:16,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And we screened 316 grade nine students in three days.

111
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the screenings were done in a confidential place.

112
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:25,523
[SPEAKER_02]: We used the gymnasium.

113
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:29,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We had set up four different screening stations.

114
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:45,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a one-on-one session, and when every student left, he or she received an educational resource about if you're worried about yourself or another student, these are the people within the school that you can contact for help.

115
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I did provide a table that summarized the results.

116
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And 316, as I said, were screened.

117
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:01,742
[SPEAKER_02]: 277 grade nine students exhibited no high-risk behaviors.

118
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, they received positive reinforcement.

119
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:16,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The screener would say, you know, I'm really proud that you have made healthy lifestyle choices, and we'd like to see you continue that through your high school years.

120
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,796
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to talk to anybody, this is who you can come talk to.

121
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:25,864
[SPEAKER_02]: 39 screened had at least one positive response.

122
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:36,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Of those 39, the most common positive response was that they rode in a car with somebody who had been drinking or using drugs.

123
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:49,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on, let's see, if you look at the CRAFT tool, there's a number of questions on part B. So depending on their score on part B, that score dictated the next step.

124
00:08:49,713 --> 00:09:03,595
[SPEAKER_02]: which for 32 of the students was a brief negotiated motivational interview where the screener explored, so tell me a little bit more about your answer on this question.

125
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:10,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would probe, looking for some information on a scale of zero to 10, where do you feel you land?

126
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:17,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And then did some exploration about likelihood to implement some healthy behaviors.

127
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:25,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven of the 39 students by their score required a referral to an in-school Councilor.

128
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:29,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And of those, seven too refused the referral.

129
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:35,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, we felt that our first screening was very positive.

130
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that the data we received out of it supported all the data from the Community That Cares survey, which has been showing the last few years a trend for lower

131
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:57,429
[SPEAKER_02]: use of substances by our high school population and more reporting of positive protective factors.

132
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:11,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at that and say, well, the efforts by the team Medford staff, the efforts by the Boys and Girls Club, the extracurricular activities within the high school are all doing their job as protective factors.

133
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

134
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:13,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

135
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:14,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

136
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot, did you have a question on this?

137
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:17,153
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I didn't.

138
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:17,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Toni.

139
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:19,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

140
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:20,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

141
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:28,157
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I want to say thank you to you and your staff for implementing this in such a quick way.

142
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:31,438
[SPEAKER_06]: 300 kids in three days is a lot to go through.

143
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:37,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think that opening the communication with children in this manner is very, very positive.

144
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, if something were to come arise, you've already had that initial contact with somebody.

145
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:49,644
[SPEAKER_06]: you might feel comfortable going to them, even for other issues that might come about.

146
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:53,586
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think that the process is good for all our children.

147
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad so many participated.

148
00:10:56,488 --> 00:11:01,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of the 32, my concern was, OK, do we notify parents?

149
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we do that?

150
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:08,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's confidential, but especially those seven students that some red flags were drawn, at what point do we?

151
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It is confidential, and at the only point

152
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:23,545
[SPEAKER_02]: where we would cross the threshold for notifying parents would be if the student demonstrated a potential for harm to themselves or others.

153
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:30,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we going back as confidential employees or nurses or guidance Councilors

154
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:34,404
[SPEAKER_06]: to check on those students in like a few months and just say, hey, how's everything going?

155
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:42,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Those students are students that are already, many of them are already followed by staff within the school.

156
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:48,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have ongoing relationships that are being built and being fostered.

157
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:52,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that connection is there.

158
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So we feel that that breeds the follow up.

159
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:57,171
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

160
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:59,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially for the two students that refuse

161
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,337
[SPEAKER_06]: the referral.

162
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,178
[SPEAKER_06]: We just don't want anybody to fall through the cracks.

163
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:05,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that's not happening.

164
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you again.

165
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that conversation with seventh graders is appropriate.

166
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:12,083
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be next year.

167
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:12,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

168
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:17,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So I also think that open that line of communications very early with children.

169
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,246
[SPEAKER_06]: They're mature.

170
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:21,968
[SPEAKER_06]: They're seeing stuff that we don't even know that they're seeing in middle school.

171
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:25,570
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's good to acknowledge it and talk about it.

172
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your report.

173
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept.

174
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:28,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

175
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

176
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:30,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Conyo.

177
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:31,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

178
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:36,339
[SPEAKER_10]: The total screenings that came out was a total of 39.

179
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven students came forward for you to know who they were, correct?

180
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

181
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:42,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

182
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the 32, what do we do with them?

183
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:47,007
[SPEAKER_10]: If they don't come forward, how do we try to help them?

184
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:59,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, by virtue of the law, there is no mechanism to place any follow-up in a student's medical record or health record that we keep.

185
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So the basis of the law was complete confidentiality.

186
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, those seven students, or those 39 students, I do not know who they are.

187
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:14,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so what do we do to keep on reinforcing what we reinforce?

188
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.

189
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:20,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And you reinforce the positive protective factors.

190
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:23,486
[SPEAKER_02]: You make known who are your supports within the school.

191
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,108
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep building and working on relationships.

192
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:29,939
[SPEAKER_02]: that type of disclosure is relationship-based.

193
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

194
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very delicate line.

195
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as a parent, yes, you want to know.

196
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

197
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,583
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're also trying to get the trust of the student.

198
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:38,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

199
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:48,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you have the seven that have come forward, what we're hoping to do is have the loyalty and the confidentiality.

200
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:53,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe those seven could hopefully give us, maybe, or have the other students

201
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:55,577
[SPEAKER_10]: say, you know, listen, it's working.

202
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: No one is really saying anything about us.

203
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,799
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to counseling and we're helping.

204
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,881
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you want to go, the door is open.

205
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,962
[SPEAKER_02]: The students had very good feedback.

206
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:19,351
[SPEAKER_02]: My role during the screening was an escorter, so I made sure I escorted the students from the health and fitness class to the screening area and then back to class.

207
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew that they got back into class.

208
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:24,975
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of them had very positive comments to say.

209
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:26,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't bad.

210
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed talking to that person.

211
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I never met him before.

212
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:31,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice to meet him.

213
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:35,379
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I heard a lot of nice feedback.

214
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And the referrals for the counseling, is it strictly whoever is in our school or is it even outside counseling?

215
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if, again, that goes on tiered intervention.

216
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:52,372
[SPEAKER_02]: The seven that we referred to an in-school Councilor, that was the level that they met by their scores.

217
00:14:52,712 --> 00:15:00,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Had we had students that had an elevated score, we would have referred them to the SAFE project, which is through the Institute of Health and Recovery.

218
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:06,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a SAFE project Councilor that is available to come to the school to do on-site counseling.

219
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:07,955
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, great.

220
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:08,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

221
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for all the work.

222
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:13,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as my colleagues have said, three days to put this together is a lot of work.

223
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:15,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

224
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:16,172
[SPEAKER_19]: Kreatz.

225
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:16,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

226
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:17,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Ms.

227
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:17,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Pinto.

228
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the report.

229
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:43,920
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to know, because I was at the DARE program at the elementary school last week, and it just got me thinking, after reading this report, I wanted to know if maybe with the cooperation with the team Medford, if we could do maybe a similar presentation, maybe in the Cameron Theater, for maybe the incoming freshmen,

230
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:52,440
[SPEAKER_19]: in the outgoing seniors to educate them again at the high school level on drinking and driving.

231
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,646
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there's the seminar for driving distracted, but that covers texting, being distracted.

232
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:08,132
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed in this report that the most frequently reported risky behavior was ridden in a car with someone who was drinking or using drugs.

233
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:13,377
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know with the new, how the marijuana is now legal,

234
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:24,868
[SPEAKER_19]: I wasn't sure if maybe we needed to do like an upgraded training program to educate the students on, you know, the dangers of, you know, smoking marijuana, drinking and driving.

235
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:30,590
[SPEAKER_19]: So I, you know, I was just, I was really thinking about that and brainstorming and wanted to ask you about that.

236
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:37,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all of those components are rolled into the Michigan model health curriculum that Rachel Perry has spoken about.

237
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:41,993
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, we, we have actually today,

238
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:53,703
[SPEAKER_02]: at our community-based justice meeting at the high school, we were talking with the district attorneys for setting up the pre-prom education seminars.

239
00:16:54,243 --> 00:17:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So they come and they provide an assembly to students prior to the junior and senior prom.

240
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:09,452
[SPEAKER_02]: That reinforces, again, healthy decision making and shares the dangers of all of those things.

241
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:10,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

242
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:11,113
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

243
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:11,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

244
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:11,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

245
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:13,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

246
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:13,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

247
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:14,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

248
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:26,502
[SPEAKER_15]: As I reflect on this, I think exactly what Kathy picked up was the thing that most concerns me, that 32 out of 39 kids reported that they had been in a car where they knew that someone had been drinking or using drugs.

249
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:33,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Just about two months, within the last two to three months, a young stonem teenager lost her life.

250
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:39,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And prior, I know many of the kids who were friends or in her class, and sadly,

251
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:47,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Prior to that, and fortunately, there were other students in the car who had gotten out before she had her tragic accident.

252
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:53,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that's the piece here, we're talking about ninth graders, that we really need.

253
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:55,924
[SPEAKER_15]: By the junior and senior prom, it's really too late.

254
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:59,106
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the piece that we really need to target.

255
00:17:59,386 --> 00:17:59,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

256
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:05,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, I mean, I said that's, you know, the health and fitness classes are in grade nine and 10.

257
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of that material they're receiving early on in high school.

258
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:21,442
[SPEAKER_02]: The Michigan model is going to be used district-wide, K through 12, so they'll be building on those components developmentally as they age in their classes.

259
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:23,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Toni.

260
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

261
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:25,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

262
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:38,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Coach Perry talking about how different things that they did at certain grade levels, and I know that drinking and driving was part of the health curriculum at this grade level.

263
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:50,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if it's still the case, but when I was on the Method High School PTO, they used to bring in speakers for different classes and different grade levels.

264
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:59,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them was yellow dress about dating violence and the other one was about alcohol awareness and driving and those type of things.

265
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could also check with the PTO and see if that is still happening.

266
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:09,723
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have, you know, we did receive the grant for the dating violence prevention.

267
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:17,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has been an active, there's been active initiatives throughout the year that students are involved in.

268
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:21,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PTO used to do the yellow dress.

269
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:25,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Every other year they would alternate so that kids got different ones.

270
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:33,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, through you to the superintendent, maybe we should check with some of our PTOs and see what they're funding throughout the community.

271
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:47,506
[SPEAKER_06]: like different programs that we would like to know, you know, because I know the PTO at Medford High, you know, they still do the prom dress shop that was started years ago, like I think we're on the 11th year now.

272
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:51,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the things, but could we check with them?

273
00:19:52,168 --> 00:20:00,952
[SPEAKER_06]: To see what the high school is offering with their PTO money, as well as our elementary schools, just to see what they're supplementing for us, so that way at budget time we know.

274
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:03,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I did actually get a phone call

275
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:13,837
[SPEAKER_06]: this week about how PTOs are paying for a lot of buses for field trips and about them being able to negotiate pricing for those buses and all of those things.

276
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:16,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was going to actually talk to you about that too.

277
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: But we should maybe invite the heads of PTO to one of our meetings and just talk about what they're doing for our school districts so that we're aware of it and how

278
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:37,890
[SPEAKER_06]: We as a district appreciate the work that they're doing and the funds that they're raising, as well as are aware of those programming and let them know how vital we think they are and thank them for their time.

279
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you could add that to the agenda for maybe either the next meeting or the next, I'll give you time.

280
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Before the end of the school year, hopefully.

281
00:20:48,343 --> 00:20:49,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

282
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:49,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

283
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:50,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Vento.

284
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:54,685
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place this paper on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

285
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:55,685
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

286
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:55,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

287
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,186
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

288
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:58,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

289
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:00,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

290
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:04,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Mustone has made a motion for suspension of the rules to take a paper out of order.

291
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:07,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval on suspension of the rules.

292
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:08,789
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

293
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

294
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:10,649
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

295
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:11,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Suspension is granted.

296
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,350
[SPEAKER_11]: It's old business.

297
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,051
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the report on safe routes to school program.

298
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:26,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We are really, really proud to announce that the Brooks School has received a $920,000 grant for Safe Routes to School.

299
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:31,140
[SPEAKER_11]: They have been working on this project for the last, I think, four years, if I'm correct.

300
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:39,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've worked very, very hard to demonstrate the activity in the school, the need to get kids walking, the safety

301
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,470
[SPEAKER_11]: routes to get to school as well.

302
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:50,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've been really, really busy working on this and we were so very proud to receive the letter from the Commonwealth of Mass, Department of Transportation, that we have been awarded this.

303
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:59,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we have some parents in the audience that worked very, very hard that we would like to come up and say a few words about this and then we can say thank you for all of your efforts.

304
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:00,644
[SPEAKER_11]: So Liz, would you like to come up?

305
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:02,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Liz and your daughter?

306
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:09,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Your name and address, please, for our record.

307
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:12,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Elizabeth White, 280 High Street, and Anna.

308
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're very excited to receive this news.

309
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:21,134
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to thank Sara McGivern, who has been instrumental in this effort as well.

310
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:28,038
[SPEAKER_16]: She's been great supporting the Safe Routes to School program at the Brooks and I know other schools as well.

311
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:36,694
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, Sarar is the Director of Mass in Motion for the City of Medford, so she gets involved with a lot of walking issues, healthy eating issues.

312
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:42,339
[SPEAKER_11]: She does a lot of different things in the community, so we're very, very happy for all of her efforts as well.

313
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:50,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yeah, so this is, you know, a long time coming, but we're excited about the changes that will be happening and we're hopeful that the other schools as well will

314
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,240
[SPEAKER_16]: be able to get involved.

315
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,147
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know some of the schools are already active with Safe Routes to School.

316
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:01,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Sarah has an update.

317
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:05,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Sarah McGivern, Mass in Motion Coordinator in the Board of Health.

318
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:15,717
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just prepared a little bit of information about what teachers are doing as far as they are participating in Safe Routes to School activities.

319
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:25,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we presented to you about two winters ago just about the Safe Routes to School program and how we're encouraging students to walk and ride more.

320
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,003
[SPEAKER_12]: The Department of Public Health considers this a community level strategy that

321
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:37,307
[SPEAKER_12]: affects people's health because oftentimes it involves the entire family, not just the student.

322
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Parents and siblings are ending up walking or riding the bikes with the students.

323
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:48,976
[SPEAKER_12]: It also helps improve our air quality and traffic around the schools as well.

324
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:58,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is why in my position that I'm funded by the state, I'm supposed to be working on this and helping the schools with the Safer School Program.

325
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:00,665
[SPEAKER_12]: But the other important thing to mention that I know

326
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:26,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Superintendent Belson is really excited about too is that when the schools participate in the Safer School activities they're eligible to apply for this funding which is why Liz applied for funding in 2013 and the improvements will be made in 2020 but we really hope that the other schools all the schools in Medford are going to be participating in the Safer School activities soon so that we can apply and get

327
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:30,267
[SPEAKER_12]: these infrastructure improvements made around all the schools in our community.

328
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:39,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as you can see from that paper that I passed out, some of the schools are participating, some of them are not as active yet, but they will be soon.

329
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:48,603
[SPEAKER_12]: I met with Principal DeLeva on Friday and we're going to be doing some trainings, bike and pedestrian safety trainings at his school soon.

330
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:54,107
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if you have any questions, I can give you more information.

331
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:59,729
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Sarah will be reaching out to all of the schools to get them on board, to get them really motivated to take on this task.

332
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:02,910
[SPEAKER_11]: And you did apply in 14, and we were just notified now.

333
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:14,115
[SPEAKER_11]: And when the state came out, they did a full assessment of the area of the Brooks School, and literally from Placeton Road, down Placeton, all the way up to the Winthrop Street Rotary.

334
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:17,716
[SPEAKER_11]: So they looked at a wide expanse of where all the kids are coming from.

335
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And the report is amazing, the detailed work that they put together.

336
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:22,533
[SPEAKER_11]: But they will be expanding.

337
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:26,637
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing the Complete Streets project right at Alston and High, right at the corner of the Brooks.

338
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:31,701
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to be expanding it up to Woburn Street and further down into the square.

339
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're taking on some of the things that we're not able to do right now.

340
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,225
[SPEAKER_11]: But $920,000 is a fabulous grant.

341
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,367
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much, Liz and your team.

342
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:40,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job.

343
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:50,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you can steal Liz and take her to some of your schools and she can show what she did.

344
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:51,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to thank Principal Andrews.

345
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:53,017
[SPEAKER_16]: He was fantastic.

346
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:10,518
[SPEAKER_16]: when I, you know, when we worked on this grant and also just supporting the walking program at the Brooks, he was really on board with that.

347
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:15,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So he was great in getting it started and now Principal Galussi will take it over and get it to completion.

348
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:16,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job.

349
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:18,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming in.

350
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:20,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

351
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:20,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any questions?

352
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:21,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

353
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:21,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

354
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:29,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think that it's important that we note that the different sorts of things that the money is being spent on, including

355
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:42,965
[SPEAKER_15]: five foot wide concrete sidewalk and granite curbs, including ramps, pavement mill and overlay, signs and striping, landscaping, drainage, utility improvements, school zone, flasher, traffic control.

356
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:49,327
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are the sorts of needed improvements that will make our city safer for walking.

357
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:51,888
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is really fantastic, and thank you so much.

358
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:53,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

359
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:54,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Burke.

360
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:55,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

361
00:26:56,993 --> 00:27:03,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Through you to the superintendent, I was reading through this report and participation and goals and needs for each of the schools.

362
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:11,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the schools don't have someone, a parent that stepped up, but we still see needs at all of our schools for this project.

363
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to maybe work with our principals about making this a priority at every school.

364
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:22,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, it says near the Robert schools, they've been very excited about this for a few years.

365
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:23,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that their

366
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:35,059
[SPEAKER_06]: walking school bus, was always a favorite of now Councilor Falco, because he used to go with his family and talk to me about it a lot.

367
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But I noticed that there is still some question about the crossing guard.

368
00:27:40,522 --> 00:27:43,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any updates on that at all on the Felsway?

369
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:46,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't have anything new.

370
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:53,508
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly talked to DCR, but there's no new commitment from them at this point in time.

371
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,889
[SPEAKER_11]: DCR is not expanding their traffic guards.

372
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,291
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitive.

373
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:10,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And through you to the mayor, is there a need for more police officers or someone there in the morning?

374
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:17,003
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be reviewing that for the upcoming budget to see if there is room in any of the city-side budget or school-side budget.

375
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:17,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

376
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:18,998
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we can ask for.

377
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:19,878
[SPEAKER_11]: That's on the school side.

378
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:20,959
[SPEAKER_11]: That is on the city budget.

379
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:21,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

380
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:21,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

381
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:22,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

382
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And Sarah's going to be going out to the other schools too, to try and motivate them a little bit more.

383
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

384
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

385
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,800
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to Ms.

386
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuno.

387
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:39,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, actually to Sarah, um, the question was, first of all, congratulations to the Brooks school for all your hard work.

388
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:40,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that's incredible.

389
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:41,802
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

390
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you really should be proud of yourselves.

391
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:45,403
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a wonderful thing to achieve.

392
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:52,316
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is that you were saying that the other schools, would they be able to also apply for this type of funding?

393
00:28:52,496 --> 00:29:01,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And since the Brooks did do it in 2014, you said, 2014, which took three years, do you know if the deadline and the waiting period is the same?

394
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:09,351
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Columbus also applied in the same year, and they only grant the funding to one school per community per year.

395
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:11,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're eligible to apply again.

396
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:17,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there is a new application process that I've inquired about from the state and I'm waiting for them to get back to me.

397
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:22,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we're hoping that we haven't missed the deadline for next year, but I mean, I think it's rolling.

398
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:23,996
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's always going.

399
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:29,337
[SPEAKER_12]: So as soon as we find out about it, we're going to try to, um, get the Roberts to apply for the next one.

400
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:31,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then we'll go from there.

401
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:41,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, by that time, after, you know, the Roberts does the next one, then whenever the next one is, the Andrews will have been participating long enough that we think there'll be eligible.

402
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they'll be a really good candidate for obvious reasons.

403
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:46,011
[SPEAKER_12]: There's three schools right there.

404
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:46,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

405
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:48,412
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's great.

406
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:50,293
[SPEAKER_10]: That way, too, they have an idea.

407
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:57,895
[SPEAKER_10]: As my colleague said, there are some schools that have not participated and do not have anybody.

408
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:05,678
[SPEAKER_10]: So at least it gives them plenty of time to try to recruit and try to get some more information from you and to try to find out what the process is.

409
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:10,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a great idea, and it's a great way of getting some more money for all of us.

410
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:20,335
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to thank you for the report and it was very detailed and a great job to is in to surround.

411
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

412
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:25,318
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to mention the point of information for Aaron.

413
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,861
[SPEAKER_19]: So the crossing light at the corner of the Fulton Street in Bell's way.

414
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:37,205
[SPEAKER_19]: The timing crossing was adjusted in that was done, you know, a while ago.

415
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:37,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

416
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:38,206
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

417
00:30:38,246 --> 00:30:39,927
[SPEAKER_19]: So that that was the only update.

418
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:40,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

419
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:47,613
[SPEAKER_19]: But so that's working and I've crossed myself and it gives you plenty of time to get all the way across.

420
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:49,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

421
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:51,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, yep.

422
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, no problem.

423
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

424
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

425
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,922
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place on file.

426
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:00,243
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

427
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:00,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

428
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:01,604
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

429
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:02,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

430
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:06,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

431
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:06,909
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

432
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:06,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

433
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:08,310
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

434
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:11,086
[SPEAKER_11]: We are now back in business.

435
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:14,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Item two, report on automated external defibrillators.

436
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:17,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Ms.

437
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot?

438
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:27,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to think that perhaps it would have been nice to have our principals of the middle schools come forward so that we could approve their

439
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:31,960
[SPEAKER_15]: field trips rather than keeping them to the end of the meeting.

440
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,402
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules offered by Ms.

441
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:36,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

442
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:36,903
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

443
00:31:36,923 --> 00:31:37,783
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

444
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:38,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Suspension is granted.

445
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,306
[SPEAKER_11]: We are on item one.

446
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:44,347
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an addenda to the school committee.

447
00:31:45,428 --> 00:31:48,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommendation to approve middle school New York trips.

448
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Please see attached report.

449
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,872
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion for approval by Ms.

450
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:52,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Discari.

451
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second by Ms.

452
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:53,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot?

453
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,303
[SPEAKER_11]: All those, motion?

454
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:58,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I did have a question.

455
00:31:58,304 --> 00:31:58,864
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a question?

456
00:31:58,884 --> 00:31:59,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

457
00:31:59,344 --> 00:31:59,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanden Heuvel.

458
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:00,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

459
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:04,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the Andrews told us the cost of the trip, but I didn't see it in the McGlynn report.

460
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It's costing $320 per student.

461
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,050
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

462
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:11,352
[SPEAKER_15]: And yours, the students go just overnight?

463
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,134
[SPEAKER_08]: One overnight this year, yes.

464
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,135
[SPEAKER_15]: And for the Andrews, it's two?

465
00:32:15,155 --> 00:32:15,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Two overnight.

466
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,437
[SPEAKER_15]: So what time do they leave in the morning?

467
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:21,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Very early, so about 5 AM on that Friday.

468
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:21,559
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

469
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:22,360
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they return?

470
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:24,707
[SPEAKER_08]: about 7 p.m.

471
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:26,628
[SPEAKER_08]: on Saturday evening.

472
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:26,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

473
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:28,489
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just an interesting difference.

474
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:29,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

475
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:37,234
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought we really needed to make some adjustments to make it affordable for our students, and we were able to get a lot more students to participate in doing so.

476
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:40,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And they really are not losing anything on the itinerary.

477
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:43,697
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they gained a Broadway show, so they're very excited about that.

478
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:48,700
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that was cut was on Sundays, the only thing we did was go to the Bronx Zoo.

479
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was cut, and they had some other things they're doing on Saturday.

480
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:53,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

481
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I think it'll be interesting when you compare notes after the trips to see how it worked out.

482
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:01,891
[SPEAKER_15]: And how many students do you have participating?

483
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: As of right now, I have 100.

484
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:04,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

485
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:04,675
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have?

486
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:05,236
[SPEAKER_08]: About 49.

487
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:05,236
49.

488
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:06,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

489
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:09,142
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't make sense to combine them.

490
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,273
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, obviously not this year.

491
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:16,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So this year, well, let me, our dates are different as well.

492
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:16,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

493
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:26,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Ours happened to be because the director of the musical had asked for an extra week due to doing two shows for the high school and then moving to the Andrews.

494
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:33,906
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, over the summer we planned it and went through everything and it seemed like that was a better way to go with the later date.

495
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:34,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

496
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:35,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not meaning this year at all.

497
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:39,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just, and I think that there were pros and cons, but I,

498
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,441
[SPEAKER_15]: The question needs to be asked.

499
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:44,622
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done it in the past.

500
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,683
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I thought.

501
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,803
[SPEAKER_09]: We have done it in the past.

502
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:51,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what happens is every year there's a different shift of interest.

503
00:33:53,127 --> 00:34:01,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the McGlynn is higher than the Andrews, and we always have to figure out the logistics of everything and making sure that it all works.

504
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:07,754
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're never opposed to doing it around the same time and integrating the groups.

505
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:13,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, more logistically, and Mr. Edwards can also chime in as well.

506
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,470
[SPEAKER_09]: There are certain things that we go to.

507
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:20,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to have bigger groups in some things.

508
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:31,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So what would happen was if we were at a certain area, the McGlynn wasn't too far behind us, or we weren't too far behind them in a different time frame.

509
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:32,519
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

510
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, great.

511
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:34,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks very much.

512
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,720
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

513
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:36,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

514
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:38,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Skerry.

515
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:41,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw you to the principals.

516
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this is the eighth or ninth year that this trip has taken place.

517
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:51,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I've moved that it be granted and I know you guys do a great job and I know the kids get a lot out of it.

518
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:56,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And given the nature of current affairs, I believe

519
00:34:57,313 --> 00:35:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps, have you worked anything out with the travel agency for contingencies if the trip has to be canceled?

520
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:06,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that the trip does take place.

521
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,421
[SPEAKER_09]: We both use the same company.

522
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,662
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been using them for years.

523
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:12,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Very amenable for things that occur.

524
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:19,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think what your point being is, compared to nine years ago, this wasn't as much of a.

525
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:22,300
[SPEAKER_09]: issue as what we're seeing nowadays.

526
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:33,069
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've been a minimal of, you know, we don't have anything officially in writing, but through phone conversations, they've been, I just want to make sure that the kids get a chance to do what they want to do.

527
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:36,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on the field trip, get to see a Broadway play.

528
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:38,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

529
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:39,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

530
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:40,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

531
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:45,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Mr. Edwards, how many students have you had in the past go?

532
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:47,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It varies every year.

533
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:49,124
[SPEAKER_08]: It varies.

534
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:51,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly has tapered off over the last few years.

535
00:35:52,606 --> 00:35:54,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really due to demographics in our school.

536
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So last year you had less than 49 students go?

537
00:35:58,651 --> 00:35:59,672
[SPEAKER_08]: We had one full bus.

538
00:35:59,712 --> 00:36:01,113
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably comparable to that.

539
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what the exact number was.

540
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:03,835
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

541
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:12,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know over the years that we've tried to say, I know over the years it's been together.

542
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:15,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And we kind of thought that was working.

543
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:16,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So that way the students felt that

544
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,365
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like one field trip for everybody.

545
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:27,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any students that want to do like a one-nighter in your school that want to go in the McGlynn School?

546
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:37,723
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't presented it like that, so I would feel that we had parent meetings and sort of laid out what our itinerary was.

547
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,925
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wouldn't feel right.

548
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,570
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of doing that shift this year.

549
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,470
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's something that we have to do.

550
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And it wouldn't be right for the student either.

551
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:45,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just asking if anybody's asked.

552
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:46,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

553
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. Edwards, you said you're leaving at 5 o'clock in the morning.

554
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:51,872
[SPEAKER_10]: What time do you get back?

555
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:57,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the evening, 7 o'clock I think approximately.

556
00:36:57,854 --> 00:36:57,914
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

557
00:36:57,994 --> 00:37:02,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're saying that the only thing that the students will miss out on is the show?

558
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:03,935
[SPEAKER_07]: The Bronx.

559
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:04,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they added a show.

560
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:06,155
[SPEAKER_08]: You added the show?

561
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:06,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

562
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:08,936
[SPEAKER_10]: In place of the Bronx too, I guess.

563
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:09,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

564
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:12,815
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I was just curious.

565
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:25,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're still going to the 9-11 Memorial, Museum of Natural Heritage, out into the water to see Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center, Times Square.

566
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,220
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

567
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,562
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have your itinerary.

568
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:35,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could provide that for us with the time.

569
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:37,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you also have the same amount of chaperones?

570
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,707
[SPEAKER_08]: We have six chaperones for 49 students.

571
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,095
[SPEAKER_10]: And 49 students?

572
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:45,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

573
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,396
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just reading.

574
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:50,077
[SPEAKER_10]: And yourself?

575
00:37:50,557 --> 00:37:51,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going this year, no.

576
00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:54,618
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so it's just the six chaperones and the students?

577
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:58,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they're all eighth grade teachers that are going, which is really nice for the students.

578
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:00,219
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

579
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

580
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,520
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

581
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:06,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Mustone.

582
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:09,842
[SPEAKER_04]: My eighth grade acquaintance is very excited to be going with the Andrews.

583
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:11,811
[SPEAKER_04]: She would not want me to chaperone.

584
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:15,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you need an extra chaperone with the McGlynn, I'll go with you.

585
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:17,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a great time, both of you.

586
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all the kids at both schools are so excited.

587
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

588
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

589
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:29,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Do any of the children need medical services that are going on the trip?

590
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And how are we handling that?

591
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe through you to the superintendent.

592
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:47,457
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a careful procedure that starts in October as we start to really get to know our students and identify any students going on any field trips, especially on this field trip.

593
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:51,400
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, we do not have any medical concerns for the students going.

594
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,363
[SPEAKER_08]: In years past, we have, and we've handled that in a variety of ways.

595
00:38:56,063 --> 00:39:00,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we had the parents of a diabetic student accompany us.

596
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,132
[SPEAKER_08]: and be readily available in case the student needed any assistance.

597
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:06,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, she did not and she had a wonderful time.

598
00:39:08,354 --> 00:39:16,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And to reiterate, I have the same scenario this year where I don't have the same medical needs as I've had in the past where we have had parents come.

599
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:20,888
[SPEAKER_09]: as well to serve the need that's there.

600
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:30,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Knowing that, I know this is a discussion that we've had this year greatly, but I think it's something that we're working on to improve through the years.

601
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that everybody has a reasonable chance to go.

602
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:42,352
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our number one, you know, we would never deny anybody because of some medical reason or even some financial hardship we've been able to.

603
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:43,855
[SPEAKER_09]: cover that as well.

604
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:44,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

605
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:56,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just want to prepare for that in case it were to arise, because it would be the school's responsibility to make sure that we provide appropriate health services for any student that chooses to go on one of these trips.

606
00:39:56,737 --> 00:40:02,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to keep that in mind when you're planning, and I applaud you for both doing that.

607
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:11,980
[SPEAKER_02]: As with every field trip, the school nurses screen the lists of students that have signed up for the field trips or that are eligible to go.

608
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:19,818
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, as both the principals said, we didn't have any students with needs that required a nurse to accompany them.

609
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:28,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents were offered a chance to go and they all willingly wanted to go.

610
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Should they had said no, we would have looked at alternative arrangements.

611
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:34,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

612
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:35,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am EpiPen certified.

613
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Defibrillator.

614
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,912
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

615
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:42,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

616
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:43,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote, please.

617
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Cunha?

618
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:46,973
Yes.

619
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:48,414
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

620
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:48,594
Yes.

621
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:49,734
Mrs. Price?

622
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,294
Yes.

623
00:40:50,635 --> 00:40:51,115
Mrs. Costello?

624
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:51,335
Yes.

625
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:52,075
Mr. Skerry?

626
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:52,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

627
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:52,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Van der Kloot?

628
00:40:52,975 --> 00:40:53,035
Yes.

629
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Senator Burke?

630
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:54,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

631
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:55,996
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

632
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:56,877
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

633
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:57,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

634
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:01,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

635
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:02,527
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

636
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:04,107
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

637
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:07,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Item two, report on automated external defibrillators.

638
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:08,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

639
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Vento, I think you already did your intro.

640
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:12,749
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just a quick thing on this one.

641
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is a report you asked for.

642
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:20,150
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a follow-up report of a report that we previously gave you on the AED.

643
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So with specific names and

644
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,452
[SPEAKER_00]: specific discussions of where they're located.

645
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:32,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a follow-up report to a previous report, but Tony is here to give you more detail.

646
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

647
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So this also follows up another mandate by Governor Baker that was just signed in January called an act requiring automatic external defibrillators in schools, and it's effective of July 2018.

648
00:41:48,827 --> 00:41:57,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're very fortunate in Medford, this has been a recommendation for many years, and we have met that recommendation for many years.

649
00:41:57,673 --> 00:42:02,857
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our school buildings do have defibrillators in them.

650
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the schools, depending on the size of the school, have multiple defibrillators.

651
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:12,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And the locations are itemized out in the report.

652
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:20,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Our AED units are compatible with the equipment that's on Armstrong ambulances.

653
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:36,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if we had to use a defibrillator, we know that we can easily turn responsibility over to the Armstrong ambulance without changing any other equipment.

654
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:37,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're fortunate with that.

655
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:41,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Every school has staff that are certified.

656
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did provide lists.

657
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:58,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Now those lists change with all of the nurses, the athletic trainer, the coaches, the health and phys ed teachers are required to be certified.

658
00:42:58,734 --> 00:42:59,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers are not.

659
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:06,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's fluidity in the teaching staff who maintain their certifications.

660
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:13,439
[SPEAKER_02]: But during the school day, we have somebody on site that is properly certified and trained.

661
00:43:15,104 --> 00:43:23,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, we, we have our unit serviced twice a year through, um, a maintenance contract with life support systems, um, in Dedham.

662
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're fortunate, um, also that our training has been provided, um, by generous support from, um, the people at Armstrong Ambulance.

663
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:38,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So superintendent Belson had asked for a demonstration of how, um, the unit would work.

664
00:43:38,705 --> 00:43:41,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, we have, I have Sean Mangan here from.

665
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:45,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Armstrong ambulance with a trainer, so we don't have to use it on anybody.

666
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:48,674
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will show you how.

667
00:43:48,995 --> 00:43:57,084
[SPEAKER_02]: The unit is set, it's a smart unit, so they're set up to give you auditory prompts through the process.

668
00:43:58,686 --> 00:43:59,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Mr. Mangan.

669
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:01,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for being here tonight.

670
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:09,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically this is the Zoll AED Plus.

671
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:13,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the machines that are in the city are Zoll products.

672
00:44:13,938 --> 00:44:16,559
[SPEAKER_01]: They're brought through life support systems.

673
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,560
[SPEAKER_01]: The machine is pretty simple to operate.

674
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same machine that's here at City Hall downstairs.

675
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:23,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Open the machine up.

676
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:29,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Any AED that you use or potentially need to use, the first thing you should do is turn the machine on.

677
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:34,111
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's basically how American Heart Association teaches you, open the machine, turn it on.

678
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:37,874
[SPEAKER_01]: When you turn on this machine, it'll start to prompt you into what to do next.

679
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:40,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not sure what to do, the machine will guide you.

680
00:44:41,438 --> 00:44:44,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of things that ultimately save people's lives.

681
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,764
[SPEAKER_01]: It's early defibrillation and high quality chest compressions or high quality CPR.

682
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:54,710
[SPEAKER_01]: If both of those things are done in a very short amount of time after we recognize somebody needs those,

683
00:44:55,729 --> 00:45:08,356
[SPEAKER_01]: The outcomes are typically much better as they get CPR much sooner We used to think a long time ago back in high school when I took CPR that you know Your brain starts to lose after seven or ten minutes of not having oxygen.

684
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:13,578
[SPEAKER_01]: So we breathe we breathe we breathe into people If their heart stops, we need to circulate the blood.

685
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:17,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the blood has plenty of oxygen in it for that period of time So we need to move it around.

686
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So those those chest compressions alone will circulate and

687
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:27,824
[SPEAKER_01]: perfuse the brain, perfuse the heart, perfuse the major organs until we can get a machine there quick enough to defibrillate somebody.

688
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:28,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

689
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:31,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put the, I'll turn the machine on for you.

690
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:33,065
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a trainer.

691
00:45:35,345 --> 00:45:36,826
[SPEAKER_01]: The pads are pretty simple to use.

692
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,686
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pictures on the pads.

693
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:45,048
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, take the pads out of the machine and lay them right on the patient's chest and turn the machine on.

694
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:51,960
Stay calm.

695
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:53,602
Check responsiveness.

696
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:54,882
Call for help.

697
00:45:56,283 --> 00:45:59,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Attach defib pads to patient's spare chest.

698
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:05,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you place the defib pads on the patient's spare chest, the machine will recognize that.

699
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Attach defib pads to patients.

700
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:09,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't touch patient.

701
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:10,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Analyze.

702
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:14,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the machine is going to analyze for up to about 10 to 15 seconds.

703
00:46:14,335 --> 00:46:16,357
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to analyze the hotbed itself.

704
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:28,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty simple to use.

705
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:31,827
[SPEAKER_01]: We clear the patient, make sure nobody else is touching the patient.

706
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:43,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So that machine gives you a metronome as to a beat to give when you're actually providing chest compressions throughout that.

707
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:47,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two minutes this machine will go into a reanalyzation process automatically.

708
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:54,144
[SPEAKER_01]: What that does is tells us to change out the compressor, because the compressor or whoever's doing the CPR is going to get tired.

709
00:46:54,705 --> 00:46:57,287
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where we change that position of that person.

710
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And every two minutes, the machine will cycle that.

711
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:05,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either going to deliver a shock, it's going to say the shock is advised, or it's going to say no shock advised.

712
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:10,858
[SPEAKER_01]: After either one of those, whether we deliver a shock or there's no shock advised, we want to start chest compressions again right away.

713
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:11,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

714
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:15,021
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it says, check your patient, check for responsiveness.

715
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:16,682
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a quick, are you okay?

716
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:17,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you all right?

717
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:26,176
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone's not breathing normally or responding to just from that or only gasping, that could be a sign of a cardiac arrhythmia that could potentially cause death.

718
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:28,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to stop compressions right away.

719
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,421
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what AHA recommends.

720
00:47:32,158 --> 00:47:36,384
[SPEAKER_01]: If we start compressions right away and someone says, please stop pushing on my chest, we would stop.

721
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, we would continue to go.

722
00:47:38,747 --> 00:47:42,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of gives you, you don't have to worry about hurting anybody or anything like that.

723
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:47,820
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to stop pushing on that chest right away to get that blood circulating and perfusing those major organs right away.

724
00:47:48,655 --> 00:47:51,177
[SPEAKER_11]: So do you want to do your song that you taught us at City Hall?

725
00:47:51,457 --> 00:47:53,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, so the song beat is what this one has.

726
00:47:53,038 --> 00:48:00,623
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all trained by Armstrong on how to use this, but there's a time lapse between getting the defibrillator and actually the person that's in the room with them.

727
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:04,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so the song that AHA used to use is called Stayin' Alive.

728
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:13,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you sing Stayin' Alive in your head and you keep the beat to stayin' alive and you do good high quality chest compressions and you get early defibrillation, you have great outcomes in patient survival.

729
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:27,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, amongst us just speaking with Tony and speaking with Diane Caldwell, we've, we've also, we have two CPR classes planned.

730
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:31,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been in touch with Jean Camuso from your office.

731
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:32,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be doing some at city hall.

732
00:48:33,398 --> 00:48:39,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the AEDs from the school and through the service zone plan, what's kind of spaced out throughout the city.

733
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,601
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost about 50 AEDs in the city.

734
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as a community, it's pretty impressive.

735
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,614
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a lot of locations.

736
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:49,858
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to get them in a few more locations in the parks and stuff with some weatherproof casing.

737
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Baseball fields have them as well.

738
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they are out there and they are available to people.

739
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:59,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Armstrong Ambulance for also assisting us on any call that we make to them.

740
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,941
[SPEAKER_11]: They're there to help us out.

741
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:01,682
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

742
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:02,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

743
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:02,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

744
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I just had one question.

745
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,866
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the list of where they are in the school system.

746
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:07,787
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just sort of curious.

747
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:08,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there one in this?

748
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:09,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

749
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:10,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Right in the front lobby.

750
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,651
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

751
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:14,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in case, because sometimes passions get pretty heated here.

752
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:15,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, there is one in the front lobby.

753
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the library has one.

754
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,037
[SPEAKER_01]: All the schools have one.

755
00:49:19,277 --> 00:49:21,980
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one in the training center at the police academy.

756
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the little league fields have them right now.

757
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,541
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd like to get a couple more too, so.

758
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:27,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

759
00:49:27,782 --> 00:49:28,302
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

760
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:29,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both.

761
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:41,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a little bit more on this, because as I said, we are in good shape, but the new law is going to require us to purchase additional units.

762
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:49,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be to meet the requirements for the presence of an AED during athletic events that are off campus.

763
00:49:50,428 --> 00:50:03,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, our athletic events, when they're on campus at the high school, we have AEDs available, the trainer is on site, and so we can get an AED to the field very quickly.

764
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:17,761
[SPEAKER_02]: The new law requires that if a school sponsored athletic event is held at a site other than a school facility, the school officials shall ensure that an AED and an AED provider is on site.

765
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:25,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spoke with Rachel Perry and Bobby Maloney about what does that mean to us.

766
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:30,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And for winter sports that are held at the high school, we are meeting requirements, we're fine.

767
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:37,026
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fall and spring sports that tend to disperse out amongst the city playing fields.

768
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:44,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So Playstead, Memorial Park, let's see where else, Columbus Park, places that there is not an AED.

769
00:50:47,939 --> 00:51:03,906
[SPEAKER_02]: the need to purchase 16 AEDs that the coaches would be able to sign out at the beginning of their season, keep with their first aid bag, and then sign it back into the athletic department at the end of the season.

770
00:51:04,246 --> 00:51:10,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, the unit goes with them to every practice and to every game, and it is on site.

771
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,692
[SPEAKER_02]: With purchasing those units, we would also have to purchase

772
00:51:17,463 --> 00:51:30,290
[SPEAKER_02]: the servicing program that maintains the twice yearly servicing and keeps the software up to date and replaces parts and pads as they're used.

773
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:35,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

774
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:36,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

775
00:51:36,874 --> 00:51:39,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your report and thank you very much for the demonstration.

776
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:44,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't seen that so I found it very interesting and your time to come out tonight.

777
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:59,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to purchase these immediately if our spring sports are underway and our coaches, like say our track team is doing long distance track or something like that.

778
00:52:00,012 --> 00:52:06,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Those coaches should have them with them and God forbid something happened while we're putting this in the budget for next year.

779
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:14,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So through you, Mayor Burke, to the superintendent, is there any way that we could find a way to get

780
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:21,087
[SPEAKER_06]: what we need for our students for this spring season to make sure that they're safe.

781
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:22,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And training.

782
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:24,268
[SPEAKER_11]: It would require training.

783
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:25,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all the coaches are trained.

784
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:28,270
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trained in this mission, the AED.

785
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:28,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

786
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's required of all the athletic coaches.

787
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:44,597
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Tony, maybe you could explain the different sites that we think, you know, technically, I mean, a coach and a trainer could bring a unit with them to every field and every activity.

788
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:45,637
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to necessarily

789
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:46,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you see how portable they are.

790
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:48,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't have to keep it in the car.

791
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:49,809
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, they would bring it in their first.

792
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:50,890
[SPEAKER_00]: They could bring it with them.

793
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:51,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

794
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:56,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're proposing going forward is that we have them actually on site at these places.

795
00:52:56,752 --> 00:52:59,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case something happens and someone is not there with it.

796
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:07,115
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we have trainers and coaches going to every game, I'm not sure we're in a critical stage yet.

797
00:53:07,635 --> 00:53:12,937
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the future, obviously we want to be in a situation where these things are automatically there.

798
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:17,814
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to that is they have to be checked fairly frequently to make sure the battery's loaded.

799
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:22,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means people have to go to these places early to check them in advance.

800
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:26,277
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of logistical work that's associated with that.

801
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:32,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working on that as to getting that going forward.

802
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:40,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion to have all of our coaches have these defibrillators with them as of this spring season.

803
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:46,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way they're portable and our children are always provided safe care.

804
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,592
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor.

805
00:53:49,672 --> 00:53:50,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

806
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:51,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you wish to speak on this?

807
00:53:52,832 --> 00:54:00,354
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I just want to know, I mean, as far as the coaches having one, at what point do they have to be recharged?

808
00:54:00,914 --> 00:54:05,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it like, does the battery go out if you don't use it, or how does that work?

809
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:08,276
[SPEAKER_02]: The batteries have a long shelf life, so for instance,

810
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:14,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The nurses check their machines daily to make sure that that battery is charged.

811
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:19,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember purchasing batteries, I mean, through a school year.

812
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:29,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the maintenance service contract, they're here twice a year, and then they swap out batteries that need to be swapped out.

813
00:54:30,255 --> 00:54:30,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

814
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:34,479
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is the actual battery charge good for, Tony?

815
00:54:36,156 --> 00:54:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: two years, two years.

816
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:40,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words saying it's, you know, generally should be in good shape.

817
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:46,224
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you know, we certainly wouldn't want to malfunction to be the outcome of anything.

818
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much of the units, like how much does it cost per unit per unit?

819
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:52,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit shy of a thousand dollars.

820
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:55,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the service contract is $285 per unit.

821
00:54:55,451 --> 00:54:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are looking at a cost.

822
00:54:56,732 --> 00:54:57,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um,

823
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:07,740
[SPEAKER_02]: about $15,000 for the purchase cost and another $4,500 to service them every year.

824
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how many coaches do we have starting off in the spring season right now?

825
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:14,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't bring that.

826
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:15,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bring that with me.

827
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,267
[SPEAKER_02]: But exactly.

828
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:19,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And they all go to different fields.

829
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:23,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So the different levels, freshmen, JV, and varsity go to different fields.

830
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:26,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have all of baseball at one field.

831
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,055
[SPEAKER_02]: We have them separated out.

832
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:32,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when, you know, cross-country is running through the fells or whatever.

833
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:35,885
[SPEAKER_07]: A coach should have somebody with him and keep, you know, training.

834
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:36,546
Offsite.

835
00:55:36,606 --> 00:55:41,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should have at least a half a dozen that they could sign up when they're off campus.

836
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,752
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of spring teams that are off campus.

837
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how we added up the 16.

838
00:56:03,676 --> 00:56:12,604
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor that funding take a place immediately if the superintendent can find the funds seconded by Ms.

839
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:13,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Mustone.

840
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:14,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote, please.

841
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:27,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

842
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:28,825
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

843
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:30,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

844
00:56:30,706 --> 00:56:31,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuno.

845
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:32,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I also have another question.

846
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:43,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony, you were just saying that anything that basically off campus, and I know we were discussing our athletes, but I'm curious in knowing what about like when we have our proms?

847
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:47,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have to find out like where we have our proms?

848
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:51,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have to find out if those locations, if there's anything going on, because we do have

849
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:57,550
[SPEAKER_10]: The proms that are off-site and certain other events that are off-site are banquets for our students.

850
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:03,931
[SPEAKER_10]: When we have our banquets at the end of the year or after a season, do we need to find out if those places are off?

851
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:07,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we spoke about that this morning at the high school.

852
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think the planners of a lot of these events, that needs to be now a question when they're setting up the venues.

853
00:57:15,755 --> 00:57:18,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an AED on site?

854
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:25,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have, I mean, I keep a couple in my office as loaners, so sometimes we have to send them on a field trip.

855
00:57:25,827 --> 00:57:32,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can give it to the nurses or a phys ed teacher who's certified to take it on a field trip if that's the case.

856
00:57:32,689 --> 00:57:37,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would fall under that category, making sure that the venue has them.

857
00:57:37,491 --> 00:57:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, then we would loan one out to our staff.

858
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:43,333
[SPEAKER_02]: They would sign it out and bring it back.

859
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:53,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I would propose, actually, even if the site has it, sometimes, even though they might have it, and if you're in a large hotel, you don't exactly know where it is.

860
00:57:53,051 --> 00:58:01,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it'd just be better safe than sorry if we do have these that we can check out, that whoever is running the event is actually bringing it with them.

861
00:58:03,138 --> 00:58:12,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we, you know, obviously have to work with our partners, the people that we play sports with and so on and so on, and other school districts, is to have that conversation.

862
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,450
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go to their school, do they have things in place?

863
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,650
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're at other places, do they have things in place?

864
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we're talking about the nurses on field trips and the like.

865
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:25,772
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be asking that question wherever we go.

866
00:58:26,172 --> 00:58:29,453
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's something major going on, do you have facilities on site?

867
00:58:30,393 --> 00:58:41,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you know this, but one of our former nurses used to get paid to go to the theater shows in Boston to sit in the audience just in case a nurse was necessary.

868
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:52,873
[SPEAKER_00]: The theaters didn't have their own medical staff, so they wanted someone there who was medically trained to intervene should a situation take place.

869
00:58:53,534 --> 00:59:00,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect we're going to have this conversation since the law not only affects Medford, but it affects every school district and every community across the commonwealth.

870
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:04,311
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be one of those discussions, do you have the right equipment?

871
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:07,594
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way with first aid kits, the same way with ambulance calls.

872
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:12,597
[SPEAKER_00]: We play a football game in a different field, we don't necessarily bring our ambulance, they have their ambulance in the field.

873
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:18,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to obviously work out a lot of coordination.

874
00:59:19,382 --> 00:59:27,308
[SPEAKER_02]: When I called life support systems to obtain a quote, my contact there said you're one of the first dozen

875
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,920
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cities to call about, about this.

876
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:43,990
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I'm expecting many, many, many calls because now with this new law and just in the last week I received an email from one of the, you know, a vendor saying, Oh, this is the new law.

877
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, are you prepared?

878
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:49,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's out there and people are, you know, we're ahead of the curve right now.

879
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:53,958
[SPEAKER_02]: People are, um, are starting to look at their needs as well.

880
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

881
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

882
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:09,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Through you to the superintendent, can we get a follow-up report of how many were actually ordered when they became available to our staff and the total cost after you figure out exactly how much you need?

883
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:14,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you add that to the requested reports list at the back?

884
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:24,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, when I read your report, I'm very happy to see that three, four, five, or more people at each of our locations

885
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,431
[SPEAKER_06]: trained, except for the Curtis Tough School.

886
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:28,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That concerned me.

887
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:30,092
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only one trained person at that.

888
01:00:30,212 --> 01:00:34,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that we're close, and Armstrong can be there in moments.

889
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:38,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we don't live miles and miles away, like some of the rural districts.

890
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:42,117
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, two people minimum should be at every building.

891
01:00:42,177 --> 01:00:44,018
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, we are opening up training.

892
01:00:44,138 --> 01:00:45,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's being offered, too.

893
01:00:46,837 --> 01:00:49,520
[SPEAKER_02]: starting with the administrators, and then we'll open up more classes.

894
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially because there's only a nurse there three hours a week.

895
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:52,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

896
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:55,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I read another report being presented.

897
01:00:55,444 --> 01:01:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: That concerns me, and those students, you know, weren't the same.

898
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:01,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

899
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Consideration.

900
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:10,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd really like to see an upgraded list after the training, through you to the superintendent,

901
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:21,682
[SPEAKER_06]: any additional people and making sure that we're starting September with the appropriate number at each building and not less than two people at each school.

902
01:01:23,202 --> 01:01:24,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Preferably more than that.

903
01:01:24,282 --> 01:01:28,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And I motion to accept the report and thank you very much.

904
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:31,404
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to accept the report and place on file, seconded by Ms.

905
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:32,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot, Ms.

906
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:32,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Cugno.

907
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:33,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

908
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:43,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just thinking that since this is something that is hitting now and it is the law, is it possible maybe, I'm not sure if there's any type of discount if you buy a certain amount and if

909
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:57,783
[SPEAKER_10]: like maybe we could talk to our surrounding areas, districts, to see if maybe if Somerville, Malden, Everett, or even if like Armstrong is buying some, just to see if that, if you buy, you know, zero to five, it costs a thousand.

910
01:01:57,863 --> 01:02:00,884
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's five to 10, it might cost something else.

911
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:09,246
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, even if there's a hundred dollar difference, maybe we could buy them together as a package deal and get the cost down.

912
01:02:10,584 --> 01:02:18,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we'll look into that, as well as the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education, they're establishing the guidelines on this.

913
01:02:19,671 --> 01:02:25,035
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also looking at getting out information about other grant sources and funding opportunities.

914
01:02:25,436 --> 01:02:27,437
[SPEAKER_02]: That information has not come out yet.

915
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:35,284
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will have our eye on that, whether we can get some costs reimbursed once the grants come out.

916
01:02:36,245 --> 01:02:36,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

917
01:02:39,075 --> 01:02:40,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good, thank you very much.

918
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:40,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

919
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Vento, on the motion.

920
01:02:41,597 --> 01:02:42,357
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

921
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:42,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

922
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:43,658
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

923
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:44,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is granted.

924
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Pre-budget health services.

925
01:02:49,822 --> 01:02:50,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

926
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:50,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Vento.

927
01:02:53,765 --> 01:03:02,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I thought I'd give you a little overview of the program, and I listed out where our staffing, where our staff nurses are assigned.

928
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:04,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Our staffing is based on

929
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: student enrollment as well as acuity of student health needs.

930
01:03:09,582 --> 01:03:22,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we meet all of the guidelines set out by the state for student enrollment, I always look at the acuity within the school and whether additional nurses are necessary at different schools.

931
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:30,833
[SPEAKER_02]: One expected change is I have one nurse that's retiring at the end of this school year.

932
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:42,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as we've talked about in many of our pre-budget reports, is the complexity of school nursing that has changed.

933
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:45,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's many advances in pediatric care.

934
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:53,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Students with chronic illnesses live, they attend school, and they receive a lot of care in school.

935
01:03:54,895 --> 01:03:57,116
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not only students with

936
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:10,078
[SPEAKER_02]: allergies, diabetes, but we have students who have had cancer, we've had students that have had organ transplants, and they all require some sort of monitoring or attention by a school nurse.

937
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:22,663
[SPEAKER_02]: The past couple of years has also seen a growing number of international children coming into the area for care at the Boston Medical Centers.

938
01:04:23,184 --> 01:04:25,525
[SPEAKER_02]: These students usually seek advanced care.

939
01:04:26,983 --> 01:04:31,804
[SPEAKER_02]: or had very little health care in their lives, so they're coming with many, many needs.

940
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:36,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And while they're here, they do enroll in the Medford public schools.

941
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:46,326
[SPEAKER_02]: We're close to the city, and there are community groups that they are linked with, and I think that's why they come here to Medford.

942
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:53,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And those students require accommodations for their time when they're in school to access their curriculum.

943
01:04:56,775 --> 01:05:09,404
[SPEAKER_02]: case managers, and not only doing first aid and medication administration, but working closely with physicians and community organizations to make sure that the students are able to attend school safely.

944
01:05:13,086 --> 01:05:25,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We have students who travel with portable defibrillators, we have students who require tube feedings, certainly diabetic care, we have students with seizure disorders, and then life-threatening allergies, and any emergency with

945
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:36,658
[SPEAKER_02]: will require one-to-one attention by the school nurse and it leaves the rest of the population waiting until the emergency has been resolved.

946
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:52,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other things that have increased the complexity, the demand for student screenings such as the mental health issues have grown and expanded yearly and our most recent numbers are we have about 660

947
01:05:54,135 --> 01:06:03,843
[SPEAKER_02]: students who have a physician diagnosed mental health condition that may require a lot of additional nursing support.

948
01:06:03,923 --> 01:06:21,858
[SPEAKER_02]: We work in tandem with the counseling staff so that behavior plans can be carried forth in the nurse's office as well, and that we're part of the team to help students get back to class quickly, stay in class,

949
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,106
[SPEAKER_02]: and access their curriculum.

950
01:06:26,227 --> 01:06:41,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also trained, we have access to Narcan in case there are any opioid overdoses by either students, staff, or even visitors in the area.

951
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:44,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The nurses are trained and we have a supply of Narcan available.

952
01:06:47,598 --> 01:06:51,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we had, we did receive funds for,

953
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:59,106
[SPEAKER_02]: to fund the contractually mandated professional development and the liability insurance as we grew our staff.

954
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:02,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the accomplishments.

955
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:12,090
[SPEAKER_02]: We have maintained a return to class rate of 97% in our district, and that's been consistent for the past three years.

956
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:18,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So students coming down to the nurse's office are receiving treatments and getting back into class.

957
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:22,836
[SPEAKER_02]: We accomplished the SBIRT screening as I mentioned earlier.

958
01:07:23,397 --> 01:07:26,918
[SPEAKER_02]: This year was accomplished at no financial cost to the district.

959
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to readjust staffing and we did that without having substitute.

960
01:07:36,283 --> 01:07:41,086
[SPEAKER_02]: The tuberculosis surveillance project was a high priority this fall.

961
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:49,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We had 205 individuals that participated in screening that took place in October and January.

962
01:07:50,777 --> 01:07:56,579
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran a blood screening clinic here at the high school for about 120 individuals.

963
01:07:57,459 --> 01:08:01,960
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of other students had skin tests placed by the Medford Board of Health.

964
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And other students were followed by their primary care physicians.

965
01:08:07,602 --> 01:08:16,584
[SPEAKER_02]: What that project entailed was a lot of collaboration and coordination by the school nurses with different departments, both at the state and city level.

966
01:08:18,722 --> 01:08:30,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And then last, another accomplishment is we're continuing our outreach to parents, and I did put a flyer over at the podium about, we have a talk on April 12th by Dr. Ruth Poteet.

967
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:46,375
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an expert on substance abuse behaviors, and she speaks frequently about the risk factors that teens face because of their brain development during the teen years.

968
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:48,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a community forum.

969
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:51,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open to all parents, teaching staff.

970
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:52,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for students.

971
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for adults.

972
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We've opened it up to the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition.

973
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:01,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Some neighboring towns have also expressed interest.

974
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:07,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very pleased to be sponsoring that with generous support from Team Medford.

975
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:11,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me?

976
01:09:11,404 --> 01:09:13,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the high school, the Caron Theater.

977
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,769
[SPEAKER_02]: at 630 on Wednesday, April 12th.

978
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:33,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So the request for the budget, the first thing is to increase the service line item to maintain our existing 13 AEDs that we have in the district.

979
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:39,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, I was able to absorb that cost through grant funding, and that grant funding is no longer available.

980
01:09:43,808 --> 01:09:49,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Also the funds to purchase the additional AEDs that we spoke about at the previous report.

981
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some special requests.

982
01:09:54,071 --> 01:10:01,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Replacing the full-time nursing position that we will lose to retirement and increasing the nursing staff by one FTE.

983
01:10:02,794 --> 01:10:12,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to increase the staff at the Roberts Elementary School so that there is some extra support to the school nurse there since she's a solo practitioner.

984
01:10:13,657 --> 01:10:26,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to place some nursing staff at the Curtis Tufts so that we would have somebody available to attend meetings and be available for the students as they need.

985
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

986
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:30,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

987
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:32,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any questions for Ms.

988
01:10:32,407 --> 01:10:32,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Vento?

989
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:38,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to receive and place this report on file by Ms.

990
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:41,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Cugno and by Mr. Skerry.

991
01:10:41,548 --> 01:10:42,288
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

992
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:43,689
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

993
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:44,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

994
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

995
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

996
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:49,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Pre-budget foreign language.

997
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:57,377
[SPEAKER_00]: This report will be given in Italian.

998
01:10:58,637 --> 01:10:58,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

999
01:10:59,118 --> 01:10:59,558
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1000
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:01,359
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do that.

1001
01:11:02,268 --> 01:11:06,171
[SPEAKER_17]: I promise you it'll be much lighter than the previous reports.

1002
01:11:07,372 --> 01:11:13,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And before you speak, we do have an addenda that was added in our packet on our desk tonight.

1003
01:11:13,056 --> 01:11:14,056
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could add it to this one.

1004
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:20,601
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to begin by giving you an overview of our department.

1005
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:30,588
[SPEAKER_17]: The foreign language program in the Medford Public Schools is aligned with the national Act IV guidelines and with the state

1006
01:11:31,863 --> 01:11:36,785
[SPEAKER_17]: of Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

1007
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:45,887
[SPEAKER_17]: In the foreign language classroom, students develop linguistics and cultural skills that enable them to contribute in a global society.

1008
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:57,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Students in the Medford public schools are first introduced to a foreign language in second grade, Italian, and that continues to fifth grade,

1009
01:11:57,792 --> 01:12:03,333
[SPEAKER_17]: and it's a program that's being supported by a grant from CASIT.

1010
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:08,955
[SPEAKER_17]: In the middle school, students can choose to study Italian or Spanish.

1011
01:12:12,136 --> 01:12:21,818
[SPEAKER_17]: They have instructions twice a week in sixth grade, and that's increased to three times a week in seventh grade and eighth grade.

1012
01:12:22,865 --> 01:12:40,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Our current program in the middle schools is not ideal and does not adequately prepare most of our students to move into the second year of foreign language at the high school.

1013
01:12:41,555 --> 01:12:47,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Ideally, students should have foreign language every day, especially at the 8th grade level.

1014
01:12:48,272 --> 01:12:55,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, the scheduling and the level of staffing needed precludes this from occurring.

1015
01:12:57,158 --> 01:13:10,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Adding staff, a .5 teacher at each of the middle schools would help reduce class size, thus increasing a student's acquisition of the language by the end of 8th grade.

1016
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:16,530
[SPEAKER_17]: At the high school, in addition to Spanish and Italian, we also offer French.

1017
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:35,282
[SPEAKER_17]: The graduation requirement is two years of the same language, but many students choose to continue through senior year, as acceptance to many colleges require three or four years of the same language.

1018
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:43,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Staffing, the foreign language department has 14 teachers, two at each of the middle schools and 10 at the high school.

1019
01:13:45,975 --> 01:13:52,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Highlights, and I did it monthly to be a little bit more organized, so I'll start with September.

1020
01:13:52,618 --> 01:14:03,284
[SPEAKER_17]: This past September, our French teachers accompanied a group of French students to the Boston Opera House to see the intriguing Opera of Carmen.

1021
01:14:04,187 --> 01:14:14,156
[SPEAKER_17]: In October, two AP Italian students each won $1,000 and were honored at a gala celebration in Boston.

1022
01:14:15,176 --> 01:14:28,408
[SPEAKER_17]: In November, six Medford Public Schools foreign language teachers, including myself, were among the 8,500 who attended the Actful Convention in Boston.

1023
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:38,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Teachers felt inspired and returned to their classrooms with renewed energy and lots of new strategies to use in the classroom.

1024
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:57,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Subsequently, we held a series of professional development workshops where teachers that attended the conference shared what they learned with the rest of the department and with each other because we made it a point not to attend the same sessions at the convention.

1025
01:14:58,443 --> 01:14:59,003
[SPEAKER_17]: In December,

1026
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:06,717
[SPEAKER_17]: 220 students of Italian enjoyed a concert by Italian singers at Everett High School.

1027
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:20,200
[SPEAKER_17]: A group of Italian and Spanish students spent a Saturday at Melrose High School's Immersion Day, where they were able to use the target language outside the classroom settings.

1028
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:28,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of using the target language outside the classroom settings, in February, students from Ms.

1029
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:29,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Bryan's Spanish 5 class

1030
01:15:30,468 --> 01:15:34,731
[SPEAKER_17]: visited and participated in Spanish classes at St.

1031
01:15:34,972 --> 01:15:36,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Anselm's College.

1032
01:15:37,253 --> 01:15:41,056
[SPEAKER_17]: In March, the same thing was done with the AP students from Ms.

1033
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:47,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Lepore's AP class, and this time it was at Tufts University.

1034
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:54,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Also in March, the Italian Consulate of Boston arranged to bring Italian culture to Medford High School.

1035
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:58,250
[SPEAKER_17]: They brought two cars, a Maserati and a Lamborghini,

1036
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:09,915
[SPEAKER_17]: and 100 packets from Italy that contained pasta, canned tomatoes, and a recipe for students of Italian.

1037
01:16:10,715 --> 01:16:15,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally, that afternoon, they entertained us with a musical group from Italy.

1038
01:16:17,257 --> 01:16:18,517
[SPEAKER_17]: A French student in Ms.

1039
01:16:19,057 --> 01:16:26,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Smith's French Four of Honors competed in the oratory contest by Club Richelieu,

1040
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:30,293
[SPEAKER_17]: of Salem and finished second place and won $200.

1041
01:16:32,075 --> 01:16:37,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Still in March, about 300 students participated in the national foreign language exams.

1042
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,481
[SPEAKER_17]: We just completed them this week.

1043
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:46,748
[SPEAKER_17]: And the results from these tests inform us about curriculum and how we perform on a national basis.

1044
01:16:47,528 --> 01:16:53,594
[SPEAKER_17]: To the two middle school teachers from the Andrews School for first time this year also opted to

1045
01:16:54,327 --> 01:16:57,649
[SPEAKER_17]: to have their students take the test.

1046
01:16:57,969 --> 01:17:00,690
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're anxious to see the results.

1047
01:17:01,871 --> 01:17:10,816
[SPEAKER_17]: In April, actually this coming Friday, a group of 19 Italian students will compete with area high schools at Brandeis University.

1048
01:17:11,456 --> 01:17:16,199
[SPEAKER_17]: They will be judged on creativity and language use.

1049
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:22,462
[SPEAKER_17]: During April vacation, Medford High School will take a group

1050
01:17:24,395 --> 01:17:26,636
[SPEAKER_17]: to Italy on an educational trip.

1051
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:35,779
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually, I will be returning on an upcoming meeting to ask your approval for two other trips for the following year.

1052
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:46,023
[SPEAKER_17]: In April and May, the Education Office of the Boston Italian Consulate will introduce Arduino to advanced Italian students.

1053
01:17:46,384 --> 01:17:52,566
[SPEAKER_17]: And Arduino is an open source platform used for building electronics projects.

1054
01:17:53,857 --> 01:18:00,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Universities in Italy and MIT are working together on numerous research collaborations using Arduino.

1055
01:18:01,662 --> 01:18:07,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of these representatives will come to give instructions in Italian to our students.

1056
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:18,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Each student will receive a Arduino kit and will be challenged to create its own electronics project.

1057
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,802
[SPEAKER_17]: In May, 28 students will be taking foreign language AP exams.

1058
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:32,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Our averages from last year were above the national average, and we wish this year's students good luck on their exams.

1059
01:18:33,548 --> 01:18:45,776
[SPEAKER_17]: After taking the AP exam, exams, I should say, because the three languages they do it, students will be teaching foreign language to the children in Kids' Corner.

1060
01:18:46,652 --> 01:18:50,855
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is in response to requests from Kids Corner and parents.

1061
01:18:53,456 --> 01:19:11,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Funding for 2016-2017 was used to purchase new textbooks, Avancemos 3, to finish our Spanish series, replace lost and damaged books, purchase new sets of easy readers for French, Italian, and Spanish,

1062
01:19:12,088 --> 01:19:16,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Purchase additional AP books since our AP Spanish enrollment was higher this year.

1063
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:22,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Pay for the annual online fee for the AP Spanish students.

1064
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:29,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Purchase sets of headphones and microphones for our middle schools and high school.

1065
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:34,259
[SPEAKER_17]: And then purchase the usual office and classroom supplies.

1066
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Requests for budget for 2017-2018, I'm asking for a level

1067
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:45,604
[SPEAKER_17]: funded budget to 2015-2016.

1068
01:19:47,045 --> 01:19:51,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Numbers of current staff and anticipated staffing needs.

1069
01:19:52,507 --> 01:19:55,309
[SPEAKER_17]: At the high school, we currently have 10 full-time teachers.

1070
01:19:55,409 --> 01:19:59,190
[SPEAKER_17]: At the middle schools, there are four, two at each school.

1071
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:05,493
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I mentioned before, I am asking for an additional .5 teacher at each of the middle schools.

1072
01:20:06,393 --> 01:20:07,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Goals and objectives for 2017-2018.

1073
01:20:11,157 --> 01:20:38,141
[SPEAKER_17]: improve on our foreign language program at the middle schools, provide professional development for teachers in pedagogy and curriculum, continue our journey to proficiency, and it is a journey, plan a PD series to work on proficiency-based assessments, especially final exams, and support and guide teachers to focus on two of the six core practices from ACTFL, and those are

1074
01:20:38,623 --> 01:20:45,826
[SPEAKER_17]: design communicative activities, and teach grammar as concept and use in context.

1075
01:20:46,887 --> 01:20:51,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Non-salary needs for educational materials and supplies.

1076
01:20:51,929 --> 01:20:57,832
[SPEAKER_17]: I supplied a table for you, and as I said, I'll be asking for level funded budget to 2015-2016.

1077
01:20:57,952 --> 01:21:01,233
[SPEAKER_17]: If you have any questions.

1078
01:21:02,073 --> 01:21:02,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

1079
01:21:03,194 --> 01:21:03,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1080
01:21:04,635 --> 01:21:05,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your report.

1081
01:21:05,755 --> 01:21:06,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very nice to see you.

1082
01:21:06,855 --> 01:21:07,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1083
01:21:08,826 --> 01:21:12,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a question about the middle school teachers.

1084
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:22,137
[SPEAKER_06]: You said the 2.5 people, one for each middle school, would not increase the amount of classes the students take.

1085
01:21:22,317 --> 01:21:24,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It would decrease the class size.

1086
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:27,121
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the average class size now?

1087
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:28,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Around 25, I think.

1088
01:21:28,242 --> 01:21:28,702
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 to 25.

1089
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:30,284
[SPEAKER_05]: In how many classes a day?

1090
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,081
[SPEAKER_05]: How many classes a day?

1091
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:43,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Do each teacher currently teach?

1092
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:49,808
[SPEAKER_09]: The middle school schedule is unique in a sense that we go a five day cycle.

1093
01:21:50,508 --> 01:21:53,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also have every exploratory as well.

1094
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:56,232
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the Andrews, we rotate quarterly.

1095
01:21:56,312 --> 01:22:02,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So art, music, tech lab, computer, include a full year of foreign language.

1096
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:07,080
[SPEAKER_09]: But in order to make everything work contractually and everybody have what they need,

1097
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,691
[SPEAKER_09]: You pay for Peter to rob the Paul in this sort of kind of way.

1098
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,333
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, everybody wants something.

1099
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:21,174
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there were times where people wanted us all to make sure that everyone's getting help from the Michigan Monocle.

1100
01:22:21,674 --> 01:22:22,955
[SPEAKER_09]: You only have 10 periods a day.

1101
01:22:23,595 --> 01:22:27,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So in order to figure out how to do that, it becomes a real balancing act.

1102
01:22:27,937 --> 01:22:30,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to increase foreign language.

1103
01:22:31,803 --> 01:22:39,485
[SPEAKER_09]: becomes a balancing act and making sure, remembering too, that if there is a 0.5, there's travel that's involved between the two middle schools.

1104
01:22:39,785 --> 01:22:43,307
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm saying 0.5 at each.

1105
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So how would a 0.5 person lower the class size?

1106
01:22:48,232 --> 01:22:53,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can make a section that would help that out and divvy things up.

1107
01:22:53,697 --> 01:23:00,364
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens when fifth graders come to select a school, they also select a foreign language.

1108
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:05,269
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do the best we can to honor that, but we can't honor that all the time due to the numbers of kids.

1109
01:23:05,349 --> 01:23:10,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So this happens to be an increased number of students that want to take Spanish.

1110
01:23:11,314 --> 01:23:12,555
[SPEAKER_09]: when they come to the Andrews.

1111
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:21,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So that, you know, with one teacher, there's only so many sections I can give that one teacher, and then I have to move it over to Italian, let's say.

1112
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:27,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So presently, what do we have for staffing at the Andrews for foreign language?

1113
01:23:27,765 --> 01:23:31,147
[SPEAKER_09]: A full-time Italian teacher and a full-time Spanish teacher.

1114
01:23:31,748 --> 01:23:34,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the class size for the Italian classes?

1115
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:36,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Average is 24.

1116
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:36,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so

1117
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: How many of those requested Italians?

1118
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:44,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it's usually a 60-40.

1119
01:23:48,263 --> 01:23:49,563
[SPEAKER_09]: 60% Spanish, 40% Italian.

1120
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,124
[SPEAKER_11]: But that changes.

1121
01:23:51,924 --> 01:23:53,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and that varies.

1122
01:23:54,325 --> 01:24:00,648
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we've talked about this, we've had middle school ILDs, we've talked about, you know, what's the change.

1123
01:24:00,788 --> 01:24:10,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it's the experience that they feel like they've had a little bit of experience in Italian in elementary and they want to make, you know, just a change into Spanish and learn something different.

1124
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:14,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious just to help how it works.

1125
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:20,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we used to have foreign language every day in the middle schools years ago, right?

1126
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:20,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago.

1127
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:28,641
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, things, you know, needed things, like everybody needs to take health and we want to make sure that they get the Michigan model.

1128
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:31,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of things that, you know, the needs are there.

1129
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:34,502
[SPEAKER_09]: We just have to make sure everything's balanced.

1130
01:24:36,082 --> 01:24:40,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So adding the .5 person, would that enable more children to have

1131
01:24:42,026 --> 01:24:42,427
[SPEAKER_06]: choice.

1132
01:24:44,349 --> 01:24:56,000
[SPEAKER_09]: As in get their first choice of which language they want?

1133
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:05,229
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that we're looking at this, if I'm assuming, correct me if I'm wrong, we're talking about one teacher that's going to be shared between two schools?

1134
01:25:07,009 --> 01:25:09,750
[SPEAKER_17]: try to get to teach to save on that.

1135
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,530
[SPEAKER_07]: 2.5 teachers.

1136
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:12,350
[SPEAKER_07]: That's even better.

1137
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:14,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Two part-time teachers would be better this way.

1138
01:25:15,331 --> 01:25:17,531
[SPEAKER_17]: They won't waste time traveling.

1139
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:21,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they just teach one language, or do some teachers teach both?

1140
01:25:21,232 --> 01:25:21,852
[SPEAKER_17]: We would teach both.

1141
01:25:21,912 --> 01:25:22,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1142
01:25:22,032 --> 01:25:24,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it'd be great if we can get two.

1143
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:29,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally, we would like to have someone that's a foreign language.

1144
01:25:30,874 --> 01:25:32,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, that would have both.

1145
01:25:32,114 --> 01:25:33,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that common?

1146
01:25:33,497 --> 01:25:34,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are very rare.

1147
01:25:34,357 --> 01:25:37,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very rare.

1148
01:25:37,438 --> 01:25:48,142
[SPEAKER_09]: But just because of what we're seeing with data, it would make things easier with scheduling if you could have someone that could teach a Spanish class and an Italian class as well.

1149
01:25:48,442 --> 01:25:50,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would help balance off numbers as well.

1150
01:25:54,344 --> 01:25:59,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So the new hires that you're going to advertise for, will they be for Spanish or for Italian?

1151
01:26:01,086 --> 01:26:02,427
[SPEAKER_17]: We will probably go for Spanish.

1152
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we have more students selecting Spanish.

1153
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:12,143
[SPEAKER_06]: So my last question is, do we need two full-time Spanish teachers and a part-time Italian teacher?

1154
01:26:12,803 --> 01:26:14,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Or has that been looked at?

1155
01:26:14,264 --> 01:26:17,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I think based on the numbers, I don't think.

1156
01:26:18,085 --> 01:26:21,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, and I don't know what the incoming numbers are at this point in time.

1157
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,027
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going through that now.

1158
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:24,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We're currently going through that.

1159
01:26:25,007 --> 01:26:32,010
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, since my tenure as principal, the increase in Spanish has gotten a little bit greater through the years.

1160
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:37,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just asking so we allocate and we plan for future choice.

1161
01:26:37,534 --> 01:26:42,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other sense of things too, and I think Mia can attest to it too, I hope.

1162
01:26:43,477 --> 01:26:49,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I'm not always able to honor the sixth grade, I do my best if there needs to be some switch.

1163
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,603
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of kids say, oh no, I'm very happy where I was, but there's still a few families that would like to make that switch.

1164
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:58,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I do everything I can in the summer to adjust for that if I can.

1165
01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:01,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1166
01:27:01,959 --> 01:27:02,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1167
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss Stone.

1168
01:27:05,423 --> 01:27:06,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I can attest to that.

1169
01:27:07,826 --> 01:27:08,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I can attest to that.

1170
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:11,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an Italian eighth grader and a Spanish sixth grader.

1171
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:13,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So they both got their first choice.

1172
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:14,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were happy.

1173
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:15,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1174
01:27:16,896 --> 01:27:17,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Skerry.

1175
01:27:18,445 --> 01:27:19,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw you to Mr. Cowell.

1176
01:27:20,106 --> 01:27:29,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Cowell, do you get requests from students to, they may want to learn another language besides what we're offering, such as German, or study Latin, or Chinese, or Russian?

1177
01:27:29,974 --> 01:27:30,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1178
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:34,777
[SPEAKER_17]: We have had that discussion at the beginning of the year with Dr. Perella and Ms.

1179
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:38,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Riccardelli, and we actually conducted a survey.

1180
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,203
[SPEAKER_17]: The students gave them a choice of 10 languages.

1181
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:47,167
[SPEAKER_17]: If they were to choose any language, which one would be their first choice?

1182
01:27:48,856 --> 01:27:51,098
[SPEAKER_17]: put them in the order of choice.

1183
01:27:51,238 --> 01:28:03,629
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there was no surprise that number one was Spanish, number two was Italian, number three was French, and actually number four is Portuguese that they want.

1184
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:10,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Chinese wasn't there, but I can send you if you want, I can send you the data of the survey.

1185
01:28:11,377 --> 01:28:16,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any possibility of offering introductory Portuguese in the fall or was that some time off?

1186
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:25,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Once we went over the survey with Dr. Ricardelli and Dr. Perella, we decided to leave things as they are for this year and then reconsider.

1187
01:28:25,902 --> 01:28:26,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1188
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:27,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1189
01:28:27,963 --> 01:28:28,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1190
01:28:28,143 --> 01:28:28,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Cunha.

1191
01:28:30,043 --> 01:28:32,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Keller, for the report.

1192
01:28:33,304 --> 01:28:36,845
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the lost and damaged books, are those numbers rising over the years?

1193
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:47,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, now that we have newer books, so that if a book is lost, it costs a lot more to replace.

1194
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:53,124
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some Italian books that are almost $170 a book.

1195
01:28:55,445 --> 01:28:57,305
[SPEAKER_17]: That includes the online component.

1196
01:29:00,386 --> 01:29:06,247
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems that more books are lost at the middle schools, but they have old books.

1197
01:29:07,112 --> 01:29:16,796
[SPEAKER_17]: And teachers are using the book less and less, because, in fact, we were looking into buying new books for middle schools, but I'd rather have the extra teachers.

1198
01:29:17,937 --> 01:29:28,902
[SPEAKER_17]: And they are making their own units, and there's so much now available online.

1199
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:36,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you have replaced lost or damaged books, because the cost of replacing newer books is very high.

1200
01:29:36,702 --> 01:29:39,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about the new books that were bought at the high school?

1201
01:29:40,205 --> 01:29:40,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1202
01:29:40,465 --> 01:29:42,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the ones I'm talking about.

1203
01:29:42,147 --> 01:29:44,509
[SPEAKER_17]: If they lose those books, right, we have to replace them.

1204
01:29:44,529 --> 01:29:46,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So has the number of losing books increased?

1205
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,212
[SPEAKER_17]: At the high school, I don't think so.

1206
01:29:48,392 --> 01:29:49,193
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty much.

1207
01:29:50,914 --> 01:29:51,034
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1208
01:29:52,475 --> 01:29:52,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1209
01:29:53,196 --> 01:29:53,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1210
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:53,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Kloop.

1211
01:29:54,457 --> 01:30:01,103
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to mention that I really love that after the AP exams, the students are going to go down to Kids' Corner and teach them some

1212
01:30:01,923 --> 01:30:03,023
[SPEAKER_15]: some words and whatever.

1213
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:03,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that was a lot of fun.

1214
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:06,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Some little songs, some words, some colors maybe.

1215
01:30:06,905 --> 01:30:07,565
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's great.

1216
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:10,926
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would be great for both the students and the little children.

1217
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:12,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1218
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:13,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1219
01:30:14,047 --> 01:30:14,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1220
01:30:14,427 --> 01:30:17,929
[SPEAKER_11]: DiCarlo, is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

1221
01:30:17,949 --> 01:30:18,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1222
01:30:18,269 --> 01:30:18,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Ms.

1223
01:30:19,649 --> 01:30:20,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

1224
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1225
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:22,690
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1226
01:30:23,191 --> 01:30:23,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is granted.

1227
01:30:24,231 --> 01:30:24,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1228
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:25,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1229
01:30:27,392 --> 01:30:28,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Pre-budget mathematics.

1230
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:29,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1231
01:30:29,313 --> 01:30:29,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Joy.

1232
01:30:34,712 --> 01:30:35,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1233
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:36,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone.

1234
01:30:37,334 --> 01:30:39,996
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go through the overview with you.

1235
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:47,841
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the full text of the narrative of the mathematics proposed budget for next year.

1236
01:30:48,502 --> 01:31:00,590
[SPEAKER_14]: The mathematics program at the K through 12 is based on the Massachusetts state framework for mathematics, and that is built upon the common core state standards.

1237
01:31:01,533 --> 01:31:12,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is currently undergoing a revision of those standards which we will be attending to during the summer and the following school year.

1238
01:31:14,163 --> 01:31:20,568
[SPEAKER_14]: The instructional practices and materials are aligned with the program.

1239
01:31:20,668 --> 01:31:29,595
[SPEAKER_14]: We have recently bought new programs for the elementary and at the high school levels and our practices

1240
01:31:30,196 --> 01:31:39,583
[SPEAKER_14]: again go on with that program and to offer course pathways for students to make them college and career ready.

1241
01:31:40,163 --> 01:31:54,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So you'll see at the high school we have a lot of offerings beyond Algebra II for our students because they do take various routes post-graduation from Medford High School.

1242
01:31:56,589 --> 01:32:05,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, at the middle school, we have 13 teachers, and at the high school, 15 and two-tenths.

1243
01:32:05,335 --> 01:32:13,601
[SPEAKER_14]: That little piece is one of the CTE teachers is teaching a section of Algebra I for us again this year.

1244
01:32:14,882 --> 01:32:17,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And the highlights of this year

1245
01:32:18,035 --> 01:32:21,577
[SPEAKER_14]: is to support those changes in curriculum and testing.

1246
01:32:21,998 --> 01:32:28,682
[SPEAKER_14]: We put in place some professional development for teachers in grades three through eight.

1247
01:32:29,622 --> 01:32:41,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Three through five was given predominantly during their professional development days, visits to the elementary schools and workshops that I had at the high school, which they attended.

1248
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:47,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was to get them all ready for the next round of testing, which will be

1249
01:32:47,578 --> 01:32:50,759
[SPEAKER_14]: We are entering in that area now.

1250
01:32:51,620 --> 01:33:08,106
[SPEAKER_14]: All the teachers on the PD day took the online assessment to see what it was like and experience that firsthand so they'd have better knowledges of the challenges that might face the children with the use of the technology.

1251
01:33:09,847 --> 01:33:16,690
[SPEAKER_14]: And then at the middle school, a lot of the professional development was done within our department meeting time.

1252
01:33:17,262 --> 01:33:22,644
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, they were taking the test, giving practice tests to students.

1253
01:33:23,424 --> 01:33:25,265
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a new program.

1254
01:33:25,285 --> 01:33:33,988
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a first year at the high school for Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and I'd like to thank members of the committee for voting that through.

1255
01:33:34,008 --> 01:33:39,030
[SPEAKER_14]: It is making a significant difference to have teachers

1256
01:33:39,497 --> 01:33:53,881
[SPEAKER_14]: like all on the same pace and that is in all the schools and at the special education classrooms are using the same materials as well as the English language learner classrooms.

1257
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:56,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that is going well.

1258
01:33:56,501 --> 01:34:03,583
[SPEAKER_14]: We kicked off the year with some professional development in how to use the technology associated with the program.

1259
01:34:04,483 --> 01:34:07,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And also in the elementary,

1260
01:34:08,038 --> 01:34:12,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we're working on greater use of the technology.

1261
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:21,086
[SPEAKER_14]: So we know that at home, they have access to online textbooks and tutors through those programs.

1262
01:34:21,606 --> 01:34:26,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going quite well, but like anything, it's so deep.

1263
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:32,812
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many layers of the technology for the faculty to learn and to be able to share with the students.

1264
01:34:37,861 --> 01:34:40,923
[SPEAKER_14]: The program is integrated, we have co-teaching.

1265
01:34:41,484 --> 01:34:49,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Also at the high school now, we extended it to geometry classes in the hopes of expanding it to algebra two.

1266
01:34:50,050 --> 01:35:00,098
[SPEAKER_14]: It's working well in mathematics and we just did an assessment on it so if it can all be scheduled, we'd like to continue in that realm.

1267
01:35:01,539 --> 01:35:03,681
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's a co-teach model.

1268
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:09,470
[SPEAKER_14]: that we're using, and again, it will depend on staffing.

1269
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:21,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And the collaboration and outreach has been with our community members and also higher education.

1270
01:35:22,313 --> 01:35:28,735
[SPEAKER_14]: We had an opportunity right now, some of our students are in the midst of taking courses,

1271
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:32,014
[SPEAKER_14]: through MIT's OpenCourseWare.

1272
01:35:32,535 --> 01:35:35,856
[SPEAKER_14]: They invited us into their BeaverWorks program.

1273
01:35:36,336 --> 01:35:45,001
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have, let's see, six students who have been granted entrance into the program.

1274
01:35:45,381 --> 01:35:51,984
[SPEAKER_14]: They're taking online programming courses and have now applied for a summer program.

1275
01:35:52,144 --> 01:35:57,867
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're hoping to get some of the students in this summer program, which will be a combination of

1276
01:35:58,313 --> 01:36:06,079
[SPEAKER_14]: programming and robotics, and it'll be free of charge to our students, so we're very hopeful all their applications are in.

1277
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:17,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We had speakers come from Wentworth Institute and Applied Mathematics to talk to the students about, you know, how are you going to use this mathematics?

1278
01:36:18,289 --> 01:36:21,732
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they brought an entire team out.

1279
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Tufts University has always been a great partner with us.

1280
01:36:25,962 --> 01:36:30,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we have a few programs going with them.

1281
01:36:30,523 --> 01:36:43,529
[SPEAKER_14]: One is the STEM Ambassador's Program, where we sit down, um, the director of science and myself with the team from that program through Tisch College.

1282
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:46,330
[SPEAKER_14]: We evaluate the program each year.

1283
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:52,816
[SPEAKER_14]: And last year we found a need to kind of strengthen our pathway in computer science.

1284
01:36:53,356 --> 01:37:01,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And it turned out this year that almost 50% of the ambassadors coming from Tufts had that as a background.

1285
01:37:02,318 --> 01:37:12,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So they were able to bring some of the units into the physics class because we're using physics as their vehicle of reaching students.

1286
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,220
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they did some programming with them.

1287
01:37:16,006 --> 01:37:37,305
[SPEAKER_14]: And also through that program, I was able to meet a new faculty member in the computer science department, who's starting a chapter of Girl Set Code, and invited Medford students, and we had quite a few, and I believe they've even connected with the Girl Scouts in Medford, to offer Saturday classes.

1288
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:41,509
[SPEAKER_14]: And in turn, one of our teachers, Ms.

1289
01:37:41,529 --> 01:37:42,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Faiza Khan,

1290
01:37:43,058 --> 01:37:54,540
[SPEAKER_14]: She went on the TEF Saturday program and spoke about her career pathway because she has an engineering background and programming background and teaches programming at the high school.

1291
01:37:55,261 --> 01:38:07,383
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the other side, we had that professor, Dr. Laney Strange, come to Medford High School and speak about her career pathway.

1292
01:38:07,483 --> 01:38:10,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So it did work out well.

1293
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:11,564
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a give and take.

1294
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:31,907
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be entering into a partnership with Harvard University on strategies for teaching Algebra I. So right now, we're just working out the details of the memorandum of agreement, and that will begin this summer with teacher education.

1295
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:38,910
[SPEAKER_14]: The parent and guardian participation and communications,

1296
01:38:39,632 --> 01:38:44,534
[SPEAKER_14]: held several nights during the school year at the high school.

1297
01:38:45,374 --> 01:38:50,216
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have an event coming up for parents of sixth graders.

1298
01:38:50,296 --> 01:38:51,736
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Thursday, if you can make it.

1299
01:38:51,797 --> 01:38:57,058
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 7 o'clock at the high school, talking about the pathways in our mathematics program.

1300
01:38:57,639 --> 01:39:06,422
[SPEAKER_14]: And then at the elementary level, we had teachers open up their classroom and actually model and envision math lessons so the parents could see

1301
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:09,403
[SPEAKER_14]: just what it looked like in the classroom.

1302
01:39:10,323 --> 01:39:27,310
[SPEAKER_14]: So the funding for this present school year, again, the entire textbook budget went to the new high school adoption for Algebra I geometry and Algebra II.

1303
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:34,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Instructional materials to support the program K through 12.

1304
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:44,893
[SPEAKER_14]: So those were like mathematics specific materials that they needed in the classroom and that included a lot of technology.

1305
01:39:45,734 --> 01:39:57,917
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting up to speed in trying to get document cameras in the classroom and calculators are always a big expense and along with that comes a big expense for batteries every year.

1306
01:39:58,357 --> 01:39:59,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So that takes a good chunk of it.

1307
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:06,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the office supplies just for operations for the department.

1308
01:40:07,681 --> 01:40:21,584
[SPEAKER_14]: And so my request for next year's funding is pretty much level to what we had last year with a little bump up on the textbook item.

1309
01:40:22,164 --> 01:40:27,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is so that we can pay our last payment for the textbook program.

1310
01:40:28,065 --> 01:40:30,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a little bit of extra money

1311
01:40:31,213 --> 01:40:36,494
[SPEAKER_14]: For those senior programs, should we see a shift in enrollment and need to buy some books?

1312
01:40:36,994 --> 01:40:41,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Or when you're at a classroom, the teacher materials are quite expensive.

1313
01:40:42,435 --> 01:40:46,556
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm not projecting anything very great.

1314
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:50,977
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do know that our enrollment has been fluctuating.

1315
01:40:51,017 --> 01:40:54,297
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been bringing in students, which is a good thing.

1316
01:40:54,797 --> 01:40:57,818
[SPEAKER_14]: But we need to kind of look ahead to see

1317
01:40:58,851 --> 01:41:02,234
[SPEAKER_14]: if any more monies need to be put in that direction.

1318
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:05,116
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you have any questions.

1319
01:41:05,316 --> 01:41:06,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1320
01:41:06,197 --> 01:41:06,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1321
01:41:06,437 --> 01:41:06,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Vandekloot.

1322
01:41:07,598 --> 01:41:10,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Could I just ask, what was the date of the pathways?

1323
01:41:12,522 --> 01:41:14,463
[SPEAKER_14]: That's this Thursday evening.

1324
01:41:14,483 --> 01:41:14,523
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1325
01:41:15,144 --> 01:41:16,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And where is it being held?

1326
01:41:16,345 --> 01:41:21,088
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be at the Science Lecture Hall at the high school at 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock.

1327
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:22,569
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1328
01:41:22,589 --> 01:41:23,870
[SPEAKER_15]: There's so many things that night.

1329
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:24,791
[SPEAKER_14]: There is.

1330
01:41:25,171 --> 01:41:26,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And that one didn't get on our list.

1331
01:41:26,572 --> 01:41:27,753
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

1332
01:41:27,793 --> 01:41:28,394
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

1333
01:41:29,491 --> 01:41:47,508
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess one other comment, I just wanted to, I really like that there's been so much interaction between our students and Tufts and many of the other MIT and whatever so that our students are seeing real world potential jobs in mathematics and what people do with it.

1334
01:41:47,548 --> 01:41:51,932
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that clearly your report listed so many of them and I think that's terrific.

1335
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:52,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1336
01:41:52,853 --> 01:41:53,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1337
01:41:53,454 --> 01:41:53,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1338
01:41:54,405 --> 01:42:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor for motion to receive in place on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1339
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:00,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Cugno.

1340
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:01,271
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor.

1341
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:03,072
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1342
01:42:03,092 --> 01:42:03,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1343
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:04,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Joy.

1344
01:42:08,176 --> 01:42:13,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, report on personnel hiring September 1st, 2016 to March 29th, 2017.

1345
01:42:14,521 --> 01:42:15,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Superintendent.

1346
01:42:15,682 --> 01:42:18,585
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a report that you requested and it's listing.

1347
01:42:18,685 --> 01:42:20,366
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty obvious as to what's there.

1348
01:42:21,167 --> 01:42:21,527
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh,

1349
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:24,901
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you updates as they require.

1350
01:42:25,961 --> 01:42:27,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent.

1351
01:42:29,523 --> 01:42:32,324
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor to accept by Mr. Benedetto.

1352
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:34,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a seconded by Ms.

1353
01:42:34,145 --> 01:42:34,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot?

1354
01:42:34,685 --> 01:42:35,386
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1355
01:42:35,406 --> 01:42:35,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1356
01:42:36,186 --> 01:42:36,867
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1357
01:42:36,927 --> 01:42:37,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1358
01:42:38,923 --> 01:42:40,703
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of announcements.

1359
01:42:41,403 --> 01:42:44,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, if I could just make an announcement from the floor.

1360
01:42:44,764 --> 01:42:46,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not related to schools.

1361
01:42:46,564 --> 01:42:48,465
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the big sweep is starting on Monday.

1362
01:42:49,245 --> 01:42:50,785
[SPEAKER_11]: So everybody, check your website.

1363
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:54,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Sign up for the website to get alerts.

1364
01:42:54,386 --> 01:42:55,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Please sign up through the website.

1365
01:42:56,466 --> 01:43:01,007
[SPEAKER_11]: And just watch for your area when it's going to be covered, because there is ticketing and towing involved.

1366
01:43:01,067 --> 01:43:03,727
[SPEAKER_11]: And we know that's very expensive, but it's the only way we can get it done.

1367
01:43:03,807 --> 01:43:05,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So a shout out.

1368
01:43:05,247 --> 01:43:06,328
[SPEAKER_11]: It's starting next Wednesday.

1369
01:43:07,048 --> 01:43:07,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1370
01:43:09,648 --> 01:43:09,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1371
01:43:09,988 --> 01:43:15,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to say something else before we throw a couple of quick information pieces out there tomorrow night?

1372
01:43:15,891 --> 01:43:23,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the city council again, seeking matching funds for the culinary arts hospitality project.

1373
01:43:24,855 --> 01:43:27,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you've got a breakout here.

1374
01:43:27,776 --> 01:43:33,118
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we're putting in quite a bit of our own money and outside money as well as the state grant.

1375
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:36,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's 500,000 from the state is 813,000 in kind.

1376
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:42,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we're asking the council and free cash for 250,000.

1377
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:44,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be there tomorrow night.

1378
01:43:45,531 --> 01:43:52,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also, um, because next Monday is Passover, we inadvertently scheduled it for Monday night.

1379
01:43:52,732 --> 01:43:53,953
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to move it to the 24th.

1380
01:43:54,153 --> 01:44:01,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I scheduled, you know, just tentatively the 26th, but that may have some conflicts with the mayor and other things.

1381
01:44:01,074 --> 01:44:04,214
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get back to you for a meeting on, on the community schools.

1382
01:44:04,234 --> 01:44:06,295
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get a date that works for all of you.

1383
01:44:06,975 --> 01:44:07,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll,

1384
01:44:07,983 --> 01:44:09,104
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to schedule a date.

1385
01:44:09,124 --> 01:44:17,030
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll check with the mayor's office and elsewhere, uh, for a community school and not community schools, a, uh, school council report night.

1386
01:44:17,671 --> 01:44:17,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1387
01:44:18,031 --> 01:44:19,092
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a committee of the whole on that.

1388
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:23,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some of the dates that we're trying to juggle to make sure everybody can be in attendance.

1389
01:44:24,836 --> 01:44:25,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're good.

1390
01:44:25,797 --> 01:44:27,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1391
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:28,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1392
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:32,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloop.

1393
01:44:32,482 --> 01:44:33,063
[SPEAKER_15]: 10th is canceled.

1394
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:33,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1395
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,763
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's rescheduled to April 24th.

1396
01:44:36,943 --> 01:44:37,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1397
01:44:37,684 --> 01:44:37,944
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1398
01:44:38,484 --> 01:44:38,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1399
01:44:39,605 --> 01:44:47,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I did wonder, when we were given the school council reports, my colleague earlier asked about the PTO representation.

1400
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:53,617
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wondered if we might combine those two, because often the school council reports reflect.

1401
01:44:53,758 --> 01:44:54,858
[SPEAKER_15]: We can.

1402
01:44:54,898 --> 01:44:58,502
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I suggest is that those meetings tend to be very long.

1403
01:44:58,782 --> 01:44:59,222
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.

1404
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:04,924
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want a different meeting for that, just simply because those meetings are long as it is.

1405
01:45:05,285 --> 01:45:05,385
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1406
01:45:05,685 --> 01:45:08,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes we hear about them.

1407
01:45:08,306 --> 01:45:11,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the same people, but that can go for a few hours.

1408
01:45:11,288 --> 01:45:11,328
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1409
01:45:11,348 --> 01:45:25,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to follow up on that, I also like it to be here at the chambers, so that way we acknowledge the people that are really doing so much time and service to our community for our students.

1410
01:45:25,376 --> 01:45:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd rather really have them present to us here.

1411
01:45:29,887 --> 01:45:32,069
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than a committee at a regular meeting.

1412
01:45:32,129 --> 01:45:32,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1413
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:34,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1414
01:45:34,231 --> 01:45:34,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1415
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:38,394
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to schedule as a regular meeting, but it's our special meeting that's put that way.

1416
01:45:38,654 --> 01:45:41,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Or added to our agenda.

1417
01:45:42,237 --> 01:45:42,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1418
01:45:42,398 --> 01:45:42,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Cunha.

1419
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:48,683
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing about having everybody here for the psych council meeting is I know that, um,

1420
01:45:49,998 --> 01:45:58,502
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people like to sit at the round table like when we have an open meeting like that and they feel that they could come and be more casual in that.

1421
01:45:58,542 --> 01:45:59,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we could still have it.

1422
01:46:02,224 --> 01:46:02,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the PTO.

1423
01:46:02,824 --> 01:46:03,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1424
01:46:03,525 --> 01:46:04,865
