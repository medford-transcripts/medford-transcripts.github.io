1
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:04,295
You let me know when we're live.

2
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,397
Awesome.

3
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:08,598
Great.

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,340
Good to see everyone.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,021
Thanks for tuning in today.

6
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:20,387
This is Solidarity Live, where we talk about the issues that affect people in Medford and Somerville, and how we can work together to solve them.

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:25,191
Today, we are going to be talking about an issue that affects everyone.

8
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:29,190
everyone in the United States, everyone in many other countries.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,932
And that is the question of our national debt and our money supply.

10
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:46,015
So before, I do have an exciting guest, but before I bring our guest on, I want to have people in the audience just think about a few questions before we start.

11
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:50,917
And one is, do you think that our national debt is a problem?

12
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:53,918
Is it something that worries you, the size of our national debt?

13
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:57,958
And if we could reduce our national debt to zero, would that be good?

14
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:02,000
Is that something that you think would help solve some of our problems?

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,264
And my third question is, who are we borrowing this money from, right?

16
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:12,145
If we have national debt, we've borrowed it from someone, we owe it to someone.

17
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,087
Who have we borrowed it from?

18
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,487
And who do we owe it to?

19
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:16,528
And how do we pay it back?

20
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:37,696
These are questions we're going to be talking about in addition to the even more important questions about how a new way of understanding our national debt can help us be able to fund things like a Green New Deal and Medicare for All and other programs that are important to us.

21
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,437
So now I'm going to introduce

22
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:48,046
Fadel Kaboob and Frank, if Frank, our producer could bring Fadel on, that would be great.

23
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:51,952
First, let me just make sure if I pronounced your name correctly.

24
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:53,554
Yes, Fadel Kaboob.

25
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:54,015
Thank you.

26
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:54,776
Thanks for having me.

27
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:56,206
Fantastic.

28
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:56,446
Great.

29
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:06,757
So Fadl Kaboob is an associate professor of economics at Denison, and he's also the president of the Global Institute for Sustainable Prosperity.

30
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:11,682
And Fadl, I would love for you to go ahead and just introduce yourself and your work.

31
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:17,112
Well, thank you for having me on this show and thank you for covering this important topic.

32
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:29,949
I think everybody's interested in this subject right now in the middle of a presidential election, in the middle of a climate crisis, in the middle of a pandemic, where we know that there is so much

33
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:47,780
need and so many things that need to be invested in spent on and covered and taken care of and everybody's worried where are we going to find the money how are we going to pay for all of this stuff who are we going to tax you know you've heard it already we've been taxed enough already that's the tea party

34
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,861
And who are we going to borrow from?

35
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,262
The country is bankrupt.

36
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,723
It's a burden on future generations and so on.

37
00:02:54,263 --> 00:03:06,169
So my work over the last several, you know, a couple of decades, at least my professional life, has been focused on these questions in the context of the US, but also in the context of developing countries in the global South.

38
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:12,072
So you can imagine the concern about, you know, poorer countries with fewer resources is even bigger.

39
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:16,335
But let's limit our conversation today to the US to keep things more focused.

40
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:25,852
So this approach to economics that I'm part of, it's called Modern Monetary Theory or MMT for short.

41
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:32,116
You've probably seen it all over the news in the last year or so, at least on the national stage.

42
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:40,601
It's a very simple set of observations to describe how the system currently works.

43
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,842
And it's trying to highlight

44
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:48,396
the mechanics of the existing ways we finance federal spending.

45
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:53,378
And it's trying to highlight some of the key limitations and some of the key obstacles.

46
00:03:53,859 --> 00:04:07,625
And it just happens to be an approach that goes completely against the mainstream understanding of what federal spending supposed to be and what the real constraints are supposed to be.

47
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,586
So let me put it this way, a couple of observations.

48
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,047
Number one, the federal government

49
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:26,795
is very different from a financial standpoint, very different from state and local municipal governments, is very different than you and I. So you and I have to work hard, earn an income first, then we spend it.

50
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:33,598
You and I can also borrow if we want to spend beyond our income, buy a big house or buy a new car or whatever.

51
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:38,781
But once we borrow, we have a debt that must be paid at some point in the future.

52
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:48,041
And the only way to pay that debt is either by earning more income somehow or spending less on other things so we can pay the bills.

53
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,622
That's the only way to do it.

54
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:56,306
Your local municipalities, your states, your cities also function the same way you and I function.

55
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:59,968
They collect tax revenues from their residents.

56
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:08,252
They use those tax revenues to spend on schools and housing and whatever programs the city or municipalities are spending on.

57
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,471
And that's it.

58
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:10,992
They're limited by tax revenues.

59
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:16,053
They can borrow to build a new school, to build a new stadium for the city or whatever.

60
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:27,536
But now the city has debt or the state has debt that must be paid for at some point in the future, maybe the next 20 years or so, by raising more tax revenues.

61
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,116
That's why we have school levies.

62
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:29,476
Right.

63
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:35,538
That's why city taxes and state taxes go up to pay for those big expenditures.

64
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:40,722
So that's the meaning of debt for you and I, for cities, for municipalities.

65
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:43,784
And it's so ingrained in us, right?

66
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:49,550
Because we live with it day to day and we have this fear of what might happen if we go into debt.

67
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,051
We've known people have gone into debt.

68
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:56,596
It's a thing that's very difficult for us to think differently.

69
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:57,617
Exactly.

70
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,299
So we learn to live within our means.

71
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:07,131
as families as as companies as nonprofit organizations where you have to raise revenues before you spend them right.

72
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,055
You don't have unlimited borrowing capacity.

73
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,620
And cities and municipalities also learn to live within their means.

74
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:18,066
If the public is demanding this big thing this ambitious thing

75
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,912
The city or the state will say, well, too bad.

76
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:22,913
We just can't afford it.

77
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:28,478
We have to settle for a smaller version of the thing that you're asking for.

78
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:37,328
But at the federal level, there is a very different mechanism for running public finances that is very different.

79
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,200
from the rest of us users of the dollar.

80
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,184
Think of the federal government as the issuer of the dollar.

81
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:48,547
It's the only entity that can legally print the currency to begin with.

82
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:52,711
But it's also, you know, functioning in a completely different way.

83
00:06:53,271 --> 00:07:05,502
And I'll highlight a few historical examples that people will connect to, to understand that the federal government is not limited the same way your state or municipality or you and I are limited.

84
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,853
Some historical examples, some very recent.

85
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:09,534
I'm talking about the CARES Act, for example.

86
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:16,938
So when the CARES Act was being introduced in Washington, D.C.

87
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:22,401
six months ago, if you go back just a couple of weeks before that, everybody in D.C.

88
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,023
was convinced there was no money for a Green New Deal.

89
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:26,884
There is no money for Medicare for All.

90
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:29,165
There's no money for broadband infrastructure.

91
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:34,197
Everybody was convinced, Democrats, Republicans, the general public that we're broke.

92
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:39,619
You know, there's no way we can spend trillions of dollars on these ambitious transformative programs.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,583
And we were told just to settle for either nothing or maybe hopefully a little bit, you know, and over time we'll deal with it.

94
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:54,146
But then all of a sudden the pandemic hits and we realize that we need to intervene on a massive scale.

95
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,110
to provide relief for the U.S.

96
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:00,233
consumers and businesses and so on.

97
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,997
So all of a sudden, 535 people in D.C.

98
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:08,261
get together and they vote to approve trillions of dollars worth of spending.

99
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:16,048
And they did it without telling us who they borrowed from, which they didn't borrow from anybody, or who they taxed.

100
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:26,728
On top of it, the president and the secretary of Treasury came out during that same week and said, by the way, April 15th is right around the corner.

101
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:28,690
Don't worry about paying your taxes.

102
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,311
We don't need your taxes.

103
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:32,894
We'll postpone that to July 15th or whatever.

104
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,896
So we didn't tax anybody.

105
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,237
We didn't borrow from anybody.

106
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:40,241
And the taxes that were due the following month, we told you we don't actually need it.

107
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:43,518
And that's how the federal government always spends.

108
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:48,843
The federal government doesn't need tax revenues or borrowing in order to spend.

109
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:55,068
Now, taxing and borrowing are still important, but they're not the thing we use to finance spending.

110
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,811
I'll give you even a better example, which is World War II.

111
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:03,756
World War II came right after the Great Depression, the most miserable time in U.S.

112
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:04,156
history.

113
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:09,556
There was no money to be taxed in the economy, and there was no money to be borrowed, right?

114
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,798
So that's like the very definition of broke, right?

115
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,199
The system was broke.

116
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:22,024
And all of a sudden, World War II is staring at us as a US economy.

117
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:28,529
And we have to spend a massive amount of money to build for the war effort and to win the war.

118
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:33,452
Now, can you imagine if we used our local city municipal budget thinking,

119
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:37,825
during World War II and said, well, listen, this thing is really expensive.

120
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:38,886
We can't afford it.

121
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:43,169
We can only afford a small, mini portion of the war.

122
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,092
So how about we send 5,000 troops to Germany and see if we can scare them away?

123
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,534
Do the incremental solution, right?

124
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:50,755
You can't do that, obviously.

125
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:55,899
So how did we pay for World War II without taxing anybody, without borrowing for anybody?

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,862
Well, the government did it the same way they spend on any program.

127
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,024
You know, not just those programs, not just the CARES Act.

128
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,765
This is how the government always spends.

129
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:08,367
535 people vote, approve the spending.

130
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,348
The spending is done.

131
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,369
It enters into the economy.

132
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:20,780
The part that we should be concerned about, and we were very concerned about during World War II, is what will be the effect of this additional spending?

133
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,323
We know that the government can spend as long as it's approved by Congress.

134
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:25,384
It's the law.

135
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,306
The Congress has the power of the purse.

136
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:35,133
The thing that Congress should always be concerned about, and we were very concerned about during World War II, was the risk of inflation.

137
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,675
If we flood the system with

138
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:47,442
billions of dollars worth of decent wages for people who are building the airplanes and the tanks and the military equipment, what will they do with that money?

139
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:48,883
Well, it's a free country.

140
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:54,586
They're gonna go out and wanna buy a house or wanna buy a car or wanna go on vacation, whatever it is, right?

141
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:55,307
It's a free country.

142
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,687
That's freedom, that's democracy.

143
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,408
Except there was a problem.

144
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:04,332
We had the vast majority of the working people of this country

145
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:12,258
busy producing military equipment and not enough people producing cars or homes or any of the consumer goods.

146
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:24,702
So we were going to be facing a situation where lots of people building airplanes have cash and they want to go out on a shopping spree and now they're going to bid up the price of homes and cars and consumer goods and cause inflation.

147
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:28,383
So what did we do to prevent that scenario from happening?

148
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:34,742
We leveraged the patriotic mood of the nation and said, here's what you're going to do.

149
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,564
You're going to buy this freedom bond from the U.S.

150
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:38,025
Treasury.

151
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:45,031
They call them freedom bonds and war bonds, which means you're going to give me, say, $10,000 of your hard earned income.

152
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,594
You're going to save it by buying this freedom bond.

153
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:49,594
And we, the U.S.

154
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:55,920
Treasury, promise to pay you back in 10 years or 15 years or whatever the duration is, plus interest.

155
00:11:56,395 --> 00:12:02,278
which means after the war, we'll give you your money back plus interest, and then you can go out on a shopping spree.

156
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:03,979
And that was the post-war boom.

157
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:10,722
But notice, the sale of those freedom bonds and treasury bonds didn't happen before World War II.

158
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:13,624
It wasn't to finance World War II, like most people think.

159
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:19,327
It happened during World War II, as the money was already spent into existence.

160
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:23,710
We found a way to pull it back out in a less coercive way.

161
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,291
So we could have taxed it away.

162
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:27,192
We could have coercively taken the money.

163
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,734
But of course, why would you want to do that?

164
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,336
You tax the upper income, you tax for other reasons.

165
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:34,577
But the sale of those U.S.

166
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:39,340
Treasury bonds, which we call borrowing, I mean, why would the government need to borrow its own money?

167
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,561
That's kind of a silly thing.

168
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:46,158
You and I call it borrowing, but from the federal government perspective, it's not for the purpose of borrowing.

169
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:52,742
At the time it was for the purpose of taming the risk of inflation, postponing consumption until after the war.

170
00:12:53,062 --> 00:13:00,086
There are other reasons also for selling government bonds, stabilizing interest rates and so on, which we can get into, but it gets more technical.

171
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,307
Can I just pause you for a second?

172
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:03,448
Yeah, of course.

173
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,909
So I want to go back a little bit, right?

174
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,651
Because I think when we use this term,

175
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:10,953
spending, like the government is spending.

176
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:26,768
I think it's very hard for us, you know, as people who spend money, who earn money, spend money, borrow money, when we talk about the federal government as spending money and borrowing money, I think it's hard for people to understand how it's different for the federal government.

177
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:34,375
So when the federal government, let me just ask this question, when the federal government spends money,

178
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:41,131
and you say spend into existence, like they're actually creating more dollars, right?

179
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,172
So they're increasing the money supply, right?

180
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,273
So it's not like they're spending.

181
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:52,336
They're just creating more dollars and giving those new dollars to people or companies.

182
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:53,216
Is that accurate?

183
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:54,757
Yeah, absolutely.

184
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:56,078
Think of federal spending.

185
00:13:56,318 --> 00:14:00,900
Every time the federal government spends, it's always spending new money into the economy.

186
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:01,722
Right.

187
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,305
Whether it's going to corporations or individuals or whatever, it's always new money.

188
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:11,171
Every time the government taxes money out of the system, think of it as dollars being destroyed.

189
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,052
It's taxed out of existence.

190
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:13,813
But.

191
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:18,803
when your local tax authority is taxing, it's not taxing and destroying those dollars.

192
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:24,004
They're taxing in order to spend because they're like you and I. They earn the dollars and they have to spend them.

193
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:30,785
The federal government doesn't need to borrow from you or from me in order to start a war, right?

194
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,766
Congress decides when they want to start a war.

195
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,546
Congress decides when they want to pay for the CARES Act.

196
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,927
Congress decides when they want to pass a tax cut.

197
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:48,075
It has nothing to do with my permission, me giving them permission, other than voting for different politicians, depending on their platform.

198
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:53,477
But we don't decide what tax dollars are going to do.

199
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:57,599
Congress always approves the spending, case in point, every time there is a war.

200
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:03,579
You know, where does the money come from?

201
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,021
It's always a deficit.

202
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:06,865
There doesn't have to be a war either.

203
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:10,471
We can just increase the military budget for no reason at all.

204
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:19,037
And that money is created by the federal government because the federal government is the only entity in the world that can create dollars.

205
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:19,777
Right.

206
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:27,680
So here's a takeaway point from this understanding the difference between us, the users of the dollar versus the federal government.

207
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,701
Every time I have a deficit, it's a problem.

208
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:33,522
Every time you have a deficit with your bank, it's a problem.

209
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,483
When your city has a deficit, they have to cut their spending.

210
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,154
When the state has a deficit, they have to cut their spending.

211
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:42,375
That's the prudent, reasonable thing to do, right?

212
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:45,216
When businesses have a deficit, they have to worry about it.

213
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:56,041
But when the federal government has a deficit, it simply means that it spent more dollars into the economy than what it has taxed out of the system.

214
00:15:56,461 --> 00:16:03,064
And that means that it created more dollars in the economy than it destroyed, right?

215
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,825
So it simply increased the amount of money in the economy.

216
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,556
So then the deficit, let's say it's a trillion dollar deficit to keep the numbers simple.

217
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:18,663
The deficit for the federal government, that $1 trillion that went into the system and hasn't been taxed yet, that's money available to the rest of us to use.

218
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:21,045
Now we didn't say anything about distribution.

219
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,047
Could be most of it is going to Bezos or Walmart or whatever.

220
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:35,857
That's a separate question, but it simply means the deficit for the federal government is the exact equivalent to the penny of the surplus that the rest of us users of the dollar have available to us collectively.

221
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:51,404
And the same with the debt, that's also true of the debt, like that the total amount, I've heard Warren Moser talk about this, that like the total amount of the national debt is equivalent to the net amount of dollars in savings in the world.

222
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:52,264
Exactly.

223
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:53,044
Exactly.

224
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:53,244
U.S.

225
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,686
dollars, right, available outside the U.S.

226
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:56,546
federal government system.

227
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,487
Yeah, absolutely.

228
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:09,498
That scary word that you and I are always the things that keep us awake at night, the deficit that we have, your credit card debt, your your personal debt, your student loan debt.

229
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:14,744
All those things come with that with that loaded psychological meaning of debt.

230
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:18,628
But then we use the same term to refer to the national debt.

231
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:24,073
And that's where you get those scary messages from politicians that say, we're broke, right?

232
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:34,738
You know, every child born in this country is, you know, has to pay, you know, $50,000 or $60,000 for the rest of their life to pay off the national debt.

233
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:38,499
Well, here's the thing about the national debt.

234
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:41,061
There were politicians, you know, throughout U.S.

235
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:46,583
history who always had this concern about the debt, that we're going bankrupt.

236
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,591
And we still have those politicians, obviously, to this day.

237
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:57,075
But there were six times in US history where Congress literally tried to pay off the national debt.

238
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,977
They were so concerned about it that they wanted to get rid of it completely.

239
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:03,920
And in some cases, they almost succeeded to bring it down to zero.

240
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,904
And every single time, six times, every single time they did that, we ended up immediately in a Great Depression.

241
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,359
Not a recession, not a small hiccup, a Great Depression.

242
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,780
The last time Congress tried to do this was 1929, which started the Great Depression.

243
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,502
So we know this for a fact, because what you're doing by paying off the national debt, you're literally sucking out money from the system.

244
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:31,102
You're extracting wealth from the population.

245
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,203
You're bringing the system to a halt.

246
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:35,683
Every time we do that.

247
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,604
So since then, we always have politicians talking about paying off the national debt.

248
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:55,249
but they know that they can't and they know they shouldn't, but they still use this, you know, quote unquote kitchen table conversation because it's so convenient to speak to your, to talk to your constituents about their economic struggle and say, vote for me.

249
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:00,570
I know what it's like to sit at the kitchen table and pay the bills and balance your checkbook vote for me.

250
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:05,291
And I'll go to DC and make the, I'll make the government just as responsible as you.

251
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:07,297
And that's the problem.

252
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:14,065
But imagine if a politician, if I'm running for office and I say, vote for me and I'll go to D.C.

253
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:21,113
and I'll make sure that the federal government has a surplus, which means you, the private sector, I'll make sure that you guys have a deficit.

254
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,070
Would anybody vote for somebody like that?

255
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,072
Of course not.

256
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:27,955
So is it fair to say that the debt, right?

257
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:33,281
I mean, the deficit is what each year, like the yearly difference, right?

258
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,223
The deficit is annual.

259
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,387
The national debt is the summation of all the previous years.

260
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,400
Right.

261
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:40,241
Right.

262
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:43,402
And so is it fair to say that the debt is the money supply?

263
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:46,864
I mean, money supply has its own sort of definitions.

264
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:47,304
Is that right?

265
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:47,605
Yeah.

266
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,606
There are other components of the money supply.

267
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:57,870
So maybe I should clarify here because somebody at some point will comment and say, well, well, a lot of the money created in the system doesn't come from the federal government.

268
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,191
That comes from private banks.

269
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:00,452
So let's get into that.

270
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:07,514
We in the MMT literature say that the government is the monopoly issuer of the currency.

271
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,615
We're talking about literally printing dollars.

272
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:10,595
Nobody can do that.

273
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:20,659
But the government, the federal government, gives licenses to private banks, their banking license, in order to operate legally as a bank.

274
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:28,082
And in that process, the federal government is essentially franchising its monopoly power

275
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,879
for money creation, not printing money, but money creation.

276
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:40,463
So every time a bank issues a loan to you or to me, it's actually creating new money into the system, not printing, but creating money.

277
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,264
These days it's digital.

278
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:54,331
And the legal documents that allow banks to do that and allow them to enforce the use of this new digital money or paper money or whatever,

279
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:57,026
is their banking license.

280
00:20:57,447 --> 00:21:01,809
So when you buy a house, when you get a loan to buy a house or buy a car, you sign a lot of paperwork, right?

281
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,050
They say sign here, initial here, sign here, initial here.

282
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:23,621
There's one document, that's the most important document in this process, which is something called the promissory note, which essentially says, just like the title of the paper says, it's a promissory note, which means I promise to pay you back $200,000, right, for the loan that I'm getting today, plus interest and all that.

283
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:36,320
As the bank is creating this two hundred thousand dollar loan to me the customer they're doing two things from an accounting perspective on the asset side of their books.

284
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,981
They have an asset.

285
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:44,747
Now the bank has an asset which is that promissory note that says I owe you two hundred thousand dollars plus interest.

286
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,249
That's something that the bank

287
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,410
counts on its books as real money, as an asset, right?

288
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,211
They can go to court and they can go after me and get the $200,000, right?

289
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:59,372
But on the liability side, what's the bank liable for?

290
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:07,253
They just created a bank account for me and they deposited $200,000 in it so I can actually buy the house or buy the car or start the business or whatever.

291
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:14,255
So what they've done is start from zero and increase their liabilities and their assets by $200,000 at the same time.

292
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,834
which means their books are still balanced.

293
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:29,778
Now tell me what's stopping them from making that loan instead of 200,000, making it 300,000, 500,000, nothing in terms of the mechanics of creating the loan.

294
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:38,942
But their responsibility is not just to inflate the value of my loan and let me buy the most expensive house that I can't afford their job.

295
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:40,963
And that's their responsibility.

296
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:45,865
That's why they have a banking license and they're regulated is to serve the public purpose, which is to,

297
00:22:46,486 --> 00:23:00,049
finance the creation of jobs, the building of homes, the purchasing of homes for individuals and so on, which means their job is not just to sign those documents and increase the amounts.

298
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:10,831
Their job is to make sure that I'm actually able to afford that house, that I actually have a stable job and have a track record that allows me to finance that house over the next 30 years and so on.

299
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,332
So that's their due diligence.

300
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:13,772
That's their responsibility.

301
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:21,439
But, you know, as we've known from the 2008 experience, they have the capacity to create those loans.

302
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:29,965
So they create them and they get you into trouble by forcing you to buy an overinflated, overpriced home and so on.

303
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,246
And that's what got us into the 2008 crisis.

304
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:41,473
But also, it gives them the capacity to finance all kinds of other speculative behavior with other financial institutions.

305
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,414
And that's really the problem.

306
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:53,831
So the problem is not the fact that banks can create money, because we want to finance homes and education and so on, but we don't want that to be speculative.

307
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:55,172
We want it to be productive.

308
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:57,214
We want it to serve the public purpose.

309
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:01,097
So that's something to recognize.

310
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:07,899
And just like the government gives them a license to operate under those rules, the government can take that license away from them.

311
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,160
The government can give that license, by the way, to the post office.

312
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,561
It can give it to a public bank.

313
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:19,162
It can give it to another financial institution that serves the public purpose, right?

314
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:23,623
Because we don't want the federal government to micromanage every single home loan, right?

315
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:27,204
We want to franchise that bureaucratic role

316
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,942
to people in local communities who know the needs and have better information and can deal with the logistics.

317
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:38,683
But there's nothing that says it has to be Bank of America.

318
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,584
It can be a community development bank.

319
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:47,686
It can be any other legal entity that follows the rules and serves the public purpose.

320
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:54,948
So to clarify that the federal government is the ultimate authority that creates the currency,

321
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,849
but it licenses the right to create money to other private agents, right?

322
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,780
Those agents of the government, of the federal government, we call them banks, but they can be a post office, right?

323
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,082
Yeah.

324
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:24,706
So another question, because I know part of what excites me and a lot of other people about this idea is the things that we could do, the things that we could afford, and how it affects those things.

325
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:32,629
And I know a lot of people are interested in the question of inflation and how that, once we realize

326
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:56,531
that there really is no problem with the federal government creating money, right, spending money or creating money, that we can afford these things and we don't have to say for Medicare for all, we don't have to say how can we pay for that, we never have to say that.

327
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:59,913
So now the real question becomes inflation.

328
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:17,157
And so I'd love for you to talk about maybe the jobs guarantee and or Medicare for all and or other programs that we could be spending more on, maybe, you know, college debt and how that kind of intersects with inflation.

329
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:19,138
Very good question.

330
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:26,600
So before I get into the things that we can afford, let me talk about the things that we can't afford.

331
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,965
And my main message is that the status quo, the current system is already too expensive.

332
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,887
That's the part that we can't afford.

333
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:42,351
And what we're proposing, things like the Green New Deal or Medicare for All or a job guarantee, these are actually the cheaper, healthier options.

334
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,693
That's how we shift the narrative.

335
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,276
So we already spent trillions of dollars on the opioid crisis.

336
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:57,683
We spent hundreds of billions of dollars building prisons and dealing with, you know, the negative effects of unemployment and juvenile issues and so on.

337
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,105
Wouldn't we rather spend the money on after-school programs,

338
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:11,742
early childhood education on summer camps to inspire kids with music and theater and sports or not do that because it's too expensive and then end up building prisons for those same kids.

339
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:17,486
who didn't have the opportunities growing up in middle school and high school and beyond.

340
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:33,551
Wouldn't we rather clean up the water source with clean energy and so on or not do that and then end up paying 10 times the cost in financial terms, but in also quality of life for cancer treatment and breathing treatments and things like that.

341
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:38,172
So that's the first step is recognizing that we can't afford this.

342
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,859
But what we're introducing are actually the cheaper version.

343
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:43,000
So that's point number one.

344
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,861
Point number two related to inflation.

345
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:55,830
All the people who worry about inflation, by the way, you know, I'm sorry, but the last, you know, 12 years, every single central bank around the world, the ECB, the U.S.

346
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:02,235
Fed and Bank of Canada, Australia, all of them have been targeting inflation at 2 percent.

347
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:05,237
And they used every trick in the textbook, literally.

348
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:07,336
to bring inflation to that level.

349
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:08,658
They call it inflation targeting.

350
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:09,859
And they fail miserably.

351
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:10,619
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:19,988
To bring inflation up from close to zero, which will be a deflation, kind of slippery slope into a great depression, to bring it to 2 percent.

353
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:22,370
And I'm glad you had that reaction.

354
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,150
I'll come back to it.

355
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,171
Because people are surprised.

356
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:24,371
What?

357
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,753
They're trying to raise inflation?

358
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:26,873
Yes.

359
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:29,134
So I'll come back to that point.

360
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:38,199
So they're trying to raise inflation from almost zero to 2 percent because below zero is a slippery slope into a Great Depression which is counterintuitive.

361
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,219
I'll come back to that point.

362
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,681
But let's say they know what they're doing and they need it to be at 2 percent.

363
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,483
They used every trick in the textbook to raise inflation to 2 percent and they couldn't.

364
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,852
Which means their theory of what causes inflation is completely unreliable.

365
00:28:54,252 --> 00:28:55,272
And it's not me saying it.

366
00:28:55,432 --> 00:29:01,854
They finally came out one after the other, all the major central banks, and they admitted, we have no reliable theory of inflation.

367
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:05,956
In other words, in plain English, we don't actually know what causes inflation.

368
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:09,697
Or we don't know what we're doing in the central bank.

369
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:12,698
So that's point number one.

370
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:13,458
Point number two.

371
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:15,599
which, which was your reaction.

372
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,160
And I think your listeners reaction is what they're trying to raise inflation.

373
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,801
I can't afford health care.

374
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:22,281
I can't afford education.

375
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:26,543
So this is where the MMT analysis of inflation comes in.

376
00:29:27,003 --> 00:29:35,447
So when you look at the numbers, you realize that yes, the actual inflation rate is below 2%, but that's the average.

377
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:38,648
You know, nobody pays the average for their, for their bills.

378
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,210
You pay actual bills for health insurance, for transportation, for housing,

379
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:48,538
And I'm mentioning these because these are actually the main drivers of inflation, which guess what?

380
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:50,801
Most economists don't pay attention to.

381
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:55,448
But you and I pay the bills and know what actually what's what's causing the pain in your budget.

382
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,413
It's housing, it's energy and transportation.

383
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,475
It's healthcare and it's higher education.

384
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:04,177
These are the top four, but there are others, obviously.

385
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:16,586
But it turns out in the inflation index, which is the average price for the economy, there are so many other things that are deflating because we're importing cheap plastics from developing countries and so on.

386
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:19,808
And there's, you know, technology is getting cheaper.

387
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:23,089
Food, you know, sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down.

388
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:25,509
But there are other factors that are deflating.

389
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,970
Think of plastic toys.

390
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,211
But all of these four things that I mentioned are inflating.

391
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:34,272
And they average out to that number, 1.5 percent or whatever it is.

392
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:39,913
So, of course, you and I are concerned about health and education and those things.

393
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,474
But the central bank, the Fed, is concerned about the average.

394
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,855
And they're not concerned about how you're going to pay for that health insurance bill and so on.

395
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:57,371
So let me bring you to the MMT approach to how do we pay for all of these things that we want without causing inflation, without bankrupting the country.

396
00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:11,582
So MMT is essentially saying the federal government has a spending capacity that's much larger than what most economists think, because most economists think it's limited by tax revenues.

397
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:21,386
And it's limited by borrowing capacity, just like states and municipalities, just like you and I. MMT is saying, no, no, no, it's much larger than that, but it's not unlimited.

398
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:25,368
Just in case the signal cut out, it's not unlimited.

399
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:26,248
I'm saying it again.

400
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:34,152
It's limited by the risk of inflation, which means we need to figure out what determines that risk of inflation.

401
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:35,772
And MMT has an answer.

402
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,974
The risk of inflation is determined by two things.

403
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:51,362
One is the availability of productive capacity, meaning do we have the skilled people, the engineering capacity, the raw materials, the machines to produce things?

404
00:31:51,982 --> 00:31:57,144
So if the demand for housing goes up, do we have enough resources to build more housing?

405
00:31:57,464 --> 00:32:03,746
If the answer is yes, then we can increase spending on housing without causing inflation in housing.

406
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:08,208
But if we physically ran out of raw materials and skilled people to build homes,

407
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:10,249
But more people want to buy homes.

408
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,570
The price will go up and that will cause inflation.

409
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,313
So think of this across the board in all areas of spending in the economy.

410
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:29,079
Obviously there are some pockets of the economy where we have shortages of skills or resources or technology and some areas where we have plenty of room to spend without causing prices to go up which means

411
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:35,523
that risk of inflation can be dealt with, with strategic planning and strategic spending.

412
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:42,466
The good news about shortage of productive capacity, we can train people, we can build resources.

413
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,427
So resources are producible in that sense.

414
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:49,348
So that's the easy part to plan for and to organize for.

415
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:52,329
And by the way, I'm gonna let you go on in a second.

416
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,530
We do have a question from the audience, so.

417
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:55,974
Wonderful.

418
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:57,935
If you want to keep going, then we'll come back.

419
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,836
I'll do this and then I'll take the question.

420
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:09,100
So the second risk of inflation has to do with prices going up in certain areas of the economy because we have too much market power.

421
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:11,261
So think of your health insurance companies.

422
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:12,782
Why do they raise prices?

423
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:13,863
Because they can.

424
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:15,764
In other words, because we let them.

425
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:17,745
Think of energy companies.

426
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,105
Think of real estate companies.

427
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:20,126
Why do they raise prices?

428
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:22,627
Because they can, because they dominate the market.

429
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:24,928
So that kind of inflation risk

430
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:27,796
It's not going to go away by spending less.

431
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:33,462
It only goes away if you tax and regulate that market power out of existence.

432
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:37,947
In other words you make those markets more democratic more competitive.

433
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:44,555
And if you do that if we're successful at doing that then all of a sudden we've just increased our spending capacity.

434
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:51,386
quite a lot, which means we can now afford more of an ambitious Green New Deal or healthcare program.

435
00:33:51,767 --> 00:34:12,478
But if we can't, if we leave the risk of inflation where it is, by not building more capacity, by not training more people, and by not taxing and regulating that market power, then we keep that fiscal spending space very limited and say, oh, it's too bad, we can't afford it because big pharma didn't let us and the super PACs didn't let us.

436
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:18,074
My final point here is that it's those 535 people we elect in D.C.

437
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:21,897
whose responsibility is to tax and regulate that market power.

438
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:25,720
Are they going to bite the hands that feed them?

439
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,623
If they're brought to you by super PACs, then we don't have a democracy.

440
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:34,125
We don't have a government of the people by the people for the people.

441
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:36,567
We have a government of the super PACs for the super PACs.

442
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:45,090
And that's really the crux of the MMT approach, that it's not just a technical kind of economic policy program.

443
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:51,257
It shines the light on the institutional structure of the economy.

444
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:55,001
And that institutional structure includes politics, includes the legal framework.

445
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:58,145
That's why we call them lawmakers, because they make the laws.

446
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:58,845
right?

447
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:08,011
And if we are not going to be able to redesign the system to be more equitable, to be more sustainable, unless we redesign the institutional mechanism.

448
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:13,555
So there's no way to avoid the political fight in this.

449
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:22,821
And what we're trying to do in the MMT community is educate, empower, inform people so that they can mobilize to push back against those

450
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:35,871
structures, because otherwise, we literally don't have a democracy, which means we're not going to afford a Green New Deal with an oligarchy in charge of how government finances operate.

451
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:36,712
Yeah.

452
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:38,072
Wow.

453
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:41,094
OK, so let's go ahead and do a question.

454
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:43,115
This one is from Frank Lee.

455
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:51,159
And the question is, why has there been such low inflation despite the massive money creation responding to 2008 and responding to COVID?

456
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,313
Right, because that's exactly the point.

457
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:04,058
We have this mainstream theory or mainstream myth that says more money spending leads to inflation.

458
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:05,919
And that's precisely the point.

459
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:14,804
I mean, look at Japan, almost three decades of massive quantitative easing and large fiscal deficits and no inflation.

460
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:18,887
They actually have deflation, right, which is the main problem that they have.

461
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:21,844
And Japan, for decades, the U.S.

462
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:30,411
has done it since 2008, the ECB, the Bank of Canada, all of these central banks, that's what I meant when I said that they tried every trick in the textbook, right?

463
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:32,733
It says printing money will cause inflation.

464
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:34,875
Well, that's not what causes inflation.

465
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:42,542
What causes inflation is when you run out of productive capacity, if you're spending in ways that actually increase

466
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:51,295
consumer spending and consumer demand in key areas, or if you have too much market power and market concentration.

467
00:36:52,376 --> 00:37:00,181
But we've been doing this for decades without pushing that risk of inflation when it comes to market power.

468
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:01,162
So what do we end up with?

469
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:08,967
We end up with austerity, with no job creation and more market power for big pharma and health insurance companies.

470
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:11,769
So we end up with the short end of the stick on both sides.

471
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:14,665
And then we end up in a stagnation.

472
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,067
Japan has been stuck in a stagnation like this.

473
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:25,317
So with the fraction of the dollar amount that was dedicated to QE, for example, all the QE since 2008, we could have

474
00:37:27,344 --> 00:37:31,345
paid for a job guarantee program, a green job guarantee program.

475
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:38,446
We could have moved away from the current healthcare system into a more universal healthcare system.

476
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:41,547
We could have done so much more at a fraction of this.

477
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:51,929
And when you look at how much money was dedicated to monetary policy, quantitative easing, trillions of dollars, literally, and that recovery from 2008 until we hit the pandemic,

478
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:58,914
was slow and painful for the majority of people, right?

479
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:05,715
Most people by 2015, 2016, most people when you ask them, they literally think that the recession is still happening.

480
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:13,736
When technically the recession ended, you know, in less than two years, you know, 18 months, the recession was over, and it was already called the recovery.

481
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:23,518
But as my colleague, Pavlina Chernova and her work demonstrated, that that recovery was the worst in terms of income distribution.

482
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:33,899
And what her work showed is that during the recovery, not the recession of 2008, during the recovery, most of the gains of the recovery went to the top 10%.

483
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,422
And the bottom 10% actually lost ground during the recovery, not just during the crisis.

484
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:42,002
During the crisis, everybody lost.

485
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:47,184
But during the recovery, the bottom 90% of Americans were still losing ground.

486
00:38:48,805 --> 00:39:01,969
And this seems like it's related to the inflation deflation problem, that if all the money being spent goes to the 1% who are not going to buy more consumer goods, then it doesn't help

487
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:11,137
bring inflation up, which is apparently I didn't know this is what people are trying to do now because their inflation is not for normal consumer goods.

488
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:12,937
There isn't enough demand.

489
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:13,997
Does that sound right?

490
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:16,958
Well, most consumers are in debt.

491
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,438
So what do they do with their income?

492
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:20,879
They pay interest and they pay late fees.

493
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:25,120
And that shows up on, you know, in terms of economic growth as GDP.

494
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:25,940
Right.

495
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,341
So it's celebrated on TV that the economy grew by five percent because we all paid five percent interest.

496
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,893
which perpetuates this fiction of economic growth.

497
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:46,439
But is it really improving quality of life or is it just, you know, like we're living in medieval Europe and we're paying rent to the landlords, right?

498
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,441
Which is an interesting way to think about it.

499
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:57,686
But to go back to those four areas of inflation, I think, because people will be interested in this, it has to do with market power.

500
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:03,474
So I think the obvious one is the health care industry, pharmaceutical industry and health insurance.

501
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:04,314
I think we all know it.

502
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:06,756
They just raise your premium by 20 percent because they can.

503
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:08,697
And there's nothing you can do to negotiate.

504
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:09,758
And we know this.

505
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:10,859
Employers have to pay it.

506
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:11,659
You have to pay it.

507
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:12,960
It's a problem.

508
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,181
Right.

509
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:20,425
The when it comes to you know, that's why the Green New Deal, by the way, includes those four areas.

510
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:21,746
It's not by accident.

511
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:24,328
It's not like the favorite shopping list of the progressives.

512
00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:32,370
We include those areas because those areas need to be democratized and they need to have additional productive capacity built in.

513
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:40,216
So additional hospital beds and additional nursing and doctors and so on, in terms of staffing capabilities.

514
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:52,467
So those four areas, they have that exclusive market power, which not only allows them to raise prices, but allows them to essentially set quotas and exclude people from services.

515
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:54,543
We exclude people from higher education.

516
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:56,164
We exclude people from health.

517
00:40:56,564 --> 00:41:00,687
We exclude people from literally access to affordable energy.

518
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:13,634
We have energy poverty in the United States, especially the northern states where you are, where states and municipalities literally have to subsidize heating bills for the lowest income members of the community in the wintertime.

519
00:41:14,295 --> 00:41:16,916
Otherwise, they literally die of cold.

520
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:18,557
And we have heat strokes in the summer.

521
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:21,119
So it works both ways for the weather.

522
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:25,148
So this is what we mean by socioeconomic exclusion.

523
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:31,231
We're setting prices high to exclude people without offering a public option.

524
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:41,215
So the Green New Deal will decarbonize, which means we produce affordable, renewable energy and create millions of jobs, good paying jobs in doing that.

525
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:48,818
We're introducing Medicare for all to eliminate the price setting behavior and eliminate the inefficiency

526
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:53,030
and increase the provisioning of healthcare to people who need it.

527
00:41:53,350 --> 00:42:04,276
And by the way, it's cheaper to do the preventative than not do the preventative and then end up with a heart surgery, with diabetes, which again, the current system is too expensive and too exclusive.

528
00:42:04,616 --> 00:42:08,958
We want it to be more affordable and more inclusive for everybody.

529
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,500
Higher education is tricky.

530
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,223
And I teach in this system, so I'm aware of, so this has to do

531
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,141
with two things.

532
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:33,915
Higher education inflation has been happening over the last two or three decades, primarily because of spending cuts from states that normally support state universities, state schools.

533
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:40,581
So when those schools receive fewer dollars from state authorities, they have to raise tuition.

534
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,303
And by raising tuition,

535
00:42:42,705 --> 00:42:48,187
They open the floodgates for private schools to raise their tuition, too, because they're in the same market.

536
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:48,587
Right.

537
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,628
So that's that's element number one.

538
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,648
It's not the only thing.

539
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:58,870
But most of the cost that universities deal with includes the cost of health care for their staff, which is massive.

540
00:42:59,290 --> 00:42:59,750
Wow.

541
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:04,372
So when we have health care price inflation,

542
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,850
higher education also gets more expensive, just like any other business, right?

543
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:20,356
Which is why a Medicare for All program would reduce the cost of health care for all businesses, including universities, and lower the cost of even private school education, not just state schools.

544
00:43:20,977 --> 00:43:30,522
Number three, universities over the last three decades, especially private schools, have been competing for students with nicer buildings and swimming pools and gymnasiums.

545
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:32,363
And so cost of construction

546
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,959
is massive.

547
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,582
Cost of heating and cooling buildings is massive.

548
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:43,486
So when you decarbonize, when you produce renewable energy, you're also reducing that cost.

549
00:43:44,027 --> 00:43:49,011
And when you reduce the cost of healthcare on construction companies, well, guess what?

550
00:43:49,471 --> 00:43:51,513
The cost of construction will also go down.

551
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:53,554
So all of these things are intertwined.

552
00:43:54,215 --> 00:44:00,620
And what we've been doing over the last three decades is pushing that burden on families.

553
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:20,653
And that's why we have a student debt crisis, which is the craziest thing that a society can do to its young people is to set them up for failure on day one of their adult productive life and say, for the next 20 years, we'll be garnishing your wages essentially.

554
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,654
So you're not gonna be able to afford

555
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:35,504
a house or, you know, a car or start a business, you're strapped with debt or start a family and so on.

556
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:40,765
So a lot of we've been calling for debt cancellation, student debt cancellation.

557
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:54,587
And there's a study at the Levy Economics Institute by many of my colleagues, including Stephanie Kelton and Scott Fulweiler and so on, that essentially show that it's a net benefit for the entire country, not just for the individuals

558
00:44:55,268 --> 00:44:56,389
that we cancel the debt for.

559
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:57,509
It's a net benefit.

560
00:44:57,549 --> 00:44:58,429
It's a no-brainer.

561
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,731
And it's, let's be clear, it's called debt cancellation.

562
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,693
I hear some friends who call it debt forgiveness.

563
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:11,435
Nobody has done anything wrong by going to college to be forgiven for.

564
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:12,956
It's debt cancellation.

565
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:22,760
If anything, we should thank people for getting the skills and knowledge to build the future of this country, of this economy.

566
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,015
We should be grateful.

567
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:31,910
We shouldn't be calling it forgiveness like they've done anything wrong and need to be punished for the next 20 years of their lives.

568
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:32,792
Yeah.

569
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:34,675
Yeah.

570
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:38,223
So, wow, I think we could talk for hours and hours.

571
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:41,783
It would be amazing.

572
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:46,164
It's such a deep, deep subject, really.

573
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:58,747
And I think hard for, you know, when I first learned about it, just wrapping my head around it, it took me hours and hours of listening to all sorts of different MMT people give lectures and reading and everything.

574
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:02,430
I hope we can do more.

575
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,892
Let us know how we can help get the word out.

576
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,573
We're going to certainly do our best to get the word out here.

577
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:15,055
I just want to ask you if you have any final words.

578
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:19,257
We don't have a specific time limit, but we try to keep it under around 45-50 minutes.

579
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:23,179
What are your thoughts maybe on what are our next steps?

580
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:40,230
So next steps, the way you described it is that it's like you have to unlearn so much of the standard understanding that we've had for years.

581
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:46,314
So I completely honor and understand and acknowledge that for listeners who are new to this.

582
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:52,298
And it's not like a switch is going to turn on and all of a sudden you have all the answers.

583
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:56,299
It takes some effort, some engagement, but this is really what democracy is about.

584
00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:10,771
If we let the 1%, if we let the 535 people run the show based on what they tell us is affordable, then I guess we just go home and tell them, well, I guess you know what you're doing, we'll trust you.

585
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:18,757
And we're saying there is a better world that's more sustainable, that's equitable, that's just, and it's within reach.

586
00:47:19,778 --> 00:47:21,800
We're not talking about the impossible, it's within reach.

587
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:46,829
So what my work has been about and many of my colleagues is really explaining, providing the education, empowering people with knowledge, with information, and mobilizing people to learn and introduce this to their neighbors and to mobilize and organize for this change that's within reach.

588
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:51,773
So to encourage people to reach out to members of the MMT community.

589
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:56,519
I'm not the only one coming up with these ideas.

590
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,342
I'm a small contributor in this space.

591
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:07,021
but reach out and follow people like Stephanie Kelton, like Pavlina Cherneva, like, oh, there you go, the deficit.

592
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:09,202
I just finished it this morning.

593
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:11,103
Stephanie's wonderful book.

594
00:48:12,563 --> 00:48:19,187
And all of us are accessible on social media, on Twitter in particular, but Facebook and LinkedIn as well.

595
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:28,612
Follow the Modern Money Network, follow Real Progressives, follow Our Money, which is another organization in this space.

596
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:36,336
Tons and tons of podcasts, Macro and Cheese here in the US, the MMT podcast in the UK.

597
00:48:37,177 --> 00:48:43,340
And I'm probably going to get in trouble by forgetting so many other wonderful podcasts and programs.

598
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:55,367
But I think one wonderful place to get kind of the hub of all of these links is a website called WeCanHaveNiceThings.com, I think.

599
00:48:55,387 --> 00:48:57,028
If you just Google it, you'll find it.

600
00:48:57,248 --> 00:48:58,009
It has links to

601
00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:06,852
everybody's work and things to read and short op-eds, academic stuff, but also videos and podcasts and things like that.

602
00:49:06,892 --> 00:49:16,597
So there's tons of stuff to learn from and to engage with, and we're happy to answer questions and engage in more conversations.

603
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:18,108
Wonderful.

604
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:21,110
Hey, Fadal Kaboob, thank you so much.

605
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,872
Wonderful to chat with you.

606
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,953
Thanks so much for the work that you're doing.

607
00:49:26,194 --> 00:49:27,655
And thanks everyone for tuning in.

608
