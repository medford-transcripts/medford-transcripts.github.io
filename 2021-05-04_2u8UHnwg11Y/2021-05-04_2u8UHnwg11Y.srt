00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:11,277
[SPEAKER_13]: But I bought my house here in West Medford in 98.

66
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,737
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm a specialist teacher, right?

67
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:17,538
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means I see all the kids every week, okay, all the kids.

[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 28 Douglas Road, and I was a student at the Columbus School from 2012 to 2018.

87
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently in eighth grade at the McLean Middle School.

88
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:29,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

89
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:35,605
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I wanna get started.

90
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have a job ahead of us.

91
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:56,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously everybody knows this has been a divisive thing in Medford and I hope that we can come up with three names that will do a presentation at the end to the school committee that will help to heal Medford, bring us all back together.

92
00:05:56,234 --> 00:06:01,336
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope that there's a naming ceremony and that there's a lot of people there

93
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,783
[SPEAKER_10]: we do some good work here and hopefully the right name comes out of this and they pick us.

94
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:22,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to read the advisory committee selection as kind of a guideline of what we're gonna go by here.

95
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:37,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Pardon me, it's gonna be three pages, so it's gonna take me a few minutes here, but the individuals up to three selected by the school committee staff, Principal Kathy Kaye and one MHS student member will be announced.

96
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Each school committee member will select two members.

97
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,084
[SPEAKER_10]: You all know this, but I'll breeze through that.

98
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Participation by the Columbus School staff and students.

99
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Work of the advisory committee, okay.

100
00:06:55,239 --> 00:07:02,661
[SPEAKER_10]: At the April 26th committee of the whole meeting, a list of names submitted for consideration will be made public and forwarded to the advisory committee.

101
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:15,365
[SPEAKER_10]: A file containing emails from the community members on topics of the renaming will be made available to the advisory committee members so that the advisory committee members all are aware of the opinions and concerns expressed by our community.

102
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:20,627
[SPEAKER_10]: So everybody should have gotten that Google file with all those letters and had a chance to look through them.

103
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:24,742
[SPEAKER_10]: The advisory committee will develop criteria for evaluating the names.

104
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:32,383
[SPEAKER_10]: The advisory committee will determine the process for vetting the names, narrowing the field and submitting no more than three finalists to the school committee.

105
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:40,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Press relations will be directed through the advisory committee chair and members of the advisory committee are urged to send press contacts to the chair.

106
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:47,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Advisory committee meetings are public meetings and must follow all requirements of meeting law.

107
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,844
[SPEAKER_10]: The superintendent will provide a note taker and create minutes.

108
00:07:53,424 --> 00:08:04,049
[SPEAKER_10]: It is expected that the advisory committee will need to meet three to five times and a majority of voting members will be required to reach a quorum for the meeting.

109
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:17,235
[SPEAKER_10]: The advisory committee will hold at least one public hearing or issue one public input survey to solicit the feedback on the options they are considering per the charge of this resolution.

110
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,574
[SPEAKER_10]: as at least one of their meetings.

111
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:33,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Advisory committee members may withdraw from participation by notifying the chair and will not be counted in subsequent quorum or voting requirements.

112
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:38,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Removal of a member is permitted by a majority vote of the advisory committee.

113
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:44,090
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair will notify the remaining members of the advisory committee of the reduction in membership.

114
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,153
[SPEAKER_10]: No new members will be added to the advisory committee due to vacancies.

115
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:59,347
[SPEAKER_10]: While consensus is always preferred, a simple majority of the total number of advisory committee members will be required to select up to three names that will be forwarded to the school committee.

116
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:08,995
[SPEAKER_10]: A major vote, a majority vote of the total number of committee members and not a vote of the quorum present is required for this vote.

117
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:15,700
[SPEAKER_10]: The advisory committee will present their recommendation for the new names of the Columbus Elementary School no later than May 24th, 2021.

118
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:24,482
[SPEAKER_10]: A presentation will be given explaining the way the recommendations was arrived at and why the selected names were chosen.

119
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:31,725
[SPEAKER_10]: If a majority of the advisory committee votes to recommend the timeline change to the school committee, they may do so.

120
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:40,509
[SPEAKER_10]: At the time the school committee will vote to approve or decline this recommendation, timeline changes shall not exceed a final date of July 31st.

121
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:40,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Once

122
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,440
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford School Committee has received the names and presentations.

123
00:09:48,460 --> 00:10:02,950
[SPEAKER_10]: The committee will vote either that evening or subsequent meeting not later than June 7th, 2021 to approve the recommendation given the authority for naming public school buildings at school committees authority law per Massachusetts General Law.

124
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:12,857
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so, and then I have one more page here.

125
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:18,751
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a rubrics on it that the school committee forwarded to me.

[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the advisory committee must narrow the field of names to three finalists by May 24th, 2021.

135
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,461

[SPEAKER_10]: The advisory committee conducts additional research and solicits public input.

141
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:01,933

00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,214
[SPEAKER_10]: to mention public input and research.

146
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:31,537
[SPEAKER_10]: While consensus has not been reached, the chair will ask dissenting members to state their concerns for additional discussion.

147
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:38,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Discussion continues until consensus has been reached or the advisory committee acknowledges that consensus will not be reached.

148
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,322
[SPEAKER_10]: The remaining names are selected by simple majority vote.

149
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,874
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that was, those are the guidelines that we're gonna try and go by.

150
00:12:52,894 --> 00:13:00,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna interpret them to work for us.

151
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:12,931
[SPEAKER_08]: But then, anybody have any questions on that, on those?

152
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Did everybody got those pages?

153
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:27,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, our goal here is to shorten this list first, and then we'll get into some deep discussions about who we have left on the list.

154
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:37,181
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I would imagine we would use this rubrics to take, break off into groups here and do some research on all of our candidates.

155
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:44,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ask everybody to please have an open mind and listen to each other's when we get to speaking about

156
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:48,668
[SPEAKER_10]: the candidates that we have conversation.

157
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:58,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I know everybody has their own favorite maybe to begin with, but this is about MedFed.

158
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,076
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not about what anybody individually wants.

159
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:05,538
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what's gonna be right for that school going forward.

160
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have an opportunity here to heal any wounds and move forward.

161
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

162
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a couple of things on the housekeeping here.

163
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:29,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to just get, there was, I saw on the agenda, someone put forth a resolution and we won't be entertaining any resolutions at this point.

164
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:31,357
[SPEAKER_10]: They're out of order.

165
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,079
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a subcommittee to a committee.

166
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,220
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been given our directive.

167
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:38,523
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not gonna change our directive.

168
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,345
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have the authority to do that.

169
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

170
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to get to the list, I guess, if anybody has any questions.

171
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:58,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I had, let me say this, I had sent a list to Susan to put on and it wasn't, it was labeled a ranking and it wasn't a ranking, it's a tally.

172
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:09,544
[SPEAKER_10]: And it merely cut the list down from four or five pages to two pages and tallied up next to the name, how many submissions,

173
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:13,462
[SPEAKER_10]: they received through that first survey process.

174
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't want to say there was any ranking there.

175
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:26,488
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that the woman in my office that I had put it together, put the most at the top and then the rest at the bottom are in alphabetical order.

176
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:32,030
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to go to the second page of that.

177
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,672
[SPEAKER_10]: From there, I mean, one of the,

178
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,401
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, people have been trying to get your attention.

179
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,222
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if you'd like us to raise our hand.

180
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:43,124
[SPEAKER_18]: I see Grace raising her hand.

181
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:44,445
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm using the function.

182
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,107
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know which way you'd like us to.

183
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:46,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

184
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:47,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

185
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

186
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:51,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Grace was first.

187
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:51,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

188
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:53,473
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

189
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:53,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

190
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:54,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Grace.

191
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:56,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Grace, you're muted.

192
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,337
[SPEAKER_18]: She can't unmute.

193
00:15:58,898 --> 00:15:59,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

194
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

195
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Grace.

196
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm not a host, so I couldn't unmute myself.

197
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:17,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a point of information, the rubric you read was the resolution I submitted, I believe.

198
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:22,506
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could have some clarification on that, it'd be great.

199
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,327
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was given to me as part of the school committee.

200
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,069
[SPEAKER_10]: That was something you submitted after the fact?

201
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:34,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I like that.

202
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:35,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's, you want to.

203
00:16:38,348 --> 00:17:00,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I submitted it as the fourth part of our agenda today as a selection for the following criteria to evaluate names since we weren't really handed, we were handed some vague stuff, but I broke it out into the rubric and submitted it as a resolution today.

204
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:02,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I didn't take it as a resolution.

205
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:05,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I took it as it came to me from the school committee.

206
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,801
[SPEAKER_10]: because it was an added on to that.

207
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:19,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so everyone had a chance to look at that, that rubric.

208
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:25,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to me, I wanna go through these names and eliminate who we can.

209
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:35,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when we get to the people that we wanna discuss that are credible, we'll use the rubric.

210
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:42,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, I thought that the agenda said that today's task was to develop the criteria.

211
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,665
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thought that we would be discussing the rubric.

212
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,387
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I have some thoughts and the other people have some thoughts as well.

213
00:17:53,209 --> 00:18:01,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that, are we going straight to the names or I thought that- No, I was under the impression for what I was given is we had a directive.

214
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,037
[SPEAKER_10]: We weren't gonna develop any more criteria.

215
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:04,978
[SPEAKER_10]: We had criteria.

216
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:06,816
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sorry.

217
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,337
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go back to the resolution.

218
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:17,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just pull up the or somebody else has a handy the text of the resolution of the of the mandate from the school committees that we are supposed to come up with a criteria.

219
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:18,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody please correct me.

220
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:22,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I just read that.

221
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:23,324
[SPEAKER_19]: That's correct.

222
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,205
[SPEAKER_19]: We are to come up with the criteria.

223
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:27,886
[SPEAKER_19]: We are not to be given the criteria.

224
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

225
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:38,274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so as a point of order, Jim, are we using Robert's Rules of Order to run the meeting?

226
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:45,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So the format of- We are, but I'm loosely with the Robert's Rules.

227
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:50,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if we have to raise hands and sit everybody back, this is a committee meeting.

228
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,883
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not open to the public.

229
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:57,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll, you know, everybody's been made a co-host so they can unmute themselves and speak.

230
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:06,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just the, so I guess the proper format then would be for somebody to make a motion to- Yeah, we're gonna get to that.

231
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: What was brought forward and then we can have the discussion.

232
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:27,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was gonna get to that on a rubric, but now I was, I guess I'm gonna see if everybody wants to, has their say about the format that we're gonna be choosing by, I mean- Point of information, please.

233
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:27,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

234
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:31,018
[SPEAKER_21]: First, this is a public meeting.

235
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,220
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there are a lot of people besides the committee on here.

236
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but the public isn't going to speak here.

237
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,444
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I understand, but we are open meeting.

238
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:46,069
[SPEAKER_21]: My understanding, I think Dr. Grace did a great job of coming up and getting this started by

239
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,752
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I believe it was her who wrote this resolution.

240
00:19:49,772 --> 00:20:03,187
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a discussion, I mean this is kind of like a very big turning point of where we're going by setting up this criteria I'd like to, I'd like to have an opportunity to express some thoughts I have on it.

241
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:10,870
[SPEAKER_21]: And once we decide on that, I think it would be a lot easier to go through these names, knowing what our criteria is.

242
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:17,571
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just think that, you know, this is why we're here is to have a discussion about the criteria for us.

243
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:25,093
[SPEAKER_10]: So if, you know, if I'm sorry, if I was under the assumption, the criteria was given to us.

244
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:33,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, the role of the when we were assigned, we were giving a basic not not limiting to guideline.

245
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:36,837
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think, I think, Dr. Grace has done.

246
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:45,841
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, if I could, I suggest that Dr. Grace explain her thoughts on where the proposal came from, whether it's a resolution or proposal, whatever you want to call it.

247
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:57,630
[SPEAKER_21]: And then some of us who have thoughts on it may have a chance to discuss that and start a debate as to, and hopefully at the end of all of that, we do have a plan with set timelines.

248
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:06,117
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we're tied up against timelines, but I think this is a very crucial point of the process is this setting the tone for the future.

249
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:09,960
[SPEAKER_21]: So I yield to Dr. Grace if she'd like to speak.

250
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

251
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:13,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ron.

252
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'll be happy to introduce this.

253
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

254
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:28,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I submitted this resolution because I recognize that as a committee, we have a lot of names that we have to examine and we have such a short amount of time to do so.

255
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:39,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need to find a transparent and equitable way that's also efficient and thorough for us to vet the merits of each of the suggestions that were brought forward.

256
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:49,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And everyone who submitted suggestions did so, they took time, they took energy, and they were very thoughtful about it.

257
00:21:49,899 --> 00:22:00,830
[SPEAKER_12]: And we should also take our own time to evaluate each and every one of those in order to honor their time and the research that the community members have put into all of the suggestions.

258
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:16,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I proposed the rubric because it enables us as a committee to share the burden of the research, along with the evaluation into smaller teams, while keeping the decision process objective.

259
00:22:18,657 --> 00:22:27,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And the three categories do align with the overall, what the community has indicated was most important in selecting the name.

260
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:35,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And it also aligns with the language that was given to us by the school committee in their resolution that created our own committee here.

261
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:41,770
[SPEAKER_12]: And most importantly, overall, this procedure was designed to try and bring our community together and

262
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:54,453
[SPEAKER_12]: to ensure that as a committee, we consider multiple perspectives and encourage the committee in making a selection by consensus as well.

263
00:22:55,273 --> 00:23:06,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just wanted to end with, I look forward to working with each and every one of all of these members on this committee, and I do move to approve this resolution.

264
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:06,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

265
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:11,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a second for that?

266
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:20,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a few comments before we move to a vote, if that's possible.

267
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:26,429
[SPEAKER_21]: As I said, Dr. Grace did a really great job of starting this off.

268
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of order, Ron, sorry.

269
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,871
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion needs to be seconded before there's a discussion, so I second the motion.

270
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:36,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bringing it to a vote, but it needs to be seconded.

271
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:37,813
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

272
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:39,033
[SPEAKER_21]: I second it.

273
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion.

274
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:49,771
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so in reading through this, I just thought there were some points that I need clarification on.

275
00:23:52,432 --> 00:24:00,818
[SPEAKER_21]: My opinion of what's here, first, it says that no living names can be used.

276
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:04,621
[SPEAKER_21]: That really was different from the guideline we received from the school committee.

277
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,242
[SPEAKER_21]: That was not included in their criteria.

278
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:18,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I also think that although the rubric is very good for evaluating names of individuals, there are a lot of names that were submitted by citizens that are not our people.

279
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:23,572
[SPEAKER_21]: and will not be able to be scored under this rubric as well.

280
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:36,656
[SPEAKER_21]: The other concern I have is the division of, although it would save time for us to divide and conquer, everybody's scoring system, even though it's aligned here, would be different.

281
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:44,360
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would not necessarily be given a chance to vote on something I feel strong about versus some of the other names.

282
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:53,406
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping that the committee has done some due diligence and looked at the names and has a pretty good idea of what names are valid and what can be thrown out.

283
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:54,327
[SPEAKER_21]: I had

284
00:24:56,588 --> 00:25:02,053
[SPEAKER_21]: looked at an alternative which would could, you know, work with Dr. Grace's thought.

285
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:12,061
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the rubric is really a great way of reviewing individuals if that's the way we decide, but I don't want to preclude the fact that there are some names in here that are not

286
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,211
[SPEAKER_21]: dead people and not people.

287
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:19,031
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't want to preclude them just with this vote.

288
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:25,733
[SPEAKER_21]: The other thing I thought, you know, not to, I don't like to criticize without having an alternative to discuss.

289
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:34,275
[SPEAKER_21]: So my thought was this, to combine the list, which we've already done, getting rid of the duplicates, which is great, reduce the list,

290
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:51,108
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it's important that everybody every citizen in Medford who thought enough to make this to fill out a name and identify the name and give a cause is something that if we do nothing else as a committee, we need to make the citizens of Medford feel like this is their choice, not ours.

291
00:25:52,718 --> 00:26:04,288
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think, I move that we look at a presentation meeting right away with the public, where they can each have three minutes to discuss why they put their name on.

292
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:11,074
[SPEAKER_21]: It probably will weed out a lot of people who, you know, don't wanna do that, but at least it gives us a chance to understand.

293
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:17,860
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I've done my, you know, I went on the internet, I've learned about every name here, but I don't know the passion as to why people gave those names.

294
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:26,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that in terms of scheduling, today's May 4th, by May 11th, we can hold a forum with three minute presentations.

295
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:40,138
[SPEAKER_21]: I think at that May 11th, we can kick off a citywide survey where people, all people, all 60,000 people in the city have an opportunity to give their opinions of what names they like.

296
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:45,541
[SPEAKER_21]: It just is not as a binding vote, but as an opinion vote to help us make a decision.

297
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:51,176
[SPEAKER_21]: I think on the 19th, the results of that presentation could be given to the committee.

298
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:55,820
[SPEAKER_21]: And at that point, we can look at developing a list of 10 finalists.

299
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,622
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, again,

300
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:01,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody has a vote.

301
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:03,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody here has an opinion.

302
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:14,929
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think those finalists, those 10 finalists, or in case of a tie, it gets even longer, that list should go to the Historical Society for vetting in cases of people's name, historical names.

303
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:15,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I stop you there?

304
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

305
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:17,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to interrupt.

306
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:24,398
[SPEAKER_10]: The Historical Society has been, the Historical Commission has been notified and the Historical Society, and we don't have anyone that will,

307
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:28,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, as the time I want has any interest in doing anything for us.

308
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,613
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so somebody will have to vet them.

309
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:32,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody from out of here.

310
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:38,741
[SPEAKER_21]: And then on May 21 have a final open forum for any citizen to give a comment on the finalist.

311
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:45,327
[SPEAKER_21]: I think at that point, we'll have enough information given from the city, plus our views plus our conversations.

312
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,094
[SPEAKER_21]: On the 24th, we can have our final debate and vote.

313
00:27:52,534 --> 00:28:06,499
[SPEAKER_21]: My goal would be that we all, 23 of us, come up with one name, not three names, one name in unity that we all agree to, to present to the school committee so it's a real true vision of what the citizens of Medford are looking for.

314
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:12,849
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, again, I think Dr. Grace has given us a great start with this.

315
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:20,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think that there are some pieces and the way we evaluate things going forward, we do need to agree on some kind of a plan.

316
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:28,273
[SPEAKER_21]: And bottom line is you're all gonna be responsible for the name you pick, and you all have your history and criteria from where you come from.

317
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,173
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's my thought.

318
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,194
[SPEAKER_21]: I have it in writing if you wanna see it, but that's my thoughts.

319
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,035
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a question of privilege.

320
00:28:35,775 --> 00:28:36,055
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

321
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:38,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's speaking?

322
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:41,089
[SPEAKER_20]: I am, Seth.

323
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,090
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a question of privilege.

324
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:52,937
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because we're starting into discussions that might take more discussion, I just kind of wanted to

325
00:28:59,235 --> 00:28:59,975
[SPEAKER_20]: as familiar with.

326
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Down at the bottom of the screen is a button called Reactions.

327
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:09,160
[SPEAKER_20]: If you click on that, there's a way there to raise your hand.

328
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:26,869
[SPEAKER_20]: And raising your hand will, on the side, make a list of people so that, Jim, as our chair, you can go down and order folks that might have something to say.

329
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,285
[SPEAKER_20]: raise our hand like that.

330
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:51,790
[SPEAKER_20]: And from a, as we discuss more of both Dr. Grace's rubric as well as Ron's ideas and theoretically more ideas to come, I think we will need some facilitation with

331
00:29:53,331 --> 00:30:04,354
[SPEAKER_20]: with some more parliamentary rules as far as, you know, we have a motion on the table.

332
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,054
[SPEAKER_20]: We're discussing that now.

333
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,875
[SPEAKER_20]: There are friendly amendments, those types of things.

334
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:13,136
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll just need to be able to facilitate that.

335
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

336
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:19,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else on the amendments?

337
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:22,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a point of information.

338
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:33,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to address one of the issues that Ron brought up with some of the names being suggested not being actual people.

339
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:46,376
[SPEAKER_12]: It is actually accounted for in the resolution itself, as they will be evaluated simply by example, since they won't necessarily be able to fit within the rubric because they are not people.

340
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:48,616
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to point that out.

341
00:30:49,616 --> 00:31:00,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I was just a little confused if Ron was trying to add amendments or if he was trying to propose a completely different resolution itself.

342
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:04,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And if that's the case, we have to vote on mine first.

343
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:10,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So to me, he was trying to add to your rubric.

344
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:18,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you were talking about using the rubric, but then adding additional language and dates of presentation to it.

345
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:25,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would imagine we would vote on the amendment first.

346
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:32,811
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to add that, and then we'd vote on the rubric.

347
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,972
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a point of information.

348
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:42,715
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm new at this, so I did not get on the agenda with this item.

349
00:31:43,356 --> 00:31:49,318
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know whether it's a, I just presented it because I wanted people to understand that there is,

350
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,248
[SPEAKER_21]: There's two points here.

351
00:31:53,428 --> 00:32:06,031
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, if Dr. Grace could clarify, if I'm calling it the mystic school, how would I score it versus one of the folks, one of the people that is being named at?

352
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:20,514
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be, how would I follow that criteria so that a number four, if I rated number four for ABC person, how would I vote number four for mystic and give you a ranking of that?

353
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:22,842
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where I'm kind of confused.

354
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:46,372
[SPEAKER_12]: They would be separated out so that those that are not by person are rated by the example that they set and how they represent the community and their proud history versus actual person or group.

355
00:32:47,313 --> 00:33:02,427
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can rate them through, and here I've written, it says, names not associated with a specific person are evaluated by example they set, such as exceptional, good, positive, neutral, or negative.

356
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:11,136
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we can, from there, pick the top ones and move those forward, along with the other names when we

357
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:17,520
[SPEAKER_12]: when we move on to further evaluation and other steps going forward.

358
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:21,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

359
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:26,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more questions on that motion?

360
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:35,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a little unclear where we're going with this.

361
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,671
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanna vote the rubric, is everyone?

362
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that part so far, we can move that along.

363
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,175
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a first motion and a second.

364
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I would call for a vote on that.

365
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:51,797
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have their hands up, Mr. Chair.

366
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, point of order.

367
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,058
[SPEAKER_18]: People have their hands up ready to speak.

368
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:55,958
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

369
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:58,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Please speak out.

370
00:33:58,379 --> 00:33:59,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's a co-host.

371
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:02,020
[SPEAKER_10]: You can unmute yourself when you want to speak.

372
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:08,462
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Hendrick.

373
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:28,330
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion that Ron suggested actually doesn't match up with what the school committee sent in their original resolution of what the work is that we're supposed to do.

374
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:41,017
[SPEAKER_19]: the, we're supposed to give them three names, and then they're the ones who choose which of the three names are the one that is put forward.

375
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:57,505
[SPEAKER_21]: But of information, if you read the directive from, I know it's confusing, I agree too, but if you look at the bottom of the charge that they gave us, it says up to three, we may present name,

376
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,264
[SPEAKER_21]: hyphenated names.

377
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:07,866
[SPEAKER_21]: So I do believe that either we get clarification, which they've already voted on it and it clearly says up to three.

378
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:08,607
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

379
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:20,350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's up to three, but clearly we could give one if we, if we come down to it, but I don't, let's go slowly here and let's work towards this.

380
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,231
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, let's not make that an issue here.

381
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:24,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're going to,

382
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,830
[SPEAKER_10]: do our presentation at the end.

383
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:34,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I would hope that we get three names and we do a presentation on those three names and they make that decision.

384
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:36,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we've got to do our homework.

385
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:45,096
[SPEAKER_10]: There's clearly a lot of names on here that, you know, I know people just sent some names.

386
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:53,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some of them don't belong on here, but we need to figure out a system to work through that and get it down to a shorter list.

387
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:58,263
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm looking for a motion here.

388
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:00,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a motion for the mover.

389
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:10,039
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, Jim, I just wanted to finish what I was saying before the point of information.

390
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:26,628
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that any chance to open this up to a zillion people spending three minutes is going to open a can of worms that none of us here that have jobs or families wanna deal with.

391
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:33,155
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be absolutely interminable and people will not stay on topic.

392
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:39,516
[SPEAKER_19]: We just don't have the time to listen.

393
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:48,258
[SPEAKER_19]: Once we have a small list, we can get people's feedback via survey.

394
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,638
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that that's the fastest way forward.

395
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,019
[SPEAKER_19]: We really need to

396
00:36:56,573 --> 00:36:59,975
[SPEAKER_19]: get past this moment in Medford, I think.

397
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,396
[SPEAKER_19]: I think everyone can agree with that.

398
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:06,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Jim?

399
00:37:06,097 --> 00:37:07,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Wooster?

400
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:08,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

401
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:15,302
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so I'm just curious if we pass this rubric, which I think is really well vetted out.

402
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:17,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just curious about number four.

403
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:24,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we pass this rubric, number four says each submission assigned five members of the advisory committee at random.

404
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:25,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's going to do that?

405
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,032
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that going to be accomplished?

406
00:37:27,232 --> 00:37:37,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I would think that each person on that would break up into fives and each person would fill out one of these rubrics and then would have the discussion within those groups.

407
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:46,104
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would think that we would collect them individually and just, you know, average out a score and then discuss them.

408
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:51,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also, this is after we've narrowed this list down and then

409
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,809
[SPEAKER_10]: the opportunity for everyone to speak.

410
00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:02,852
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to speak passionately about one of these people, one of these submissions, then we should hear each other and let each other speak passionately about them.

411
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:05,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can hear the other person's opinion.

412
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:11,516
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, so I saw that the five people, and I don't know how that in a group would work for us.

413
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:14,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be individual sheets for each person.

414
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:16,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll talk.

415
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:19,880
[SPEAKER_13]: So does that mean we strike this number four out of this rubric?

416
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,401
[SPEAKER_13]: You're gonna vote on it?

417
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:27,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Chair, if I may.

418
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:28,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

419
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:31,483
[SPEAKER_20]: Seth Hill speaking.

420
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:46,518
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now we have a motion on the floor to discuss the resolution as presented.

421
00:38:47,628 --> 00:39:06,434
[SPEAKER_20]: From my understanding of what we're sort of faced with at this moment, Dr. Grace may or may not accept what I guess could have been a friendly amendment from committee member Giovano.

422
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:24,942
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that in itself is solely Dr. Grace's position as to whether or not we do that, or she allows that, or takes it, and then we discuss that inclusion or not.

423
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:26,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes.

424
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:34,289
[SPEAKER_10]: She could take it back and make the change, or we could vote an amendment onto that before we pass it.

425
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:34,369
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

426
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:40,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Grace.

427
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:44,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

428
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:54,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we, I'm sorry, are we talking about the number four?

429
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, each submission is assigned five members of the advisory committee at random.

430
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:01,549
[SPEAKER_12]: And the,

431
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:09,669
[SPEAKER_12]: question was to, or it was requested to strike that.

432
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, walk us through your idea.

433
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:12,813
[SPEAKER_12]: The idea.

434
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:16,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's a bunch of ways that we could randomize.

435
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:19,240
[SPEAKER_12]: assigning it.

436
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:29,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean we can pop all the names, all of our names into a website and pop out five different groups and the same thing with the other names.

437
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:37,899
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's random and we don't have a selection or preference as to what names each committee gets.

438
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,380
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be my suggestion on how to do it.

439
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:55,643
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems fair and the least biased way for us to form our groups so that we all are forced to work together and to evaluate these names and have these discussions needed.

440
00:40:55,663 --> 00:41:04,565
[SPEAKER_10]: So out of each group would come one submission to this rubrics.

441
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:19,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of each group, everyone rates all of their names and then we pull them all together and see from there all of the scores.

442
00:41:19,866 --> 00:41:25,411
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important that we see all of the scores from everybody, not everybody submitting just the top ones that they have.

443
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:33,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody submitting scores, not a group average coming out of a group, correct?

444
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:37,277
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're trying to clarify here.

445
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:38,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

446
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:39,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

447
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:41,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we could.

448
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, all individually do it.

449
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:52,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should have individual and group averages for that just so that we can see how the breakdowns work as well.

450
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:55,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

451
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:57,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody with anything else on that?

452
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:09,830
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to clarify, would we be meeting two in those small groups or is it really individual work?

453
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:14,717
[SPEAKER_23]: So that small group work in terms of reviewing our ratings of those names?

454
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:34,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I would leave it individually up to that group around your schedules as to how you all decide to research the names and then have those if you want to have the discussions or if you're just writing them on your own to do that, but we have a lot of names to go through even if we cut down some of that list tonight.

455
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:39,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and they're going to need to be researched and vetted in some way, shape or form.

456
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:52,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, you know, if we all share the work across the board, um, and we can make all those files available to everybody so we can see what everyone has collected on each of the names as well.

457
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:53,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

458
00:42:54,212 --> 00:42:54,533
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

459
00:42:57,994 --> 00:42:58,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chair.

460
00:42:58,415 --> 00:42:58,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

461
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:02,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

462
00:43:02,775 --> 00:43:08,899
[SPEAKER_18]: So I also just want to thank Dr. Grace for putting this really, really thoughtful and helpful rubric together.

463
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:13,202
[SPEAKER_18]: And I only have a few thoughts, some of which have already been mentioned.

464
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:21,308
[SPEAKER_18]: In terms of the groups, I'm not sure the open meeting law allows us to meet five of us at a time without doing it in an open process, right?

465
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:23,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Lister, Mr. Chairman, I don't think we're allowed to do that.

466
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,731
[SPEAKER_18]: So we would either have to do it individually.

467
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:28,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, as long as there's not a quorum.

468
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:32,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, open forum of the group.

469
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:35,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you for that.

470
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:42,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So I also had a question like Rondovino about how to score names that are not people.

471
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:51,879
[SPEAKER_18]: And my idea is, I guess a friendly amendment would be that we tweak the language a little bit in the second and third rows.

472
00:43:52,240 --> 00:44:00,947
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think the first row in terms of the potential to bring the community together fits perfectly with both people and names or words.

473
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:16,289
[SPEAKER_18]: The second and the third could be tweaked slightly so that, for example, role model for Medford students could become role model or positive influence for Medford students.

474
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:25,956
[SPEAKER_18]: And in addition to everything that's written here, just a line at the bottom saying, if this is not a person, also has these same qualities.

475
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:28,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we could tweak that language.

476
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:32,481
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what the best way to do that is in terms of today's meeting.

477
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:35,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to write it in the chat and we can discuss it as a friendly amendment.

478
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:38,585
[SPEAKER_18]: I did not bring it ahead of time written out.

479
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:43,869
[SPEAKER_18]: And the same for the third row, which represents Medford's community proud history.

480
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:51,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously a name or word will not have lived in Medford, but it could have a longstanding connection to Medford.

481
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:55,158
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's, yeah, that's my friendly amendment.

482
00:44:56,657 --> 00:44:58,178
[SPEAKER_12]: I accept those changes.

483
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're a good addition to it and it'll make it easier across the board.

484
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:02,199
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes.

485
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,719
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

486
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I know someone's taking the minutes.

487
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we getting this, Elisa?

488
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:17,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hear.

489
00:45:18,623 --> 00:45:19,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on one second.

490
00:45:27,797 --> 00:45:28,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa.

491
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:34,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see it.

492
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,681
[SPEAKER_24]: It just said she's a coast.

493
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:39,623
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you hear me now.

494
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:40,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

495
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:41,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me now.

496
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:42,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

497
00:45:42,804 --> 00:45:44,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you getting this.

498
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:47,093
[SPEAKER_04]: These amendment changes?

499
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:47,993
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, yep.

500
00:45:48,434 --> 00:46:05,504
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody, what we usually do in school committee, if somebody puts forth a motion that they email it to me later as properly worded, so that I don't put words in somebody's submission.

501
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:16,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people can do that, when you do submit a motion, you know, at the end of the meeting, if you can email it to me, that would be helpful.

502
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:22,920
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll- We need to read it back so we can finish voting on this motion.

503
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:23,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

504
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't wait till, so let me- No, I understand that, but I'm just saying for the note purposes, I just want to get that out there.

505
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:33,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

506
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:45,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So if Grace wants to reread her motion, and then Patrick is seconding the motion, and then you can take the vote from there, I will take down the vote.

507
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:47,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

508
00:46:49,212 --> 00:46:50,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Grace.

509
00:46:51,993 --> 00:46:57,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Now she has those amendments that Laura added.

510
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:02,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So she should probably do that before she reads it so that everybody knows what they're voting on.

511
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:06,465
[SPEAKER_10]: So Grace.

512
00:47:08,246 --> 00:47:11,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Grace.

513
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:13,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

514
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:23,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me pull up the document.

515
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:23,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

516
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:32,379
[SPEAKER_12]: So you would like me to read the entire resolution?

517
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,720
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think we can.

518
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:37,368
[SPEAKER_06]: We can go to number four.

519
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:39,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably should for public record purposes.

520
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:40,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

521
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:41,609
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a public meeting.

522
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:42,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

523
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:44,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

524
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,550
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

525
00:47:46,570 --> 00:48:04,813
[SPEAKER_12]: So the entire resolution states, whereas the Medford School Committee has charged the Columbus Elementary School renaming advisory committee with the task of vetting names submitted for consideration and weighing the relative strength of submissions against the criteria the advisory committee will develop.

526
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:25,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas these criteria may include, but not be limited to such factors as the potential for the name to bring the community together, the ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and the name as a representation of the Medford community's proud history.

527
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:31,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the advisory committee must narrow the field of names to three finalists by May 24th, 2021.

528
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:41,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it so resolved that the advisory committee adopts the following selection criteria and procedure.

529
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:55,002
[SPEAKER_12]: One, submissions made in bad faith not conforming with the submission of names for consideration requirements or nominating a living person are excluded from consideration.

530
00:48:56,243 --> 00:49:02,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Two, all other submissions are evaluated using the below rubric.

531
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:10,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Potential to bring the community together.

532
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:17,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Number four, significant to multiple historically marginalized groups, not polarizing.

533
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:23,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Three, significant to one historically marginalized group, not polarizing.

534
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Two, significant to most of the community, not polarizing.

535
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:28,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And one,

536
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:32,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Polarizing marginalizes some community members.

537
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:42,815
[SPEAKER_12]: The next line, role model for Medford students or

538
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Laura's word was.

539
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Role model or positive influence for Medford students.

540
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

541
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Role model or positive influence for Medford students.

542
00:49:58,221 --> 00:49:58,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Lisa.

543
00:49:59,061 --> 00:49:59,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

544
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:14,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Number four is known for exceptional deeds, community involvement, or contributions to society historically notable with a legacy that will last decades.

545
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:27,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Three, known for good community deeds, involvement, or contribution to society historically notable, no known character concerns.

546
00:50:30,797 --> 00:50:51,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, if it's a place just known for the community, known to, known for positive deeds, community involvement or contributions to society, no known character concerns or naming issues in general, just a positive place.

547
00:50:52,892 --> 00:51:04,877
[SPEAKER_12]: place, and then one known for community involvement and contributions, known character concerns, whether major example, criminality, depravity, or oppression, or minor.

548
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:12,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And then all of those are with Laura's amendments.

549
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:16,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

550
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

551
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:30,932
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the last one was represents Medford's community, community's proud history.

552
00:51:31,032 --> 00:51:37,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Four, lives in Medford with Medford specific reputation or known for Medford if it's a place.

553
00:51:38,076 --> 00:51:46,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Three, lived in Medford without Medford specific reputation, known to Medford.

554
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:51,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Number two, did not live in,

555
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:56,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford, Medford-specific reputation.

556
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:09,420
[SPEAKER_12]: One has never lived or visited Medford, reputation not specific to Medford or place that's not specific to Medford as well.

557
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:17,904
[SPEAKER_12]: And then number three, submissions are scored by summing the numerical values.

558
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:26,083
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, a four potential three role model and three represents would yield a score of 10.

559
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:31,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Four, each submission is assigned to five members of the advisory committee at random.

560
00:52:31,507 --> 00:52:36,070
[SPEAKER_12]: These committee members individually research and evaluate submissions according to the rubric.

561
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:46,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Five, the 15 submissions receiving the highest average score advance to consideration by the whole advisory committee in the

562
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:52,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Event of a tie, at the cutoff, all tied submissions advance.

563
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:58,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Six, advisory committee conducts additional research and solicits public input.

564
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:05,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven, all members of the advisory committee evaluate the remaining submissions according to the rubric.

565
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:08,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Evaluations previously made in step four cannot be modified.

566
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Eight, the advisory committee deliberates to select three names by consensus.

567
00:53:14,073 --> 00:53:21,097
[SPEAKER_12]: weighing the submission's average scores, average values on each rubric dimension, public input and research.

568
00:53:21,717 --> 00:53:30,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Nine, while consensus has not been reached, the chair will ask dissenting members to state their concerns for additional discussion.

569
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:37,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Discussion continues until consensus has been reached or the advisory committee acknowledges that consensus will not be reached.

570
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:43,050
[SPEAKER_12]: And 10, the remaining names are selected by a simple majority vote.

571
00:53:44,278 --> 00:53:46,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and what was number 11 that we wanted to add?

572
00:53:51,281 --> 00:53:53,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone made a motion for number 11 as a change.

573
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the living person or not a living person?

574
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:01,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that's somewhere.

575
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:10,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's back up at the number one that has living or nominating a living person or excluded from consideration.

576
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:12,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to...

577
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,692
[SPEAKER_10]: discuss that, whether we're gonna eliminate that or?

578
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:18,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

579
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:23,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Any discussion on that living person?

580
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:38,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So point of order, Ron presented an amendment to eliminate the living person portion and there was no second that I've heard yet.

581
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:40,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sorry, correct.

582
00:54:41,606 --> 00:54:41,946
[SPEAKER_23]: Second.

583
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:55,739
[SPEAKER_23]: I will second that to remove the living person restriction or non living persons.

584
00:54:56,019 --> 00:54:56,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

585
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,040
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

586
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Removing the living person restriction.

587
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:06,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can have to enhance.

588
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:06,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

589
00:55:07,663 --> 00:55:08,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a vote button.

590
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:22,732
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a thumbs up or there are checks and Xs in the reactions down below.

591
00:55:24,312 --> 00:55:24,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

592
00:55:24,832 --> 00:55:25,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Thumbs up.

593
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:28,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, checks and Xs.

594
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:29,013
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do the checks.

595
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:41,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of the thumbs up, could we use the check mark, please?

596
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:42,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

597
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:50,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, somehow I do not have a check mark.

598
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:57,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Neither do I. Neither do I, nor can I raise my hand.

599
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:00,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Your versions of Zoom.

600
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:05,428
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know why that is.

601
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:07,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Bree here.

602
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,453
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Chair, if I may, I have a question.

603
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:15,496
[SPEAKER_25]: Before we do the checker and X,

604
00:56:16,676 --> 00:56:22,219
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanted to understand more about why the living person restriction was there.

605
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,661
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've taken out the living restriction person.

606
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,122
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, that's what this vote is for.

607
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:37,188
[SPEAKER_10]: That they don't, right now, the living, that says the person has to be, that says that if this is a living person, they're excluded.

608
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:38,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

609
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:44,432
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just voted to say that that's not one of the exclusions, that it could be a living person.

610
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:45,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that it could be a living person.

611
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:49,737
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, yeah.

612
00:56:50,097 --> 00:56:55,460
[SPEAKER_25]: And I wanted to understand more about why we would have excluded living people.

613
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally?

614
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:58,141
[SPEAKER_25]: Originally.

615
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:00,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we hear from Grace on that?

616
00:57:01,162 --> 00:57:02,763
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I want to hear from Grace on that.

617
00:57:03,684 --> 00:57:06,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

618
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:13,649
[SPEAKER_12]: So the living people were was excluded just because people

619
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:31,275
[SPEAKER_12]: There are, because even if a person is alive right now they have a lot of, presumably a lot of life yet to still live.

620
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:38,062
[SPEAKER_12]: It puts us in a weird position.

621
00:57:38,082 --> 00:57:55,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if, for whatever reason, something does not go well in their life, for us to then have to potentially come back and address the issue again, there isn't a full history yet.

622
00:57:56,697 --> 00:58:11,367
[SPEAKER_12]: not saying that it would happen, but there's always a potential for things to shift in a manner that we don't see yet as a committee because they haven't lived their life fully yet.

623
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:20,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully they have a long, filled, wonderful life, but there always is that risk.

624
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:22,655
[SPEAKER_12]: And as a way to try and reduce that,

625
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:31,901
[SPEAKER_12]: and to not put us as a community in this place again where we have to come back and try and rename the school.

626
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:33,662
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why it was there.

627
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:37,004
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was kind of the reasoning behind it.

628
00:58:39,365 --> 00:58:51,453
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that when you memorialize someone's name, generally it's taken that the person is no longer here, that when you memorialize them by naming a building after them, I mean, that to me is that intent,

629
00:58:52,878 --> 00:58:58,484
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you don't name a building after, as Grace said, but I may be wrong.

630
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:01,988
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a sense of how many living people are on our list.

631
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:03,130
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just curious.

632
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:06,634
[SPEAKER_10]: There might be a dozen, I think.

633
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not sure.

634
00:59:07,895 --> 00:59:10,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had some looked at some of them.

635
00:59:15,443 --> 00:59:17,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not weighing in one way or the other.

636
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:22,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I mean, the McGlynn, the McGlynn school was named after- May and McGlynn's father, correct.

637
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:24,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was living at the time, so.

638
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:24,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

639
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,506
[SPEAKER_02]: There is precedent.

640
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:35,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it has been done definitely, but in most cases it's, when you memorialize someone's name, they're no longer of this earth.

641
00:59:38,728 --> 00:59:41,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Another point to add on is that,

642
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:58,050
[SPEAKER_16]: If, well, considering the fact that we're here to change a name that was already done before to base what we name this or what we changed the name to based on what has already been done, does not necessarily make sense.

643
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:02,212
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

644
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:05,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I would agree with that too.

645
01:00:07,935 --> 01:00:11,878
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess my trouble with voting on this is that I see both sides of it in that like, yes,

646
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,242
[SPEAKER_25]: they don't have any more story left to tell.

647
01:00:15,262 --> 01:00:19,383
[SPEAKER_25]: They're easier to vet, you know, if they are passed.

648
01:00:20,303 --> 01:00:34,408
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, naming them after someone who is alive and then having to go, potentially having to go back later is also that example of knowing better and doing better.

649
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:40,009
[SPEAKER_25]: And when we learn, we adapt and make changes.

650
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,650
[SPEAKER_25]: So I

651
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:45,119
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's tough.

652
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:53,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to interrupt, but if you're going with this as an amendment to change the amendment, then

653
01:00:55,879 --> 01:01:14,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say any votes, Jim, it's just my suggestion to go down the list as the chairperson and call out everybody's name, just from the future for now or for whatever, just, I know it's a long list, but I think that we'd have to have that down on the notes anyway, so.

654
01:01:14,994 --> 01:01:15,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

655
01:01:15,235 --> 01:01:20,199
[SPEAKER_10]: If I didn't get the last vote, say it clearly, yes.

656
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:21,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

657
01:01:22,455 --> 01:01:30,759
[SPEAKER_10]: So on this amendment, this amendment alone, the changing the living, taking out a living person.

658
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:33,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we vote on this?

659
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:38,083
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're gonna vote on it, who made the motion and who seconded it?

660
01:01:38,123 --> 01:01:39,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I might've missed that.

661
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:42,085
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

662
01:01:42,426 --> 01:01:46,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron Jovino made the motion, Lila Floor seconded the motion.

663
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:47,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

664
01:01:47,468 --> 01:01:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

665
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:48,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, good.

666
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:50,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the strike.

667
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:57,347
[SPEAKER_10]: the language that says a living person is excluded.

668
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:00,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone clear on that?

669
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:01,869
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information.

670
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,829
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we're voting on right now to exclude.

671
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:04,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Just that amendment.

672
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:08,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

673
01:02:09,011 --> 01:02:15,053
[SPEAKER_10]: To strike the language that says that it can't be a living person.

674
01:02:17,554 --> 01:02:17,874
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct?

675
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:20,494
[SPEAKER_23]: That is correct.

676
01:02:20,934 --> 01:02:24,296
[SPEAKER_23]: So there could be more discussion or we can proceed to the vote.

677
01:02:24,857 --> 01:02:25,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

678
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:25,938
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

679
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:37,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So a yes vote would be to strike the language of it being a, it has to be a living person.

680
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:39,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you vote no.

681
01:02:40,168 --> 01:02:43,090
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that it can't be a living person.

682
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,872
[SPEAKER_24]: We're voting that we can't be a living person.

683
01:02:46,732 --> 01:02:49,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was the language, can't be a living person.

684
01:02:50,493 --> 01:02:53,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Are we voting on it the way Dr. Grace presented it?

685
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:54,515
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

686
01:02:54,555 --> 01:03:01,038
[SPEAKER_21]: The amendment was to eliminate the language of no living person can be considered.

687
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:04,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

688
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:09,541
[SPEAKER_18]: But essentially strikes the word or nominating a living person.

689
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:12,260
[SPEAKER_18]: We're striking those words.

690
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,180
[SPEAKER_18]: That is the amendment that's on the table, right?

691
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So a yes vote would be striking those words.

692
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:20,023
[SPEAKER_24]: Which means we could vote on a person who's still alive for a name.

693
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:20,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

694
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:21,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

695
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:21,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

696
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:23,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

697
01:03:24,324 --> 01:03:25,925
[SPEAKER_10]: So are we on the list?

698
01:03:25,985 --> 01:03:26,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Three brothers?

699
01:03:28,006 --> 01:03:28,106
No.

700
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:32,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Just point of order real quick, Jim, sorry.

701
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:38,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's within the chair's purview to call the vote and you don't have to do the roll call.

702
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:45,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody questions it just from a sake of time, if we're gonna be taking a lot of votes, we don't have to do the roll every time.

703
01:03:45,693 --> 01:03:49,556
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a close vote, I recommend doing a roll.

704
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:51,637
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, you can take the call.

705
01:03:51,877 --> 01:03:52,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

706
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:56,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but anything on zoom has to be done by roll call.

707
01:03:57,086 --> 01:04:02,188
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why even school committee can't adjourn by just all saying we adjourn.

708
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:06,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if we were in person, we could do that, but we are not.

709
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:12,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything does have to be a roll call vote, even to just adjourn.

710
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:14,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

711

[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so majority there, everybody heard that.

759
01:05:56,949 --> 01:06:00,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And Mr. Chair, Caitlin Shaughnessy has joined us, just so you're aware.

760
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:05,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Caitlin, did you hear the whole topic we were discussing?

761
01:06:05,476 --> 01:06:06,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been here for a while?

762
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, hi, I'm voting no.

763
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:13,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

764
01:06:14,343 --> 01:06:14,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

765
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

766
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:21,870
[SPEAKER_10]: To clarify it now,

767
01:06:24,178 --> 01:06:28,499
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to be, a living person is not to be considered, okay?

768
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:31,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

769
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:45,644
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, on the other amendment on, I believe it was number four on the submission is assigned to five members of the advisory committee at random.

770
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:48,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we have other language that we were gonna put?

771
01:06:51,366 --> 01:06:52,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Chairman?

772
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:52,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

773
01:06:53,617 --> 01:07:07,061
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wondering if Dr. Grace would amend that segment to allow that each one of us vet our list and come up with next meeting with our five top and work through it that way.

774
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:15,244
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems like getting committees and subcommittees together in the interest of time, I would imagine that everybody's looked at the list.

775
01:07:16,064 --> 01:07:19,565
[SPEAKER_21]: has vetted their own list, has done some research prior to this meeting.

776
01:07:20,065 --> 01:07:27,507
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm asking that we may amend that to everybody being charged with bringing their five top and compiling that list for next meeting.

777
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:42,911
[SPEAKER_21]: As opposed to going through the distribution, and I also think we should adopt the rubric as our guidelines for individuals, but I just think that I don't want to get Vito Corleone's name and trying to

778
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:44,036
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I agree.

779
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:45,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

780
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:57,261
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was trying to get to that point and then go to the list later on today and work through and take off some nonsense names there that we all can identify.

781
01:07:57,321 --> 01:08:02,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if we agreed that we aren't taking any living names, we could remove them.

782
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:07,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just curious what Dr. Grace has thoughts on that idea.

783
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:12,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Grace, you're muted.

784
01:08:15,285 --> 01:08:31,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, a point of information maybe we the first part of this does allow us to go through and take off names to begin with off the top as to amending number four, I.

785
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:55,008
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm inclined to say no, just because it would do us well as a committee to have a paper trail with our research from each of the committees, from each of the smaller groups aligned so that we can also have that available, not only when we do our presentation, but

786
01:08:56,377 --> 01:08:58,299
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, if the public wants it.

787
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think it's the each submission.

788
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:03,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Each submission is the part that we're in question here.

789
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:12,591
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to shorten the list and then get it down to a short list of submissions that we put into the group.

790
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:16,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so it would be each submission after we've already gone through.

791
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, I see what you're saying.

792
01:09:33,678 --> 01:09:38,000
[SPEAKER_12]: No, so it's, we're already gonna go through and cut things off in the first one.

793
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:48,505
[SPEAKER_12]: And then from there, we're saying each, all the other submissions are being evaluated by the rubric and then- All the other, okay.

794
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:52,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, all other submissions are evaluated by the rubric below.

795
01:09:53,988 --> 01:10:01,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And then those are the submissions that are also assigned to five members at random.

796
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:01,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

797
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:04,134
[SPEAKER_12]: in the smaller groups.

798
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a point of information.

799
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I agree with your process.

800
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:21,030
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just, in terms of a paper trail, we'll all be bringing our paper trail because people will understand which each 23 of us has elected as our top five.

801
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,334
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just trying to get to the final debate

802
01:10:25,914 --> 01:10:39,227
[SPEAKER_21]: in a debate where if I get a group of, in my group, if I have four names of which none of them are of my top four or top five, then I don't have input in that list.

803
01:10:39,347 --> 01:10:46,734
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just suggesting that if each of us brought their top five, that builds a list that we can start debating on.

804
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:48,876
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's just a shortened way of doing that.

805
01:10:48,976 --> 01:10:50,478
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just,

806
01:10:51,943 --> 01:11:07,808
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, in my opinion, I can't support this resolution as it stands, because to me it just represents a debate that other members of this committee are not gonna be part of, and we're gonna be coming out with our ratings on these, and nobody's gonna see that necessarily.

807
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:17,975
[SPEAKER_21]: This way here, each of us has our own individual input in a top five and then a group debate can start on the numbers that we end up with.

808
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,276
[SPEAKER_21]: That was my intent.

809
01:11:19,896 --> 01:11:23,839
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just suggesting that we tweak that a little bit in the interest of time.

810
01:11:23,919 --> 01:11:25,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you get the same results.

811
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:31,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're all holding on to, I hope we're holding on to our top five that we know.

812
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:42,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we are actually going to spend more time if we force everyone to go through and do independent research on the rest of the names submitted.

813
01:11:43,256 --> 01:11:49,942
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to take us a lot more time and effort to do that versus trying to break this up into smaller chunks.

814
01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:59,855
[SPEAKER_12]: divide and conquer and spread the work out in a equitable way where we are not all spending a lot of time.

815
01:12:02,463 --> 01:12:08,224
[SPEAKER_12]: in order to go through and research all of the names such that we can come up with a top five.

816
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:11,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is why it is written as it is written.

817
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:17,627
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is why I am also saying no to that proposed change.

818
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:18,907
[SPEAKER_21]: My guess is that

819
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:29,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Our top fives for all 23 of us will have a lot of commonality in them, because we will have vetted them.

820
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:36,243
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just trying to avoid a long debate on names that I may have no interest in anyway.

821
01:12:36,303 --> 01:12:40,644
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think if we move to top five list, it just shortens that.

822
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:44,025
[SPEAKER_21]: There's going to be plenty of time and plenty of discussion and debate.

823
01:12:44,305 --> 01:12:46,205
[SPEAKER_21]: But I appreciate what you're saying.

824
01:12:46,225 --> 01:12:47,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I just can't support it the way it's written.

825
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:49,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I jump in here, Mr. Chairman?

826
01:12:53,806 --> 01:12:55,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, go ahead.

827
01:12:55,828 --> 01:12:57,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul Donato next, Paul Donato, Jamie.

828
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:05,737
[SPEAKER_05]: My suggestion through you, it'd be each member pick three names off of this list, submit it to the chair.

829
01:13:06,737 --> 01:13:11,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So this way we can have some sort of list and start from there.

830
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:13,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll narrow it down.

831
01:13:13,503 --> 01:13:14,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

832
01:13:14,504 --> 01:13:19,769
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with what you're saying, but my intention tonight was to take this rubrics

833
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:28,341
[SPEAKER_10]: let's and hold it till we get a shorter list, but go through this list, but start from the bottom and work our way up.

834
01:13:28,421 --> 01:13:33,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you can see how many submissions there are for the names.

835
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:45,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you say, some of us have a short five people name list, but we have to figure a way to shorten this list before we get into doing our investigating.

836
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:55,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, I would like to try and move to the prior question and vote on the rubric.

837
01:13:55,975 --> 01:13:59,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have at 7.30.

838
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:03,458
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a prior work commitment on Tuesdays starting at that time.

839
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:07,220
[SPEAKER_12]: So I make that motion.

840
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:07,880
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

841
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

842
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,200
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

843
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:09,841
[SPEAKER_10]: So

844
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:18,360
[SPEAKER_20]: information.

845
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:21,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I had typed up in chat.

846
01:14:22,484 --> 01:14:35,076
[SPEAKER_20]: And there is a chat feature that some of us are using to sort of back channel while other folks are talking, just to make it easier for to keep track of what's going on.

847
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:38,099
[SPEAKER_20]: There's

848
01:14:41,713 --> 01:14:48,407
[SPEAKER_20]: To simplify what I think Dr. Grace might have had from an intention to

849
01:14:50,333 --> 01:15:03,983
[SPEAKER_20]: to randomly assign each name to five individuals on the committee, we could just push that responsibility to the superintendent's office for that facilitation.

850
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:19,214
[SPEAKER_20]: If we said, OK, we'll go through, and it doesn't even need to necessarily be something that the entire list does, if we say to the superintendent's

851
01:15:21,236 --> 01:15:33,446
[SPEAKER_20]: office, please present us with a... Please choose from this list of... I'm sorry.

852
01:15:34,127 --> 01:15:36,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Please eliminate the living people from this list.

853
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:46,737
[SPEAKER_20]: And then randomly assign each of these names to five members of the committee.

854
01:15:48,038 --> 01:15:50,060
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we'll go through

855
01:15:52,698 --> 01:15:57,601
[SPEAKER_20]: individually, submit it back to the superintendent's office.

856
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:05,004
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll run the tally and then present us with the information that would bring us to step number five.

857
01:16:08,885 --> 01:16:14,948
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm not sure whether or not that... I'm not sure that's the intention of...

858
01:16:15,623 --> 01:16:16,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a school committee.

859
01:16:16,563 --> 01:16:18,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they want the superintendent's office.

860
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the superintendent's role.

861
01:16:20,564 --> 01:16:26,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the school committee's role, and they assigned it to you guys, if that makes sense.

862
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:35,667
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, my understanding was that the superintendent's office was there for administrative.

863
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:40,968
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that would be kind of the role of a secretary, to what my understanding is.

864
01:16:40,988 --> 01:16:41,728
[SPEAKER_20]: There's actually no...

865
01:16:43,692 --> 01:16:45,833
[SPEAKER_20]: It's only administrative.

866
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:54,997
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no decision-making happening from the superintendent's office.

867
01:16:55,037 --> 01:17:05,202
[SPEAKER_20]: It's only just facilitating our operations, which would be the role of what a secretary and a committee would be doing.

868
01:17:05,422 --> 01:17:08,284
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding- Hold on.

869
01:17:09,164 --> 01:17:10,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just letting you know that.

870
01:17:13,757 --> 01:17:17,901
[SPEAKER_12]: My hand up on point of order.

871
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:25,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I had previously requested that we move to, um, the previous question so that we can vote on it.

872
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:32,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, is that something that can we please do that on vote on the, on the admin mint at hand?

873
01:17:33,757 --> 01:17:34,077
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

874
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:36,600
[SPEAKER_10]: The amendment at hand is.

875
01:17:39,152 --> 01:17:42,454
[SPEAKER_10]: All other submissions are assigned to five members of the advisory committee.

876
01:17:42,934 --> 01:17:44,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, that was never seconded.

877
01:17:44,896 --> 01:17:55,223
[SPEAKER_12]: So the amendment at hand would be the overall rubric and names itself, the overall process.

878
01:17:58,246 --> 01:17:59,426
[SPEAKER_10]: The overall rubric.

879
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:04,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe we're done discussing the amendments that were brought to it.

880
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to go through each.

881
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,292
[SPEAKER_10]: make sure we were clear on all of them.

882
01:18:09,053 --> 01:18:11,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I point of information?

883
01:18:11,095 --> 01:18:18,420
[SPEAKER_19]: I move to adjourn until next time to get Grace's to be at her job and do what she needs to do.

884
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:26,367
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion on the floor.

885
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:34,093
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion is Grace's original resolution, which was seconded by Patrick.

886
01:18:35,183 --> 01:18:38,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need to take a vote on that because it was seconded.

887
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:40,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

888
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:48,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to do amendments later or whatever, you know, decide something else, a different issue, but you have a motion on the floor.

889
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:51,317
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

890
01:18:51,838 --> 01:18:55,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The amendments that are on the floor get voted on before the original.

891
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

892
01:18:58,063 --> 01:19:00,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That are on the floor get voted before the original.

893
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:07,938
[SPEAKER_12]: That amendment wasn't previously seconded, so what is on the floor right now is the resolution itself.

894
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:10,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

895
01:19:10,558 --> 01:19:24,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I believe that the amendment from Laura Rotolo, unless we're considering accepting friendly amendments, and if it's a friendly amendment, needs to be accepted by you, and then me as the person who seconded.

896
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:30,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well, I did accept Laura's friendly amendment, so I will.

897
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:33,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I would accept that as well.

898
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:46,871
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're accepting friendly amendments as a group, it's under debate whether or not a friendly amendment needs to be voted on by the whole or could be just accepted by a person originally making the motion in the second.

899
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody needs to vote because it's on Zoom.

900
01:19:54,452 --> 01:19:56,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll go through the line.

901
01:19:58,635 --> 01:20:00,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what everyone's voting on right now.

902
01:20:01,556 --> 01:20:04,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand what we're voting on.

903
01:20:07,299 --> 01:20:09,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we get the two friendly amendments please?

904
01:20:11,561 --> 01:20:12,601
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to begin with mine.

905
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:24,787
[SPEAKER_18]: So my friendly amendment was to add a clarifying language to rows two and three relating to submissions that were not names of people, but were instead words or terms.

906
01:20:27,992 --> 01:20:34,417
[SPEAKER_18]: If we need specific language, I can, I've just been typing it up so I can read that in now.

907
01:20:34,437 --> 01:20:35,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Please.

908
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so this is my friendly amendment.

909
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:42,363
[SPEAKER_18]: If you will just follow with me on the rubric.

910
01:20:42,923 --> 01:20:45,845
[SPEAKER_18]: In column, we're looking at row number two.

911
01:20:46,826 --> 01:20:55,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Column one, it would read role model for Medford students or positive influence for Medford students.

912
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:59,822
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Lisa, Miss Angelica, let me know if I'm going too fast.

913
01:21:01,204 --> 01:21:05,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to know what they're voting for.

914
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:09,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

915
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to say the amendments so people can second it and vote on it.

916
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to wait until after the fact.

917
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:18,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Got it, okay.

918
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:29,416
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're still in row number two, column two, we would add the sentence, if not a person has a historical significance that will last decades.

919
01:21:30,837 --> 01:21:38,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Column three, we would add the sentence, if not a person is historically notable and has no known negative properties.

920
01:21:40,483 --> 01:21:44,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Column four, if not a person is perceived positively.

921
01:21:45,441 --> 01:21:52,264
[SPEAKER_18]: And column five, if not a person has negative or harmful connotations or history.

922
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:59,728
[SPEAKER_18]: And then moving on to row three, the first column stays the same, represents Medford community's proud history.

923
01:22:00,288 --> 01:22:07,592
[SPEAKER_18]: The second column, we would add, if not a person has longstanding ties to Medford with positive history.

924
01:22:08,972 --> 01:22:14,735
[SPEAKER_18]: Column three, we would add, if not a person has ties to Medford without negative history.

925
01:22:16,633 --> 01:22:20,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Column four, add, has no ties to Medford and no negative history.

926
01:22:20,695 --> 01:22:23,596
[SPEAKER_18]: And column five has no ties to Medford.

927
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:24,456
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it.

928
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:27,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and that was a friendly amendment.

929
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:30,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So did somebody second that?

930
01:22:30,799 --> 01:22:31,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick second that?

931
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I can second it if you need it seconded.

932
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:37,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

933
01:22:40,103 --> 01:22:43,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you have to- Were you gonna vote on that, the amendment?

934
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:46,721
[SPEAKER_10]: or was it a friendly amendment?

935
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,402
[SPEAKER_10]: She accepted it to her original.

936
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:50,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have to vote on it?

937
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Your call.

938
01:22:53,924 --> 01:22:58,905
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's accepted by the person making the motion in the second, it's your call, Mr. Chair.

939
01:23:00,106 --> 01:23:01,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're not going to vote on it.

940
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:02,486
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go back to the motion now.

941
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:06,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there any other, was there another amendment that we wanted to clarify?

942
01:23:10,169 --> 01:23:13,850
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I believe we were at the amendment itself.

943
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:16,348
[SPEAKER_12]: for the resolution itself.

944
01:23:16,829 --> 01:23:18,331
[SPEAKER_24]: There was nothing else.

945
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:20,034
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, can I ask a question?

946
01:23:20,515 --> 01:23:20,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

947
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:25,122
[SPEAKER_24]: So Dr. Grace, if I'm understanding you correctly, and I'm not sure if I am.

948
01:23:26,283 --> 01:23:47,513
[SPEAKER_24]: I think what the suggestion you're making is that we take off the names of the people who are still alive, and then we would come with a list of names that we would then use the rubric and take our top five, and then come together from there and then assign people to vet those names to make sure that there's nothing we have to worry about.

949
01:23:49,814 --> 01:23:50,914
[SPEAKER_12]: The list would be,

950
01:23:53,112 --> 01:24:08,123
[SPEAKER_12]: anything that's bad faith not conforming and not living would be removed, then we would go ahead and assign the rest of the names to smaller

951
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:13,965
[SPEAKER_12]: groups of five members, they would be randomly divided up between everybody.

952
01:24:15,085 --> 01:24:20,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone would then research and do their own scoring according to said rubric.

953
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:24,008
[SPEAKER_12]: We come back together with all of those numbers and we take a look from there.

954
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:26,769
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you.

955
01:24:27,009 --> 01:24:27,610
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand now.

956
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:27,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

957
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:33,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the shortening of the list we would do as a group.

958
01:24:35,212 --> 01:24:36,793
[SPEAKER_10]: But all right, let's

959
01:24:39,409 --> 01:24:44,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone in favor of this motion to accept this resolution?

960
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go through reading the names one at a time.

961
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:57,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion seconded by Patrick, amended by Laura, correct?

962
01:24:59,134 --> 01:24:59,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

963
01:25:00,574 --> 01:25:00,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

964
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:03,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, roll call.

965
01:25:06,289 --> 01:25:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on one second.

966
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:12,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa, I thought that Jim had made the call though, that we're voting on the original motion.

967
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,495
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

968
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

969
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:16,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

970
01:25:16,637 --> 01:25:18,358
[SPEAKER_10]: The amendment was a friendly amendment.

971
01:25:18,838 --> 01:25:19,639
[SPEAKER_10]: We accepted that.

972
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:29,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's the original motion to accept this rubrics with the few changes we made.

973
01:25:29,186 --> 01:25:32,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm calling for the vote.

974
01:25:33,789 --> 01:25:34,390

[SPEAKER_10]: Seth Hill.

1007
01:26:29,705 --> 01:26:29,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1008
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:31,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathy Kay.

1009
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:32,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1010
01:26:33,768 --> 01:26:34,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Matthew Havistrop.

1011
01:26:35,543 --> 01:26:35,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1012
01:26:37,104 --> 01:26:38,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Caitlin Shaughnessy.

1013
01:26:38,984 --> 01:26:39,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1014
01:26:40,265 --> 01:26:41,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Janelle Garland McKenzie.

1015
01:26:42,246 --> 01:26:42,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1016
01:26:43,246 --> 01:26:44,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Josie DeFore.

1017
01:26:44,887 --> 01:26:45,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1018
01:26:46,507 --> 01:26:46,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1019
01:26:47,588 --> 01:26:48,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1020
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:49,008
[SPEAKER_11]: That passes.

1021
01:26:51,009 --> 01:26:52,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Jim, can I make a comment?

1022
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:52,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1023
01:26:54,270 --> 01:27:01,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So for the sake of simplifying this whole process, you know, we're all, we're all,

1024
01:27:02,386 --> 01:27:03,346
[SPEAKER_11]: here for a reason.

1025
01:27:04,046 --> 01:27:13,188
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all picked for a reason, or whether it may be one of the school committee members put us on, or you were in the lottery.

1026
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:16,508
[SPEAKER_11]: One way or another, we're all here for the same goal.

1027
01:27:17,429 --> 01:27:24,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in order to simplify things, I think the best avenue might be what Paul had said.

1028
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:30,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And have each of us just picked three names and submit them to you using the rubric, obviously,

1029
01:27:32,269 --> 01:27:41,711
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, using that process of elimination with three names, sending them to you as the chair, and then opening it up for discussion at the next meeting.

1030
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:44,492
[SPEAKER_11]: This could go on for days and days.

1031
01:27:44,512 --> 01:27:46,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that.

1032
01:27:47,973 --> 01:27:56,595
[SPEAKER_10]: As Ron said, you know, a lot of people that submitted names have some impassioned feelings about the names that they submitted.

1033
01:27:56,655 --> 01:27:58,495
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some ridiculous names on here.

1034
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:00,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1035
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:11,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, we should go through the list and get rid of names that aren't real.

1036
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:15,313
[SPEAKER_11]: The survey of 300 people or so, where did that come from?

1037
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:22,218
[SPEAKER_11]: The people that submitted those names, where was that from?

1038
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:27,402
[SPEAKER_24]: It was put out to the community through the superintendent.

1039
01:28:28,146 --> 01:28:30,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that was put out to the community.

1040
01:28:31,809 --> 01:28:37,033
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we kind of got a pulse on what the community is thinking with those names.

1041
01:28:37,093 --> 01:28:43,038
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll tell you that the first five or six names, they're great, you know, they're great starting points.

1042
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:57,149
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we, as being tasked with this, you know, with this task, I think it might be a good idea that we all take, you know, three of our top, use the rubric,

1043
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,643
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, and submit three names a piece.

1044
01:29:02,345 --> 01:29:03,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Just keep it simple.

1045
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:07,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, we just passed information on what we were going to do.

1046
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:10,272
[SPEAKER_13]: So with all due respect, Dan, I mean, that's what we should be doing.

1047
01:29:10,773 --> 01:29:17,779
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'd be great if we could cut down this list and then randomly assign these numbers, just like step four.

1048
01:29:18,919 --> 01:29:21,500
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to pick three names and just hand them to you.

1049
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,060
[SPEAKER_24]: If I may also say I agree.

1050
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:25,901
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1051
01:29:26,382 --> 01:29:27,562
[SPEAKER_24]: I think what we need to do.

1052
01:29:27,582 --> 01:29:31,203
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't I don't live in Medford I'm not from Medford I come from New York originally.

1053
01:29:31,664 --> 01:29:35,565
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know the names on this list that may be living or deceased.

1054
01:29:36,673 --> 01:29:46,360
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I think that's very important that for those of you in the community who might know these names, I know some of the people who are on it that are still presently alive, but I don't know all of them.

1055
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,983
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think that would probably be an easy place to start perhaps for this evening.

1056
01:29:51,424 --> 01:29:51,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1057
01:29:54,586 --> 01:30:05,875
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole point of randomization is to maintain a point of objectivity, to go and just simply pick three names that are our favorites

1058
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:16,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, even if we do use the rubric, that's going to ultimately be secondary, at least for some, um, to the rubric itself.

1059
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,269
[SPEAKER_16]: And that can become problematic.

1060
01:30:21,632 --> 01:30:23,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1061
01:30:26,516 --> 01:30:26,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Maria.

1062
01:30:29,338 --> 01:30:36,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I was saying that, um, the point of having, uh, the names that we research randomly assigned

1063
01:30:36,508 --> 01:30:40,255
[SPEAKER_16]: is in order to maintain a level of objectivity.

1064
01:30:40,756 --> 01:30:44,643
[SPEAKER_16]: To simply go through the list and pick our three favorites completely

1065
01:30:46,078 --> 01:30:51,940
[SPEAKER_16]: gets rid of that aspect of objectivity because this is not about what we want.

1066
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,681
[SPEAKER_16]: This is about what the Medford community wants.

1067
01:30:55,682 --> 01:31:06,326
[SPEAKER_16]: And so if we're not going to research not only the impact that this will have on the community itself, as in, will this marginalize certain groups or not?

1068
01:31:07,626 --> 01:31:11,028
[SPEAKER_16]: And beyond that, will this be a positive influence, et cetera, et cetera?

1069
01:31:12,388 --> 01:31:14,209
[SPEAKER_16]: It just seems like we're,

1070
01:31:14,727 --> 01:31:20,168
[SPEAKER_16]: to just pick our three favorites is going against the purpose of this committee.

1071
01:31:20,688 --> 01:31:21,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information.

1072
01:31:21,888 --> 01:31:25,829
[SPEAKER_21]: We've already approved the resolution, so we don't have to have this discussion anymore.

1073
01:31:25,849 --> 01:31:28,290
[SPEAKER_21]: We should move towards keep the ball moving.

1074
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:29,650
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we've already voted on it.

1075
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:30,290
[SPEAKER_21]: It's done.

1076
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,750
[SPEAKER_21]: It's time to move to.

1077
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:34,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1078
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:36,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1079
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:40,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1080
01:31:44,008 --> 01:31:48,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chair, I just wanted to offer up to Ron as well and other folks the point they brought up.

1081
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:57,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we get assigned somebody who's not our first choice, we have the ability to talk to people who were assigned that person, right?

1082
01:31:57,093 --> 01:32:02,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And to put in your opinion to other members of the committee so that your voice is heard.

1083
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not locked out just because you didn't get that person.

1084
01:32:06,497 --> 01:32:07,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Patrick.

1085
01:32:07,918 --> 01:32:09,318
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, I'm semi-retired.

1086
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:13,100
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've done a lot of research on the internet on all these names.

1087
01:32:13,632 --> 01:32:19,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, the piece that I think I'm missing is the passion that allowed somebody to go to the website and pick a name.

1088
01:32:19,095 --> 01:32:21,416
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the only piece I don't have with me.

1089
01:32:21,797 --> 01:32:29,681
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's why I want to get to that point where the community either fills out a survey or tells us something more than what I don't think I already know.

1090
01:32:29,761 --> 01:32:37,746
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to see this move in an orderly fashion, because I do believe these debates and these subcommittee groups are going to be time consuming.

1091
01:32:39,947 --> 01:32:40,007
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1092
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:48,466
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, to move back to this, what we just passed now, we'll go back and we can take our list out and start.

1093
01:32:49,807 --> 01:32:54,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Submissions made in bad faith, not conforming with the submission of names consideration requirements.

1094
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:58,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, do we wanna go down the list and pull out names who are made in bad faith?

1095
01:33:00,213 --> 01:33:03,335
[SPEAKER_25]: Does someone wanna share their screen with that list?

1096
01:33:07,492 --> 01:33:15,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just want to point out that there was one name that was submitted on the same line as PeerPoint.

1097
01:33:15,534 --> 01:33:16,515
[SPEAKER_00]: The name was Fannie Farmer.

1098
01:33:16,655 --> 01:33:20,456
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not make it onto the list because it was submitted in the same line as another name.

1099
01:33:24,837 --> 01:33:25,498
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that name?

1100
01:33:27,138 --> 01:33:28,458
[SPEAKER_00]: The name was Fannie Farmer.

1101
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:29,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1102
01:33:30,599 --> 01:33:31,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Fannie Farmer?

1103
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:33,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1104
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:36,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Fannie Farmer.

1105
01:33:38,564 --> 01:33:39,745
[SPEAKER_04]: F-A-N-N-I-E.

1106
01:33:40,025 --> 01:33:40,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomber.

1107
01:33:41,086 --> 01:33:41,266
Yeah.

1108
01:33:41,947 --> 01:33:46,370
[SPEAKER_21]: I think she's on the big list, original list, but she got lost in the consolidation.

1109
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:48,712
[SPEAKER_24]: I have her on the list I'm looking at.

1110
01:33:48,732 --> 01:33:52,174
[SPEAKER_24]: I was sent today, I think.

1111
01:33:52,194 --> 01:33:57,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

1112
01:34:01,633 --> 01:34:12,061
[SPEAKER_23]: Jim, I had a clarifying question about the resolution that was submitted by Hendrik Giedones.

1113
01:34:12,462 --> 01:34:15,644
[SPEAKER_23]: So where is that now in terms of the agenda?

1114
01:34:17,165 --> 01:34:17,646
[SPEAKER_23]: What was the...

1115
01:34:18,871 --> 01:34:19,431
[SPEAKER_23]: Resolution?

1116
01:34:19,772 --> 01:34:25,897
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's a resolution to refer to the Medford Historical Society for assistance as part of the naming project.

1117
01:34:26,037 --> 01:34:38,126
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've reached out to the mayor and the Historical Society, the Historical Commission has no interest and no one available to meet with us or to do any work for us.

1118
01:34:38,206 --> 01:34:47,854
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone has anybody, you know, we'd be happy to have them come on and give us some advice, but that's the position of the Historical Society.

1119
01:34:48,607 --> 01:34:57,681
[SPEAKER_19]: My understanding is that the historical society will help us, but they don't have somebody that is available to come to the meetings.

1120
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:05,290
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need to submit materials to them in writing so that they can help us.

1121
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:09,074
[SPEAKER_19]: That wasn't the message I got.

1122
01:35:09,314 --> 01:35:16,100
[SPEAKER_19]: If that is no longer the case, this is what Susie Weiss expressed to me.

1123
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:20,544
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if this happened after

1124
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:34,036
[SPEAKER_19]: the mayor wasn't able to secure somebody from the historical commission, or if it happened before, but my understanding is that they were willing to help.

1125
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:38,818
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor was discussed, talked to Jim today, if I'm not mistaken, Jim?

1126
01:35:39,298 --> 01:35:39,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1127
01:35:40,519 --> 01:35:40,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1128
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was no availability, so.

1129
01:35:45,261 --> 01:35:45,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1130
01:35:47,582 --> 01:35:50,664
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have someone that will, Henrik, that wants to

1131
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:54,467
[SPEAKER_10]: We're you know, they should contact.

1132
01:35:56,008 --> 01:35:56,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1133
01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the mayor Jim's for the chair.

1134
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:03,035
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a point of information.

1135
01:36:03,535 --> 01:36:10,522
[SPEAKER_17]: It was to answer our chairman's question about suggestions made maybe not in the best faith.

1136
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:13,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Kate Elwell suggested color school.

1137
01:36:14,766 --> 01:36:15,727
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think

1138
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:26,143
[SPEAKER_17]: It was well intended, but her description is that her five-year-old came up with it and she sort of just hoped it wouldn't offend anybody.

1139
01:36:26,163 --> 01:36:35,107
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that's, you know, a thoughtful way to do it, but I don't think it gets to the core of what we're trying to accomplish.

1140
01:36:35,127 --> 01:36:37,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1141
01:36:38,888 --> 01:36:46,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, so we want to go through this and make a list and then vote to take those people or those names off

1142
01:36:48,418 --> 01:36:50,279
[SPEAKER_10]: We can start from the bottom and work our way up.

1143
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be one of them we would include, but... Yes, let's do that.

1144
01:36:55,002 --> 01:36:57,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we get to the list and get rid of some of these names?

1145
01:36:58,564 --> 01:37:01,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chairman, I think we have nine minutes left.

1146
01:37:03,406 --> 01:37:06,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering if the same thing would be accomplished.

1147
01:37:06,408 --> 01:37:12,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if this went to the small group of five people and they saw Vito Corleone, then they would...

1148
01:37:13,396 --> 01:37:21,040
[SPEAKER_02]: give that the lowest grades all across the board, and then it would have a low score and just get filtered out automatically, I believe.

1149
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe he said at the beginning, it had to be public, right, Elisa?

1150
01:37:24,581 --> 01:37:26,202
[SPEAKER_05]: This had to be done in public?

1151
01:37:27,262 --> 01:37:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is not public, so long as there's not a quorum, Paul.

1152
01:37:32,505 --> 01:37:39,188
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a quorum of the committee, then it's subject to open meeting law, but a group of five of us is not going to

1153
01:37:41,071 --> 01:37:44,954
[SPEAKER_02]: meet the requirement as I understand it.

1154
01:37:45,294 --> 01:37:55,442
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Grace's original motion was that we would go through the names here and then the names that weren't eliminated would then be split out randomly.

1155
01:37:56,783 --> 01:38:01,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, living or dead is easy to sort out, so that we can do clerically.

1156
01:38:01,646 --> 01:38:07,231
[SPEAKER_21]: I think whether it's frivolous or not may be subject to a debate.

1157
01:38:08,228 --> 01:38:18,475
[SPEAKER_21]: So that may need to go to subcommittee, but certainly on this list are names that can be eliminated without a discussion about dead or alive, and that can move on.

1158
01:38:18,716 --> 01:38:23,699
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I think in subcommittee, a name like colors would be taken care of.

1159
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:24,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

1160
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,122
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could just accelerate our process.

1161
01:38:27,342 --> 01:38:31,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Second, from the bottom, we have a submission that says, please do not change the name.

1162
01:38:31,845 --> 01:38:35,868
[SPEAKER_17]: I think ones like that are also pretty easy to eliminate.

1163
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:37,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just scanning through now.

1164
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:45,611
[SPEAKER_22]: I would like to bring up looking at the rankings of the names.

1165
01:38:46,752 --> 01:38:50,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, they're not rankings, they're just a tally.

1166
01:38:51,353 --> 01:38:53,074
[SPEAKER_22]: The tally, yes, thank you.

1167
01:38:53,974 --> 01:38:58,836
[SPEAKER_22]: Mystic Elementary School has received 22 votes.

1168
01:38:58,956 --> 01:39:06,299
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm wondering about Mystic was also an entry, at least three.

1169
01:39:07,723 --> 01:39:09,524
[SPEAKER_22]: received at least three, I think.

1170
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:12,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, as well.

1171
01:39:12,506 --> 01:39:14,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they got grouped in together with Mystic.

1172
01:39:15,187 --> 01:39:23,952
[SPEAKER_10]: We could have discussion on that as far as that's just a person that I had do the thing, the tally for me, grouped them together.

1173
01:39:23,972 --> 01:39:28,494
[SPEAKER_10]: But I realized there was distinction between the two that we would have to discuss.

1174
01:39:29,155 --> 01:39:30,035
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah.

1175
01:39:30,215 --> 01:39:33,577
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would like to have those be separate.

1176
01:39:34,721 --> 01:39:35,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1177
01:39:36,982 --> 01:39:45,705
[SPEAKER_19]: We cannot use the ranked list as our working list because it's not a ranking.

1178
01:39:47,086 --> 01:39:56,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand but that's what it says on the it's it's a an edited version of we can't work from an edited version.

1179
01:39:56,569 --> 01:40:03,452
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't uh we're working from the original list or are we working from

1180
01:40:05,974 --> 01:40:07,374
[SPEAKER_19]: The revised list.

1181
01:40:09,776 --> 01:40:12,937
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be the original list just changed into a shorter format.

1182
01:40:14,878 --> 01:40:20,321
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the one that Susie Weiss sent us today is an attachment was just cleaned up and they're all alphabetical.

1183
01:40:22,362 --> 01:40:22,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1184
01:40:23,547 --> 01:40:28,910
[SPEAKER_21]: I do think it's important to have an official list as we just found out Fannie Farmer somehow got lost in the transition.

1185
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:40,257
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm also suggesting that maybe a couple of people on this committee can take the task of individually vetting the list for dead or alive and inappropriate, and then work together to come up with a final list.

1186
01:40:40,477 --> 01:40:41,798
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I just think, you know,

1187
01:40:42,418 --> 01:40:43,898
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no debate in some of the stuff.

1188
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:46,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything debatable stays on the list, just to suggest.

1189
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:52,860
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we just, I know some names right now, like Diane Caldwell Elementary, Diane is still alive, thank goodness.

1190
01:40:53,721 --> 01:40:55,501
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can, you know, take that one off.

1191
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:59,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Joan Buckley Yeager, she's also still alive.

1192
01:40:59,782 --> 01:41:03,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Kamala Harris, back, you know, Kamala Harris, that can come off the list.

1193
01:41:04,363 --> 01:41:05,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Marie Cassidy also.

1194
01:41:06,444 --> 01:41:09,544
[SPEAKER_24]: Those are the four I had of people that I know that still work.

1195
01:41:11,085 --> 01:41:11,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Anthony Fauci.

1196
01:41:12,665 --> 01:41:14,206
[SPEAKER_24]: Anthony Fauci too, right, that's another one.

1197
01:41:15,888 --> 01:41:19,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I also found kids and dragons, which didn't.

1198
01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:21,772
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think anything, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1199
01:41:21,932 --> 01:41:22,753
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it.

1200
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:33,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything that I think dead or alive, we could do clerically, but anything relating to whether it was in good faith or bad faith, or whether it meets the requirements, we really do need to debate.

1201
01:41:34,523 --> 01:41:34,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1202
01:41:35,691 --> 01:41:45,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Would it be possible to share screens with the original list so that we're able to actually see the list together and possibly take off names right now?

1203
01:41:45,655 --> 01:41:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Extremely small.

1204
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't receive an updated list today.

1205
01:41:51,918 --> 01:42:01,102
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, if we're working with a shared document, we could also continue this work.

1206
01:42:01,463 --> 01:42:04,564
[SPEAKER_23]: We could just begin to edit it and then

1207
01:42:05,293 --> 01:42:09,439
[SPEAKER_23]: make comments and such, and so we would be able to see what the comments are.

1208
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:14,385
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a second tab here that's the cleaned up list of names at the bottom there.

1209
01:42:16,788 --> 01:42:17,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you click on that one?

1210
01:42:19,492 --> 01:42:20,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Whoever's sharing that?

1211
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:24,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, sorry, I'm sharing.

1212
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:25,591
[SPEAKER_24]: What am I clicking on?

1213
01:42:25,911 --> 01:42:28,292
[SPEAKER_24]: The cleaned up list at the bottom, Caitlin.

1214
01:42:28,712 --> 01:42:29,473
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a separate tab.

1215
01:42:29,493 --> 01:42:30,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, the tab, yep.

1216
01:42:30,953 --> 01:42:31,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1217
01:42:31,374 --> 01:42:34,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, that's the one I was referring to, and Franny Farmer is on it, Joes.

1218
01:42:35,075 --> 01:42:38,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, should I scroll down to the bottom or to the top?

1219
01:42:40,177 --> 01:42:41,178
[SPEAKER_24]: So that right there.

1220
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:44,579
[SPEAKER_19]: So on this list, Mystic and Missituk is still a single entry.

1221
01:42:44,599 --> 01:42:46,500
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, it should be two entries, correct?

1222
01:42:49,381 --> 01:42:51,202
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, those are separate entries.

1223
01:42:52,964 --> 01:42:54,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

1224
01:42:54,164 --> 01:42:55,405
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to put a new line in.

1225
01:42:57,805 --> 01:43:11,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1226
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, folks, it's 7.58.

1227
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:14,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to note the time.

1228
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know when our next meeting is?

1229
01:43:18,911 --> 01:43:21,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was scheduled yet, but that's Jim's question.

1230
01:43:24,369 --> 01:43:26,670
[SPEAKER_24]: I just didn't know if it was already settled and I missed it, sorry.

1231
01:43:27,351 --> 01:43:30,032
[SPEAKER_24]: Jim, do we know when our next meeting is gonna be?

1232
01:43:30,052 --> 01:43:37,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So Susan had put a questionnaire out for everybody and I'll have to get back to her and see what, I think we were talking one a week.

1233
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:52,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after seeing the way things progressed tonight, I think we're gonna request that we should request another week on the other end from the mayor past that deadline of the 24th, maybe get us to June 1st.

1234
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:56,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I have a motion?

1235
01:43:57,391 --> 01:43:58,591
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a suggestion, too.

1236
01:43:58,611 --> 01:44:02,653
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it would be a real good use of our time during the week.

1237
01:44:02,693 --> 01:44:04,654
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some action items that we can approach.

1238
01:44:05,314 --> 01:44:16,699
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we can't do public meeting stuff, but clerical stuff like making sure this list is fixed and preparing for how the subcommittees are going to open up, those might be things we want to hit the ground running next week.

1239
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:17,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1240
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:28,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to extend one week, Mr. Chairman.

1241
01:44:29,049 --> 01:44:34,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I get a second on that motion to request an extension from the mayor for another week beyond the scheduled 24th?

1242
01:44:34,613 --> 01:44:35,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1243
01:44:36,675 --> 01:44:37,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you second that for me?

1244
01:44:37,935 --> 01:44:40,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1245
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:41,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Any discussion?

1246
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:43,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, please.

1247
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:45,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

1248
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:47,923
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the things that's important to me

1249
01:44:50,551 --> 01:45:03,035
[SPEAKER_20]: have this happening in a timeline that can actually sync up to the end of school for this academic year.

1250
01:45:04,116 --> 01:45:19,021
[SPEAKER_20]: As the parent of a fifth grader, it's important to me to have a timeline that can actually have the renaming ceremony, what I would hope be part of

1251
01:45:22,193 --> 01:45:28,779
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something that my daughter is really looking forward to it's part of why I volunteered for the committee itself.

1252
01:45:29,379 --> 01:45:35,424
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that there are other parents of fifth graders and other parents here to that might be a consideration.

1253
01:45:38,925 --> 01:45:47,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to intercede, but I don't think that you can make a motion to extend it by a week because the mayor can't make that decision.

1254
01:45:47,271 --> 01:45:48,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be the school committee as a whole.

1255
01:45:48,812 --> 01:45:50,173
[SPEAKER_04]: She's only one vote on the school committee.

1256
01:45:50,193 --> 01:45:52,474
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanted to ask the mayor for the extension, was the motion.

1257
01:45:53,675 --> 01:45:56,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, it would have to go to the school committee for a vote.

1258
01:45:58,178 --> 01:45:59,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So we meet on the 10th.

1259
01:46:01,176 --> 01:46:05,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose we could try to add it to the 10th's agenda if that's necessary.

1260
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:24,316
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gonna try and stay within schedule, but we're asking for the other week at the other end, because just to get that- From a point of order, sir, that's not within our, that's not how we've been charged and what the resolution that actually formed the committee, that's not necessarily how it works.

1261
01:46:24,376 --> 01:46:25,537
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not just asking the mayor.

1262
01:46:26,696 --> 01:46:28,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have to go.

1263
01:46:28,638 --> 01:46:29,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I just said.

1264
01:46:29,318 --> 01:46:30,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have to go to the school committee for a vote.

1265
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a school committee.

1266
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:34,042
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has only one vote on the school committee.

1267
01:46:34,563 --> 01:46:46,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, if in fact the committee could not come to, could not submit three names, I believe by,

1268
01:46:47,816 --> 01:46:51,644
[SPEAKER_04]: May 24 meeting that the school committee would.

1269
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:58,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the school committee is going to want to name change, I believe it says by July 31.

1270
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:05,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure the renaming ceremony would be able to take place by the end of the academic year.

1271
01:47:06,381 --> 01:47:09,903
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, that's just a pie in the sky at this point.

1272
01:47:09,983 --> 01:47:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a long way to go before we get there.

1273
01:47:12,724 --> 01:47:16,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that there is a July 31st final possible.

1274
01:47:16,365 --> 01:47:19,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that they wanted initially

1275
01:47:27,651 --> 01:47:37,277
[SPEAKER_04]: a presentation by the May 17th meeting, but it would accept that presentation for the May 24th meeting if that worked better for this committee.

1276
01:47:37,337 --> 01:47:50,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I don't know if that is helpful and if not, then I would suggest touching base with Susie because it would have to go on the agenda for the May 10th meeting and the agenda has to be posted by Thursday at four.

1277
01:47:51,221 --> 01:48:15,395
[SPEAKER_21]: point of information I just the resolution it says timeline changes shall not exceed the final date of July 31st so we can make a request but it is a provision in the resolution to be able to change the timeline whether we do or not I don't think we need to do it tonight well I think we should put the request in tonight because it's gonna take a week to get on the agenda at the school committee

1278
01:48:16,327 --> 01:48:20,670
[SPEAKER_21]: My only concern is we may want to extend it two weeks after we get through the next process.

1279
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:30,056
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, I don't think we have to get it done for this week because we have till the 24th to before we have to request it.

1280
01:48:30,156 --> 01:48:31,997
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just saying that we haven't even got into

1281
01:48:33,015 --> 01:48:34,055
[SPEAKER_21]: really anything yet.

1282
01:48:35,836 --> 01:48:37,676
[SPEAKER_21]: We may need two weeks.

1283
01:48:37,916 --> 01:48:40,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Why go now and ask for one and then come back again?

1284
01:48:40,637 --> 01:48:44,938
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we should just table that until we get this subcommittee thing going.

1285
01:48:45,438 --> 01:48:45,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a thought.

1286
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree the way we're going right now.

1287
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we'll make two weeks.

1288
01:48:55,961 --> 01:48:57,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I withdraw my motion.

1289
01:48:57,621 --> 01:48:58,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I withdraw my ask.

1290
01:48:59,082 --> 01:48:59,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's put it that way.

1291
01:48:59,802 --> 01:49:00,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get the motion.

1292
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:06,079
[SPEAKER_13]: When I look at this rubric, I don't really understand why we're going through this process of cutting down the list in the first place.

1293
01:49:06,199 --> 01:49:11,900
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're all randomly assigned five names, four of them are obviously not approachable.

1294
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:14,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you rate one higher, and the other four have gone away.

1295
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,981
[SPEAKER_13]: You end up with 15 high ones when they're all turned in.

1296
01:49:17,021 --> 01:49:17,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know.

1297
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:24,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also, why we're talking about subcommittees when there's nothing on this list that says subcommittees?

1298
01:49:24,222 --> 01:49:26,042
[SPEAKER_13]: It all says about individual research.

1299
01:49:27,383 --> 01:49:29,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't really have to go through this cutting down.

1300
01:49:30,819 --> 01:49:37,945
[SPEAKER_13]: If we use the rubric, we rate the ones we like or we think are the best ones that we think are the best.

1301
01:49:38,485 --> 01:49:45,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, I do think the resolution we voted for talks about five member subcommittees taking five names.

1302
01:49:46,111 --> 01:49:48,754
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it says five members of the advisory committee at random.

1303
01:49:48,934 --> 01:49:53,778
[SPEAKER_13]: These committee members individually research and evaluate the submissions according to the rubric.

1304
01:49:53,938 --> 01:49:55,539
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no subcommittee name in here.

1305
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:56,940
[SPEAKER_21]: There's got to be.

1306
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,323
[SPEAKER_21]: What do we do with that information once we get it?

1307
01:50:00,745 --> 01:50:02,887
[SPEAKER_13]: You get five names.

1308
01:50:03,267 --> 01:50:04,848
[SPEAKER_13]: You attach a rubric to it.

1309
01:50:05,228 --> 01:50:05,889
[SPEAKER_13]: You hand it in.

1310
01:50:06,309 --> 01:50:08,290
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 15 that float to the top.

1311
01:50:09,031 --> 01:50:13,614
[SPEAKER_13]: So when people say submitting three or five, there's none of that in here.

1312
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:16,716
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 15 that rise to the top.

1313
01:50:17,897 --> 01:50:21,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of five, it's 15 names.

1314
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,021
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it is.

1315
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:24,782
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's all laid out there.

1316
01:50:24,802 --> 01:50:29,885
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have to spend time eliminating all these people.

1317
01:50:31,874 --> 01:50:39,018
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're gonna get that, if you're gonna get something like a Dragon School or whatever, you're obviously in the rubric gonna make that really low, right?

1318
01:50:40,059 --> 01:50:43,240
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you get George Stearns, maybe we'll make it up a little bit higher.

1319
01:50:44,241 --> 01:50:48,423
[SPEAKER_13]: So that George Stearns probably gonna make the top 15, maybe not, just throwing it out there.

1320
01:50:49,244 --> 01:50:51,645
[SPEAKER_13]: That top 15 is what we're gonna discuss.

1321
01:50:52,826 --> 01:50:58,709
[SPEAKER_13]: That top 15 could be selected by our next meeting, if somebody just randomly assigns these names.

1322
01:50:59,824 --> 01:51:01,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what, that's how I read this rubric.

1323
01:51:01,786 --> 01:51:05,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see some clarification though on that, Matt.

1324
01:51:05,169 --> 01:51:17,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were questions earlier about, you know, whether it would violate public meeting law if five people met and there was a discussion about, you know, five people did, you know, when do they meet?

1325
01:51:18,786 --> 01:51:22,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a discussion about the five people being the same group.

1326
01:51:22,308 --> 01:51:25,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear what you're saying about the language.

1327
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:29,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry to interrupt, Patrick, but it's individually researched.

1328
01:51:29,953 --> 01:51:32,095
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't say meaning the five people.

1329
01:51:32,335 --> 01:51:35,377
[SPEAKER_13]: It's numbers, and you're individually researching them.

1330
01:51:35,897 --> 01:51:37,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Apply the rubric to it.

1331
01:51:37,498 --> 01:51:45,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And the individually could mean each person is individually researched, not that the research is done by individuals separately.

1332
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:55,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was very clear that her intent was to have five people meeting to talk about this.

1333
01:51:55,742 --> 01:52:11,567
[SPEAKER_20]: But in order to do that, we would actually have to divide the entire list into chunks that we're going to hand to singular groups of five people.

1334
01:52:11,607 --> 01:52:15,789
[SPEAKER_20]: And those would actually then become, in effect, subcommittees.

1335
01:52:16,673 --> 01:52:29,188
[SPEAKER_20]: If it is actually randomized, what it is is that we have a full list that's divided by 23 people five times.

1336
01:52:30,349 --> 01:52:36,757
[SPEAKER_25]: What if we took the start of next week's meeting to use the random number generator, but the random

1337
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:41,171
[SPEAKER_25]: number generator to break these up into chunks of five names.

1338
01:52:41,251 --> 01:52:46,252
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we actually split into separate Zoom rooms over the course of the next meeting.

1339
01:52:46,312 --> 01:52:47,933
[SPEAKER_25]: And we do this for the next meeting.

1340
01:52:49,473 --> 01:52:50,954
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think we need clarification.

1341
01:52:51,314 --> 01:52:53,194
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds like a subcommittee meeting to me.

1342
01:52:53,654 --> 01:53:01,477
[SPEAKER_21]: But if we're all just picking, give me five names, I'm vetting them to the rubric, why not give me, I'll give you my five top?

1343
01:53:01,537 --> 01:53:03,237
[SPEAKER_21]: That really makes more sense to me.

1344
01:53:03,297 --> 01:53:05,758
[SPEAKER_21]: Because if I get five names that I have no interest in,

1345
01:53:06,772 --> 01:53:09,194
[SPEAKER_21]: then what am I supposed to vote other than a zero?

1346
01:53:09,795 --> 01:53:11,396
[SPEAKER_21]: It just doesn't make balance to me.

1347
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,038
[SPEAKER_25]: It's supposed to be unbiased.

1348
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:16,501
[SPEAKER_25]: You're supposed to be given five names that in theory mean nothing to you.

1349
01:53:17,542 --> 01:53:29,933
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you go off and research them and you rate based on- I agree, but I just think the value is, my top five is more valuable than me betting based on a generic number.

1350
01:53:30,649 --> 01:53:34,370
[SPEAKER_18]: But Ron, we've already wrote it on the rubric.

1351
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:37,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, we've already wrote it on the rubric and it says random.

1352
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:41,732
[SPEAKER_18]: So we would have to go back and design something new if we were going to do that.

1353
01:53:42,172 --> 01:53:44,313
[SPEAKER_13]: It says random and individual as well.

1354
01:53:44,533 --> 01:53:45,173
[SPEAKER_13]: And individual.

1355
01:53:45,233 --> 01:53:45,913
[SPEAKER_13]: It's individual.

1356
01:53:46,133 --> 01:53:48,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say community point of order.

1357
01:53:49,554 --> 01:53:52,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also, it's not people being assigned five names.

1358
01:53:52,615 --> 01:53:55,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that five people are assigned the same name.

1359
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:00,272
[SPEAKER_13]: individual research.

1360
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:02,193
[SPEAKER_02]: How many, how many total are on the list?

1361
01:54:02,613 --> 01:54:04,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're not going to do the whole list.

1362
01:54:04,935 --> 01:54:05,195
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1363
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:07,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have other criteria to shorten the list.

1364
01:54:07,917 --> 01:54:08,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1365
01:54:08,377 --> 01:54:08,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1366
01:54:08,597 --> 01:54:14,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But about how many Jim are on the list is 84 now.

1367
01:54:15,882 --> 01:54:23,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that means that means each person on this list would get like close to 17 names to evaluate.

1368
01:54:24,554 --> 01:54:29,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I think we'll pull at least, it sounds like we could pull 15 off of that, you know, 84.

1369
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:30,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1370
01:54:32,162 --> 01:54:40,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so if it's 65 names, that means that everyone here is going to get 13 people to do their research on.

1371
01:54:43,353 --> 01:54:43,593
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1372
01:54:44,254 --> 01:54:44,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

1373
01:54:47,549 --> 01:54:49,049
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think we could do that.

1374
01:54:49,069 --> 01:54:51,790
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we could split it up tonight.

1375
01:54:51,970 --> 01:54:55,151
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we could do that, or during the week.

1376
01:54:55,191 --> 01:54:58,991
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think we need to wait till the next meeting, though, to randomly generate the group.

1377
01:54:59,011 --> 01:54:59,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you, Lee.

1378
01:54:59,952 --> 01:55:00,732
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have to wait.

1379
01:55:00,912 --> 01:55:05,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I think those randomized assignments should be done as soon as possible.

1380
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:06,513
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do that.

1381
01:55:06,813 --> 01:55:08,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we can apply our rubrics to it.

1382
01:55:08,934 --> 01:55:13,735
[SPEAKER_13]: So that next meeting, we can, or even before the meeting, we give those rubrics to Jim.

1383
01:55:13,795 --> 01:55:14,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And he can say, here's the top 15.

1384
01:55:16,491 --> 01:55:19,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we can discuss, Ron, the top 15.

1385
01:55:19,574 --> 01:55:20,114
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1386
01:55:22,016 --> 01:55:22,636
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way to put it.

1387
01:55:22,656 --> 01:55:26,059
[SPEAKER_11]: This is exactly what I had said, but only I had said three names.

1388
01:55:28,361 --> 01:55:30,003
[SPEAKER_23]: And not randomly assigned names.

1389
01:55:30,383 --> 01:55:30,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1390
01:55:30,783 --> 01:55:33,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, but you just, you know, you have the rubric.

1391
01:55:33,346 --> 01:55:38,050
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, you know, I have to say, Dr. Grace, I don't know her at all, but it's all, you know, this works.

1392
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:41,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Our next step shouldn't be cutting down this list.

1393
01:55:41,373 --> 01:55:44,175
[SPEAKER_13]: It should just be assigning these random names.

1394
01:55:44,585 --> 01:55:48,006
[SPEAKER_13]: the list will get cut down by nature and by the rubric.

1395
01:55:48,026 --> 01:55:52,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Still nobody, excuse me, just point of information, nobody's told me how to score miss a tech school.

1396
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,649
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still confused on that.

1397
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:56,750
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a scoring definition I don't get.

1398
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:58,291
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not in the rubric.

1399
01:55:59,991 --> 01:56:01,012
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know how I can score.

1400
01:56:01,452 --> 01:56:09,035
[SPEAKER_24]: I also think point of information too, is if we can get rid of some of the names, like we've already discussed, that's less names than each group has to deal with.

1401
01:56:10,063 --> 01:56:15,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Like why even bother going through the rubric process if we're not gonna, you know, if we need to take the living people off.

1402
01:56:17,365 --> 01:56:21,106
[SPEAKER_24]: So then we go down from 83 to maybe 70 or something like that.

1403
01:56:22,726 --> 01:56:27,087
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I think we've already tagged most of the living people and I see Maria has her hand raised.

1404
01:56:31,268 --> 01:56:31,668
[SPEAKER_23]: Maria?

1405
01:56:34,449 --> 01:56:35,269
[SPEAKER_23]: And you're muted, Maria.

1406
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:36,029
[SPEAKER_16]: You're muted, Maria.

1407
01:56:38,027 --> 01:56:41,388
[SPEAKER_16]: I wasn't a co-host, so I couldn't unmute myself.

1408
01:56:41,948 --> 01:56:45,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to ask, I dropped off for a bit.

1409
01:56:45,628 --> 01:56:50,409
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was wondering in terms of our next meeting date, was anything decided?

1410
01:56:50,429 --> 01:56:53,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to get back to everyone on that.

1411
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:58,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to see what Susan had put out a questionnaire for everyone.

1412
01:56:58,551 --> 01:57:04,652
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know what, I mean, my proposal to her was once a week.

1413
01:57:06,226 --> 01:57:07,767
[SPEAKER_10]: next Tuesday being the next one.

1414
01:57:08,807 --> 01:57:11,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll see what everybody's schedule fits better.

1415
01:57:11,168 --> 01:57:15,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm available any night myself.

1416
01:57:15,691 --> 01:57:19,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see what the consensus is for the next meeting.

1417
01:57:21,893 --> 01:57:35,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd also like to talk about how in terms of the randomization of groups and names, I do think that in terms of what we are removing, for example, as we have been doing

1418
01:57:35,802 --> 01:57:45,010
[SPEAKER_16]: in terms of vetting living people and some of the more throwaway quote unquote names.

1419
01:57:46,991 --> 01:57:58,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't necessarily think that that is something that we need to do on a live Zoom, wait until next meeting, someone else mentioned that, but I want to emphasize that we do have a timeline.

1420
01:57:58,481 --> 01:58:04,946
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that we should be at this point already pushing to delay that timeline

1421
01:58:05,747 --> 01:58:11,613
[SPEAKER_16]: when considering that this has already been so contentious and there have already been attempts to delay it.

1422
01:58:11,774 --> 01:58:24,767
[SPEAKER_16]: And so even if we do need to do some work that is not on a Zoom meeting, it's essential that we do it because otherwise we should not be part of this committee.

1423
01:58:29,476 --> 01:58:33,420
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to agree with what you said, Maria.

1424
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:43,589
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some items that we can, like it's a yes, no question when someone is either alive or dead.

1425
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:51,156
[SPEAKER_19]: And any of the different versions of Christopher Columbus, those are all gone.

1426
01:58:52,791 --> 01:59:04,635
[SPEAKER_19]: all of the things that are, you know, the dragons and children, that should probably stay on the list and just get booted through the rubric.

1427
01:59:05,596 --> 01:59:08,537
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that, you know,

1428
01:59:09,804 --> 01:59:16,992
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not going to stick to the top 15, but I don't think that we should be making a judgment call.

1429
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:28,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, if it's a yes, no question, alive, dead, or Christopher Columbus, you know, different version, yes or no, that's a very easy decision.

1430
01:59:29,255 --> 01:59:38,558
[SPEAKER_19]: All the other ones, I don't think we need to make a decision about them, let the rubric weed it out, like Mr. Havestro was saying.

1431
01:59:38,578 --> 01:59:50,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a few more that fall into the category that we can weed out though, like Vito Cuglioni, there's a few of those on there too that could be taken off.

1432
01:59:50,821 --> 01:59:55,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we should have that list next meeting and just do that right away and get rid of them.

1433
01:59:57,489 --> 01:59:59,330
[SPEAKER_10]: and then have the rest broken up into groups.

1434
02:00:00,511 --> 02:00:05,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the question is, can we do it before the next meeting so that we can review this?

1435
02:00:06,094 --> 02:00:11,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the question, then who's responsible for doing that?

1436
02:00:14,078 --> 02:00:25,804
[SPEAKER_20]: I think what we can do is maybe if we want to, depending on what the other committee members want to do, we can quickly just

1437
02:00:28,936 --> 02:00:37,403
[SPEAKER_20]: come up with a strike list immediately right now, do an up or down vote on whether or not we want to strike the list in total.

1438
02:00:39,025 --> 02:00:54,917
[SPEAKER_20]: And then if there are living names, for instance, that we miss, we'll have a document that the committee is

1439
02:00:58,959 --> 02:01:00,460
[SPEAKER_20]: that is available to the committee.

1440
02:01:01,541 --> 02:01:03,963
[SPEAKER_20]: We note that we're striking it from that list.

1441
02:01:04,944 --> 02:01:18,095
[SPEAKER_20]: And then from an administrative standpoint, the chair or one of the committee, it is administrative, so it doesn't necessarily need to be a part of open meeting, et cetera.

1442
02:01:18,995 --> 02:01:22,298
[SPEAKER_20]: The names get distributed.

1443
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:25,361
[SPEAKER_20]: We do our rubric, and then we have the rubric

1444
02:01:33,086 --> 02:01:35,808
[SPEAKER_20]: We have it so that we'll be the third meeting.

1445
02:01:35,828 --> 02:01:37,329
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking half with the rubric.

1446
02:01:37,509 --> 02:01:38,630
[SPEAKER_20]: No, this is the second one.

1447
02:01:39,751 --> 02:01:40,492
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want it.

1448
02:01:40,812 --> 02:01:45,296
[SPEAKER_20]: I want all of this to happen, or I would like all of this to happen before our next meeting.

1449
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:56,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, maybe it's it's too much, but I can't stay on any longer.

1450
02:01:56,664 --> 02:01:58,886
[SPEAKER_25]: I would volunteer to go through the chat.

1451
02:01:59,567 --> 02:02:00,908
[SPEAKER_25]: People have been chiming in with

1452
02:02:02,142 --> 02:02:06,064
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been doing all this legwork in the background with who they think is alive.

1453
02:02:07,244 --> 02:02:15,988
[SPEAKER_25]: I would volunteer to take those names, to take variations of Christopher Columbus, and to take out the ones that say, like, don't change the name.

1454
02:02:16,509 --> 02:02:17,429
[SPEAKER_25]: I wouldn't remove them.

1455
02:02:18,089 --> 02:02:23,412
[SPEAKER_25]: I will just copy them into a new column, and then be like, hey, this is the strike list.

1456
02:02:24,312 --> 02:02:27,974
[SPEAKER_10]: If we agree, they just get... The next meeting we voted up, yes.

1457
02:02:29,534 --> 02:02:32,377
[SPEAKER_21]: point of information on the shared drive that list we were starting.

1458
02:02:32,417 --> 02:02:35,701
[SPEAKER_21]: There's already been some editing being done, and that's great.

1459
02:02:35,841 --> 02:02:39,425
[SPEAKER_21]: We can all look at that shared drive to verify what's going on.

1460
02:02:39,465 --> 02:02:49,555
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the policies that we have have changed, so some names have already been tagged for elimination, but they won't be now that we've talked about it, to Hendrick's point about leaving

1461
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,352
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything that's questionable, just leave it on there.

1462
02:02:52,912 --> 02:02:57,116
[SPEAKER_21]: But we all have the ability to go to that shared drive to see the update.

1463
02:02:57,156 --> 02:03:04,502
[SPEAKER_21]: So whoever has authorization to do that, if Bree can get that up and running, we can all look at that shared drive during the week.

1464
02:03:04,562 --> 02:03:12,029
[SPEAKER_21]: Just Bree can send us an email saying it's been updated, and then we can vet it for ourselves and see if there's anything that we need to question.

1465
02:03:12,389 --> 02:03:16,273
[SPEAKER_21]: So to Seth's point, we come in here next week or whenever our next meeting is,

1466
02:03:17,170 --> 02:03:22,451
[SPEAKER_21]: let's get the list assigned and talk about other things while we wait for the vetting to be done.

1467
02:03:22,591 --> 02:03:24,412
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think it's all doable.

1468
02:03:24,472 --> 02:03:29,693
[SPEAKER_21]: We just, we're doing a lot of talking about some real obvious, you know, things that we've already started doing.

1469
02:03:30,073 --> 02:03:31,953
[SPEAKER_21]: And that share drive is there for that purpose.

1470
02:03:31,973 --> 02:03:36,154
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can all go see what Brie would be doing and just verify.

1471
02:03:36,254 --> 02:03:39,415
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think, who has authorization to change that share drive?

1472
02:03:40,515 --> 02:03:40,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody?

1473
02:03:43,696 --> 02:03:45,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that might be something to,

1474
02:03:46,892 --> 02:03:47,872
[SPEAKER_21]: worry about a little bit.

1475
02:03:48,173 --> 02:03:50,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't think I don't think everybody has it.

1476
02:03:50,954 --> 02:03:51,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, check.

1477
02:03:52,094 --> 02:03:54,175
[SPEAKER_21]: But I would say Brie gets the authority to do it.

1478
02:03:54,295 --> 02:04:00,097
[SPEAKER_21]: We can, Brie can send us an email on Saturday saying I've updated the list to the best of my knowledge, and then we can just look at it.

1479
02:04:00,838 --> 02:04:02,518
[SPEAKER_24]: Is Lisa Evangelista still on?

1480
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:04,319
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I am.

1481
02:04:04,799 --> 02:04:06,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Lisa, do you know, do we all have access to that?

1482
02:04:07,901 --> 02:04:08,461
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1483
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:09,181
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you?

1484
02:04:12,601 --> 02:04:17,563
[SPEAKER_23]: I've gone through the list and tagged at least most of the names I saw in the chat.

1485
02:04:17,584 --> 02:04:19,925
[SPEAKER_23]: So Bree, if you wanna double check that, that would be great.

1486
02:04:20,565 --> 02:04:24,707
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I also tagged some of the things that we suggested removing.

1487
02:04:24,747 --> 02:04:26,288
[SPEAKER_23]: They're still on there though, so.

1488
02:04:27,548 --> 02:04:39,174
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it would literally just be like Hendrick was saying, yes or no questions, variations of Christopher Columbus and fields where people literally said, don't change the name.

1489
02:04:40,131 --> 02:04:45,553
[SPEAKER_21]: And you may want to just, Bree, just a suggestion, just highlight things that are being removed and don't actually remove them.

1490
02:04:45,973 --> 02:04:48,133
[SPEAKER_21]: That way everybody understands what's going out.

1491
02:04:48,834 --> 02:04:50,134
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just going to say the same thing.

1492
02:04:50,194 --> 02:04:51,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe color code them red.

1493
02:04:51,775 --> 02:04:52,735
[SPEAKER_24]: They have to go or something.

1494
02:04:52,815 --> 02:04:54,135
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like that's already started.

1495
02:04:54,175 --> 02:04:55,696
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody's highlighted them in yellow.

1496
02:04:55,716 --> 02:04:56,356
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's good.

1497
02:04:56,376 --> 02:04:58,857
[SPEAKER_21]: At least, you know, what's being removed.

1498
02:04:59,877 --> 02:05:02,458
[SPEAKER_21]: It would be impossible to look at that list and not know what's missing.

1499
02:05:02,538 --> 02:05:04,839
[SPEAKER_21]: So that would be a good idea to highlight them.

1500
02:05:04,919 --> 02:05:05,759
[SPEAKER_21]: We all review them.

1501
02:05:06,237 --> 02:05:10,558
[SPEAKER_21]: And we agree first thing in our next meeting, just that's the list and distribute and let's move.

1502
02:05:11,638 --> 02:05:16,220
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm all for Seth, I'm all for getting this thing done for the kids, all for it.

1503
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,980
[SPEAKER_21]: And hopefully that's May 24th is a good date.

1504
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:28,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'd be nice if the next action step could be hopefully sometime this week is get these submissions assigned to five members.

1505
02:05:28,483 --> 02:05:29,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we do that or not?

1506
02:05:30,711 --> 02:05:33,413
[SPEAKER_13]: David Ensign, PB – He, Him, His): Before so we can do a little bit before our next meeting.

1507
02:05:33,473 --> 02:05:35,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to stay on task on these meetings.

1508
02:05:35,234 --> 02:05:36,014
[SPEAKER_13]: David Ensign, PB – He, Him, His.:

1509
02:05:36,014 --> 02:05:42,859
[SPEAKER_25]: : Well, if so, if I if we have all the names highlighted by end of week, which I can commit to do David Ensign, PB – He, Him, His.:

1510
02:05:42,859 --> 02:05:45,460
[SPEAKER_25]: : We can maybe, you know, Friday or Saturday.

1511
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:53,725
[SPEAKER_25]: We all agree yes or no on the strike list, then the numbers that are next to what's left we put those into a random number generator.

1512
02:05:54,386 --> 02:05:59,629
[SPEAKER_25]: And then that gives us the groups of five, then it's just a matter of who is in these groups.

1513
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,765
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.

1514
02:06:03,065 --> 02:06:06,726
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't meet on Saturday or Sunday because of open meeting laws.

1515
02:06:06,746 --> 02:06:11,507
[SPEAKER_25]: I meant via email, like via Google Drive.

1516
02:06:13,148 --> 02:06:19,090
[SPEAKER_13]: You were saying you were just going to do the random generator over the weekend.

1517
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:24,231
[SPEAKER_02]: We could vote for the random generator now, and then that's just an administrative procedure.

1518
02:06:27,432 --> 02:06:28,453
[SPEAKER_20]: And we could

1519
02:06:30,148 --> 02:06:33,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So we come out with a list Monday or Tuesday of the ones we're taking off.

1520
02:06:34,693 --> 02:06:41,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the random generator would already be give us our sub lists and our groups.

1521
02:06:43,381 --> 02:06:43,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct?

1522
02:06:46,445 --> 02:06:47,866
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that sounds right to me.

1523
02:06:48,126 --> 02:06:51,108
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm pretty flexible as Matt already suggested.

1524
02:06:51,168 --> 02:07:00,195
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, even if we were to parse out the list tomorrow and then we could remove the ones that are slated for elimination later too.

1525
02:07:00,435 --> 02:07:02,316
[SPEAKER_23]: So we don't have to wait.

1526
02:07:02,997 --> 02:07:12,544
[SPEAKER_10]: We could parse them all out and then- So can I get a motion then to parcel out the list and have it ready for

1527
02:07:14,107 --> 02:07:17,688
[SPEAKER_10]: with the random generated groups for our next meeting.

1528
02:07:20,709 --> 02:07:22,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get a motion on that?

1529
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:24,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a motion.

1530
02:07:24,290 --> 02:07:27,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, who's willing to work on this?

1531
02:07:27,551 --> 02:07:28,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Bree.

1532
02:07:29,352 --> 02:07:31,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to work with Bree on assigning the random?

1533
02:07:32,653 --> 02:07:36,874
[SPEAKER_20]: I can work to assign the random or I see some other names.

1534
02:07:40,135 --> 02:07:42,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, if I could, whatever's done,

1535
02:07:43,354 --> 02:07:56,003
[SPEAKER_04]: should probably go through the chair so through Susie through Jim like everyone should be on that same email or whatever so that Jim is everything should come from Jim per se.

1536
02:07:56,519 --> 02:07:59,561
[SPEAKER_04]: that goes out to the committee or goes into the committee, if that makes sense.

1537
02:08:00,021 --> 02:08:02,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1538
02:08:02,863 --> 02:08:09,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a motion that Brie, Caitlin, Seth, Jim, and was there anyone else?

1539
02:08:10,447 --> 02:08:13,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hendrick were the names I saw.

1540
02:08:14,189 --> 02:08:15,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I see Maria scratching.

1541
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:17,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if she was raising her hand or not.

1542
02:08:18,292 --> 02:08:19,812
[SPEAKER_02]: She was raising her hand, okay.

1543
02:08:20,493 --> 02:08:21,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So that those six people,

1544
02:08:23,054 --> 02:08:23,975
[SPEAKER_02]: by the end of the week.

1545
02:08:24,516 --> 02:08:25,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And Josie.

1546
02:08:25,416 --> 02:08:35,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Call the list, remove all the living people in the references to Christopher Columbus and assign them by the end of day on Friday.

1547
02:08:35,285 --> 02:08:42,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we start developing our route, that we have our rubric by the next meeting.

1548
02:08:44,512 --> 02:08:45,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Our scores.

1549
02:08:46,634 --> 02:08:46,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1550
02:08:49,835 --> 02:08:50,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Any discussion?

1551
02:08:50,695 --> 02:08:53,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question.

1552
02:08:53,557 --> 02:08:59,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we sure before we move forward that we're not violating any open meeting laws by forming into subcommittees?

1553
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:01,041
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not actually.

1554
02:09:01,101 --> 02:09:02,401
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to be sure of that.

1555
02:09:03,522 --> 02:09:08,865
[SPEAKER_21]: The only concern I'd add is that the assignment needs to come from Jim, who's the chairman.

1556
02:09:09,805 --> 02:09:10,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just need to add that.

1557
02:09:10,766 --> 02:09:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I put Jim in the motion.

1558
02:09:13,427 --> 02:09:13,607
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1559
02:09:15,068 --> 02:09:15,188
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1560
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:24,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick, you had Brie, Caitlin, Henrik, Maria, who am I missing?

1561
02:09:25,114 --> 02:09:26,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and Seth.

1562
02:09:27,455 --> 02:09:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Josie.

1563
02:09:29,336 --> 02:09:29,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Josie.

1564
02:09:30,377 --> 02:09:30,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Josie.

1565
02:09:31,037 --> 02:09:31,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Josie.

1566
02:09:31,577 --> 02:09:33,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, Josie as well.

1567
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:41,123
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting close though to Dan's concern about the open meeting.

1568
02:09:41,163 --> 02:09:42,043
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have- Right.

1569
02:09:43,064 --> 02:09:44,945
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't have- Are you on this, Patrick?

1570
02:09:45,005 --> 02:09:46,586
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're just making the motion.

1571
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making the motion.

1572
02:09:48,993 --> 02:09:49,894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not on it.

1573
02:09:50,654 --> 02:09:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Brie, Caitlin, Jim, Henrik, Maria, Seth, and Josie, correct?

1574
02:09:57,118 --> 02:09:57,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1575
02:09:59,319 --> 02:10:03,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Patrick, just a question.

1576
02:10:03,422 --> 02:10:10,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Patrick, are you saying they're just assembling the list, or are you saying the distribution process is going to be handled by Jim?

1577
02:10:10,987 --> 02:10:11,587
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that clear?

1578
02:10:12,407 --> 02:10:13,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I correct on that?

1579
02:10:13,928 --> 02:10:16,270
[SPEAKER_02]: That that group is responsible for assigning

1580
02:10:17,976 --> 02:10:30,464
[SPEAKER_21]: I would question the open meeting law being compromised if six or seven folks are doing the distribution without, you know, it sounds like to me it's an assignment that Jim can do as the chairman.

1581
02:10:32,345 --> 02:10:33,846
[SPEAKER_20]: We're just helping administratively.

1582
02:10:34,026 --> 02:10:38,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, just with the pulling numbers from a hat, essentially.

1583
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:46,654
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just saying the list could be done and I think Jim could pull the names out of the hat and make the assignments on his own without

1584
02:10:47,648 --> 02:10:49,330
[SPEAKER_21]: a third of the group.

1585
02:10:49,350 --> 02:10:55,896
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, however Jim decides to make it random, that's fine.

1586
02:10:55,936 --> 02:11:02,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I just, I feel like the list and I'll be happy to assign the list.

1587
02:11:03,083 --> 02:11:03,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take the list.

1588
02:11:06,566 --> 02:11:10,590
[SPEAKER_11]: My only question though, is if we break into smaller groups,

1589
02:11:11,905 --> 02:11:13,729
[SPEAKER_11]: and someone in the public.

1590
02:11:14,591 --> 02:11:17,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information, we won't be doing subcommittees.

1591
02:11:18,661 --> 02:11:21,604
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1592
02:11:22,244 --> 02:11:28,470
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to get a list of names that we're going to do the rubric on individually, and then bring that back and have discussions.

1593
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,011
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, correct.

1594
02:11:30,031 --> 02:11:30,932
[SPEAKER_20]: That makes more sense.

1595
02:11:30,952 --> 02:11:31,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1596
02:11:31,672 --> 02:11:45,885
[SPEAKER_20]: Every valid name will have five committee members assigned to evaluate according to the rubric that and then we bring it back to the meeting and then we will bring our individual rubrics of

1597
02:11:47,412 --> 02:11:53,955
[SPEAKER_20]: everything that gets assigned to us by the chair, and then we'll go from there.

1598
02:11:54,636 --> 02:11:55,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Perfect.

1599
02:11:55,836 --> 02:12:05,781
[SPEAKER_17]: And my understanding is the chairman will randomize the list, but he'll contact me or any of those people mentioned if we need to help.

1600
02:12:05,881 --> 02:12:11,984
[SPEAKER_17]: But I guess my question is, do I need to have involvement as suggested?

1601
02:12:12,004 --> 02:12:14,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Only to compile the list.

1602
02:12:15,206 --> 02:12:15,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry?

1603
02:12:16,109 --> 02:12:20,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Bri may need help compiling the list to make sure it's valid.

1604
02:12:20,291 --> 02:12:21,031
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's it.

1605
02:12:21,351 --> 02:12:25,232
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so anyone can send me all the information I'm good with or without it.

1606
02:12:26,673 --> 02:12:28,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Just cleaning it up, correct?

1607
02:12:28,474 --> 02:12:30,154
[SPEAKER_24]: That's their task, is to clean up the list.

1608
02:12:30,474 --> 02:12:30,734
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1609
02:12:31,435 --> 02:12:33,795
[SPEAKER_23]: And that doesn't have to be done in a meeting.

1610
02:12:34,016 --> 02:12:37,697
[SPEAKER_23]: It can be done virtually, individually, asynchronously, too.

1611
02:12:38,467 --> 02:12:48,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that would just be writing suggested removal for the things that are ambiguous and writing living if it's unambiguous and they're still alive.

1612
02:12:48,876 --> 02:12:49,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct?

1613
02:12:50,577 --> 02:12:50,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1614
02:12:51,638 --> 02:12:52,198
[SPEAKER_17]: And highlighting it.

1615
02:12:52,539 --> 02:12:55,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1616
02:12:55,761 --> 02:13:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So my motion is for Jim and the other named individuals that Lisa already went through the names perfectly to be

1617
02:13:09,284 --> 02:13:25,347
[SPEAKER_02]: to call the list to remove all instances of Christopher Columbus and all living people, and then to assign every remaining candidate with five committee members to their name.

1618
02:13:26,087 --> 02:13:26,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the motion.

1619
02:13:27,647 --> 02:13:28,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Second the motion.

1620
02:13:28,807 --> 02:13:35,668
[SPEAKER_02]: How they do it is up to Jim as the leader of the committee and the rest of the small group.

1621
02:13:36,949 --> 02:13:37,709
[SPEAKER_21]: Second the motion.

1622
02:13:37,829 --> 02:13:39,029
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all those in favor?

1623
02:13:39,944 --> 02:13:40,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1624
02:13:40,705 --> 02:13:40,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1625
02:13:42,766 --> 02:13:44,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I want to get on the list?

1626
02:13:44,548 --> 02:13:45,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1627
02:13:45,528 --> 02:13:45,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1628
02:13:47,450 --> 02:13:48,090

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1635
02:14:05,143 --> 02:14:05,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1636
02:14:05,443 --> 02:14:06,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1637
02:14:06,564 --> 02:14:06,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1638
02:14:08,485 --> 02:14:09,046

1639
02:14:09,892 --> 02:14:10,132
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1640
02:14:11,513 --> 02:14:14,414

[SPEAKER_10]: That's the doctor.

1642
02:14:18,976 --> 02:14:19,957

[SPEAKER_06]: So unanimous.

1678
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:15,867
[SPEAKER_19]: I got missed, but I vote yes also.

1679
02:15:15,967 --> 02:15:16,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1680
02:15:17,008 --> 02:15:17,468

[SPEAKER_19]: That was Hendrick.

02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:20,731

[SPEAKER_10]: All right, sorry.

1684
02:15:21,832 --> 02:15:22,432
[SPEAKER_19]: No worries.

1685
02:15:23,173 --> 02:15:23,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Hendrick.

1686
02:15:24,614 --> 02:15:25,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Vote was unanimous.

1687
02:15:26,815 --> 02:15:32,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we have our assignment for the next meeting here.

1688
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:38,344
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna come back with a list of the people we wanna strike off the list, the names,

1689
02:15:39,636 --> 02:16:06,929
[SPEAKER_10]: that wanna be taken off the list, and we're gonna vote that first thing, and then we're gonna have the names that are living, the names that are on any Columbus variants, the names of Vito Corleone, anything that was put on there that's not relevant,

1690
02:16:08,939 --> 02:16:23,377
[SPEAKER_10]: has a wrong intent, and then we're gonna break the list up and have groups already figured out who's gonna get, and we're gonna work through the rubrics.

1691
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:27,002
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not going to work through the rubrics in the meeting.

1692
02:16:27,022 --> 02:16:30,444
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd like to receive it before the meeting.

1693
02:16:30,764 --> 02:16:34,146
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to get our rubrics done before the next meeting.

1694
02:16:34,226 --> 02:16:35,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully, that would be a goal.

1695
02:16:36,368 --> 02:16:41,051
[SPEAKER_20]: We just voted on a resolution that we are all going to have homework prior to the meeting.

1696
02:16:41,311 --> 02:16:42,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand, but I'm just making sure.

1697
02:16:42,912 --> 02:16:44,453
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so we'll work on that this week.

1698
02:16:44,553 --> 02:16:45,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, everybody.

1699
02:16:46,348 --> 02:16:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: by end of day on Friday is when we should receive no later than end of day Friday.

1700
02:16:51,911 --> 02:16:53,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Our next meeting we have.

1701
02:16:53,312 --> 02:16:57,995
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully there's some data cruncher there because we're all going to have scores for rubrics.

1702
02:16:58,695 --> 02:17:00,216
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to go up the top 10 list.

1703
02:17:01,096 --> 02:17:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that was that was the motion.

1704
02:17:03,378 --> 02:17:04,918
[SPEAKER_05]: When was our next meeting, Mr. Chairman?

1705
02:17:05,919 --> 02:17:08,160
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't specified yet.

1706
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:09,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to get back to you.

1707
02:17:09,481 --> 02:17:10,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Get an email from Susan.

1708
02:17:12,683 --> 02:17:13,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, motion.

1709
02:17:13,904 --> 02:17:14,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

1710
02:17:16,721 --> 02:17:18,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone like to make a motion to adjourn?

1711
02:17:19,344 --> 02:17:20,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to adjourn.

1712
02:17:21,526 --> 02:17:21,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1713
02:17:22,347 --> 02:17:22,747
[SPEAKER_24]: I second.

1714
02:17:24,109 --> 02:17:24,910
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1715
02:17:24,930 --> 02:17:26,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1716
02:17:26,952 --> 02:17:28,073
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you, everyone.

1717
