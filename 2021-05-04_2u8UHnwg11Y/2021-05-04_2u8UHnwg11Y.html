    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=309.116s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=312.537s">And</a>  Josie Dufour.</p>

    <p>[Dufour]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=315.618s">Hi,</a>  I'm Josie Dufour. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=317.238s">I</a>  live at 28 Douglas Road, and I was a student at the Columbus School from 2012 to 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=324.78s">I'm</a>  currently in eighth grade at the McLean Middle School.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=328.941s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=332.844s">All</a>  right, I wanna get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=335.645s">I</a>  mean, we have a job ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=338.306s">Obviously</a>  everybody knows this has been a divisive thing in Medford and I hope that we can come up with three names that will do a presentation at the end to the school committee that will help to heal Medford, bring us all back together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=356.234s">And</a>  I hope that there's a naming ceremony and that there's a lot of people there <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=362.861s">we</a>  do some good work here and hopefully the right name comes out of this and they pick us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=369.105s">I</a>  wanted to read the advisory committee selection as kind of a guideline of what we're gonna go by here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=386.875s">Pardon</a>  me, it's gonna be three pages, so it's gonna take me a few minutes here, but the individuals up to three selected by the school committee staff, Principal Kathy Kaye and one MHS student member will be announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=398.502s">Each</a>  school committee member will select two members. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=401.423s">You</a>  all know this, but I'll breeze through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=405.505s">Participation</a>  by the Columbus School staff and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=412.009s">Work</a>  of the advisory committee, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=415.239s">At</a>  the April 26th committee of the whole meeting, a list of names submitted for consideration will be made public and forwarded to the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=423.682s">A</a>  file containing emails from the community members on topics of the renaming will be made available to the advisory committee members so that the advisory committee members all are aware of the opinions and concerns expressed by our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=436.005s">So</a>  everybody should have gotten that Google file with all those letters and had a chance to look through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=441.561s">The</a>  advisory committee will develop criteria for evaluating the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=444.962s">The</a>  advisory committee will determine the process for vetting the names, narrowing the field and submitting no more than three finalists to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=453.424s">Press</a>  relations will be directed through the advisory committee chair and members of the advisory committee are urged to send press contacts to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=462.846s">Advisory</a>  committee meetings are public meetings and must follow all requirements of meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=469.142s">The</a>  superintendent will provide a note taker and create minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=473.424s">It</a>  is expected that the advisory committee will need to meet three to five times and a majority of voting members will be required to reach a quorum for the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=485.27s">The</a>  advisory committee will hold at least one public hearing or issue one public input survey to solicit the feedback on the options they are considering per the charge of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=498.573s">as</a>  at least one of their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=500.594s">Advisory</a>  committee members may withdraw from participation by notifying the chair and will not be counted in subsequent quorum or voting requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=513.983s">Removal</a>  of a member is permitted by a majority vote of the advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=519.007s">The</a>  chair will notify the remaining members of the advisory committee of the reduction in membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=524.71s">No</a>  new members will be added to the advisory committee due to vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=529.039s">While</a>  consensus is always preferred, a simple majority of the total number of advisory committee members will be required to select up to three names that will be forwarded to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=540.708s">A</a>  major vote, a majority vote of the total number of committee members and not a vote of the quorum present is required for this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=549.235s">The</a>  advisory committee will present their recommendation for the new names of the Columbus Elementary School no later than May 24th, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=557.699s">A</a>  presentation will be given explaining the way the recommendations was arrived at and why the selected names were chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=565.402s">If</a>  a majority of the advisory committee votes to recommend the timeline change to the school committee, they may do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=573.046s">At</a>  the time the school committee will vote to approve or decline this recommendation, timeline changes shall not exceed a final date of July 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=580.529s">Once</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=585.458s">The</a>  Medford School Committee has received the names and presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=588.46s">The</a>  committee will vote either that evening or subsequent meeting not later than June 7th, 2021 to approve the recommendation given the authority for naming public school buildings at school committees authority law per Massachusetts General Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=609.054s">All</a>  right, so, and then I have one more page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=614.929s">It</a>  has a rubrics on it that the school committee forwarded to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=619.791s">Whereas</a>  the Medford School Committee has charged the Columbus Elementary School Renaming Advisory Committee with the task of vetting names, submitting for consideration and weighing relative strength of submissions against criteria the advisory committee will develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=634.159s">Whereas</a>  the criteria may include, but not limited to such factors as the potential for the name to bring the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=641.664s">The</a>  ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students and the name as a representation of Medford's community's proud history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=649.252s">Whereas</a>  the advisory committee must narrow the field of names to three finalists by May 24th, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=656.118s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the advisory committee adopts the following selection criteria and procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=662.659s">Submissions</a>  made in bad faith, not conforming with the submissions of names, considerations, requirements, or nominations of a living person are excluded for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=673.727s">All</a>  other submissions are evaluated upon the rubric below. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=678.851s">Submissions</a>  are scored by summing the numerical values. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=683.575s">For</a>  example, a four potential three role model and three represent would yield a score of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=689.359s">Each</a>  submission is assigned five members <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=692.679s">of</a>  the advisory committee at random. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=694.28s">The</a>  three committee members individually research and evaluate the submission according to the rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=701.363s">The</a>  15 submissions receiving the highest average score advanced to the consideration by the whole advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=710.107s">In</a>  the event of a tie at the cutoff, all tied submissions advanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=714.79s">The</a>  advisory committee conducts additional research and solicits public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=720.772s">All</a>  members of the advisory <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=722.611s">committee</a>  evaluate the remaining submissions according to the rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=727.076s">Evaluations</a>  previously made in step four cannot be modified. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=731.02s">The</a>  advisory committee deliberates to select three names by consensus, weighing the submissions, average scores, average values on each rubric <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=742.193s">to</a>  mention public input and research. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=744.414s">While</a>  consensus has not been reached, the chair will ask dissenting members to state their concerns for additional discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=751.597s">Discussion</a>  continues until consensus has been reached or the advisory committee acknowledges that consensus will not be reached. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=760.52s">The</a>  remaining names are selected by simple majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=768.51s">All</a>  right, that was, those are the guidelines that we're gonna try and go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=772.894s">We're</a>  gonna interpret them to work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=783.183s">But</a>  then, anybody have any questions on that, on those? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=792.971s">Did</a>  everybody got those pages? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=795.626s">I</a>  mean, our goal here is to shorten this list first, and then we'll get into some deep discussions about who we have left on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=807.174s">And</a>  then I would imagine we would use this rubrics to take, break off into groups here and do some research on all of our candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=817.781s">And</a>  I ask everybody to please have an open mind and listen to each other's when we get to speaking about <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=825.066s">the</a>  candidates that we have conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=829.409s">I</a>  know everybody has their own favorite maybe to begin with, but this is about MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=838.834s">It's</a>  not about what anybody individually wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=842.096s">It's</a>  what's gonna be right for that school going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=846.759s">And</a>  we have an opportunity here to heal any wounds and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=853.743s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=856.004s">I</a>  have a couple of things on the housekeeping here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=858.226s">I'd</a>  like to just get, there was, I saw on the agenda, someone put forth a resolution and we won't be entertaining any resolutions at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=870.516s">They're</a>  out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=871.457s">We're</a>  a subcommittee to a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=873.659s">We've</a>  been given our directive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=875.801s">We're</a>  not gonna change our directive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=878.683s">We</a>  don't have the authority to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=882.006s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=883.516s">I'd</a>  like to get to the list, I guess, if anybody has any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=886.597s">I</a>  had, let me say this, I had sent a list to Susan to put on and it wasn't, it was labeled a ranking and it wasn't a ranking, it's a tally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=899.881s">And</a>  it merely cut the list down from four or five pages to two pages and tallied up next to the name, how many submissions, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=910.421s">they</a>  received through that first survey process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=914.183s">So</a>  I don't want to say there was any ranking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=916.484s">It's</a>  just that the woman in my office that I had put it together, put the most at the top and then the rest at the bottom are in alphabetical order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=926.548s">So</a>  I want to go to the second page of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=932.09s">From</a>  there, I mean, one of the,</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=937.519s">I'm</a>  sorry, people have been trying to get your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=939.421s">I'm</a>  not sure if you'd like us to raise our hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=941.263s">I</a>  see Grace raising her hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=943.384s">I'm</a>  using the function. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=944.465s">I</a>  don't know which way you'd like us to.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=946.247s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=947.288s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=947.948s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=951.031s">Grace</a>  was first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=951.691s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=953.233s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=953.533s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=953.993s">Go</a>  ahead, Grace.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=956.175s">Grace,</a>  you're muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=957.456s">She</a>  can't unmute.</p>

    <p>[Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=958.898s">Hi.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=959.418s">Wait</a>  a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=962.961s">Yeah,</a>  Grace.</p>

    <p>[Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=965.54s">Hi,</a>  I'm not a host, so I couldn't unmute myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=971.342s">Just</a>  a point of information, the rubric you read was the resolution I submitted, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=978.805s">If</a>  we could have some clarification on that, it'd be great.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=984.546s">So</a>  that was given to me as part of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=990.448s">That</a>  was something you submitted after the fact? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=994.107s">Cause</a>  I like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=994.914s">I</a>  mean, that's, you want to.</p>

    <p>[Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=998.348s">Yeah,</a>  I submitted it as the fourth part of our agenda today as a selection for the following criteria to evaluate names since we weren't really handed, we were handed some vague stuff, but I broke it out into the rubric and submitted it as a resolution today.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1020.838s">Well,</a>  I didn't take it as a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1022.539s">I</a>  took it as it came to me from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1027.5s">because</a>  it was an added on to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1029.081s">Okay,</a>  so everyone had a chance to look at that, that rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1040.327s">I</a>  mean, to me, I wanna go through these names and eliminate who we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1045.47s">And</a>  then when we get to the people that we wanna discuss that are credible, we'll use the rubric.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1057.398s">Point</a>  of information, I thought that the agenda said that today's task was to develop the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1063.662s">And</a>  I thought that we would be discussing the rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1066.765s">I</a>  know I have some thoughts and the other people have some thoughts as well.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1073.209s">Is</a>  that, are we going straight to the names or I thought that- No, I was under the impression for what I was given is we had a directive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1081.755s">We</a>  weren't gonna develop any more criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1084.077s">We</a>  had criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1086.036s">No,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1086.876s">I'll</a>  go back to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1088.357s">Let</a>  me just pull up the or somebody else has a handy the text of the resolution of the of the mandate from the school committees that we are supposed to come up with a criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1098.122s">Somebody</a>  please correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1098.942s">I</a>  just read that.</p>

    <p>[Gideon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1102.624s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1104.704s">We</a>  are to come up with the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1106.245s">We</a>  are not to be given the criteria.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1109.628s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1110.048s">All</a>  right, so as a point of order, Jim, are we using Robert's Rules of Order to run the meeting?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1118.294s">So</a>  the format of- We are, but I'm loosely with the Robert's Rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1125.819s">I</a>  mean, if we have to raise hands and sit everybody back, this is a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1130.662s">It's</a>  not open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1132.463s">So</a>  I'll, you know, everybody's been made a co-host so they can unmute themselves and speak.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1139.807s">Yeah,</a>  and just the, so I guess the proper format then would be for somebody to make a motion to- Yeah, we're gonna get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1147.351s">What</a>  was brought forward and then we can have the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1149.652s">So</a>  I was gonna get to that on a rubric, but now I was, I guess I'm gonna see if everybody wants to, has their say about the format that we're gonna be choosing by, I mean- Point of information, please.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1167.462s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1169.076s">First,</a>  this is a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1171.638s">I</a>  think there are a lot of people besides the committee on here.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1174.64s">Yes,</a>  but the public isn't going to speak here.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1177.082s">No,</a>  I understand, but we are open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1180.685s">My</a>  understanding, I think Dr. Grace did a great job of coming up and getting this started by <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1186.929s">You</a>  know, I believe it was her who wrote this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1189.772s">I</a>  think a discussion, I mean this is kind of like a very big turning point of where we're going by setting up this criteria I'd like to, I'd like to have an opportunity to express some thoughts I have on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1204.008s">And</a>  once we decide on that, I think it would be a lot easier to go through these names, knowing what our criteria is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1211.05s">And</a>  I just think that, you know, this is why we're here is to have a discussion about the criteria for us.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1217.631s">So</a>  if, you know, if I'm sorry, if I was under the assumption, the criteria was given to us.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1226.192s">Okay,</a>  the role of the when we were assigned, we were giving a basic not not limiting to guideline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1234.876s">And</a>  I think, I think, Dr. Grace has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1237.197s">You</a>  know, if I could, I suggest that Dr. Grace explain her thoughts on where the proposal came from, whether it's a resolution or proposal, whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1246.321s">And</a>  then some of us who have thoughts on it may have a chance to discuss that and start a debate as to, and hopefully at the end of all of that, we do have a plan with set timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1257.69s">I</a>  know we're tied up against timelines, but I think this is a very crucial point of the process is this setting the tone for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1266.177s">So</a>  I yield to Dr. Grace if she'd like to speak.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1270.961s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1272.622s">Thank</a>  you, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1273.483s">Yes,</a>  I'll be happy to introduce this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1275.884s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1277.445s">I</a>  submitted this resolution because I recognize that as a committee, we have a lot of names that we have to examine and we have such a short amount of time to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1288.051s">And</a>  we need to find a transparent and equitable way that's also efficient and thorough for us to vet the merits of each of the suggestions that were brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1301.631s">And</a>  everyone who submitted suggestions did so, they took time, they took energy, and they were very thoughtful about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1309.899s">And</a>  we should also take our own time to evaluate each and every one of those in order to honor their time and the research that the community members have put into all of the suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1322.311s">I</a>  proposed the rubric because it enables us as a committee to share the burden of the research, along with the evaluation into smaller teams, while keeping the decision process objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1338.657s">And</a>  the three categories do align with the overall, what the community has indicated was most important in selecting the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1347.622s">And</a>  it also aligns with the language that was given to us by the school committee in their resolution that created our own committee here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1355.366s">And</a>  most importantly, overall, this procedure was designed to try and bring our community together and <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1364.071s">to</a>  ensure that as a committee, we consider multiple perspectives and encourage the committee in making a selection by consensus as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1375.273s">And</a>  so I just wanted to end with, I look forward to working with each and every one of all of these members on this committee, and I do move to approve this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1386.196s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1387.876s">Do</a>  I have a second for that?</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1394.005s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, I'd like to make a few comments before we move to a vote, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1401.747s">As</a>  I said, Dr. Grace did a really great job of starting this off.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1406.549s">Point</a>  of order, Ron, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1408.87s">The</a>  motion needs to be seconded before there's a discussion, so I second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1413.551s">It's</a>  not bringing it to a vote, but it needs to be seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1416.952s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1418.473s">I</a>  second it.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1421.014s">Okay,</a>  on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1422.853s">Okay,</a>  so in reading through this, I just thought there were some points that I need clarification on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1432.432s">My</a>  opinion of what's here, first, it says that no living names can be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1440.858s">That</a>  really was different from the guideline we received from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1445.241s">That</a>  was not included in their criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1448.403s">I</a>  also think that although the rubric is very good for evaluating names of individuals, there are a lot of names that were submitted by citizens that are not our people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1459.731s">and</a>  will not be able to be scored under this rubric as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1464.312s">The</a>  other concern I have is the division of, although it would save time for us to divide and conquer, everybody's scoring system, even though it's aligned here, would be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1477.316s">And</a>  I would not necessarily be given a chance to vote on something I feel strong about versus some of the other names. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1484.441s">I'm</a>  hoping that the committee has done some due diligence and looked at the names and has a pretty good idea of what names are valid and what can be thrown out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1493.426s">I</a>  had <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1496.588s">looked</a>  at an alternative which would could, you know, work with Dr. Grace's thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1502.093s">I</a>  think the rubric is really a great way of reviewing individuals if that's the way we decide, but I don't want to preclude the fact that there are some names in here that are not <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1514.19s">dead</a>  people and not people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1516.691s">So</a>  I don't want to preclude them just with this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1519.551s">The</a>  other thing I thought, you know, not to, I don't like to criticize without having an alternative to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1525.753s">So</a>  my thought was this, to combine the list, which we've already done, getting rid of the duplicates, which is great, reduce the list, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1535.313s">I</a>  thought it's important that everybody every citizen in Medford who thought enough to make this to fill out a name and identify the name and give a cause is something that if we do nothing else as a committee, we need to make the citizens of Medford feel like this is their choice, not ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1552.718s">So</a>  I think, I move that we look at a presentation meeting right away with the public, where they can each have three minutes to discuss why they put their name on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1565.029s">It</a>  probably will weed out a lot of people who, you know, don't wanna do that, but at least it gives us a chance to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1571.094s">You</a>  know, I've done my, you know, I went on the internet, I've learned about every name here, but I don't know the passion as to why people gave those names. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1578.908s">I</a>  think that in terms of scheduling, today's May 4th, by May 11th, we can hold a forum with three minute presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1587.312s">I</a>  think at that May 11th, we can kick off a citywide survey where people, all people, all 60,000 people in the city have an opportunity to give their opinions of what names they like. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1600.678s">It</a>  just is not as a binding vote, but as an opinion vote to help us make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1606.533s">I</a>  think on the 19th, the results of that presentation could be given to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1611.917s">And</a>  at that point, we can look at developing a list of 10 finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1615.84s">You</a>  know, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1619.696s">Everybody</a>  has a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1621.598s">Everybody</a>  here has an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1623.239s">So</a>  I think those finalists, those 10 finalists, or in case of a tie, it gets even longer, that list should go to the Historical Society for vetting in cases of people's name, historical names.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1634.949s">Can</a>  I stop you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1636.15s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1636.511s">Sorry</a>  to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1637.552s">The</a>  Historical Society has been, the Historical Commission has been notified and the Historical Society, and we don't have anyone that will, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1645.208s">Okay,</a>  as the time I want has any interest in doing anything for us.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1648.791s">All</a>  right, so somebody will have to vet them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1651.494s">Somebody</a>  from out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1652.995s">And</a>  then on May 21 have a final open forum for any citizen to give a comment on the finalist. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1659.702s">I</a>  think at that point, we'll have enough information given from the city, plus our views plus our conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1668.133s">On</a>  the 24th, we can have our final debate and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1672.534s">My</a>  goal would be that we all, 23 of us, come up with one name, not three names, one name in unity that we all agree to, to present to the school committee so it's a real true vision of what the citizens of Medford are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1688.448s">You</a>  know, again, I think Dr. Grace has given us a great start with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1693.529s">I</a>  just think that there are some pieces and the way we evaluate things going forward, we do need to agree on some kind of a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1700.811s">And</a>  bottom line is you're all gonna be responsible for the name you pick, and you all have your history and criteria from where you come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1708.333s">So</a>  that's my thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1710.794s">I</a>  have it in writing if you wanna see it, but that's my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1713.754s">I</a>  have a question of privilege.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1715.775s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1718.107s">Who's</a>  speaking? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1720.349s">I</a>  am, Seth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1721.629s">It's</a>  a question of privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1723.291s">Just</a>  because we're starting into discussions that might take more discussion, I just kind of wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1739.235s">as</a>  familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1741.156s">Down</a>  at the bottom of the screen is a button called Reactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1745.458s">If</a>  you click on that, there's a way there to raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1750.621s">And</a>  raising your hand will, on the side, make a list of people so that, Jim, as our chair, you can go down and order folks that might have something to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1769.445s">raise</a>  our hand like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1772.226s">And</a>  from a, as we discuss more of both Dr. Grace's rubric as well as Ron's ideas and theoretically more ideas to come, I think we will need some facilitation with <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1793.331s">with</a>  some more parliamentary rules as far as, you know, we have a motion on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1804.834s">We're</a>  discussing that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1806.714s">There</a>  are friendly amendments, those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1809.795s">So</a>  we'll just need to be able to facilitate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1814.056s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1815.696s">Anything</a>  else on the amendments?</p>

    <p>[Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1820.311s">Just</a>  a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1822.111s">I</a>  wanted to address one of the issues that Ron brought up with some of the names being suggested not being actual people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1833.993s">It</a>  is actually accounted for in the resolution itself, as they will be evaluated simply by example, since they won't necessarily be able to fit within the rubric because they are not people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1847.196s">So</a>  I just wanted to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1849.616s">And</a>  then I was just a little confused if Ron was trying to add amendments or if he was trying to propose a completely different resolution itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1861.305s">And</a>  if that's the case, we have to vote on mine first.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1864.667s">So</a>  to me, he was trying to add to your rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1870.231s">I</a>  mean, you were talking about using the rubric, but then adding additional language and dates of presentation to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1881.226s">So</a>  I would imagine we would vote on the amendment first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1887.869s">We</a>  want to add that, and then we'd vote on the rubric.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1894.792s">It's</a>  a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1895.993s">I'm</a>  new at this, so I did not get on the agenda with this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1903.356s">And</a>  I don't know whether it's a, I just presented it because I wanted people to understand that there is, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1911.167s">There's</a>  two points here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1913.428s">And</a>  again, if Dr. Grace could clarify, if I'm calling it the mystic school, how would I score it versus one of the folks, one of the people that is being named at? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1926.531s">That</a>  would be, how would I follow that criteria so that a number four, if I rated number four for ABC person, how would I vote number four for mystic and give you a ranking of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1941.021s">That's</a>  where I'm kind of confused.</p>

    <p>[Caldera]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1945.903s">They</a>  would be separated out so that those that are not by person are rated by the example that they set and how they represent the community and their proud history versus actual person or group. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1967.313s">And</a>  you can rate them through, and here I've written, it says, names not associated with a specific person are evaluated by example they set, such as exceptional, good, positive, neutral, or negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1983.348s">And</a>  then we can, from there, pick the top ones and move those forward, along with the other names when we <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=1993.117s">when</a>  we move on to further evaluation and other steps going forward.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2001.342s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2004.263s">Any</a>  more questions on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2006.224s">So</a>  I'm a little unclear where we're going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2015.81s">We</a>  wanna vote the rubric, is everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2021.454s">Like</a>  that part so far, we can move that along. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2023.835s">We</a>  had a first motion and a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2027.396s">I</a>  would call for a vote on that.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2028.616s">We'll</a>  have their hands up, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2032.097s">Sorry,</a>  point of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2033.097s">People</a>  have their hands up ready to speak.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2035.638s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2037.639s">Please</a>  speak out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2038.379s">Everybody's</a>  a co-host. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2039.659s">You</a>  can unmute yourself when you want to speak.</p>

    <p>[Gideon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2042.04s">This</a>  is Hendrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2051.55s">The</a>  motion that Ron suggested actually doesn't match up with what the school committee sent in their original resolution of what the work is that we're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2070.171s">the,</a>  we're supposed to give them three names, and then they're the ones who choose which of the three names are the one that is put forward.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2081.937s">But</a>  of information, if you read the directive from, I know it's confusing, I agree too, but if you look at the bottom of the charge that they gave us, it says up to three, we may present name, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2098.564s">hyphenated</a>  names. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2100.845s">So</a>  I do believe that either we get clarification, which they've already voted on it and it clearly says up to three.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2107.886s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2109.347s">It's</a>  up to three, but clearly we could give one if we, if we come down to it, but I don't, let's go slowly here and let's work towards this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2121.19s">You</a>  know, let's not make that an issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2124.371s">I</a>  mean, we're going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2125.39s">do</a>  our presentation at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2127.431s">I</a>  would hope that we get three names and we do a presentation on those three names and they make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2134.573s">I</a>  mean, we've got to do our homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2137.734s">There's</a>  clearly a lot of names on here that, you know, I know people just sent some names. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2145.116s">I</a>  mean, some of them don't belong on here, but we need to figure out a system to work through that and get it down to a shorter list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2155.339s">So</a>  I'm looking for a motion here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2158.744s">I</a>  have a motion for the mover.</p>

    <p>[Gideon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2161.474s">I'm</a>  sorry, Jim, I just wanted to finish what I was saying before the point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2170.059s">I</a>  think that any chance to open this up to a zillion people spending three minutes is going to open a can of worms that none of us here that have jobs or families wanna deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2188.094s">It</a>  will be absolutely interminable and people will not stay on topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2195.215s">We</a>  just don't have the time to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2200.696s">Once</a>  we have a small list, we can get people's feedback via survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2208.278s">I</a>  think that that's the fastest way forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2213.879s">We</a>  really need to <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2216.573s">get</a>  past this moment in Medford, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2222.096s">I</a>  think everyone can agree with that.</p>

    <p>[TjgvMpuq30w_SPEAKER_65]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2225.777s">Jim?</a> </p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2226.097s">Mr.</a>  Wooster? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2228.459s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2229.419s">OK,</a>  so I'm just curious if we pass this rubric, which I think is really well vetted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2235.702s">I'm</a>  just curious about number four. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2237.743s">So</a>  if we pass this rubric, number four says each submission assigned five members of the advisory committee at random. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2245.031s">Who's</a>  going to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2245.972s">How's</a>  that going to be accomplished?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2247.232s">Well,</a>  I would think that each person on that would break up into fives and each person would fill out one of these rubrics and then would have the discussion within those groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2258.839s">But</a>  I would think that we would collect them individually and just, you know, average out a score and then discuss them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2267.845s">I</a>  would also, this is after we've narrowed this list down and then <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2273.188s">the</a>  opportunity for everyone to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2274.849s">If</a>  you want to speak passionately about one of these people, one of these submissions, then we should hear each other and let each other speak passionately about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2282.912s">So</a>  we can hear the other person's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2285.653s">But</a>  yeah, so I saw that the five people, and I don't know how that in a group would work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2u8UHnwg11Y&t=2292.076s">I</a>  think that would be individual sheets for each person.</p>
