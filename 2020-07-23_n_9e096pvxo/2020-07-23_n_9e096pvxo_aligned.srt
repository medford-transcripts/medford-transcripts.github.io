1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:00,772
Great.

2
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:06,757
So first, we're going to talk about how COVID-19 is affecting folks in jails.

3
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:15,064
And I would love it if you would go ahead and just introduce yourself and how you are sort of related to this topic.

4
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:16,486
Sure.

5
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:18,528
My name is Caroline Bays.

6
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:26,615
I am the president of the Board of Progressive Massachusetts, and I've been working on criminal justice issues for a while now.

7
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:34,349
And I, oh, by the way, I'm also a town counselor in Watertown, so I could relate to what Zach was saying.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:51,042
But I have been visiting, as a result of my activism, I've been visiting a young man who's been in solitary confinement for three years, because he doesn't have any family nearby and has nobody else to visit him.

9
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:56,527
So I've been learning what it's like, really, almost as a family member.

10
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,551
for somebody who's inside prison, and especially inside solitary confinement.

11
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:02,671
Yeah.

12
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:05,252
Yeah.

13
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:14,214
Before we talk a little bit more generally about what's happening, well, you tell me, do you want to talk generally about what's happening in Massachusetts prisons?

14
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:18,695
Or do you want to go, should we just go straight at what's happening related to COVID-19?

15
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:23,336
I think let's start with COVID-19 and why it's so dangerous for them at this moment.

16
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:25,897
And then we can broaden it up a little bit after this.

17
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:29,834
So yeah, right now, I've actually been talking to him.

18
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:31,395
We've been emailing daily.

19
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:40,019
Right now, basically, paranoia and fear is running rampant through his tier.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,281
They're basically helpless.

21
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:50,665
They cannot leave their cells without touching, you know, people, things.

22
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:56,208
They have to be, I mean, to the point where they actually, every time they leave their cell,

23
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:59,728
even just for a shower, they're strip searched.

24
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:08,782
So they have no way of protecting their own bodies from the correctional officers.

25
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:11,527
In addition, the correctional officers are

26
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:17,996
from what he's saying, not taking it as seriously as they would like them to.

27
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:26,363
Just as of a few days ago, they were finally given masks, you know, face masks, the correctional officers, but none of them are wearing it.

28
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:39,354
They're putting them, you know, I'm thinking of all these doctors who were killing for masks and they're just putting them around their necks and joking about it and joking that they're gonna breathe on, that they'll joke like they'll cough.

29
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,811
act like they're sick and say that they're going to breathe on the prisoners.

30
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:49,352
And it's just very scary for the prisoners.

31
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,693
They're buying as much soap as they can.

32
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:54,074
They don't have any hand sanitizer.

33
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:59,055
Do you mean that the prisoners themselves are spending their own money to buy soap?

34
00:02:59,655 --> 00:02:59,995
Oh, yes.

35
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,496
Oh, that's true of everything.

36
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,096
That's the broader issue.

37
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,777
They have to spend their own money to buy toothpaste, toothbrushes,

38
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:11,880
If they want decent food, they have to spend their own money.

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:24,407
So before you go on, I do want to just mention, um, we have someone who's commented on YouTube saying, um, they're hoping to hear about what correctional facilities are doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

40
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:34,233
Um, and so it sounds like one thing that they're doing is they have, they seem to have obtained masks, which, you know, it's so incredibly important for our, like there's a shortage of masks.

41
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:40,301
And it's so important for our hospital staff and doctors to be able to have the masks that they need.

42
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:52,576
And of course, it's important for correctional facilities to have masks as well, but not if they're just wearing them around their neck and using it to, you know, taunt

43
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:54,727
The inmates.

44
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:55,548
Yes.

45
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:00,851
And they also said they were cleaning, like they were cleaning the showers.

46
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,792
They were doing things like that.

47
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:06,574
But as far as he could tell, the showers didn't look any cleaner.

48
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:14,358
They didn't have, he actually saw the cleaning supplies that they said there was going to be special cleaning supplies, but he's seen those cleaning supplies a million times.

49
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:15,599
It's the same cleaning supplies.

50
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,560
So they haven't, they're saying that they're doing things.

51
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,523
The one thing that they have done that is the best thing they have done is, um,

52
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,693
Unfortunately, he's in solitary confinement.

53
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:28,935
He does get one visit a week.

54
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:33,781
Understandably, everybody understands they've had to cancel all visitors.

55
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:42,730
However, they are in lieu of that giving them two extra phone calls a day, and they're giving them a free phone call.

56
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:45,173
And just that little step

57
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:54,697
I wish that the CEOs, I wish that actually the people who run the prisons could understand that little step goes a long way.

58
00:04:54,717 --> 00:05:07,711
It is so appreciated by Andrew, the young man I visit, and all of the other prisoners who have to endure being separated from their families.

59
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:08,317
Yeah.

60
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,238
So I'm going to jump in.

61
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:18,942
I can't resist jumping in here because I did spend two nights in jail in 2000 when I was illegally arrested for protesting.

62
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,824
There were about 71 of us.

63
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:25,446
We were illegally strip searched.

64
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:31,168
The women only were strip searched twice during our time there, and there was a giant lawsuit afterwards and all that.

65
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,891
But I will say that this was in Los Angeles, and I will say that we were

66
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:42,233
We were arrested and literally not allowed to wash in any way.

67
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:54,517
And the police who had arrested us had us leaning up against, like, pushing us against a chain link fence that was, like, covered in grease and oil because it was right directly underneath a freeway.

68
00:05:54,537 --> 00:06:00,699
And so our hands and our bodies were just, they had all this black grease all over them.

69
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,980
And we were not, there was no,

70
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:09,778
ability for us to wash anything at all for like, you know, 30 hours or more.

71
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:09,898
So,

72
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:26,183
And the whole taunting thing, people may not realize how much psychological games are played to inmates by correctional staff.

73
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:37,869
So the idea that correctional staff are joking about purposefully getting inmates sick with COVID-19, that is,

74
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:43,672
you know when this is real psychological

75
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,569
I mean, it's terrible.

76
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:48,930
That should not be legal for them to do that.

77
00:06:49,491 --> 00:07:00,097
And then I want to, for a second, before we go on, to talk a little bit about how dangerous it is to be in these close quarters with people.

78
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:08,703
I mean, we're talking about social distancing, and people who are incarcerated do not have that ability.

79
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:14,727
So can you talk a little bit just about how dangerous it is and if there have been any outbreaks inside of any correctional facilities?

80
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,887
There has been an outbreak in a correctional facility.

81
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,789
Quite a number of people have gotten sick.

82
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:29,213
I'm not up to date on today on what the numbers are, but it was 17 the last I'd looked.

83
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:43,562
I did hear from Chris Fallon, who said that they have lots of protocol and that he was going to keep people from being sick, but the protocol obviously is not being followed.

84
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:54,257
and people are getting sick, and the main problem is, and as you must have experienced and felt yourself, is just a pure helplessness.

85
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:59,059
We can control where our bodies go.

86
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:07,643
We can control what is gonna happen to us, but they are totally at the whim of other human beings.

87
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:09,444
They have zero control over this.

88
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,565
So the psychological sort of fear

89
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:40,512
even without another human being actively trying to terrorize you, the psychological fear is there already and the helplessness and the not being able to, you know, protect yourself is just, you know, it's heartbreaking to listen, well, I'm reading right now what Andrew has to say about the experience of being inside there right now.

90
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:44,667
We have another question here.

91
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:51,294
Are there ways for people to get involved and support the incarcerated population during this time of crisis?

92
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:54,077
Canteen money for soap, masks, letters.

93
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:56,700
I am sympathetic to those who are in prisons.

94
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,891
So letters are always appreciated.

95
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:05,674
There's several different, you can go online and find, you know, write a prisoner.

96
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:09,495
There's a couple of websites that can match you up with prisoners.

97
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,736
I can't tell you how much letters are appreciated.

98
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:23,422
Once you've established a relationship, it's a little difficult to get money to somebody, but once you've established a relationship, they can describe how you need to, how you can

99
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,012
get some money for people.

100
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:29,134
There's no donation for getting things.

101
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:36,639
It's actually quite difficult to get anything to a friend or relative.

102
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,541
And you can't buy it for them.

103
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,042
They have to buy it themselves.

104
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:49,066
And it's only prison-approved things from the canteen that are allowed to go into their cells.

105
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,604
You can't really buy them anything.

106
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:56,986
And before we go on to the next questions, we do have another question.

107
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,228
You're saying that letters and emails are really helpful.

108
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,450
Is there a particular easy way?

109
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:11,854
I know that a lot of people who are involved in Mamas Mutually Medford and Somerville are, people want to help.

110
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:13,415
People want to be able to do something.

111
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,916
What's an easy way for people to get involved that way?

112
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:23,830
The best way to do that, I think, writeaprisoner.com, I think is the name of it.

113
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,251
Look that up.

114
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:34,078
And there's lots of prisoners who really are begging for people to write them because they don't have that much contact with the outside.

115
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:35,599
So I would do that.

116
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,740
That's probably the best way.

117
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:46,086
There are also a whole bunch of different groups who are working on different issues.

118
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:54,201
I'm a member of both Massachusetts Against Solitary Confinement.

119
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:59,625
I'm also a member of a group called Concerned Elders.

120
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,587
We actually go in and visit people in prisons.

121
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:15,274
If you want to give people my contact information, especially if they're interested in visiting people, that is one of the things that are harder for people to do.

122
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:19,690
really makes a big difference in their lives.

123
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,351
And I assume we can't do that right now.

124
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:22,832
What?

125
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,033
Oh, no.

126
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,394
Yeah, there's no visiting, right.

127
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:27,515
No, no visiting right now.

128
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:33,098
However, writing the letters is allowed, so that can be done.

129
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:44,606
But if anyone's interested in getting involved, I'm happy to point them in the right direction for whatever thing they might want to do.

130
00:11:45,055 --> 00:12:02,276
There's also different groups who go in and educate prisoners so they can go in and actually they could become part of a group that might teach people how to read or teach people how to write.

131
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,128
you know, there's also groups like that.

132
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:18,811
So there's a long list of groups, and I'm like, the names are escaping me right now, but I would be more than happy to, you know, forward all that information to anyone who's interested.

133
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:19,652
Wonderful.

134
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:27,674
There is another question, which is, do you know what sort of medical care is available in case someone in prison does get the virus?

135
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,367
There is medical care available.

136
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:44,953
However, from what I've seen, and I don't know if they've improved it at all, it's been very, very lax.

137
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:56,060
They do have nurses, but they have way too few doctors and nurses per prisoner to really deal with.

138
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,781
If there's a huge outbreak,

139
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:02,157
there's going to be a big problem because they just don't have the bandwidth.

140
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:12,126
There's too few doctors and nurses employed by the system to deal with a huge outbreak in the Massachusetts state prisons.

141
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:13,237
Right.

142
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:27,813
So, you know, I've heard, I know that a couple of our city councilors here in Somerville, Ben, you and Kevin and JT Scott, and as well as other people have been talking about releasing certain portions of the prison population.

143
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:35,877
Certainly the the ones who are oh, what's I'm forgetting the term I I sometimes call it debtors prison, right?

144
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,418
It's people who their pretrial detention.

145
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:38,818
Is that right?

146
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:43,059
So they they haven't been convicted of anything and they just can't pay bail.

147
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,159
And so they're held in jail.

148
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:53,942
Is that yes So so despite the fact that they're supposed to actually not not not force people to

149
00:13:54,887 --> 00:14:00,031
to pay a bail that's unaffordable, they are still requiring bails that are unaffordable to people.

150
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:11,179
So there's a lot of people in jail, the vast majority, I think it's the majority of the prisoners, jails, we've been talking about prisons, now there's jails, have not actually been convicted of a crime.

151
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,080
It is so insane.

152
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,903
It's really mind-blowing to me that this is true in America today.

153
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,665
Yeah, so Rachel Rollins,

154
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:22,339
has been working on that.

155
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,740
She kind of took the lead.

156
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,701
I know that Peter Katushin and D.A.

157
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:29,502
Ryan are looking at who they can release, but it's taking them a while.

158
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,823
And also, I think Andrea Harrington is another D.A.

159
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:42,287
out in the western part of the state who's also looking into trying to get people released who could possibly, you know, be released.

160
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:49,430
And this includes not just the people who are held on bail and are pre-sentencing.

161
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,050
There's

162
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:53,354
There's high-risk people with illnesses who should definitely come home.

163
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:56,755
There are geriatric prisoners who should come home.

164
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:01,756
There are parole-eligible people should be coming home.

165
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:07,658
And anyone who's really close to being released should just be released.

166
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:13,099
Is there some way that we can pressure people?

167
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,900
Is there a way that folks listening here can help with that?

168
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:32,317
Yes, well, first of all, the DAs are, you know, they're elected, so certainly, as a constituent, please contact every DA, especially the ones who are not acting on this, please contact them.

169
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:40,764
And also, contact your state reps and your senators, because Lindsay Sabadoza has filed a bill,

170
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:48,291
You can write this down, HD 4963 to decarcerate prisoners.

171
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:51,494
And that is something that people can do.

172
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:54,417
Try to get your legislators to support that bill.

173
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:56,719
Great.

174
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,824
Do you want to talk a little bit about, we've talked a lot about COVID-19 and how it's affecting people.

175
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:08,529
Can you talk to us a little bit about what you were working on before COVID-19 and about solitary confinement?

176
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:11,610
Sure, yes.

177
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:18,137
I'm part of a group, like I said before, Massachusetts Against Solitary Confinement, which people could also join.

178
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:33,093
We'd love to have more members trying to bring attention to the fact that Massachusetts has one of the largest solitary confinement populations.

179
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:40,113
in terms of the proportion of prisoners we have, inmates we have in Massachusetts.

180
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:55,604
The last time for the last year where they were really taking a sample, out of 9,000 prisoners, approximately 3,000, a little bit less than 3,000 had been put in solitary confinement in Massachusetts.

181
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:00,367
And they keep them in there for up to 10 years.

182
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,748
How is that legal?

183
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:08,628
It's legal in Massachusetts, and it's still legal even after the Criminal Justice Act was passed.

184
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:13,992
So I have a friend who's visiting someone who was sentenced for 10 years.

185
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:18,395
I'm visiting someone who was sentenced to four years.

186
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:23,498
And I mean, the young man I'm visiting was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

187
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:30,984
He was sentenced to four years in solitary confinement in an incident where nobody was hurt.

188
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,502
so where nobody was even injured.

189
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:40,643
So it was an altercation with a correctional officer, but it was a minor altercation.

190
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,464
And by the way, I think you once mentioned to me the limit.

191
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:51,626
Isn't there a limit under the sort of world human rights?

192
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:56,567
Who has a limit that's... Oh, 15 days.

193
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,507
Yeah, according to the...

194
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:06,415
yeah, the UN, 15 days is torture.

195
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:13,199
And 15 days is nothing, they don't even, you know, everybody gets 15 days.

196
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,645
And most people spend two, three months, and then lots of people, and for the place where the young man I visit, it's a DDU,

197
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:31,315
It's specifically, it's almost a separate prison that's specifically just for long-term solitary confinement.

198
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,297
Everybody has over a year.

199
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,519
That is totally insane.

200
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,320
Yes.

201
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,020
That's horrible.

202
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,681
Horrifying.

203
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:48,549
Because they've all spent at least six months waiting in solitary confinement for a sentence, and then they're sentenced to at least six months.

204
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,910
Usually they're sentenced to about a year or two years.

205
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,665
Wow.

206
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:03,917
Well, let's end on a slightly better note than that one.

207
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,621
Do you have any better notes than that one in terms of the incarcerated population?

208
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:15,622
Is there anything on the horizon?

209
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:22,204
Are there any bills that you think are happening right now, maybe at the state level, that have a good chance of passing?

210
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:26,545
Or Rachel Rollins, she seems pretty good.

211
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,547
And maybe through our elected DAs, we're going to be having some positive movement.

212
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:48,907
I'm hoping through DAs like Rachel Rollins, like Andrea Harrington, there is going to be some movement, and they are going to stop incarcerating so many people in our population who do not need to be incarcerated.

213
00:19:50,407 --> 00:20:00,953
I actually did court watch, and I'm starting to see the change, and I'm starting to see the decarceration of our population, which is the hopeful

214
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:05,107
you know, thing that's happening on our, that's the whole full.

215
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:10,454
You know, if they're not in prison in the first place, then we don't have to worry about the conditions in prison.

216
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:11,954
That's exactly right.

217
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:12,875
That is right.

218
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:14,635
Yeah.

219
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:21,318
Thank you so much for coming on today and for talking about this incredibly important, I think, too often overlooked topic.

220
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,459
And also for all the work that you do.

221
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:27,300
Oh, thank you.

222
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,300
It's really important.

223
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm going to actually go on.

224
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,582
I'm going to see if I can get some mamas folks to

225
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,971
some mama's folks to start writing letters.

226
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,915
We have one final comment.

227
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:47,141
As the mother of a previously incarcerated, I agree with Caroline when she says the medical care is lax.

228
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:52,807
Inmates are often not taken seriously and there are longer than average wait times for care.

229
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:54,966
Yeah.

230
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:01,091
So medical care in prisons, important topic, especially now.

231
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:05,414
But yeah, we're going to see if we can get some folks to write some letters.

232
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,275
And thank you so much.

233
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:08,857
Great to talk to you.

234
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:09,957
Thank you.

235
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:10,658
Yeah.
