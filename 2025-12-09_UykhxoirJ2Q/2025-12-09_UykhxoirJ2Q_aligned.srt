The purpose of the meeting is to discuss citywide collection, disposal, and processing of solid waste, reusables, organics, and recyclables awarded pursuant to a request for proposal number 23-0067, paper 23-032.

10
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:57,346
The committee has invited DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern, Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and any additional representatives of the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to attend this meeting.

12
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:05,432
Sincerely yours, Nicole Morrell, Council President.

13
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:10,696
We have Commissioner McGibbon and Director Hunt here to give us a presentation.

14
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:14,098
Before we get started, are there any questions from councilors?

15
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,024
Seeing none, I will turn it over to you both.

16
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,067
Can you tap the mic just to turn it on?

17
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:29,268
There you go, sorry.

18
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:32,390
It literally changes every week, so.

19
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,950
Thank you very much.

20
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:42,214
We have a relatively short presentation to give, and I'll turn it over to Alicia to start the presentation, and I'll take over at some point in the middle.

21
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:45,935
Good evening, councilors.

22
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:50,938
So we just, obviously you know about waste and recycling today in Medford.

23
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:56,700
We're gonna recap RFP process that we went through, the RFP goals,

24
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:59,650
the results and recommendations and what's ahead.

25
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:09,337
And to be clear, I think that everybody is aware that the mayor needs the city council's approval to sign a 10-year contract.

26
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:16,262
And that is on your city council agenda tonight, is the request to allow the signing of a 10-year contract.

27
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:22,927
What our goal was was to provide you some information about what's in there, what's going on, what's the process here.

28
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,795
so that you would feel more comfortable at that meeting and for us to have a little bit of time to actually discuss that now at this meeting.

29
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:34,719
So I included this here just for completeness.

30
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:39,443
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:42,205
You all know what we do for waste and recycling in Medford.

32
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:46,828
We have weekly trash, every other week recycling.

33
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,291
Yard waste is 15 weeks plus one week of Christmas tree.

34
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:56,193
Currently, white goods are $26 for a curbside fee for pickup.

35
00:02:57,213 --> 00:03:03,134
Residents can have up to three bulky items picked up, collected every other week.

36
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:06,615
And that costs the city about $25 an item.

37
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:14,556
We actually have a very high rate of people calling and their item not being there when the waste management truck gets there.

38
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,777
And the city still pays $25 an item.

39
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:23,575
when that happens, there's about, we pay about $400,000 a year on that line.

40
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:28,998
And currently residents can subscribe for the city recommended composting service.

41
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,118
It's $99 a year.

42
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,942
One of the things that I just wanted to flag, this is a slide.

43
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:40,623
We do not actually have this data for Medford or for the state.

44
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:48,267
This is an EPA slide about the breakdown about what households are discarding annually.

45
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:54,713
And as you can see, 48% of what gets discarded is recyclable.

46
00:03:54,934 --> 00:04:01,415
There's 15%, the orange, that's potentially reusable or recyclable.

47
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:11,077
12% is yard waste, yard trimmings, and 22% is food scraps, which really only leaves a small amount that truly, truly has to go in the garbage.

48
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:17,359
Now things vary from area to area about what can actually be recycled, but this is the,

49
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,131
in a big picture.

50
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:29,217
So you're also aware that we've been working on hauler regulations that we've had mandatory separation of recyclables since 1992.

51
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:45,927
This meant the hauler regulation that we worked on will require permitted trash holders to provide recycling service so that they can't just pick up trash from say apartment buildings without also

52
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,129
basically providing recycling at for one bundled rate.

53
00:04:50,730 --> 00:05:00,516
I do understand from our director of board at our last meeting about that, there was some question about our board of health regulations and that there were definitions that were different.

54
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:11,103
I understand from our director of public health that the board of health has actually voted and adjusted their regulations to be in line with what is proposed in front of the city council.

55
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:13,465
And I know councilor Kit was there

56
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:19,965
at that meeting and I was not, so I couldn't speak to it any more than to say I know that that is in process.

57
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:24,788
That is actually, we feel like an important step as part of this process.

58
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:32,373
So for the RFP, last summer and fall, we had our Solid Waste Task Force and we did community outreach.

59
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:37,176
I'd like to thank the number of members of the task force who are actually on the Zoom tonight.

60
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,158
Saw a couple of them before I started sharing my screen,

61
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:44,318
We drafted and released an RFP over the winter.

62
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:51,000
We received proposals this spring, and this summer we have been doing contract negotiations.

63
00:05:53,521 --> 00:06:09,687
So the goal of the RFP, controlling costs was number one, creating fairness and transparency regarding our service recipients, expanding our recycling and composting options, and providing services comparable to neighboring communities

64
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:14,812
streamlining the transition of continuity of service without interruptions.

65
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:21,860
We wanted to move Medford towards zero waste and decrease the multiple haulers in the business districts.

66
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:25,484
So I think I'm turning it over to you here.

67
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:27,708
Thank you, Aisha.

68
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:32,292
So we're doing a great job in meeting our goals.

69
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,554
So I think that's really important.

70
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:45,005
Up until we started evaluating the RFP, some of those goals, we weren't 100% sure if we were going to be able to reach them, but we're on track.

71
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,406
So that's great news.

72
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,830
The results of the RFP are

73
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,708
They're summarized here but, and this is, you know, these are three important bullet points that I think are we think that are quite important to share.

74
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:04,757
If, for example, if we were to go to weekly recycling we discovered that it would cost an approximate about a million dollars extra per year.

75
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:11,822
The weekly food composting that we're heading towards is gonna cost us about a million dollars per year.

76
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:17,627
And if we move to every other week trash, we're gonna save about a million dollars per year.

77
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:22,892
And we're proposing to start that in year three to have a transition period.

78
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:32,800
So just so everybody's clear, we're not recommending weekly recycling at this point, but we did wanna understand what that would cost.

79
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:45,468
The reason is because that minimal increases in materials recycled based off of analysis is that MassDT has done and others in national research.

80
00:07:51,632 --> 00:08:03,675
So the weekly food scraps composting piece, you know, another thing that we've discussed in the past with you is trash has a lot of, today has a lot of food scraps in it.

81
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:04,815
Food scraps are heavy.

82
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:10,937
So when you remove the food scraps out of your trash, then your trash is lighter, you have less of it.

83
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:16,502
it doesn't fester as quickly, it doesn't become a nuisance as quickly.

84
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:23,149
So that's one of the directions that we're headed here, and that's what we've heard from the community, and that's where we're headed.

85
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:35,261
And then the transition piece I mentioned is important too, since we are realistic in the idea that we can't wave a magic wand and have the entire city start composting their food scraps all at once.

86
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:39,743
question.

87
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:44,206
I have a question on number three about the every other week trash.

88
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:44,706
Yes.

89
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:53,971
If when we get to that third year and we realize it's not working, are we able to change it to go to a weekly thing?

90
00:08:54,011 --> 00:09:01,035
If, if, if we realize that when we start to maybe after six, seven months, it's not working out, are we able to

91
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:12,254
Well, we'll be entering a contract with waste management, and I think, you know, we'd have to have that discussion if it's not working and it's just had itself and you know no one's picking up composting and it's not.

92
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:16,218
I'm talking about the every other week.

93
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:17,759
Well, that would start in year three.

94
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:19,961
Yeah, so yeah if we if we realize that.

95
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:23,464
Maybe, you know, three or four or five months into it, it's not working.

96
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,265
The answer is yes.

97
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:27,127
Are we going to be able to opt back into a weekly trash pickup?

98
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:29,148
Yes, we would be able to do that.

99
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:33,652
We wouldn't be able to do that and the composting.

100
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,853
So we would have to make some hard decisions at that time.

101
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:38,756
It would have a significant budget impact.

102
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:39,256
Yes.

103
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:46,882
We literally could do composting and every week trash, but that would have a million dollar budget impact.

104
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:48,103
That would be a barrier.

105
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:49,604
We don't recommend

106
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:55,399
I have a question that same vein just as we started.

107
00:09:55,499 --> 00:10:05,986
So, if it going to every other we trash, would there be an option like right now if folks have a ton of recyclables they can go to the DPW yard, is there an option there I'm like literally being very specific.

108
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,288
I have a one year old I have lots of diapers, like,

109
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:16,771
Food, great, we can get the food out, that has saved us a ton, we already do composting, but something like that, not necessarily want around.

110
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:29,603
The overflow bags wouldn't go away, and also an extra bin that you'd have to pay for wouldn't go away, so there would be options if you are generating more trash, but it would be a cost to the resident.

111
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:33,747
Right, but there would be no other way to remove the trash in that in-between week.

112
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:40,829
Like I'm just saying, because right now, if I have a ton of recycling, I can go to the DPW yard and drop off that recycling before the next pickup.

113
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:50,293
Yeah, I would say we have not discussed an option that would... So we had actually conceptualized, could there be a way to do it?

114
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:56,337
The difficulty would be the truck would run this route this week and that route that week.

115
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,898
So to have a truck hit one person's house,

116
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:02,279
would be really expensive.

117
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:05,603
We have not currently contemplated a drop-off location.

118
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:07,725
We have contemplated overflow bags that people could choose to purchase.

119
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:27,032
an extra bin if you had, so I actually had a neighbor with two in diapers and he ordered an overflow bin that he used for the year that he had two children in diapers.

120
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:28,033
Okay, yeah.

121
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,074
Okay, thank you.

122
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,456
Madam President, if I can.

123
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,840
Oh, Councilor Scarpella and then we'll go to Vice Mayor Beers.

124
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,406
Right, so is the, thank you, through the Chair, is the food scrap pickup program, is that a weekly program?

125
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,256
Yes, that would be a weekly program.

126
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:48,597
Okay.

127
00:11:50,197 --> 00:12:00,981
One thing that I'm really nervous about, especially this past week, I think that we've gotten so many phone calls, and I'm sure that the Board of Health has gotten a lot of phone calls.

128
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:07,683
We're seeing a huge uptick on the rat populations and what's happening with the rat problem in the community.

129
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:08,544
And I think that

130
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:29,227
A couple of things that as we're moving forward with this RFP and what the asks are, I find a few difficult concessions here and looking at not everybody, although we want everybody to recycle more, but every two weeks having a pickup of trash.

131
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:43,832
I don't think that's a real big problem considering right now when we're being asked to vote on this issue without really getting the true input from the whole community.

132
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:52,116
I think this is what we had an issue years ago when Mayor McGlynn put this program out.

133
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:53,537
So I think that,

134
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:09,314
You really have to try to sell me on this because I, you know, the every other week trash in three years, unless we have a grasp on what's going on with the rat population and what we're doing here in the city with the rats.

135
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,635
Uh, I think that's, that's a dangerous situation.

136
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:22,398
Um, so, uh, and that's brings another question I had from a lot of people that did contact me about the food scrap and going with the composting that way.

137
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:33,029
is one resident put it as, we're now having drive-through separate containers for our rats for their consumption.

138
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:42,198
So I know the reason why we're doing this, but I think that a million dollars, if you look at the big picture,

139
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:59,474
The problems that are going to arise because of pickup once a week, I think that we're not really thinking it through of what the process would be if there were, or there needed to be drop-offs per se.

140
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:19,668
I don't know, this is a good meeting, this is a great meeting to get things rolling, but I can't see us voting on this tonight for the fact that here we are in end of July, and for the most part, most of the community hasn't heard about the process or what the RFP states.

141
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:23,091
So again, I'll have more later, but thank you.

142
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,952
Thank you, Madam President.

143
00:14:28,272 --> 00:14:31,774
Just to be clear operation about the procedure.

144
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:44,798
Essentially, this is a 10 year contract and there's an option in the contract to move from weekly trash to every other week trash, and that reduces the annual payment by about a million dollars, plus or minus whatever the annual adjustments are.

145
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:52,671
And we're choosing, we're making a plan to exercise that option in year three or in the contract that says we are going to exercise the option in year three.

146
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,193
So let me answer that first and then I'll go back to the rats.

147
00:14:56,573 --> 00:15:07,039
So actually what is literally written in the contract and I had the, so our consultants are also on the line in case there's questions and we actually also have a representative from MassDEP on the line.

148
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,083
So what is literally written in the contract is that there is an option to go to every other week trash

149
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:17,999
that can be decided six months before July 1st, 2026.

150
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:26,183
So six months before that, we have to decide if we're ready to move to every other week trash and it would have a budget impact.

151
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:29,125
And so that's where we would, that would need to be part of that.

152
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:32,166
But no, it is not locked in stone that we have to.

153
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:41,671
And if we said we are moving that way and we can see, so actually I was also gonna talk to sort of this phase in that we were talking about, but we're not ready.

154
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,052
We don't have enough adoption,

155
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:54,936
we could say, let's push that back a year, let's stick one more year with weekly trash, we'll take the budget hit and then switch to every other week trash the year after that.

156
00:15:55,457 --> 00:16:07,881
Or we could say people aren't, so I think I would also be helpful to speak to the composting, but I do wanna actually just address the rats first, and then let's go back to the money, because Councilor Scarpelli asked about the rats first.

157
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:26,858
We, the Board of Health has found that the toters, they're smaller with locks on them that are used for the composting, have been more successful in keeping out rats and raccoons than the large things that we have trash in.

158
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:39,164
Where a raccoon can climb up, and we've had photos of it, I've seen it out my own window, and literally the raccoon can open a trash can, one of our waste management trash cans, and go in there and pull the trash out

159
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,994
The toters for the compost have very simple locking lids in them.

160
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:49,356
And actually I could have, we have the one up in the hallway upstairs.

161
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,777
We could have David go get that.

162
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:52,557
Do you mind, do you know what I'm talking about?

163
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:56,959
Sorry, David's one of the interns in our office who's been helping us with this.

164
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:07,023
It has a very easy for a human to use lock, but the rats and the raccoons have not figured out how to get that open.

165
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:20,605
plastic on the composting bins is thick enough that we do not have examples of rats eating through the composting toters that have been in use in the city of Medford.

166
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,647
There are buckets in some communities.

167
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:30,851
Our board of health said no to the buckets because they did find that rats were eating through the lids of those buckets.

168
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:37,535
So that's why in Medford, if you were to subscribe to one of these companies, you're only allowed to get the toter that's per our board of health.

169
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:47,531
So we believe that moving, or we have found that moving the trash out of the garbage cans and into these toters actually helps with the rat problem.

170
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:52,273
The other issue with rats is business, and we'll talk about that a little bit later as well.

171
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:56,095
But some of the way we wanted to address composting.

172
00:17:56,135 --> 00:18:02,238
So right now we have 1200 households in Medford paying for weekly composting.

173
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:06,920
We had, I'm gonna say, oh, I printed it.

174
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:11,873
Oh, no one can see it because we're sharing.

175
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:14,494
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to turn off screen share for a minute.

176
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:23,296
And then you can see this, like, this is a really easy.

177
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,777
So like, anybody can

178
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:32,588
When you push on this, you don't have to have good hand strength or anything to push.

179
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,408
So even elderly, it's easy to push.

180
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:37,169
And if we turn it, let's just say, cause you can see there.

181
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:38,889
Thank you, Shane.

182
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,810
You can't quite see, but there's a little lip on there.

183
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,991
So this is what, and we do have this, it's actually up in the hallway upstairs.

184
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:52,311
We don't mean to be advertising for any one company.

185
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,392
Both the companies that do provide this service in Medford right now,

186
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,581
use the exact same toter from the same company.

187
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:03,882
It's just one is, this one is branded by one of the companies.

188
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:13,645
So the idea is that we believe, hold on, when we did the survey, does it say the survey?

189
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:17,045
I thought it did.

190
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:21,527
20% said they would definitely, oh, well, that was actually the moving to every other week trash.

191
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:39,298
So we actually had a lot of people say they were interested, I could call it up if I wanted, in composting, and a lot of people, only 25% of the population said they were not interested in composting, and that was with no outreach, no education, it was just the survey.

192
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:43,581
So- How many people were in that, Alicia, if you're interested to know?

193
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,525
The survey was about 850 people responded to it.

194
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:47,965
Thank you.

195
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:48,265
Yes.

196
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:56,244
Um, so actually, I realized I should go back to screen sharing.

197
00:19:56,264 --> 00:20:03,870
There we go.

198
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:14,277
So when we did the RFP, we heard from several composting companies, and they felt strongly that what we should do is an opt-in program for the first couple of years.

199
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,139
and have people sign up.

200
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:19,220
This is based on the model that Boston did.

201
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:29,183
So they have an opt-in program where they have a cap on how many people can opt in in the first year, in the second year, and then in the third year.

202
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:36,666
So this idea would be, we believe that we could have 8,000 households sign up in year one, and then 12,000 in year two.

203
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,026
We have 19,770 households on our waste program right now.

204
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:49,983
so that then at that point in year three, we think we could roll in the rest of the households.

205
00:20:50,523 --> 00:21:06,607
If we found in year two that we were not at 12,000 households, that we were at 6,000 households composting, the compost companies would charge us a weekly rate per household rather than a rate for the whole city.

206
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:14,349
So will we ramp up our costs by only paying for the number of subscribers in year one and year two?

207
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:22,595
And there's like a critical mass point at which it's cheaper to pay for the whole city than per person because of the way math works.

208
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,817
So that's where we would switch.

209
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:35,882
So this is what our, we would have real metrics to be able to have a good understanding if we were ready to switch to universal in year three.

210
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:37,923
Oh, thank you.

211
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:48,225
So would you be interested in moving to every other week trash collection if you had food scraps collection?

212
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:55,409
And the online survey said 21% said yes and 20% said maybe.

213
00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,572
And then after we talked about it at the workshop, the numbers changed.

214
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:07,256
So we had 60% saying yes and 15% maybe, and at that point only 25 no.

215
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,797
And that was actually just discussing the program

216
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:15,359
during a workshop for the evening, that many changed their minds.

217
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:18,621
Thank you.

218
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:22,283
All right, let me go back to you.

219
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:22,863
I was letting you.

220
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:24,124
Yeah, that's fine.

221
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:32,029
All right, so I think Alicia went over this pretty well, and we also went over how this isn't set in stone.

222
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:37,952
So if it's not panning out with this plan, then we do have the option of changing how we do it.

223
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:42,087
I think that's important for everybody to know, right?

224
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:46,973
Let's see if we have anything else on this slide that we need to talk about.

225
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:56,425
So one of the things that we want to bring to your attention is a piece

226
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:59,786
of resident-like businesses and residents.

227
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:09,970
So, you know, if you're a resident-like business, like a small business out there that generates enough trash that it's almost like a resident or even less, you'd be included in the program.

228
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:20,935
And then if you are a building with four or fewer units, you would be eligible for the weekly food scraps composting collection service as part of that collect the city's collection services.

229
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:25,617
And that three-year approach is just a recommendation for now, like we said.

230
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,239
I think we go to the next slide.

231
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,895
So currently our budget is $7.6 million approximately.

232
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:46,922
Years one through five, we're looking at 7.7 per year average and years six through 10, 8.7 per year average.

233
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:56,870
So those are some numbers that we're working hard on to fit what we wanna do in a reasonable escalation

234
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:58,992
based off of our current budget.

235
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:13,061
So we're not trying to, in other words, we're trying not to have the annual budget for waste collection increase, which is part of the cost goals.

236
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:19,565
So some of the things that we've achieved, we believe that the new system will be fair and transparent.

237
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:22,427
The process thus far, fair and transparent.

238
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:31,374
Food waste composting services is included, and as Alicia mentioned, it builds off of experiences of other municipalities in the area, such as Boston.

239
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:37,266
We're targeting yard trimming compostings, April through December.

240
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:41,927
One thing we heard loud and clear is folks want more yard trimmings pickup.

241
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:47,028
So, you know, the reality of it is that particular service is getting more expensive.

242
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:54,090
So we are currently working with waste management to get those costs reasonable.

243
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,390
And one of the,

244
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:04,634
The ways we're doing that is contracting directly with a contractor and not having waste management sub it out.

245
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:07,255
So we do have some significant savings that way.

246
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:12,498
So there very well may be a third contract associated with this.

247
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:20,642
So one for trash and recyclables, one for food scraps composting, and one for yard waste composting.

248
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:33,496
The fact that we're going with waste management, insurance continuity, I think, you know, I know in my office, we're very used to working with waste management, the folks there and the processes that they have.

249
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,957
So that's a nice perk.

250
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,642
One of the other goals that we have is bringing the city towards zero waste.

251
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:51,228
So we believe that this set of contracts would be taking a big giant step over the next decade towards zero waste.

252
00:25:53,381 --> 00:26:22,392
And one of the things we haven't really mentioned quite yet is, you know, some of the, for example, the business districts and there are other situations in the city where we wanna provide a way to get from having many, many toters out in the street to containerized situations that are better for things like rats, better at making the squares look nicer,

253
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:23,733
Things like that.

254
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:36,142
So we're working on a preferred hauler system, where there are rates that are pre negotiated that that businesses can take advantage of.

255
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:40,745
So we're working very closely with Waste Management to work those rates out.

256
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:42,506
So basically provide a discount.

257
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:51,733
Thank you, Madam President, Tim, how many cities and towns actually do commercial trash for free?

258
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:53,685
It's not the norm.

259
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:54,726
That's not the norm.

260
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:59,830
I mean, at some point, are we going to get up with making the commercial people pay?

261
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,591
That's what this is about.

262
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:03,573
Yes, that is what exactly what this is about.

263
00:27:03,593 --> 00:27:06,615
But we don't want to pull the rug out from under him, so to speak.

264
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:08,677
So we're trying to provide a soft landing.

265
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:09,798
We're trying to

266
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:15,515
work a transition and the preferred holiday program is a critical piece of that.

267
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:31,423
So we have pre negotiated rates that we can offer businesses that need to transition off a city system, would they would they be able to pick up the commercial crash in the evening, the commercial district so they don't have to leave it out all night.

268
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:34,263
Things like that we can certainly work out.

269
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:40,465
I'm sure, you know, we've all driven through the square and we've seen trash thrown all over the place in boxes and stuff.

270
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:40,985
Correct.

271
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:42,005
It's very unsightly.

272
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:42,685
Correct.

273
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:46,626
And that is something that we're, through this process and through this contract, we're trying to solve.

274
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,127
It's not going to happen immediately.

275
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:52,610
There is some work to do there, and an example of some work to do is space.

276
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,312
Space for dumpsters, space for collection.

277
00:27:55,673 --> 00:28:15,348
Not all businesses have enough space, so there will be some sharing, there will be potentially some city-owned space set aside, like a parking space or two in a targeted area with a dumpster, as opposed to having the bagged mess that you see today.

278
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,694
All right, I think we can go to the next slide.

279
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:29,438
So what's next?

280
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:40,426
So right now, as Alicia mentioned, we're negotiating, which is taking some serious amount of time between Alicia and myself, our consultants and waste management.

281
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:46,730
So we've already 12 hours or something of negotiations, and we're continuing to do that.

282
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,765
We're well on our way and things are looking great.

283
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:57,590
The scope B contract that's mentioned here would be the food waste contract.

284
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:09,979
Now that's coming next because that negotiation is going to hinge upon where exactly we land with our scope A or trash and recycling contract.

285
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,140
So they impact each other, it's all the same budget.

286
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:21,081
So we would execute that in July, August 2023, fall, winter 2023 with starting outreach.

287
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:31,267
And that's going to be a big part of this as Alicia showed you or discussed once you educate people on how this will actually work and,

288
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:39,753
What it actually means, people start turning over to the side of food scrap composting.

289
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:42,575
So we believe that will continue.

290
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:48,479
It is the trend that in general we're headed as I think a larger community, not just Medford.

291
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,043
July 1st, 2024, new contract begins, including food composting.

292
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:57,365
And at the same time, the hauler ordinance goes into effect.

293
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:59,627
And that's important for the Preferred Hauler Program.

294
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:05,484
July 1st, 2026, that is the target for every other week trash begins.

295
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:22,492
So hopefully by that point, we have enough folks on the composting and we've done our job with education and outreach where folks are a lot more comfortable with the idea of their dry trash goods getting picked up.

296
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:31,334
every other week and the heavy food scraps and compostables getting picked up every week.

297
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:33,774
So that's the plan.

298
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:37,655
And then I think we can move on to the last slide.

299
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:41,416
So thank you very much.

300
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,837
We're open to questions and we, like Alicia said, we have our consultants on board and we have an SDEP here too.

301
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:52,298
So answer whatever questions you have, try to.

302
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:53,878
Thank you, Councilor Carvilla.

303
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:54,358
Thank you.

304
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:56,939
So just a couple of my opinions.

305
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,240
You talked about the bulk items that we pick up for free.

306
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,020
Yes.

307
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,021
Why don't we cut that down to maybe to one?

308
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:07,822
Oh, so honestly, I apologize.

309
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:09,642
I thought that was one of the slides in here.

310
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:12,743
It was in the memo that we sent out to councilors.

311
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:22,385
So part of the plan, what we have strong recommendation from the haulers, they have found that when we charge residents for the bulk items, even a portion of the cost,

312
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:33,450
that there is a dramatic drop in one, the number of items that they asked to have picked up, and two, the number of times they call, make an appointment, and then don't put their item out.

313
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:42,400
We believe that a number of those that we're being charged for are actually people not putting it out, calling a second time and putting it out then.

314
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,402
They see a dramatic drop off.

315
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,531
And so the recommendation is that we split the cost.

316
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:49,233
We've gotten them to keep the cost.

317
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:51,935
Right now, the city gets charged $25 an item.

318
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:55,719
They are willing to go up to just $26 an item.

319
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:03,485
And the recommendation is that we share the cost with the residents and waste management would do the billing.

320
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:07,108
So they would actually, a resident calls, tries to schedule it.

321
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,851
Waste management would take their credit card number for

322
00:32:10,405 --> 00:32:14,988
A number we choose, I think we're recommending somewhere between 13 and $15 an item.

323
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:26,054
And then they put that item out and they'll find that, they think that can actually drop our $400,000 down much lower under $100,000 for bulk items.

324
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:37,941
So maybe if you give them one for free and in charge for the other two, you know, the 13 nominal fee, I think that's more than, well, it's something that people put it all, then people come by at night and pick it up.

325
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:39,882
And that's what happens a lot of times too.

326
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:44,543
It does happen that they get picked up by other people.

327
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:51,686
If you cut that down to maybe one for free and the nominal fee for everything else after that, I think we can live with that.

328
00:32:51,846 --> 00:33:01,749
We also find that people are dramatically incentivized to try putting it out on everything is free or to giving it away or donating it if there's a small charge associated with it.

329
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:07,231
Just to be clear, this would be every single, there'd be no free one, it would be everything's 13 bucks a resident?

330
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,472
That's what our recommendation is from this-

331
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:12,473
this is to recommend for everything.

332
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:18,534
And white goods is staying at, it's been $26 an item, it stays at $26 an item.

333
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:19,995
Now that's for the white goods?

334
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,355
That's white goods.

335
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:22,595
I'm talking about the bulk items.

336
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:23,595
For the bulk items, yes.

337
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:26,436
Yeah, maybe if you give just one bulk item per year.

338
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,136
They're saying none, they're saying all the bulk items would be 13.

339
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:31,877
Don't give any bulk items?

340
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:35,557
So that's the recommendation, particularly in best practice from DEP.

341
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:39,458
It's also simpler for people to include a nominal fee.

342
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:55,724
So when we go on to the every other week pickup, I'd like to see something at the DBW, similar to like we have with the cardboard.

343
00:33:56,644 --> 00:34:07,907
Because I know myself, there's probably times, maybe around the holidays and stuff like that where people have a lot of trash, have a receptacle down there that people could buy the bag,

344
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:11,057
and bring it down there.

345
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:25,120
So for the few times a year that your barrel does get full, I think that'd be, that'd probably save a lot of heartache for a lot of people rather than, you know, let the stuff pile up all over the place and, you know, just drop the bag down.

346
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:30,261
And I have it open on a Saturday or so, a Monday to Friday, just to make sure there's someone there.

347
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:35,222
So non-residents don't put stuff there, but everything that goes in there must be in the bag that we provide.

348
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:37,923
Yes, we'll have to, and actually,

349
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:50,841
Sorry, because that also reminded me something that we didn't put into our slides but something else that we've negotiated in this contract with waste management.

350
00:34:51,261 --> 00:35:00,072
Sorry for interrupting your list is a twice a year drop off day where they would organize it, they would have all the vendors there.

351
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:27,393
And if you normally have to pay $25 for a white good, you would still have to pay $25 for a white good and why you would bring it, I don't know, but we would have all the hard to recycle items, all the fabric, all the, so we'll continue to have textile part pickup, but for them to organize like a hazardous waste and paint and electronics recycling and textile and have everything there in one place, but not organized by our staff.

352
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:29,654
Our staff would be there to keep an eye on things

353
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,731
but we wouldn't have to set all of that up, that they would set it up and run it for us twice a year.

354
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,732
And the same thing with the yard waste.

355
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:45,734
I know we pick it up certain times of the year, but the leaves continue to come after those couple of weeks.

356
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:55,117
So if maybe at some point they could provide a dumpster or some type of compactor where people can bring the yard waste down to the DBW yard.

357
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:56,797
on their own.

358
00:35:57,017 --> 00:36:02,161
So what we're looking at with this contract is approximately April through December.

359
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:09,868
Right now we end in November and that's a problem for people, but to have more pickups into December and then in January.

360
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:14,612
And one of the things that I'm very interested in is they're interested in doing it every other week.

361
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:20,977
So your yard waste would be picked up on the opposite week of your recycling so that you would know the schedule

362
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,129
they would do half the city each week.

363
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:31,794
So that'll also cut down on the times that there's totally overwhelmed and don't get to your house for two more days by subcontracting to another company we're hoping.

364
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:40,480
And in fact, they've said they would like, they're happy for us to contract directly with Save That Stuff for that pickup.

365
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:48,845
But the idea being that it could be, if we did 20 weeks, it would be every other week from April through late December plus one,

366
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:54,592
two week window in January where half the city one week and half the city the other for the Christmas trees.

367
00:36:55,953 --> 00:37:00,955
We need to negotiate with Save That Stuff if that January pickup could be more than Christmas trees.

368
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:05,097
So if you had another bag of yard waste, could you put that with your Christmas tree?

369
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:08,198
We still have to meet with them and discuss that with them.

370
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:13,180
But this way would be a lot easier for people to remember when their pickup is.

371
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,062
20 weeks is recommended by DEP as the

372
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:28,830
best practice, we're looking at potentially 16 weeks for a couple of years, simply because of the cost difference between 16 weeks and 20 weeks for the city.

373
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,912
But that's currently part of the negotiation we're doing.

374
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:41,776
Well, if that's what the case, I think it would be better would it be beneficial to have a compactor at the city yet, so people can bring this stuff down there.

375
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:44,678
Potentially, I think that's on the table.

376
00:37:45,172 --> 00:38:02,601
I mean, the way I think I want to approach this is if we change the program schedule and number of times, push it later in the year, increase the number of times, see how many problems that solves and what problems are left, and then explore things like that.

377
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:07,243
Keep it on the table, you know, and have really the same response for trash too.

378
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:12,717
Once we're at the cusp of year three, what's the feedback?

379
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:14,938
Are we ready for every other week trash?

380
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:18,321
Once we implement, what are the problems that we're seeing?

381
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:23,784
Do we need to be ready to have another location for situations like diapers, drop off location?

382
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,026
So that I think is still all on the table.

383
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,229
And in my mind, those are problems that we haven't seen yet.

384
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:34,292
So I'm just reluctant to solve problems that we don't know about,

385
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:37,486
Maybe we can foresee so I want to be prepared for those problems.

386
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:44,976
Um, but I think having this discussion is helpful because, for example, the the diaper situation that President morale brought up.

387
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:50,949
scenario where diapers don't go in food scrap.

388
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:54,452
And when you have a small child, I know this too, you generate a lot of diapers.

389
00:38:54,792 --> 00:39:01,038
So maybe there's an option where you can bring them down to the city yard and there's a dumpster for that.

390
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:03,900
So I think those options are still on the table.

391
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:08,885
And like I said, I wanna make sure that we understand what the problems are before we try to solve them.

392
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,147
Thank you.

393
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:12,388
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

394
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:22,077
Thank you, President Brown, thank you so much, both of you for being here, running us through it in advance of our regular meeting tonight.

395
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:31,267
I was a member of the Solid Waste Task Force so I've talked about many of these issues ad nauseum with you before and came into this meeting, you know,

396
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:36,936
predisposed towards the results of this negotiation process.

397
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:40,860
It's really heartening to see, or the pending results of the RFP process.

398
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:52,770
I think it's really heartening to see that so many of the goals that we talked about on the task force are seemingly coming to bear fruit through the negotiations.

399
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,192
It's great to see these sort of

400
00:39:56,541 --> 00:40:12,221
ordinance revision and your process, talking with various callers and tailoring the RFP I think that it's resulting in a couple scenarios that are really aligned with our short term and long term goals it makes me feel very confident about the 10 year contract scenario.

401
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:22,997
And I think for folks watching, I think like it's, I want to restate that what we're talking about specifically is kind of a top level, top level issue.

402
00:40:23,017 --> 00:40:24,297
Just do we, are we comfortable?

403
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:26,718
What are the conditions under which we'd be comfortable entering into?

404
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:29,279
A long contract, a 10 year contract.

405
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,741
And then there's a lot of small considerations within that.

406
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:40,704
Composting, bringing in pet issues, diaper issues, kind of contingencies for households and businesses that have different types of needs.

407
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:48,956
I think that what we've seen so far shows that this is a pretty flexible scenario.

408
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:59,205
Lots of opportunities for outreach, lots of points along the way where we could say, are we ready to, for example, scale up for 7,000 more households doing composting?

409
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:03,049
Are we ready to transition to every other week trash pickup?

410
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:09,515
and lots of runway for getting businesses on board and making sure that residents have the information that they need.

411
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:29,225
For example, you know, I think that composting is maybe the best, like clearest example of this saying, you know, food scraps are an issue regardless of the container that they're in and composting actually presents, if we do it right, an opportunity to have rats be less of an issue because the composting buckets are actually more secure against rats than what we're currently working with.

412
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:32,387
I think that's a really powerful thing to have the opportunity to communicate to the city.

413
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,022
because this is an issue that, you know, every household cares a lot about and nobody wants rats in their yard.

414
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:43,724
And this is actually an opportunity to make that problem better.

415
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:51,527
Yeah, thank you so much for the months of work leading up to this discussion.

416
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:53,128
Thank you.

417
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:53,688
Thank you.

418
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:54,728
Thank you.

419
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,629
Thank you for your presentation.

420
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:59,130
And thank you for your hard work negotiating on this.

421
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:15,574
I'm really encouraged by what I hear about bulk items, because I do think that we need to start pricing things where at the cost, more close to the cost that we're paying as a city, that each, that all of our taxpayers are paying.

422
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:27,198
I am also encouraged to hear us think about how we're gonna structure the business district trash collection and all of that, and the plan for that as well.

423
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:51,772
very, very much encouraged by how committed we are to weekly recycling and composting, which is not only good for the environment, but I think is a very clear equity issue in the city as well, especially with the composting part, where a lot of families who, they either, they want to be recycling more, composting more, a lot of folks,

424
00:42:53,441 --> 00:43:10,415
don't know about the DPW yard, they don't know about the composting programs that we have as a city, and some folks, they maybe don't make, they're in that golden zone where they can't really afford the composting program, but they don't qualify for help.

425
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:16,940
And so I'm very encouraged by this because I think this levels out the playing field for folks.

426
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:25,740
I'm happy that there's been a lot of thought about rodents and about how we're going to deal with rodents.

427
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:42,049
I think Councillor Collins makes a really good point that by shifting, hopefully, our food scraps to composting bins, we can reduce the likelihood of rodents running around opening trash cans because the smaller bins are harder to open.

428
00:43:42,768 --> 00:44:01,812
I was wondering if there was a plan to maybe work with the Board of Health to monitor rat presences, like reports, things like that, before and after we, and before, during, and after we make the switch, just to see if our hypotheses are confirmed.

429
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:05,993
So I, we can speak to the Board of Health about that.

430
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:06,873
My main

431
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:14,300
caveat is that there are a lot of things that are impacting the environment that are impacting the rat population.

432
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:20,864
And to say that it was just because of compost bins would be like a very slippery slope.

433
00:44:20,904 --> 00:44:27,887
We certainly, I do believe that they monitor a number of locations already, particularly on public property.

434
00:44:27,907 --> 00:44:31,549
I don't wanna over speak about what I think they're doing.

435
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:35,631
I do know that they have expressed to me an interest in seeing

436
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:40,640
things even out of dumpsters and into more secure bins like compost bins.

437
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:49,870
We literally had a conversation with waste management today about writing into the contract that any dumpsters that they provide under it would be kept in good condition.

438
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,936
And we use the word rat proof as part of our paragraph of description.

439
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:56,097
And they were like,

440
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:59,150
you cannot make a dumpster rat proof.

441
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:05,095
Like we can make sure there are no holes and dents and we'll put some language together that we're comfortable with.

442
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,176
We can say there's a lid.

443
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:09,199
They're like, but there is no such thing as a rat proof dumpster.

444
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:12,221
That is literally the conversation we had today with them.

445
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:19,248
So now I'm going to take that back to the board of health and say, is there like, you know, do I push them more on this?

446
00:45:19,288 --> 00:45:22,050
What language would you like to have in this for that?

447
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:24,292
So I just sort of share that, that it's,

448
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:26,004
That's an issue.

449
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:34,608
I strongly believe that some of our problem is most of our squares, the way we do trash pickup, are piles of garbage bags.

450
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:43,352
And in at least Haynes Square, I know businesses put them out on Sunday for pickup on Tuesday, or put them out on Sunday.

451
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:45,814
They must be putting them out Saturday night.

452
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:52,937
You know, if I'm there at one o'clock Sunday afternoon and there are trash bags everywhere, that must be for Monday morning pickup, right?

453
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:54,218
And that is not okay.

454
00:45:54,617 --> 00:46:03,682
So that is something that we are writing into the contract that they'll work with us to toterize, put them in toters or dumpsters to get them out of plastic bags on the street.

455
00:46:04,622 --> 00:46:05,002
Thank you.

456
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:15,188
Yeah, I think that's a great point that even if we collect that information, it might not be, we can't really get for one-to-one on that.

457
00:46:15,288 --> 00:46:16,628
So I think that's very helpful.

458
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:26,950
I wanted to ask a quick question about the phasing in program for composting, which I do think is very fiscally sensible, makes sense.

459
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:37,760
And I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but I was wondering if perhaps maybe we get to a point in year two where let's say 10,000 houses have signed up.

460
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,565
We have maybe 9,000 who haven't, and we're preparing to switch.

461
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:53,358
is, let's say the 9000 or even if we max it out and we do 12,000 and there's 7000 left.

462
00:46:55,138 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm just afraid of a situation where those 7000 haven't had a chance to experience

463
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:19,032
the fact that they don't need that weekly pickup of trash and that perhaps giving them the opportunity to do it would basically help them, like give them the experience of sorting trash a different way.

464
00:47:20,453 --> 00:47:27,619
Again, I do think the current plan that you have is fiscally sensible, but I was wondering about that situation and if there was any flexibility there.

465
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:37,513
So I think what we believe so we sat down with three different composting companies and talk through these issues, their thoughts, and to be clear, they all there.

466
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:49,757
Part of the discussion that we're going to have next with the composting companies, but we've had preliminary conversations, the interviewers is aggressive outreach and aggressive getting people to sign up for this.

467
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:58,027
So that is absolutely part of what we're looking for in the composting companies is one that will do this in a very robust manner.

468
00:47:58,572 --> 00:48:07,514
But there is a belief that some people will not compost until you literally take away their every other week trash.

469
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:12,615
And they go, dang, I don't like having my trash sit here for an extra week.

470
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:19,557
And you say to them, well, you know, if you put it in that bin, the compost bin, we'd take it away every week.

471
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:24,578
And then it's actually that act that will get people to start composting.

472
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:34,531
that there is a window, a group of people who wouldn't do it unless we took away their every week trash service.

473
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:45,314
And I did say it like a takeaway because my hope is at that point, we'll have three quarters of the community already composting.

474
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:47,935
So now you have peer support for it.

475
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:56,211
Because if three quarters of the people on your street are already doing it, then you have people everywhere who can say, just put it in here.

476
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:57,131
This is how I do it.

477
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:57,951
This works for me.

478
00:48:58,192 --> 00:48:59,952
This is not that hard.

479
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:05,094
And that'll make it easier for that last group to sort of get the hang of it.

480
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:14,574
I do think it's exciting that, I think what's exciting about this is the grassroots aspect of it, where I can, I imagine neighbors will be telling each other.

481
00:49:15,575 --> 00:49:27,143
This will create some community conversations about how they're sorting their trash, which I think will raise public consciousness about what's good for the environment, what's good

482
00:49:27,503 --> 00:49:28,904
fiscally for the city as well.

483
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:36,971
And I appreciate that we theoretically have the option to opt back in.

484
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:45,817
I think that's a huge question for the future, but I am pretty happy with what you guys have set out.

485
00:49:46,698 --> 00:49:52,383
And I do think it's really important to underscore how much more expensive it would be

486
00:49:52,963 --> 00:49:54,464
to have weekly trash pickups.

487
00:49:55,045 --> 00:50:09,335
And that's a cost, not just theoretically to the city, that's a real cost to taxpayers and to the budget and the other city services that we would need to reevaluate if we were to keep that.

488
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:12,997
You've already touched on education.

489
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:15,339
I was just wondering what the general plans were.

490
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,303
I guess with composting, it sounds like we're expecting the composting company to do a lot of that reach.

491
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:29,327
The companies, so one of the ideas that we heard, so we got ideas from sort of both, sorry, three companies.

492
00:50:30,768 --> 00:50:37,852
One of the ideas that one of the companies was very robust about was that they would organize actually grassroots campaigning.

493
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:51,480
And the way they described it to me was a political campaign where they had, this is your neighborhood, here's the list of households, you go door to door and talk to them about composting and that they would solicit

494
00:50:52,309 --> 00:51:01,826
their current subscribers to be neighborhood captains and to go out and volunteer to help recruit other people to do it.

495
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,112
And in my experience, not everybody has time and interest.

496
00:51:05,392 --> 00:51:09,197
But the people who are currently paying for composting it do it for a reason.

497
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:14,524
And they are much more likely to say, yes, I would volunteer to go knock on my neighbor's doors and talk about it.

498
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:20,972
And that was one of the things that they would organize as opposed to our staff organizing it, which was, I liked that a lot.

499
00:51:21,232 --> 00:51:21,372
Yeah.

500
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:22,694
Well, I mean, I think

501
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:31,700
everyone behind the rail can attest to the power of door-to-door canvassing, and we're going out that way.

502
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,062
So I'm encouraged by that.

503
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:49,191
Of course, there's so many other considerations that with different companies that you'll have to choose, or that you have options to choose from, but that does sound encouraging, and I think we'll have more conversations in the future about how to do that outreach, but I am encouraged.

504
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:50,852
Thank you.

505
00:51:50,892 --> 00:51:51,553
That's embarrassing.

506
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:54,466
Thank you, Madam President.

507
00:51:56,567 --> 00:52:02,031
And I do think something to note too is we're talking about year one starting next July one, right?

508
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:08,956
So we have all of this year and year one and year two, and everyone will, you know, there's already mail that goes out every year to everybody.

509
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:12,178
I know we keep our green book handy at all.

510
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:12,958
Yep, right there.

511
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:13,699
Oh, there.

512
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:20,884
He keeps it right in his jacket pocket, the commissioner does.

513
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:29,970
So there'll be lots of opportunity for everybody to have had a chance to take part in this program.

514
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,112
And I know in my household, the initial reaction was concern.

515
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:50,840
And then a little bit of discussion and Googling and research was maybe this makes a lot of sense and may actually be better, not just for the environment and for the city or for the city budget, but even for just being at home and not having food waste,

516
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,542
in an open, not open, but easy enough for a rat or a raccoon to open container.

517
00:52:59,283 --> 00:53:02,464
Just a couple of quick questions around the bins.

518
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:07,127
It's gonna be the same size of bins for trash and recycling for the next contract?

519
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:08,448
Yes.

520
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:08,708
Yes.

521
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:09,608
Yeah.

522
00:53:09,748 --> 00:53:12,570
And are they planning to keep the same bins that we have now?

523
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:20,974
We had asked them to budget for replacements as bins started to fail.

524
00:53:21,518 --> 00:53:27,581
Okay, but we're expecting like the vehicles will be able to pick up the same bins.

525
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,623
There is no plan to mass change out the bins.

526
00:53:31,363 --> 00:53:35,606
Vehicles would pick, there's no need to change the bins unless somebody's been as failing.

527
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:43,750
And at that point, if somebody's been as failing now as broken wheels or whatever, they should be contacting waste management or the CPW.

528
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:44,791
I'm gonna look right in here.

529
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:47,813
contact DPW for a replacement then.

530
00:53:48,053 --> 00:53:48,934
Okay, good.

531
00:53:49,214 --> 00:53:49,954
I may be in touch.

532
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:52,736
It happens all the time.

533
00:53:53,537 --> 00:53:55,779
Couple more things on the budget.

534
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:06,306
So budget impact over the next 10 years, I saw 3.5 to 6% average, depending on the elements within the scope.

535
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:09,269
Is that about the same as it is under the current contract?

536
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:12,751
Is that how much we've been growing every year under the existing contract or is it more?

537
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:18,861
I think the last jump we saw was about 5%, a little over 5%.

538
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:26,125
Then there was, I forget exactly which years, but there was a flat year a couple of years ago where we didn't have any growth in that line.

539
00:54:28,122 --> 00:54:34,946
But that's one of the things we're working with finance with, what is a reasonable growth from year to year.

540
00:54:35,546 --> 00:54:36,947
So, we're looking hard at that.

541
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,448
That's a big piece of the negotiations.

542
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:44,751
So, like I said about, I think it was like 5.2 when I calculated it out.

543
00:54:45,431 --> 00:54:48,213
The last time we grew, which was from, I wanna say 22 to 23.

544
00:54:50,699 --> 00:55:08,911
Yeah, and I saw you gave us in the memo or the strategy zero folks in the memo gave us average over the first five years average over the second five years, if it would be possible to give an estimate for all 10 years, instead of the averages and the like just, you know, 7.67.77.98.18.28.6, just to kind of see it year over year, since that's how we, you know, that's how I'm thinking about the budget anyway.

545
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,287
Sure, I mean.

546
00:55:17,168 --> 00:55:18,048
You're still figuring that out.

547
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:22,330
We're still in the throes of that particular negotiation.

548
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:29,032
We're working, we're pretty far down the road, but I think that's gonna come later.

549
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:32,294
You have your hands around the big scope, but the specific increments.

550
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:35,255
Year to year to year for the next 10 years, yes, yes.

551
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:36,275
Okay.

552
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:45,015
It's fine.

553
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:56,198
I just want to point out again, and everyone can shoot arrows at me if they want, 3.5 to 6% is more than 2.5%.

554
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:04,820
This is another cost driver that is increasing faster than the state allows us to increase the property tax levy without an override.

555
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:08,406
Do you think there will be an impact on the DPW budget?

556
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:11,110
This is half of the DPW budget, this contract alone.

557
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:18,422
Do you think there'll be an impact on the other half of the DPW budget as this line item increases faster than the tax base increases?

558
00:56:19,581 --> 00:56:20,402
Not if I can help it.

559
00:56:20,702 --> 00:56:21,023
Yeah.

560
00:56:21,103 --> 00:56:25,086
And I think, you know, the mayor is aware of this as well.

561
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:36,575
You know, obviously we've been discussing this with the mayor and she's, she's aware of that piece of it, and it's worth mentioning to that some of these are some of the costs are out of our control fuel, for example.

562
00:56:37,675 --> 00:56:43,179
So I would say that one of the biggest factors in my budget is fuel.

563
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,360
Fuel goes up higher than 2.5%.

564
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:53,926
So every year we receive an effective cut because we buy all the fuel for the whole city.

565
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:56,988
And it's a bigger growth of 2.5%.

566
00:56:57,788 --> 00:56:59,329
So your point is well taken.

567
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,711
And your point sinks deep in me.

568
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:03,112
So I appreciate it.

569
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:05,634
Well, you and I hope many others, because it's just,

570
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:28,831
I know, I think the more and more and more we talk about how many pieces of the city budget are increasing at rate faster than the tax levy is increasing, and how that means, you know, less money for maybe sidewalk repairs or less money for the forestry and tree planting and stump removal or less money for all the things that people are really concerned about in the city.

571
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:38,986
It's because we have these large major cost drivers that are increasing faster than two and a half percent and their limits in the city on the city by state law of property proposition two and a half.

572
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:42,731
I can only be overridden by an override.

573
00:57:45,158 --> 00:57:47,380
One last question on the budget.

574
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,485
Are there any program elements in here that could potentially limit cost growth?

575
00:57:53,645 --> 00:57:55,467
And these are just like totally out of the blue.

576
00:57:55,547 --> 00:57:59,871
I don't, you know, I don't pretend to be in the weeds the way that you guys have been in these negotiations.

577
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:07,237
But like, if everybody composted a ton, and suddenly the solid waste like trash volume was a lot lower than

578
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:11,243
expected, would that affect the cost to the city?

579
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:20,988
Or another thought was like, if all the recycling came in and it was all like, right, and no one was putting stuff in the recycling that was wrong, would that reduce cost to the city?

580
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:26,590
I'd say this, the recycling, yes to both, but the recycling would be a little bit different.

581
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,451
So you know, we're paying for the weight of the trash.

582
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:30,992
Yeah, to dispose of that's passed through cost again.

583
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:31,833
Yeah.

584
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:33,934
That's another cost we don't have a lot of control over.

585
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:36,655
And then as far as recyclables go, there's a formula

586
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:43,492
So if we can sell our recyclables on the market, we actually get a credit.

587
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:50,193
So if the market is healthy and folks are buying plastic, then we would actually get a credit.

588
00:58:50,753 --> 00:58:53,154
If it happens the other way around, we end up paying more.

589
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:58,715
If it can't be sold, then obviously then that is a cost that we have to pay.

590
00:58:59,395 --> 00:59:01,375
So hopefully that answers your question.

591
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:05,336
Well, I think, yeah, just kind of going to the point of maybe some of the education here.

592
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:06,936
And I know we already tried to do it.

593
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:13,421
And one of the reasons we're going down this road is to try to get a little bit more incentive money from the SDP to maybe do a little bit more education as well.

594
00:59:14,382 --> 00:59:30,334
But just letting folks know, right, like, there are ways that our behaviors, either through education or behavior change, whichever way you want to look at it, right, the city doing the education or residents adjusting their behaviors, there are ways that we can all pitch in a little bit to maybe help keep the cost down on this cost driver.

595
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,176
which I think we all wanna do.

596
00:59:32,857 --> 00:59:35,058
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

597
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:36,579
The first one is reduce.

598
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,040
Yeah.

599
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,181
And they're in that order for a reason.

600
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:38,641
Yeah.

601
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:42,884
So if we all reduce, then we're paying less as a city for the weight of the trash that we're disposing.

602
00:59:42,964 --> 00:59:43,084
Right.

603
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:59,857
And I think too, just the education point of piece of reduce could mean composting and just taking that food waste out of trash where it then, and we can talk about all the waste impacts of how it's unproductive and where if it's composted, maybe it is for productive use, but that's a great way to reduce

604
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:06,674
the stuff that's going into landfill and reduce the cost to the city and the taxpayer of the waste.

605
01:00:06,714 --> 01:00:10,157
Also, if I could just, will you both you both are staying for the regular meeting?

606
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:12,959
Yes, just because we're we're over time this meeting.

607
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,363
But yeah, any final words, then we'll go continue the conversation in the regular meeting.

608
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:23,808
And I just wanted to put on there that we actually built that into financially into the model that we're looking at right now.

609
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:27,251
So we pay per ton for trash.

610
01:00:27,551 --> 01:00:29,092
So we pay per household for pickup.

611
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:31,189
but then we pay for the weight of the trash.

612
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:34,371
Please don't throw away water bottles full of water.

613
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:38,594
That is the most wasteful thing you can do and cost the city a bajillion dollars.

614
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:46,499
But that said, the composting model is per household with the weight of it is built in there.

615
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:52,743
So if you compost more or less, we don't pay a different amount for your household.

616
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:58,006
So the more that's heavy wet weight food, if you put that in your compost bin,

617
01:00:58,479 --> 01:01:04,803
It literally saves the city money because we're not paying per pound for anything that goes into the compost bin.

618
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:10,887
So anybody who would like to sign up for the composting now, our preferred vendor at the moment is Garbage to Garden, and you can sign up.

619
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:19,372
And if you go to their website and you put in a Medford's address, you will get the Medford rate, which is $99 a year right now, but you can pay monthly.

620
01:01:19,392 --> 01:01:21,873
Great, I'm done, thank you.

621
01:01:22,273 --> 01:01:22,493
Thank you.

622
01:01:23,695 --> 01:01:25,055
Any further questions, we can move it.

623
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:29,477
And Mr. Castagnetti, I see you, if you could join us in the regular meeting, we will get to your question.

624
01:01:29,497 --> 01:01:31,377
Motion to adjourn.

625
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:37,439
On the motion of vices and bears to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk.

626
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:40,839
George already dropped off.

627
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:41,980
All those in favor?

628
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:42,440
Aye.

629
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,320
All those opposed?

630
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,560
Motion passes, meeting is adjourned.

631
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,601
We will take this up again in the regular meeting.
