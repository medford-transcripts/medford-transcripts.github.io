1
00:00:00,912 --> 00:00:02,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're having a fabulous spring.

2
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:05,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Una primavera muy especial.

3
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:10,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we have a quorum, apparently, I'm going to skip the roll call.

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see Martha is about to join us.

5
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Martha.

6
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:22,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am bringing the meeting to order.

7
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:26,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's review the minutes from May.

8
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll entertain a motion to approve the minutes.

9
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:36,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Lois, do you approve?

10
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:40,913
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a yes.

11
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:42,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob?

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,091
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have a motion.

14
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody made the motion.

15
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:53,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody has to make the motion, and then somebody has to second the motion.

16
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:58,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that it really matters, but for when it matters, you should know how to do it.

17
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make the motion.

18
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:02,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I move that we accept the minutes.

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll second that.

20
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:07,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for teaching me.

21
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:12,136
[SPEAKER_02]: So Lois approves of the minutes.

22
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:13,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob?

23
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:14,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

24
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:16,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Barry?

25
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:17,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

26
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Fran?

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,640
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Benji, yes.

28
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda?

29
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:27,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm not a voting member.

30
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:28,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.

31
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:30,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan?

32
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:32,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

33
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:34,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica?

34
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:35,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

35
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:37,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Martha?

36
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:38,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

37
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:41,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew.

38
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:45,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, also not a voting member.

39
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Matthew is a guest.

40
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:48,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

41
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's Medford community?

42
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Alicia?

43
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:00,753
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the community TV.

44
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:02,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're here to record the meeting.

45
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:04,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then.

46
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:07,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like that's everyone.

47
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:10,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also approve.

48
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, minutes are approved.

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go through the agenda.

50
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:31,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the next thing is the administrative updates.

51
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,992
[SPEAKER_01]: The only real administrative updates are

52
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:42,433
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have new interns in our office starting this week and next.

53
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:53,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure what work each of them will be taking on, but for future meetings, you should see some new faces coming in to help out.

54
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:12,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Brenda, are we having a table at the Circle the Square event?

55
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We are for Electrify Medford, yes.

56
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:19,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.

57
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,070
[SPEAKER_00]: But not for the committee?

58
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:27,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it really matters.

59
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:35,297
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I mean, if folks from the committee want to come to Circle the Square and help out there

60
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:42,170
[SPEAKER_01]: any materials that you want to have there, we can have it for the table that we have reserved for Electrify Medford.

61
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:53,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we have a save the date for the Harvest Your Energy Festival, or something of that ilk.

62
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be there with Trees Medford, Brenda.

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was hoping we'd be side by side, which we often are.

64
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:10,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I can sort of go back and forth as needed.

65
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,246
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

66
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't seen the layout for it yet.

67
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:23,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any further administrative updates?

68
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, I'd like to take a moment to welcome our guest.

69
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:34,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew, would you like to tell us about yourself?

70
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:37,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, not really.

71
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:42,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get in the way of the meeting, but thank you for being so inviting.

72
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:44,947
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.

73
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:45,908
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plenty of time.

74
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:54,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

75
00:04:54,254 --> 00:05:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we proceed to the monthly update on initiatives involving climate policy in Medford?

76
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,923
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one item in the administrative, the planning for the next meeting.

77
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,090
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like a floating meeting.

78
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,871
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we probably have to send out a doodle poll maybe.

79
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:20,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I volunteered in the last couple of years to have it in my backyard.

80
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:26,773
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see a installation of a heat pump system as a bonus.

81
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:36,835
[SPEAKER_00]: And my purple air monitor, which is currently saying the air quality is, I think it's okay.

82
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:42,134
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as a color code, if it's green, that's good.

83
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,535
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's orange, it's not so good.

84
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:45,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's red, run for the hills.

85
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:54,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that requires some, you know, just to see.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,301
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a Monday.

87
00:05:55,321 --> 00:06:04,946
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be pretty much Monday through, you know, we wouldn't have a Friday, but we could have it any evening from Monday through Thursday night that's

88
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:15,598
[SPEAKER_00]: We get most of the votes and typically we would have it starting a week of after the 4th of July through maybe mid August or something like that.

89
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,727
[SPEAKER_00]: One week I'm not around is week of July 22nd, but otherwise I'll be around to host the event.

90
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:30,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ren, are you able to send out some sort of a doodle poll?

91
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can definitely.

92
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:35,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

93
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:37,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Are folks happy to have it in Bob's backyard again?

94
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:40,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

95
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:42,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And we usually have a potluck.

96
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,932
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring your own food offering and beverage and very informal and

97
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,115
[SPEAKER_00]: another in-person meeting.

98
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:57,058
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no steps involved.

99
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:01,982
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone has a wheelchair, they can easily access the backyard.

100
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,843
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no issue there.

101
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:06,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

102
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:10,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, I can't wait to see your backyard in person after seeing it in the background.

103
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,950
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to rain again, because last year it rained.

104
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,571
[SPEAKER_00]: The year before, it was good.

105
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:21,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you can walk up the street and see my backyard, because I'm only five houses away.

106
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:25,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a five-seater canoe.

107
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:36,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And anybody who's serious about enjoying the day should come dressed for canoeing and take a ride.

108
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:45,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have two kayaks, a canoe, and a, well, anyway, we have flotilla, if you will.

109
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:48,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we could have the meeting on the water.

110
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's not go too far.

111
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.

112
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,660
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you call a floating meeting, Bob.

113
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.

114
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:00,004
[SPEAKER_00]: We have docks anyway, yeah.

115
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:05,729
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to stay away from the insects, so we'll stay away from the water.

116
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:09,239
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.

117
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:16,886
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look for the doodle poll and we'll even send an update as to when that meeting will be.

118
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:18,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sounds good.

119
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:21,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And this takes the place of both the July and August meetings.

120
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:22,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

121
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:22,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

122
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:23,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

123
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

124
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:30,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything else that folks should bring it you mentioned that it's going to be a potluck ship to people bring

125
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, folding chairs or anything like that.

126
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:43,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I have plenty of chairs, so don't need to bring anything but yourself and your favorite food or beverage that you would like to share.

127
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have extra chairs if you need them, Bob.

128
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:50,283
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great.

129
00:08:51,063 --> 00:09:00,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we often begin that meeting at 6 to avoid darkness, so that might be another consideration, but it's really

130
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:13,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly informal meeting and it's more like a summer break, but we talk about a few things in business and then we enjoy the event.

131
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:19,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember last time there was some real yummy food and a lot of desserts.

132
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:21,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like everyone brought a dessert.

133
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:23,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

134
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:28,820
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's better if it's outside so that you can see.

135
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:32,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, more things.

136
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:38,012
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to consult the local meteorologist to choose a good date.

137
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid we can't predict that far in advance.

138
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:42,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can.

139
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:48,521
[SPEAKER_01]: When I send out the doodle, the top two ones, I'll choose for the date and the rain date for it.

140
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:49,542
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great.

141
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, plan that ahead, I guess.

142
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:51,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

143
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,007
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense for a public meeting, I don't know.

144
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:57,729
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

145
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:01,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

146
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:01,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

147
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send that out.

148
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:12,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think the next thing on the agenda is the updates on the city initiatives.

149
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Top of that, I would, I would say electrify Medford.

150
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:33,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 1 more training and a Q and a session left for the coaches and we have 7 paid coaches and 11 volunteer coaches who are who are going through the trainings.

151
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:40,432
[SPEAKER_01]: And some have been joining our Zoom meetings to sort of do it all together.

152
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have been doing it on their own.

153
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:53,738
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an online dashboard and some of the paid coaches especially have been coming in to do the training in person because they don't have as much access to technology at home.

154
00:10:54,638 --> 00:11:04,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the lesson I learned from this is the need to be flexible to make it as easy as possible on the coaches who are spending so much time on this.

155
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:11,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the coaches have already been helping out at events.

156
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:19,275
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a Haitian Flag Day event that I brought a little dollhouse to, to sort of point out all of the

157
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,793
[SPEAKER_01]: the areas where the building could be improved.

158
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:32,643
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big hit with the kids and the parents who gave me an opportunity to talk to their parents as they were sort of hovering there with their kids.

159
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:40,131
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an asthma education event that I brought a portable induction cooktop to do.

160
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:58,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we're talking about the fact that natural gas is the number one trigger for asthma inside the home, you could then say, OK, here's one thing that you can do about it and be really hands-on with that.

161
00:11:58,829 --> 00:11:59,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a great event.

162
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we were talking about this a little bit earlier, but we'll have a table at Circle the Square on the 15th.

163
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:14,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll have some climate themed games that people can play.

164
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:19,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are games that I don't know if folks have heard about Mass Energize.

165
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:27,556
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're a nonprofit organization that's been working with lots of municipalities and community groups.

166
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have created these

167
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:40,330
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty large form wooden games with climate change themes to them that organizations can rent for the day.

168
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to be doing for Circle the Square and Harvest Your Energy Festival.

169
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So is anyone interested in helping to man our table for Circle the Square?

170
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:10,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Brenda, this is Bob, I can do at least for part of the, what is it, 3 to 7 p.m.?

171
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:11,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

172
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.

173
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:19,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll let you know what, maybe a couple hours of that period, whatever.

174
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sounds good.

175
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 15th, right?

176
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

177
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:25,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I can help set up.

178
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Brenda, I'll be there early to help set up.

179
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:44,986
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really helpful because we'll have to build up the games sort of get flat packed and then we have to set them all up.

180
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:48,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be more set up for this than there normally would be for a table.

181
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:55,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you email me when you need help and where and I'll do it.

182
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:56,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

183
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to join, but I do have a surgery, a minor surgery the day before, so I cannot join this one, but probably the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

184
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,344
[SPEAKER_02]: When does that take place again?

185
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,845
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, it's October 19th.

186
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:25,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the recovery is smooth for the surgery.

187
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:28,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

188
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:37,053
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to have some of the Electrify Medford coaches there helping out too.

189
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it'll be a really fun day.

190
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:55,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also going to be at the Multicultural Day at the Andrews School on the 22nd and at the Farmers Market on the 27th.

191
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:25,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And just dropping into the chat, there's a link to some of the, a spreadsheet with the outreach events that we're looking at for Electrify Medford with the people who have signed up to help out there.

192
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:51,351
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry I see Jessica's asking when when circle the square is happening so that is June 15th it's from 3 to 7 unfortunately last year was there was a rain date and it was pushed to Father's Day which would happen the same thing this year if it rained so that's a fingers crossed

193
00:15:57,507 --> 00:16:01,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Electrify Medford, we've had three people sign up so far.

194
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:10,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob was good enough to speak with one of them who was specifically looking for help in assessing some proposals for solar on her home.

195
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:18,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Bob, for doing that before we finished preparing all the materials and going through the training and everything.

196
00:16:24,298 --> 00:16:33,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Switching gears a little bit, the curbside compost program, the bulk compost and bin distribution event at City Hall was very successful.

197
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:35,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the suggestion.

198
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:39,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that came up in this April meeting for this group.

199
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:42,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you for pushing us to do that.

200
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:50,937
[SPEAKER_01]: We have currently... Put it in my closet.

201
00:16:51,677 --> 00:17:04,484
[SPEAKER_01]: A little over 3,000 people signed up for the program, a little over 1,000 who are currently enrolled, and a little over 2,000 who are on the wait list to start on July 1st.

202
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:18,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And Garbage to Garden is interviewing people now for a paid street team, in addition to some of the volunteers who have been helping out from Mothers Out Front.

203
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:21,602
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're still looking for volunteers.

204
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:30,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody's interested in helping out sort of getting the word out on your street, you can sign up with Garbage to Garden to do that.

205
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:35,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll drop that link in the group chat as well.

206
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:41,655
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just go on Garbage to Garden's website and sign up.

207
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:44,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medfordcompost.com.

208
00:17:52,166 --> 00:18:05,876
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of updates from some of the things that we discussed last time, the congressionally directed spending request, another word for earmarks, that we submitted.

209
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:18,426
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to find out about that until the Appropriations Committee makes decisions on the budget, hopefully July 31st.

210
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:29,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the timeline for that after that fact point is Congress will approve the final funding bill sometime between December and March.

211
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:42,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the agency that would be administering the funding would contact us in April or May to start getting the contract process going.

212
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:47,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the funding would actually officially be awarded in spring or summer of next year.

213
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:59,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a long process, but we should know this summer if we are actually going to be receiving the funding eventually, because really it's that Appropriations Committee

214
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:02,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Decision that's that's the important 1.

215
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:13,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for the community center, replacing the building that's there right now with a larger building.

216
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:20,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Has upgraded heating systems and solar panels and things like that.

217
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a question.

218
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:32,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's not just for heat pumps, but that's definitely part of it.

219
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:38,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the idea is to give them a larger location so that they can host more programs at the community center.

220
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:58,962
[SPEAKER_01]: The school HVAC project, we are close to signing contracts for the project manager.

221
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:02,594
[SPEAKER_01]: and the designer for the project.

222
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:06,656
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need to start this as soon as possible.

223
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:10,518
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully those contracts are finalized this week.

224
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:29,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really feel the urgency now because just since we've been working on those contracts, the water heater at the Brooks School died, and one of the chillers at the Roberts School died.

225
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:39,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just highlighting the state of the equipment at these schools that we really need to be moving quickly on them.

226
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:52,856
[SPEAKER_01]: One new thing, I'm not sure if Alicia had mentioned this to you in the past,

227
00:20:54,066 --> 00:21:22,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Previous earmark that was applied for we finally we got the word that we were approved for that And this is to You know renovate the Hegner Center That's a building near near Fellsway and Fulton intersection And the the earmark is basically to make the building habitable again so it can be used for

228
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:32,304
[SPEAKER_01]: offices for, you know, Board of Health and Office of Outreach and Prevention, and then also as a resilience hub.

229
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:40,167
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the case of some emergency, whether it's a power outage or flooding or something like that,

230
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:47,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a location that people could go to and they, you know, we could have cots there and things like that.

231
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:53,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're looking, we're trying to get multiple resilience hubs like that set up around the city.

232
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,982
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this isn't another one that we'll be working on.

233
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And my office isn't heading this up.

234
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:08,909
[SPEAKER_01]: The facilities director will be heading this up, but we'll definitely be involved just to make sure that as the building is renovated,

235
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:15,572
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that we're putting in efficient electric heating systems and things like that.

236
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:22,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Brenda, can I ask you a left-field question?

237
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:23,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

238
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:26,418
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an emergency shelter.

239
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:35,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a blow-up bed, a queen-size, double-high blow-up bed that developed a bubble in the middle.

240
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:46,741
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now useless to me for couples to sleep on unless they wanna sleep on either side of the bed, but it's not totally unusable.

241
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,384
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an inflatable and it deflates.

242
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:55,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you use that for something like that?

243
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:59,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I am trying very hard to find somebody who can make use of it.

244
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to just throw it away.

245
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:05,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.

246
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:15,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I can ask the folks at the Board of Health because they're the ones who arrange for things like cots for locations like this.

247
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:24,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have specific cots that they use because they can be easily collapsed and stored.

248
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:29,965
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can talk to them and see if donations like that would be helpful.

249
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would love to see it find a use in an emergency.

250
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be far better than nothing.

251
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:39,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

252
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the only other thing I wanted to mention was that

253
00:23:52,575 --> 00:24:04,460
[SPEAKER_01]: We were awarded technical assistance from the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to make a decarbonization roadmap for city-owned buildings.

254
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:18,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea of that is we set out exactly when all of the different systems in the buildings are likely to reach end of life so that we plan ahead to

255
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:22,488
[SPEAKER_01]: to replace them.

256
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:38,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, you know, we'll have time to apply for grants to get funding and we're not going we wouldn't be in emergency situations where we might be tempted to just replace them with in kind systems just because it would be quicker.

257
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:51,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kathleen's actually helping us to collect information about city owned buildings to give to the to the consultant that would be giving us this technical assistance.

258
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:05,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be a huge project, but I think the roadmap at the end will be really interesting for this group to see as we are looking at the different city buildings and what we can do to improve them.

259
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:16,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are all the updates that I had.

260
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions about any of that?

261
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:42,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Brenda, did I hear that Medford's program with the Resilience Hubs slash emergency centers is being used as a model in other communities?

262
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:45,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

263
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:53,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the city of Cambridge has a community center that they are

264
00:25:55,918 --> 00:26:02,402
[SPEAKER_01]: doing essentially the same thing as what we were looking to do with one of their community centers.

265
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:05,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're moving faster than us on it.

266
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:08,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have more funding to be able to do it.

267
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:12,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to see.

268
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:23,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And MVP, the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant, they have been using the model that we have set up with the

269
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:39,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Connectors, the folks who speak the major languages in the city and are helping to do outreach to different groups.

270
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:47,798
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using the model that we started with our connectors as sort of a way for people to think about this for their own community center.

271
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:52,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So start with the outreach and the social services, then create the physical location.

272
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,256
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to actually be able to go to in the event of an emergency.

273
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:11,311
[SPEAKER_01]: But because you've been doing all of the social services work beforehand, you have that trust and you are the people that they're looking to for help in cases like that.

274
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more questions for Brenda?

275
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Brenda, this is Bob.

276
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,164
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned something about an event of emergency.

277
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:40,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a municipal plan in case there's gonna be like a major flooding event?

278
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:45,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's hard to predict those sometimes.

279
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:55,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're thunderstorms that are just like this pop up and they can create a lot of local street flooding.

280
00:27:56,417 --> 00:28:02,360
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if there's any organized approach for reacting to that.

281
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:13,446
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has been going through a planning process with all the different departments coming together to discuss different types of emergencies and

282
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,221
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be the response to each of them.

283
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:26,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if there is a public-facing document for that that's prepared yet, but the city has been going through that process.

284
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:37,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, is there a, do we have like a, when do you think there'll be more progress on that?

285
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:38,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's hard to say.

286
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:42,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Has any other community done this already?

287
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Cambridge, Boston, they have all this money.

288
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:52,662
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.

289
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:58,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been directly involved in Medford's responses.

290
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:02,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been mostly department heads who have been coming together to have these discussions.

291
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:08,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can follow up with Alicia to find out more about it and sort of what the timeline is and all of that.

292
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:19,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's really a, you know, I've been living on the river for, Mystic River for decades.

293
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:26,483
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst that's happened is that the water got over my dock, but it didn't get over the bank.

294
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:30,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a pretty bad event.

295
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:34,887
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like eight inches of rain or something like that in a June event.

296
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:46,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we've avoided at least the river flooding areas near it.

297
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:58,828
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there have been sometimes there are, if there's a lot of street flooding, you can have pockets where there's poor drainage.

298
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:07,214
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if there's any approach for improving the drainage in areas that we know are problems.

299
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:08,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

300
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:17,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, in Medford, because of the Amelia Earhart Dam, the river flooding is not necessarily as much of an issue.

301
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:26,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, it's it's really that that street level flooding that that we've the city's been focusing on.

302
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:32,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the, the dam will need to be raised because of sea level rise in the, in the future.

303
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:38,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that the cities and cities around the dam have been.

304
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:44,371
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the state to try to make sure that the state allocates funding to do that.

305
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:49,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as they do, then the river flooding is not going to be as much of an issue.

306
00:30:51,694 --> 00:31:02,540
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has done a climate vulnerability assessment and some follow-up studies focusing on the stormwater flooding.

307
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:09,367
[SPEAKER_01]: in different parts of the city and has really highlighted some areas to focus on.

308
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:15,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the first ones that the city is focusing on is in South Medford.

309
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:21,836
[SPEAKER_01]: The streets are Bowen and Golden Ave.

310
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:25,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is an area around Tufts Park.

311
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,102
[SPEAKER_01]: that also has some flooding.

312
00:31:29,603 --> 00:31:43,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the studies that we've done have identified those areas as a particular priority, not just because of the flooding that's happening, but because of the sort of the demographics of, you know, the number of people who are living there and their social vulnerability.

313
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:52,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have gotten funding, grant funding to do the design work for the

314
00:31:55,035 --> 00:32:11,293
[SPEAKER_01]: The upgrades to the drainage system for Boeing golden abs and have have done that design work and are now moving forward with with looking for grant funding for the actual construction of the, the actual improvements to that drainage system.

315
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:15,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's a slow process, but it's moving along.

316
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:21,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's good because I think that's just nuts and bolts type of thing.

317
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:28,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding where the street flooding is known to be a problem and then figuring out how to rectify that.

318
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good to know that that's being done.

319
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:44,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Brenda, on that topic, I heard at one of the budget subcommittee meetings that the police got a grant

320
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:51,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford police got a grant to work on resilience and response related.

321
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:56,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a climate related grant and be interesting to know more about that.

322
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:04,484
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a chance and how the how that works with other departments, particularly planning and.

323
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:25,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just observed that one of the consequences of flooding that maybe people don't see so much is the sewer outfalls, the combined sewer outfalls, and the sanitary sewers that behave properly normally, but in the heavy rain, they dump sewage.

324
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:33,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I live on the lower lake and the river at a point where that happens pretty often, I'm very aware of it.

325
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Alewife Brook related groups are very aware of it.

326
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:54,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be interesting to know, as a kind of follow-up question, how our climate plan addresses water quality and the contamination in our surface water.

327
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:58,422
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing is that the

328
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:07,103
[SPEAKER_01]: The overflows that you probably hear about are from the Somerville and the Cambridge sewers.

329
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:17,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford actually already has a separated system where the drainage and the sewers are actually different systems.

330
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:22,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stormwater doesn't mix with the sewage in Medford.

331
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but if there's,

332
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:32,146
[SPEAKER_01]: overflow that's happening in Somerville, it's going into the Mystic River.

333
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:40,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, same with Cambridge up on there, on the Alewife Brook.

334
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:46,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Although they've been working, both cities have been working to do sewer separation projects.

335
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:57,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to live in both in Cambridge and Somerville on streets when they were doing the sewer separation projects there.

336
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:03,655
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time for them to be doing construction on our streets to be doing that.

337
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:08,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, Medford doesn't have to do that because they were constructed properly to begin with.

338
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:23,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just close by saying there are definitely sanitary sewer overflows that aren't related to the separation issue.

339
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just old sewers that

340
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: accidentally, if you want to call it accidental, do flood the river, discharge into the river at times when there's heavy rain.

341
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

342
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:51,126
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding was that, huh, that that wasn't true, but I can follow up with the city engineer to see more about that.

343
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:55,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's also DCR responsibility.

344
00:35:55,557 --> 00:35:59,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see their trucks parked out here monitoring those.

345
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You know where those sewers are because they park a truck there during heavy rain.

346
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:10,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to find out some more facts and not just feelings about it, OK?

347
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:13,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd love to find out more.

348
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any more questions for Brenda?

349
00:36:31,674 --> 00:36:41,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one city related question, and that is, are we continuing to replace gas lines?

350
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:47,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So my understanding is there is nothing preventing National Grid from replacing gas lines at the moment.

351
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:53,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's part of what Senator Barrett

352
00:36:55,461 --> 00:37:08,011
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bill that Senator Barrett was talking about, I think that's a first step to getting to the point where they can stop that from happening.

353
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:11,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

354
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:17,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I see that Matthew has a question.

355
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Matthew.

356
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:21,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is OK.

357
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:28,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very nice to meet you recently, Brenda, and to speak again on the telephone today.

358
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:42,027
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I live in public housing, and the question I'm always trying to want to know is what the housing authority can do for more, you know, climate resiliency and renewable energy and stuff like that.

359
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:47,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm never kind of quite like you gave a recommendation today about a question I had about the Salton.

360
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It was no walk in court.

361
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know about the redevelopment.

362
00:37:53,622 --> 00:37:57,345
[SPEAKER_05]: what was in plan for that as far as renewable energy.

363
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:05,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that this commission, and I think Barry, you took leadership on this as far as the ordinance for the solar panels.

364
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:18,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sometimes I have questions that they will not apply to state and federal property and all kinds of stuff, but I don't really know where to start as far as how to move forward with this.

365
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:20,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the current board of commissioners isn't really

366
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:25,845
[SPEAKER_05]: ambitious as far as I think addressing this and I think the executive director has a lot on this plate.

367
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:39,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anybody has any recommendations about how we would go about all these buildings, all the housing buildings here, I would like to know any directions to point me in and any attempts that have been made in the past.

368
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:39,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

369
00:38:52,958 --> 00:39:02,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't been directly involved in the Walkling Court discussions, but I can follow up with other folks here.

370
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:09,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew, I think when we talked earlier, we talked about the fact that Danielle has probably been involved with that, so I can follow up with her.

371
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Martha, do you have some insights on this?

372
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Barry.

373
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:17,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

374
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:43,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know if it's an insight, but I would think if the city is taking an inventory of, I think it's a terrific idea to do what Brenda described, where you look at the remaining life of the HVAC equipment in municipal buildings, public buildings, so you can plan to intervene, rather than replacing a boiler when it

375
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:48,928
[SPEAKER_03]: dies on a weekend with a new boiler, you're ready to go in with a heat pump.

376
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if that also extends to public housing in the city.

377
00:39:56,951 --> 00:40:00,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't because those are technically not city-owned buildings.

378
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:05,014
[SPEAKER_01]: The housing authority is a separate entity.

379
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would suggest that you somehow

380
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:18,250
[SPEAKER_03]: get them on the same plan of understanding where their opportunities are.

381
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:25,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

382
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:25,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Martha.

383
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:40,738
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to follow up with the folks that we've been talking to about the Willis Ave Community Center and just follow up with them about whether they have a similar type of decarbonization roadmap.

384
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:43,877
[SPEAKER_01]: what their plans are.

385
00:40:46,878 --> 00:41:01,904
[SPEAKER_06]: In partial answer to Matt's question, I've asked specifically about the Walkling Court development, whether there would be solar panels on those roofs, and I was told yes.

386
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:06,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good news.

387
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Martha and Barry.

388
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:11,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

389
00:41:12,314 --> 00:41:15,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Brenda.

390
00:41:23,737 --> 00:41:26,277
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, last call for questions for Brenda.

391
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:31,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak now or forever hold your peace.

392
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Paul here?

393
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a number 617-417.

394
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:44,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that you, Paul?

395
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:48,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathleen.

396
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:50,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kathleen.

397
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:51,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

398
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:59,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been walking to meeting and now I'm in my car.

399
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:06,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Martha, I know that you've been talking with Paul about the pollinator garden work

400
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,360
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's been doing, or the two of you have been doing.

401
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you be comfortable talking about it a little bit now?

402
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:18,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you a little bit about it.

403
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul's been doing the work, really.

404
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:37,568
[SPEAKER_03]: He has identified, with a group of interested people, he's identified five locations in city, in Medford Public Parks where we could put

405
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:53,763
[SPEAKER_03]: a pollinator garden, natural meadow, you know, there are different terms for the same idea of using native plants that pollinators have great value to pollinators.

406
00:42:55,224 --> 00:43:00,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's identified places that have high visibility, so it could be an educational,

407
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:12,327
[SPEAKER_03]: tool, but are not competing with youth sports or some other use of the property, and that are ecologically suitable.

408
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:24,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to present this to the Parks Commission, or there's a group he's presenting to, I think, on the 18th to get support.

409
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:29,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have, turns out there's a pollinator group at Tufts.

410
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: student group, which is going to participate.

411
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: They like to partner with other groups, so we'll be working with them.

412
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:49,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Mystic River Watershed Association also has someone who has done natural meadows and has expertise in this.

413
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe within the group that Paul's pulled together, there are

414
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,681
[SPEAKER_03]: at least one person who has experience.

415
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:05,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we've, he's got real potential here for getting this done and making a difference.

416
00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:20,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's also engaged with the high school science teacher who, you know, we can't do it this summer, but by next summer, we might, it might make sense to have a student project next spring and summer.

417
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:22,753
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I know.

418
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:29,542
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot from the last time we met.

419
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:35,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see some hands-on work happening there.

420
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:41,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the update, Martha.

421
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:48,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we move on to new business?

422
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:51,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any questions for Martha?

423
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:02,657
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on to new business.

424
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:08,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would like to introduce a new topic?

425
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I have something that I just wanted to mention.

426
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:26,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that Trees Medford was approved for CPA funds to do a park trees inventory to help sort of complete the city's tree inventory.

427
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:30,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, Lois, you're involved with Trees Medford.

428
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:34,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any information about that you can share?

429
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:45,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing specific at this point, but yes, we are doing what we can.

430
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,443
[SPEAKER_07]: On Circle the Square, I think Amanda will be there.

431
00:45:57,037 --> 00:46:01,560
[SPEAKER_07]: at the table, and that's a time to get some more updates.

432
00:46:05,642 --> 00:46:07,203
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're very active.

433
00:46:07,263 --> 00:46:11,946
[SPEAKER_07]: They did the giveaway at the library and got a lot more trees started.

434
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:20,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did a tree pickup in April, I guess.

435
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:27,320
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be doing it again in the fall like we did last year.

436
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:32,004
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting lots of trees out there, I can tell you that.

437
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:45,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're aware there's a public listening session

438
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:49,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this was put out through the Go Green Medford Google group, so you're definitely aware.

439
00:46:50,100 --> 00:47:14,068
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a public listening session tomorrow evening that DCR is holding about a project for McDonald Park where they'll be replacing trees that have, it sounds like they've been victims of the Emerald Ash Borer.

440
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:33,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any updates on the Harvester Energy Festival planning?

441
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an intern?

442
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have an intern working on that?

443
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:39,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.

444
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:46,488
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one new intern start today, and we'll have a couple more starting over the next week.

445
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:49,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll start digging into it then.

446
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:07,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have plenty of time, so.

447
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:11,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new topic I'd like to introduce.

448
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:18,491
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'll indulge me for a couple minutes, I came across some climate maps

449
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:27,834
[SPEAKER_02]: the climate future of the United States and Massachusetts in particular, there's maps and tables.

450
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:39,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And the table part is basically a climate risk scorecard for each Massachusetts county for multiple types of climate impacts.

451
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it okay if I screen share that?

452
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:45,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

453
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:46,858
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to your co host.

454
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:48,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

455
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:54,633
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

456
00:49:02,915 --> 00:49:05,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll send this link shortly.

457
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:07,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ProPublica article.

458
00:49:09,176 --> 00:49:18,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't take you through the whole thing, but this is our suitable temperate zone right now, or historically.

459
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically, it's moving upwards towards

460
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:27,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Maine, Vermont, Canada.

461
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:30,218
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a heat map.

462
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:35,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the south, southeast, midwest, western states affected.

463
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:40,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Extreme heat and humidity.

464
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:47,811
[SPEAKER_02]: This central part of the country, this middle belt surprised me.

465
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Also southeast coast.

466
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:55,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Western states, Southwest.

467
00:49:58,626 --> 00:50:01,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and is that Louisiana?

468
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:02,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

469
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:09,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Wildfires, Western states, of course.

470
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:16,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Sea level rises, coastal areas all around the perimeter of the US.

471
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,921
[SPEAKER_02]: This is farm crop yields.

472
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:26,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So purple is bad.

473
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: The southeast is going to have lower agricultural yield.

474
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:41,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Green is good, because that's a negative decline, which is actually an increase.

475
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,628
[SPEAKER_02]: But this isn't a high emissions scenario.

476
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:47,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Moderate emissions scenario looks a little better.

477
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:54,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Economic damages.

478
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:56,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.

479
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:58,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these maps have nothing in New England.

480
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:02,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean there's no data or there's no change?

481
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that for many of the metrics, we in New England and Massachusetts are pretty well situated.

482
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:17,959
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very insulated from the worst impacts of climate change compared to the rest of the country.

483
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:26,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And where you do see, this was very interesting, especially because this green is good.

484
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually showing that in Vermont and Maine, they're going to see some economic gains from climate change in the decades 2040 to 2060.

485
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:47,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Major economic losses in Florida and much of the coastal southeast.

486
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:54,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a good place for real estate in the long term, the Southeast.

487
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is that very interesting table.

488
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually goes on and on and on.

489
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single county in the United States is captured.

490
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But because the counties are dispersed, they're actually in order of worst impacts to

491
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,490
[SPEAKER_02]: less serious impacts.

492
00:52:23,951 --> 00:52:29,512
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did was I cut and pasted and stitched together.

493
00:52:29,532 --> 00:52:33,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

494
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:41,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut and pasted and stitched together this, these little pieces, Massachusetts.

495
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all the MA counties.

496
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:50,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Suffolk County includes Boston, so that's why you see sea level rise there.

497
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:54,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Barnstable County also, purple.

498
00:52:54,335 --> 00:53:00,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The darker the shade, the worse the impact.

499
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:03,959
[SPEAKER_02]: They also scored it with numbers.

500
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Middlesex County, if you look at this area compared to

501
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:23,069
[SPEAKER_02]: What we saw in the beginning of this table, we're pretty lucky compared to the rest of the US.

502
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also pretty lucky compared to coastal Massachusetts.

503
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:37,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll stop there.

504
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,412
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your reaction?

505
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:44,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that surprise you or did you learn something new?

506
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:50,606
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bob.

507
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:56,010
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard about a lot of rainstorms in the Houston area.

508
00:53:57,131 --> 00:54:07,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect with the bad hurricane years, you can get a lot of damage in the hurricane-prone states, which is probably part of that issue.

509
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:15,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard, you know, it's much more expensive now to even get house insurance in these states.

510
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:20,161
[SPEAKER_00]: because insurance companies are losing so much money with a big storm.

511
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:25,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's an economic issue.

512
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:40,497
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much exposure to high temperatures, high sea surface temperatures, which will generate abnormally large rain events.

513
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:54,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's the rain events and the wind events that are driving this, the problems with livability, affordability, that type of thing.

514
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:08,462
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting to me to see the green economic impact in northern Maine because I'm originally from Maine and

515
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:36,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of family there still who are seeing economic impacts already for things like they work in the woods industry and they are seeing more weeks of the year where they aren't able to do work because the frost has melted earlier than it did before.

516
00:55:37,237 --> 00:55:39,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can't actually go in with their equipment into the woods.

517
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:41,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It would dig it up too much.

518
00:55:41,444 --> 00:55:45,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're actually out of work for more weeks of the year because of that.

519
00:55:48,547 --> 00:56:06,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I would guess that the projected economic gains in Maine and Vermont have more to do with people wanting to move there, people who are going to flee worse areas, and also the farmers will have greater yield.

520
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:08,079
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be able to grow more types of crops.

521
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to point something out about the scale of the map.

522
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:24,303
[SPEAKER_03]: The county scale is a very interesting scale.

523
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:28,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still pretty broad brush.

524
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:45,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So it may be that there's a benign effect over, say, Middlesex County, but within that county, certain populations or communities are going to be much more vulnerable than others.

525
00:56:46,919 --> 00:56:56,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen maps that include social vulnerability, and the EPA does that, or attempts to do that, for example.

526
00:56:56,944 --> 00:56:58,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And those maps are quite different.

527
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:06,208
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see some pretty severe effects in specific pockets.

528
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you referring to the EJ populations, environmental justice?

529
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:14,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

530
00:57:15,472 --> 00:57:29,264
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there was a study on Chelsea, you know, of the heat effects in Chelsea compared to, say, Medford or, you know, another different community.

531
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:37,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to be hit much harder because of the density and the amount of paving, you know, the amount of heat absorbed.

532
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:41,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the fact that people don't have air conditioning.

533
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:49,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And the housing quality, it is not such that, you know, the housing is not designed to keep heat out.

534
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:59,183
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, that's just a small example of, you know, how you have to really look at this at a pretty fine grained level to find out where the impacts are.

535
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:02,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my opinion anyway.

536
00:58:05,835 --> 00:58:14,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would take that even a step further and say that what Martha's bringing up is absolutely right.

537
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:30,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And but I think it takes it beyond geography that you can't really necessarily look at it geographically to next door neighbors could experience very different impacts from from climate change.

538
00:58:44,964 --> 00:58:50,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more thoughts on this topic or any other topics of new business?

539
00:58:55,126 --> 00:59:05,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just add, I'd question whether they factored in two things that are, again, people aren't so aware of, but that are important.

540
00:59:05,448 --> 00:59:07,689
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the impact of wildfire smoke.

541
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:18,738
[SPEAKER_03]: because Canada is basically a big smoking ash can north of us that is sending us huge amounts of air pollution.

542
00:59:19,979 --> 00:59:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Air quality has declined in recent years because of the fires.

543
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:35,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, ozone production is increasing with the climate change, and that has a great impact on people's health.

544
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:40,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that particular study factored in.

545
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:44,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are dynamic, and they're hard to characterize.

546
00:59:46,546 --> 00:59:47,566
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're important.

547
00:59:50,447 --> 00:59:58,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was in New York City last summer when it was hit by that really bad two days of wildfire smoke.

548
00:59:59,190 --> 00:59:59,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was shocking.

549
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,631
[SPEAKER_02]: The sky was red.

550
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:02,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hazy.

551
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:05,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people weren't wearing masks.

552
01:00:06,763 --> 01:00:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a couple hours of exposure without a mask made me pretty sick.

553
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:15,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sick for the next five days.

554
01:00:30,512 --> 01:00:31,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, any more?

555
01:00:32,935 --> 01:00:37,117
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts or does anyone have a matter of new business?

556
01:00:55,525 --> 01:01:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one more thing I wanted to talk to you all about.

557
01:01:02,012 --> 01:01:11,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any interest in a talk by a soil scientist or soil expert?

558
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:17,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I happen to know three that I've met through my work, and two of them are board members.

559
01:01:21,032 --> 01:01:29,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Our subcontractor recently produced a healthy soils report just two weeks ago, and it's a very comprehensive document.

560
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:34,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to hear from you all just to gauge the interest.

561
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:47,869
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is some, I'd be happy to invite one of those three people to give a brief talk on soil degradation, regenerative practices, and healthy soils.

562
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,290
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we define that?

563
01:01:56,418 --> 01:01:58,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be very interesting.

564
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:02,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it apply at all to our specific area?

565
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:24,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Their general knowledge will certainly apply, such as the do's and don'ts, and what traditional or more modern agriculture has been getting wrong.

566
01:02:25,925 --> 01:02:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: and what regenerative practices we need to move towards and why, and the relationship between soil as a carbon sink and mitigating climate impacts, mitigating climate change.

567
01:02:41,898 --> 01:02:51,827
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the Healthy Soils report, it's more focused on my MVP project in the Nashua River watershed.

568
01:02:53,280 --> 01:03:00,604
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's certain parts of the report that are definitely applicable to any and all areas.

569
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,567
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be an interesting topic for our September meeting.

570
01:03:16,811 --> 01:03:17,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew, go ahead.

571
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:21,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I wanted to have a community garden some years back.

572
01:03:22,718 --> 01:03:31,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people were saying that we should not grow any vegetables in this soil around here because it's so polluted.

573
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, Martha, you and I, we also talked about this.

574
01:03:34,483 --> 01:03:38,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Martha is actually, I guess, was one of the commissioners you were speaking about that knows a lot about soil.

575
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:50,009
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was just kind of wondering about this report, if it would be somehow, if the idea is to eventually use it to show to policymakers or anything like that,

576
01:03:50,851 --> 01:04:02,719
[SPEAKER_05]: for a failure to address all the pollutants, it's creating situations where people do not have such options in which they can grow food or anything like that, if there's any kind of relation.

577
01:04:07,202 --> 01:04:09,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that that's a really good point.

578
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:15,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love it if this talk tied into, again, local conditions.

579
01:04:16,087 --> 01:04:19,610
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of brownfield soils

580
01:04:21,411 --> 01:04:31,774
[SPEAKER_03]: When they put in the clipper ship connector, they got delayed, I think, about a year because they had to remove lead, you know, soil that had too much lead in it.

581
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:47,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think twice about planting food because of, you know, so many of the areas are brownfields or just not suitable soils.

582
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a great topic.

583
01:04:51,402 --> 01:05:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And if brownfields and contamination is your particular concern, one of the soil experts I had in mind, it just so happens that he founded a company

584
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:18,808
[SPEAKER_02]: affirmed that for many years was remediating contaminated soils, including some of the worst brownfield sites in the Merrimack and Nashua watershed area.

585
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:22,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'd love to invite Dr. Ralph Baker.

586
01:05:22,329 --> 01:05:26,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm certain he would agree in September.

587
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:29,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and we have a new guest.

588
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:35,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we still?

589
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:36,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

590
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

591
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about the puppy?

592
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:46,321
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an individual named Mark, but he's no longer with us.

593
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:51,205
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your puppy's name?

594
01:05:53,727 --> 01:05:54,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Nim.

595
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:01,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And how'd you choose that name?

596
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my nephew's dog, so I don't know.

597
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

598
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:19,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But he saw me sitting here and my sister-in-law's in the bathtub, which he couldn't follow her into, so he latched on to me.

599
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:28,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears that we've exhausted the agenda, so I'd like to make a motion to adjourn.

600
01:06:30,677 --> 01:06:31,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

601
01:06:36,614 --> 01:06:39,876
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to take a roll call on that one, Sarah, you could.

602
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:41,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved.

603
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:44,680
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can just ask, does anybody object?

604
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:45,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

605
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:48,442
[SPEAKER_02]: No objections.

606
01:06:51,704 --> 01:06:53,466
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone objects, say nay.

607
01:06:53,486 --> 01:06:56,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you agree, say aye.

608
01:06:56,588 --> 01:07:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

609
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

610
01:07:09,436 --> 01:07:10,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everyone.
