142
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:39,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility students at the Brooks Elementary School for their fundraiser to purchase safety devices for our local United States Postal Service mail carriers.

143
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:45,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that we invite these students to the May 14 City Council meeting to receive a citation for their fantastic work.

144
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:57,902
[SPEAKER_04]: We also had from Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved the City Council recognize the amazing work of Savannah McLaughlin and Adam Costello, members of the CCSR, and 5th grade students from the Brooks Elementary School on providing safety whistles for postal workers.

145
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:02,403
[SPEAKER_04]: We unanimously approve those resolutions and we are excited to offer these citations tonight.

146
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:05,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli if he would like to say any words.

147
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:06,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

148
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:10,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight is a great example of what Method truly is about, right?

149
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:16,320
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, tonight was just, we haven't had many of these in a long time, but this was a love fest.

150
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:19,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, this is what Method's all about.

151
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:30,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So a group that was started a few years back, the CCSR, we have one of our leaders here, Mr. Richard Trotter is here tonight.

152
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that

153
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:45,691
[SPEAKER_06]: when we heard about this story, and then we saw it on TV, and then you see it in action, because, you know, it sounds, well, that's cute, right?

154
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:50,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all of a sudden, our postal worker walked down the street with the whistle.

155
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, and you see what's going on.

156
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some dangers.

157
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:56,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, there are dangers.

158
00:27:57,016 --> 00:28:01,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had two fifth graders that decided that they wanted to do something about it.

159
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:03,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's easy just to sit back and do nothing.

160
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is what's exciting when you have a fifth grade.

161
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:25,810
[SPEAKER_06]: to fifth graders that can reach out to this school, that can reach out to an organization like CCSR, and then provide an avenue that they can do something really, really, really moving, and something that really shows the city and shows their friends and shows everybody that you take an initiative,

162
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,626

256
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:46,250
[SPEAKER_02]: We met with the council zoning consultant and our discussion centered on updating some of the critical definitions that have been flagged for updating.

257
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We also discussed the timeline of the project over the next several months.

258
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:50,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

259
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:51,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

260
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:56,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe there's an error on the agenda that is on us.

261
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:58,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you amend to remove the 2-4?

262
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,401
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just, we're just, it's a Claire Blair.

263
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:03,564
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just one additional paper number.

264
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:04,424
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

265
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:08,248
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve seconded by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

266
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed.

267
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

268
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Refer to committee for further discussion.

269
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:15,696
[SPEAKER_04]: 24-351 offered by Councilor Leming.

270
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:17,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me one second here.

271
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:25,300
[SPEAKER_04]: be it resolved, whereas veterans in the city of Medford need a place to live and are often discriminated against when searching for housing.

272
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the veteran services director shall have the authority to offer available funds to entities that choose to rent to qualified veterans.

273
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:36,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that this be discussed with the veteran services director and the city's legal representation in committee.

274
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn it over to Councilor Leming.

275
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,588
[SPEAKER_04]: What committee would you like to refer this to?

276
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And the intent of this section is to keep these relatively short.

277
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know there's a proposed agenda here.

278
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:54,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee mainly because that primarily covers Veterans Affairs.

279
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:09,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also invited over the Veterans Services Director, Veronica Shaw, for this, but essentially this is a paper that would allow the Veterans Services Director to establish a program

280
00:39:10,262 --> 00:39:19,264
[SPEAKER_09]: under which she may offer monetary incentives to landlords who choose to rent out to qualified veterans.

281
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:29,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been asking KP Law for legal advice around this, as well as talking with the city's chief of staff around this issue.

282
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:35,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I would motion to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

283
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:40,911
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, on the motion to refer to resident services and public engagement by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Collins.

284
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Shaw, is there anything you want to add at this time?

285
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:48,656
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been with us for a while, so I want to give you the chance to speak on this paper and why this issue is so important.

286
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:49,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

287
00:39:57,743 --> 00:39:59,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may need to adjust the microphone.

288
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:00,926
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

289
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for having me.

290
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:11,497
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I would like to be able to do is offer landlords, either private, I prefer private corporations,

291
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,667
[SPEAKER_19]: think it would probably be discriminatory if I said no to them.

292
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:21,928
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to offer them $500 in exchange for them renting to veterans.

293
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:28,890
[SPEAKER_19]: There is a lot of stigma around veterans and a lot of landlords just choose not to rent to them.

294
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,611
[SPEAKER_19]: And that snowballs to homelessness.

295
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,612
[SPEAKER_19]: and I'm hoping that this will help.

296
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:42,294
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to start small, offering to four landlords this fiscal year.

297
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:57,479
[SPEAKER_19]: The funds will come out of my cash aid budget, and they would, if they continue to allow that veteran to stay with them, they would get that every year, as long as both parties are agreeing to it.

298
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:02,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions on the motion?

299
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Callahan.

300
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:11,734
[SPEAKER_13]: As I raise my hand, I realize this is something we can discuss in committee, so I take it back.

301
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:12,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind, thank you.

302
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:13,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

303
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:19,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilors, I just wanted to thank you for taking so much time out of your evening to be with us.

304
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you've done a lot of homework for this.

305
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:25,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is something I mean, if I speak for myself, I very much support.

306
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:27,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope the council supports.

307
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:34,372
[SPEAKER_11]: We, I think, you know, we often forget that homelessness and this housing crisis touches

308
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,519
[SPEAKER_11]: wide swaths of our population, including veterans.

309
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's really easy for us not to see that.

310
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:45,429
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really important that we bring it to light and do what we can to make it work.

311
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're curious about all the work that we can do.

312
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:52,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you have a lot of research, but we have more time to talk about it.

313
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:55,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Gallo.

314
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:56,465
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

315
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:01,409
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm excited that you and Councilor Leming are bringing this to us.

316
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,750
[SPEAKER_20]: I have many questions.

317
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,051
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm excited to get into it.

318
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:08,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm also excited that we have this section where it's clearly marked.

319
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,817
[SPEAKER_20]: This is simply what we're referring to committee.

320
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,259
[SPEAKER_20]: I will save all of my questions for committee.

321
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:14,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

322
00:42:14,953 --> 00:42:20,219
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng to refer this paper to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

323
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:20,960
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

324
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

325
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

326
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:22,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

327
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:23,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Director.

328
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

329
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:26,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

330
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:29,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I would motion to suspend the rules to take 24-355 and then 24-100.

331
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:40,860
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to suspend the rules to take papers 24355 and 24100, seconded by?

332
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

333
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:43,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

334
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:43,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

335
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:44,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

336
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:45,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

337
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:48,326
[SPEAKER_04]: 24355, review open meeting law complaint.

338
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:52,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Open meeting law complaint from Deanne Andrasano, dated April 24th, 2024.

339
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Acknowledge and review complaint.

340
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Discuss council's response to complaint.

341
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote to take any remedial action if necessary and appropriate.

342
00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Votes may be taken.

343
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:15,353
[SPEAKER_04]: We have here an open meeting law complaint summarizing, essentially, that there was a social media post summarizing a previous meeting, and there's a suggestion that that is a violation of the open meeting law.

344
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:21,277
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a response from the city's legal counsel here.

345
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:26,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Please be advised that this office represents the city of Medford carry this KP law to

346
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:34,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Carrie Benidon, Esquire Director, Division of Open Government, Office of the Attorney General, 1 Ashburton Place, Boston, MA, 02108.

347
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,155
[SPEAKER_04]: City of Medford City Council have a meeting law complaint from Deanna Dersano, dated April 24th, 2024.

348
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:42,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Please be advised that this office represents the City of Medford, Massachusetts.

349
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:46,702
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford City Council, the Council is in receipt of an open meeting law complaint filed by D.N.

350
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:51,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Andresano dated April 24th, 2024, a copy of which is attached here too as exhibit one.

351
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:57,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Following receipt of the complaint, the Council requested a brief extension of the deadline to respond, which was granted by the Division of Open Government.

352
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:04,019
[SPEAKER_04]: On May 14th, the Council met at a properly posted meeting notice for such purposes to discuss the complaint and consider its response.

353
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:15,742
[SPEAKER_04]: The Council has carefully reviewed the allegations contained in the complaint and following such discussion has authorized this office to submit the following response on its behalf in accordance with General Law Chapter 30A Section 23 and 940 CMR 29.055.

354
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:20,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, that's what we would be doing tonight.

355
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:22,044
[SPEAKER_04]: We're reviewing this response and this would be

356
00:44:22,644 --> 00:44:26,147
[SPEAKER_04]: would submit to the Division of Open Government.

357
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:38,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, the process requires that any open meeting law complaint received by the Division of Open Government is received by the City, that the City Council or the body that the complaint is against considers that, and then replies.

358
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:47,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will just read here the main headlines of the response drafted by Council.

359
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:51,984
[SPEAKER_04]: One, posting a summary of the Council's April 2nd meeting to Reddit did not violate the open meeting law.

360
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:52,312
you

361
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,633
[SPEAKER_04]: because the communication was not directed to a quorum of the public body.

362
00:44:56,373 --> 00:45:00,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, including contextual information in a social media post did not violate the open meeting law.

363
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:07,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Conclusion, the City Council respectfully submits that there has been no actionable violation of the open meeting law and considers this matter resolved.

364
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,341
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any questions, please contact me.

365
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your attention to this matter.

366
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Very truly yours, Janelle Austin.

367
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do have Attorney Austin on the line.

368
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to recognize Attorney Austin.

369
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:21,088
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's anything else you'd like to add, and then we'll hear from members of the Council.

370
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:22,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Attorney Austin.

371
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:35,028
[SPEAKER_05]: You're recognized.

372
00:45:37,093 --> 00:45:39,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you just muted yourself.

373
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:39,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

374
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:39,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try again.

375
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:42,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, members of the Council.

376
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:47,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time this evening to review this open meeting law complaint.

377
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with Council President Bears.

378
00:45:50,921 --> 00:46:02,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the process with respect to an open meeting law complaint is that a copy of that complaint be distributed to the members of the Council, which has transpired for compliance with the open meeting law.

379
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:09,256
[SPEAKER_00]: By way of background, there was an open meeting law that was recently filed

380
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:21,145
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to obtain an extension of time to allow the council adequate time to review the allegations in the open meeting law complaint and really have time to meet this evening to discuss and deliberate on the response.

381
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,247
[SPEAKER_00]: The complaint itself was dated April 24, 2024.

382
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:26,769
[SPEAKER_00]: We did obtain an extension of time to respond until

383
00:46:30,672 --> 00:46:34,575
[SPEAKER_00]: May 24th, to allow the Council to review this evening.

384
00:46:35,176 --> 00:46:41,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the allegations of the complaint, I'm certainly available this evening to answer any specific questions.

385
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:49,407
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of reviewing the draft, there has been a draft response that has been provided to members of the Council.

386
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to review any of the specifics in there.

387
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:59,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, in my opinion, to comply with the Open Meeting Law, the Council can review that draft, review the allegations of the complaint this evening,

388
00:47:00,436 --> 00:47:04,581
[SPEAKER_00]: and discuss whether it feels like any remedial action is required.

389
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:18,799
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, in terms of open meeting law compliance, I have reviewed the allegations of the complaint and feel comfortable with the response that has been provided to the council, specifically as Council President Bears had read into the record.

390
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:29,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the Open Meeting Law prohibits, as all of you know, deliberation amongst a quorum of the Council, either outside of a properly posted meeting.

391
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:34,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're here deliberating this evening on a variety of matters within the Council's jurisdiction.

392
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:45,746
[SPEAKER_00]: To the extent that occurred outside of a properly posted meeting, including via email, social media, or text, then the Open Meeting Law provisions would be implicated.

393
00:47:46,626 --> 00:48:01,031
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, it's my understanding that there was a Reddit post for informational purposes only, and there wasn't a quorum of the City Council commenting or deliberating on that social media post outside of a properly posted meeting.

394
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:14,436
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the information that our office has been provided, and consistent with that information and the factual circumstances that are at issue in the complaint, a draft response was provided to the Council for its consideration this evening.

395
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,797
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to answer any other specific questions.

396
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:28,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, this evening we would be looking for a vote to acknowledge the complaint as well as to, you know, to approve a response.

397
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:36,103
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been a draft response provided and potentially designate, whether it be Vice President Collins or Council President Bears,

398
00:48:36,803 --> 00:48:48,970
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of the council to finalize the response, we would issue a copy to the complainant, as well as a copy to the Attorney General's Division of Open Government, consistent to comply with the Open Meeting Law.

399
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

400
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to answer any other questions anyone may have.

401
00:48:52,952 --> 00:48:54,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Officer.

402
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:56,493
[SPEAKER_04]: We go to Vice President Collins and Council Chair Pelley.

403
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:57,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

404
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, President Bears.

405
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:05,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you also, Attorney Austin, for being with us tonight and also for your work on this matter.

406
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:14,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I have reviewed this complaint with Attorney Austin prior to this meeting, being the party that was named specifically in the complaint.

407
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:21,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that she and her colleagues have reviewed this and reviewed my Reddit post in question very thoroughly.

408
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:26,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pleased to read their very thoroughly researched response and their

409
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,613
[SPEAKER_02]: They're finding that that does not constitute an OML violation.

410
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:36,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself have, you know, looked over the draft response.

411
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:37,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given it some time.

412
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm comfortable submitting this.

413
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the response is thorough.

414
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:41,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It's adequate.

415
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:48,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It backs up all the relevant points, which are that the Reddit post in question contained no open meeting law violation.

416
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I will indulge myself to say that as an elected, as the named party in the complaint,

417
00:49:54,915 --> 00:50:18,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I am fully aware and respectful of the fact that the things that I say might not always be popular, but I know that always doesn't necessarily equate with a rule or regulation being broken, and I appreciate having legal clarity around the difference between those two things and the attorney's attention to detail in helping us articulate what the Reddit posts, what my Reddit posts did and did not include.

418
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: forward a motion to acknowledge the complaint and approve this draft response after my fellow Councilors have had time to review and ask any questions that they might have.

419
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:44,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have more I could say on the topic, but I think that the top lines are, you know, for myself as an elected, when I first gained office, I immediately researched the open meeting law to make sure that I understood it, understood the parameters, the point of open meeting law.

420
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:53,741
[SPEAKER_02]: is to ensure that all issues of public import that are before a public body only ever take place among a quorum of that body in public session.

421
00:50:53,761 --> 00:51:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so that the community can be there whenever a quorum of that body is debating things that are important to the community, things that are public matters.

422
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:03,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that really seriously.

423
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:04,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a really important rule.

424
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:09,527
[SPEAKER_02]: We have open meetings for a reason, and those conversations should happen in open meetings.

425
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:12,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I do these Reddit posts to be informative.

426
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:22,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Community members have asked me to do them because I think it is understandably really hard to keep up with the nuts and bolts of what's going on in City Council and elsewhere in City Hall.

427
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:29,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the intent of these Reddit posts, continues to be to just be informative, to share these on a popular online platform that people use.

428
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:34,263
[SPEAKER_02]: not to be a forum for debate amongst members of the body.

429
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, of course, I appreciate, you know, the opportunity for a legal mind to take a look and say, I confirm there is no deliberation.

430
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:44,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never my intent.

431
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:49,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has never been the case in the post that I have been sharing on Reddit.

432
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:54,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Attorney Austin and my fellow Councilors for their time in considering this.

433
00:51:55,387 --> 00:51:56,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

434
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:57,109
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.

435
00:51:57,129 --> 00:52:08,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is the process that... No, you... Sorry, this is the... So I think that the process we're seeing is on point.

436
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:09,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that...

437
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:14,280
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I personally didn't see any violations myself.

438
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:24,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that this is just an example for our newer Councilors that voted against legal response for my question from last couple of weeks.

439
00:52:25,384 --> 00:52:30,306
[SPEAKER_06]: What that triggers now is the public asking for

440
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:48,595
[SPEAKER_06]: their opinion okay so what happens is so I did reach out to legal opinion just just point of information that it's because we have absence of a city solicitor I it shouldn't be a motion it's just a request the administration so it doesn't need it doesn't need um

441
00:52:49,555 --> 00:52:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: a passing of the council if a sitting member of this council asks for a legal opinion.

442
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:02,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be brought up again and I'll just ask the questions that I had at our previous meeting with any legal questions.

443
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:03,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the process that works.

444
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:08,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, what we're seeing is the lack of a city solicitor really hinders a lot of issues.

445
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:09,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, again,

446
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:24,244
[SPEAKER_06]: This situation will be handled by a city solicitor, and we probably wouldn't have to pay more money to a outside law firm to rule on this, which is pretty self-explanatory.

447
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:27,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad it worked out.

448
00:53:27,646 --> 00:53:34,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, just a point of information that's gonna be down the line.

449
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's important that we know as a council, if you have a question legally,

450
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:42,278
[SPEAKER_06]: you could just refer it to the city administration to get legal opinion.

451
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:43,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

452
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:48,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and any councillors welcome to send legal questions to me and I can forward them to the administration.

453
00:53:50,825 --> 00:54:07,098
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to acknowledge receipt of the open meeting law complaint to accept this draft response as drafted, and I'm happy to be the final work with the Attorney Austin if that's part of the motion as well.

454
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan after, we have a second on that motion from Councilor Stanton.

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, got it.

457

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, on that motion, essentially to say that there was no open meeting law violation, no remedial action is necessary, and we will submit this to the Division of Open Government.

458

[SPEAKER_06]: This wasn't clear.

530
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:55,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that is there a lot there?

531
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there?

532
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that there's a lot.

00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:03,213
[SPEAKER_06]: at that location where you can just you can, you can show the cars, is it?

00:59:05,215 --> 00:59:06,997
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to sell a couple cars.

535
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:12,924
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to get a big cars just to keep the business busy with the other body.

536
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:15,787
[SPEAKER_18]: And a couple cars.

537
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we have a space in the building.

538
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:21,616
[SPEAKER_06]: where are you gonna store these?

539
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:32,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to help me understand that your auto body shop doesn't have any exterior parking for display of used cars.

540
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we do.

541
00:59:35,523 --> 00:59:35,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Where?

542
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,105
[SPEAKER_18]: The 26th Street.

543
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:41,086
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have two buildings.

544
00:59:41,146 --> 00:59:45,368
[SPEAKER_18]: We have 81th Street and then we have 26th Street.

545
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:51,071
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not clear, Mr. President.

546
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:56,575
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, you know, I think your petition's a little misleading.

547
00:59:56,615 --> 01:00:03,561
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's a little, when I looked, I looked at the address of 26 R Mystic.

548
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:04,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

549
01:00:04,321 --> 01:00:05,762
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an auto body shop.

550
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:06,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

551
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but it's a side street.

552
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:11,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it's behind the street.

553
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:18,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so I don't, there isn't, what I'm saying is, you're saying now there's another address that you bring your used cars?

554
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,409
[SPEAKER_18]: No, the same others.

555
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:27,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

556
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:41,874
[SPEAKER_06]: As I did my research and what I saw is that I didn't see that, so I would have to see what I could do here.

557
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:47,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at Google Maps and I drew by, so I'm trying to figure out where.

558
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Google Maps open right now.

559
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I could share.

560
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was trying to pull it up.

561
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:56,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a second.

562
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:59,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's so.

563
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pull it up on the screen.

564
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:05,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, if you can, because I don't see parking there.

565
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:07,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a lot.

566
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:13,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And the biggest issue we have in those areas are parking.

567
01:01:13,772 --> 01:01:16,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And whenever, you know,

568
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:22,823
[SPEAKER_06]: just to the fact that overflow from auto body shops park their cars temporarily on the street.

569
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand that.

570
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:33,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to affect that business, but if you're putting in placing used car there and just sitting there, you know, and on the street, I can't, I couldn't support that.

571
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:34,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

572
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:35,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you point out, this is the map.

573
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:37,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see the map on the screen up here?

574
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:40,593
[SPEAKER_04]: This is 26R.

575
01:01:40,753 --> 01:01:42,234
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your frontage here.

576
01:01:42,254 --> 01:01:43,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Where would the cars be parked?

577
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,101
[SPEAKER_18]: The parks will be parked in the building, inside the building.

578
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:49,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside this building?

579
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:49,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

580
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:50,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

581
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:52,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you do in the building?

582
01:01:53,863 --> 01:01:55,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an auto body building inside.

583
01:01:56,404 --> 01:02:01,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but we have a big location and I don't use the whole building to auto body.

584
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,821
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'm asking to try to sell a couple cars.

585
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:08,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would have room inside the building for how many vehicles?

586
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:09,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Like four.

587
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:14,245
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a space for like 40 vehicles in the whole thing.

588
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:18,147
[SPEAKER_18]: But I need a space for, so I got like three, four cars.

589
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:29,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if I can, I think instead of wasting time, what I do is I'd like to maybe send the code enforcement officer and ask them to go visit that, because I don't see it.

590
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:34,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you're doing business for auto body, you need the indoor space for auto body.

591
01:02:37,448 --> 01:02:42,911
[SPEAKER_06]: That means if you're gonna take spots inside, where are you gonna move the cars that you're working on?

592
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:44,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Outside, right?

593
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:45,692
[SPEAKER_18]: No, inside.

594
01:02:47,404 --> 01:02:48,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have Director Hunt here.

595
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:50,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to recognize Director Hunt.

596
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:55,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning Development Sustainability.

597
01:02:56,226 --> 01:02:56,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

598
01:02:57,446 --> 01:02:58,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council President.

599
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:06,368
[SPEAKER_12]: I just also, I would personally recommend that you would want to table this as Councilor Scarpelli is mentioning.

600
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:13,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, because I do not believe that this use is allowed as of right by the, I didn't have a chance to pull up the zoning this evening.

601
01:03:14,938 --> 01:03:28,338
[SPEAKER_12]: see this on the agenda I apologize in advance, but for the zoning changes that were made last fall, all the auto body uses are by special permit, and so it would need to go through a special permit process.

602
01:03:29,207 --> 01:03:31,309
[SPEAKER_12]: in order to be considered at this location.

603
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:38,974
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just saying that off the cuff, and I would actually want to check the zoning and check the rules in order to be certain of that.

604
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:44,959
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd hate to see you approve something inappropriately without us doing the proper due diligence on it.

605
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just don't want to deny it, if we don't know enough.

606
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:56,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can table it till May 28 meeting or enough time for everybody to do their due diligence.

607
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:06,881
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk has said to me that I believe he concurs with Alicia Hunt that it's a special permit.

608
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:07,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

609
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:12,285
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly going to need more research on this and may need a special permit.

610
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:18,128
[SPEAKER_10]: If Director Hunt is saying it needs a special permit, then I'm going to defer to her, but we're going to do some research on our end.

611
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:19,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I table this.

612
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:19,849
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

613
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:20,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

614
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:26,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to make a similar motion to table or convene in planning and permitting to determine.

615
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,280
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk has also suggested a June 11th.

616
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:33,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if it's a special permit, it's going to need to be advertising butters and it's going to need to be notified.

617
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:36,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe after we start doing the process.

618
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:37,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

619
01:04:38,862 --> 01:04:46,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Hahn, just for clarification, what board would grant the special permit?

620
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:48,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be this one or the Community Development Board?

621
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:51,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Or where would they get that?

622
01:04:52,737 --> 01:05:00,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that's what I need a few minutes to look up because some of the, um, auto bottle uses were set to be.

623
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:08,186
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a used it's a special permit for use and some were set to be city council.

624
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:17,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Some are city board and some are board of appeals and I need to actually check the tables to see which 1 I feel confident though that.

625
01:05:18,737 --> 01:05:24,904
[SPEAKER_12]: clerk her to bees and my staff can connect on this and figure out what the process should be.

626
01:05:25,445 --> 01:05:29,229
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have high confidence that we're going to need to advertise a public hearing.

627
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:30,510
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why you need more time.

628
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:34,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if it's a public hearing, it requires two weeks notice in the paper.

629
01:05:35,076 --> 01:05:37,038
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why you can't table it for too soon.

630
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Council President, I also have an additional question.

631
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:46,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to clarify on a point that was brought up by Councilor Scarpelli.

632
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:54,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So he stated that if there's room that's taken up to display cars, the four cars that you intend to sell, there will be less

633
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:59,562
[SPEAKER_09]: space that would be used to repair the cars or to work on them.

634
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:02,524
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your thoughts on this?

635
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:10,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you just not using that space within your shop right now to fix cars or what's the space currently being used for?

636
01:06:12,364 --> 01:06:17,927
[SPEAKER_18]: That's separate, and behind the building, it's in the same building, but it's empty.

637
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,468
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't use it for a body show right now.

638
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:25,911
[SPEAKER_18]: The space we use for a body show, we don't touch it.

639
01:06:26,753 --> 01:06:31,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so you don't use the space that you're proposing to use to display cars for anything, correct?

640
01:06:31,596 --> 01:06:33,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's empty right now.

641
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:35,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just to clarify that part.

642
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, if I could, it sounds like we're going to need some more time on our end.

643
01:06:40,862 --> 01:06:41,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to probably need

644
01:06:42,663 --> 01:06:52,351
[SPEAKER_04]: some coordination again to speak with the city clerk's office and the planning office to make sure that we go through the right process and get you the right permit that you need.

645
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:58,456
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that could probably help us with that too, if you could bring maybe some pictures of the space or send some pictures of the space

646
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:26,466
[SPEAKER_04]: to the planning department and the clerk and that could be included in the packet that we could see where you plan to put the vehicles that you're not using it now where you know just a little bit of a picture so we can understand because yeah you know you're there a lot you know how flood you know the roads are covered with cars yeah yeah thank you appreciate that so um you know i think there's a motion right now to table uh to june 11th um sorry for the delay on that um but yeah if you could take some photos and if you could communicate with our city clerk

647
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:35,153
[SPEAKER_04]: and our planning department, and Councilor Scarpelli maybe, I don't know if you could, whichever one of you has a business card, if you could share that.

648
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,635
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been working with Annie in her office.

649
01:07:36,655 --> 01:07:45,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and the clerk's office, you've been working with Annie Kelly, Ann Marie Kelly, I think their number's 781-393-2425 as well.

650
01:07:46,803 --> 01:07:51,087
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a motion on the floor to table till June 11th by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by

651
01:07:52,128 --> 01:07:53,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

652
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:58,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll try to get all this worked out behind the scenes and hopefully have you back June 11th.

653
01:07:58,272 --> 01:07:58,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

687
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:46,914

01:10:48,976 --> 01:10:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Laurel, for being on the call tonight.

690
01:10:51,698 --> 01:11:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Last Wednesday in Committee of the Whole, we had a more detailed presentation about all of the proposals for how to allocate our block grant funding for the year.

691
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:04,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great to see that that number has increased a little bit.

692
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:06,550
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the final figures have been released.

693
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:19,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for myself as one councilor, I really appreciated the detail into what that grant funding is doing in our community this year and hearing about some of the previous grantees just building on and continuing the work that they do in our community.

694
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of that work is directed at serving the neediest and most marginalized members of our community.

695
01:11:26,137 --> 01:11:29,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always great to hear about how those funds are getting spent.

696
01:11:29,138 --> 01:11:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know we have to open the hearing, but I would motion to approve.

697
01:11:34,268 --> 01:11:43,333
[SPEAKER_04]: motion of vice president cons to approve the motion to authorize the action plan seconded by Councilor Sir Kelly.

698
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:46,055
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I need to open the public hearing.

699
01:11:46,075 --> 01:11:53,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to open the public hearing to anyone in favor, opposed or otherwise to this position, please raise your hand on zoom or come to the podium in person.

700
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:56,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know what you think of this action plan.

701
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So public hearing is open.

702
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:01,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Laurel, I'm guessing that the city is in favor.

703
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:03,981
[SPEAKER_15]: That is correct, thank you.

704
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:05,182
Great.

705
01:12:06,282 --> 01:12:12,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else who'd like to comment on this public hearing on program year 50 of the community development block grant annual action plan?

706

01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:04,652
[SPEAKER_04]: 24068, Picky's Pizza, 165 Main Street, special permit for hours, continued.

725
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Legal notice, their own Medford City Clerk's Office notice of a public hearing, Medford City Council.

727
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: on a petition from CS Properties, LLC, DBA Pinky's Famous Pizza, 165 Main Street, Medford, MA 02155 for a special permit to amend its hours of operation in accordance with the Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94-7.2.1, to operate extended hours of its business, 165 Main Street, Medford, MA 02155, said site being located in Apartment 1, District as follows.

[SPEAKER_04]: Extended hours of operation requested, Monday to Thursday, 11 p.m.

729
01:13:45,194 --> 01:13:47,334
[SPEAKER_04]: to 1 a.m., Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 11 p.m.

730
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:47,635

01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:55,105
[SPEAKER_04]: and plan may be seen in the office of the City Clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford MA, call 781-393-2425 for any aids and accommodations.

732
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,308
[SPEAKER_04]: The City of Medford is an EEOA 504 employer.

733
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:00,033
[SPEAKER_04]: By order of the City Council, Adam Milner to the City Clerk.

734
01:14:01,744 --> 01:14:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have this continued from our April 30th meeting.

735
01:14:05,327 --> 01:14:10,650
[SPEAKER_04]: We had several communications from residents who were concerned about changes to the hours.

736
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:16,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the petitioner was able to speak with the chair of licensing, permitting and science subcommittee, Councilor Scarpelli.

737
01:14:17,175 --> 01:14:19,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do believe they are present here on the call.

738
01:14:19,837 --> 01:14:20,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I see them here.

739
01:14:21,438 --> 01:14:26,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli, and then I'll turn it over to the petitioner to see if there's an amendment to the request.

740
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:27,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

741
01:14:27,942 --> 01:14:29,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

742
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:35,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have one of the other pieces that we wanted to have a meeting with the code enforcement officer.

743
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:49,654
[SPEAKER_06]: He reported back to us that there has been no issues or concerns in that neighborhood surrounding Pinky's for any of their business issues that have been fine.

744
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one of the concerns.

745
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:55,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I did talk to the owner and

746
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:02,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I made some recommendations after talking with the neighbors, and again, this is their decision.

747
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:09,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So I leave it to the owner to give us an idea of what they might be looking at, and then we can move from there, Mr. President.

748
01:15:10,193 --> 01:15:10,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

749
01:15:10,493 --> 01:15:11,674
[SPEAKER_04]: The council recognized Ms.

750
01:15:11,714 --> 01:15:18,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Carr from Pinky's Famous Pizza to share if there's been any changes to your request to the council.

751
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:42,274
[SPEAKER_14]: hello so um um first of all i'm sorry i couldn't be there personally i actually have a scheduled delivery for baby tomorrow so my doctor was just stay home today so i was like i'll just attend via zoom i hope you guys can see me and hear me yes we can see you and thank you for being here we totally understand

752
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:43,370
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

753
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:53,018
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, I did talk to the Councilor and I understand I don't want to step on anyone's toes in the neighbor, you know, neighbors.

754
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:55,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand, you know, it could be loud and stuff.

755
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:58,943
[SPEAKER_14]: We were thinking that the drivers don't really stay there for too long.

756
01:16:00,144 --> 01:16:03,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Even Uber and, you know, DoorDash, they have a time limit

757
01:16:03,587 --> 01:16:06,428
[SPEAKER_14]: like five to 10 minutes, they need to quickly grab the orders and leave.

758
01:16:06,588 --> 01:16:14,972
[SPEAKER_14]: But I understand there are other complaints from other businesses that Uber eats, drivers don't really listen because we don't really have control over them.

759
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:25,877
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was suggested maybe we could do right now, Monday to Thursday till 11, which is right now, that's what it is.

760
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:30,019
[SPEAKER_14]: For weekends, maybe we could just do 12 a.m.

761
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:31,160
[SPEAKER_14]: instead of one or two.

762
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:42,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe in future, if we could have our own drivers instead of doing business with the companies, which we would like anyways, because they take a lot of percentage from us anyways.

763
01:16:43,538 --> 01:16:53,227
[SPEAKER_14]: So for now, if we can get approval till 12am for weekends, like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Friday, Saturday, at least, that would be also big help.

764
01:16:55,037 --> 01:17:05,206
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so the petitioner has amended the proposal to just have this be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, extended from 11 to 12 a.m.

765
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's reflect that in the record.

766
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, you got it?

767
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any discussion by members of the council before I open it up?

768
01:17:13,992 --> 01:17:16,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know that we've been talking with the neighbors.

769
01:17:16,253 --> 01:17:17,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they're on right now.

770
01:17:17,693 --> 01:17:23,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll ask if there's any, well, if I just could go to the council, then I'll open the public hearing.

771
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:26,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions by members of the council?

772
01:17:27,078 --> 01:17:29,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins, and then Council Member.

773
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:29,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

774
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:30,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't have a question.

775
01:17:30,799 --> 01:17:32,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say I appreciate the flexibility on this.

776
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is a

777
01:17:35,114 --> 01:17:45,601
[SPEAKER_02]: very reasonable proposal, and I appreciate that the petitioner was willing to have conversations with Councilor Scarpelli, Throat Enforcement, and the neighbors to come back with something that I hope will indeed help your business.

778
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:52,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, maybe some of those neighbor concerns just because of the behavior of delivery drivers as we're in the city.

779
01:17:52,986 --> 01:17:53,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

780
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:54,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

781
01:17:55,404 --> 01:18:02,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would also just like to say, I go to Pinky's a good amount here and there.

782
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:12,295
[SPEAKER_09]: What I do like about it is the fact that they do have a temporary parking spot just off Summer Street that's right in front of the store.

783
01:18:12,415 --> 01:18:23,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So just the idea that drivers would just come there really quickly, get pizza, and then go back with very little fuss makes a lot of sense to me visually.

784
01:18:23,223 --> 01:18:25,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So I could see that, but obviously,

785
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:34,227
[SPEAKER_09]: hear from the neighbors and the houses directly surrounding there, but you know, y'all make very good pizza.

786
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:34,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

787
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:40,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

788
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:45,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, really thank you for not just your flexibility, but your creativity.

789
01:18:46,212 --> 01:18:51,294
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm excited for you to explore having your own drivers where I think you can keep

790
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:57,602
[SPEAKER_20]: more of the proceeds here in the city of Medford amongst you and your employees as well.

791
01:18:57,682 --> 01:19:01,684
[SPEAKER_20]: So I love the creativity of that idea and thank you so much for that as well.

792
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:04,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

793
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:14,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I would know that the neighbors we talked about either two or three days appreciate the petitioner working with us.

794
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:16,350
[SPEAKER_06]: What we did decide is that

795
01:19:17,315 --> 01:19:19,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a 30-day, 60-day review.

796
01:19:19,976 --> 01:19:35,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what the neighbors did ask, because Tufts might be their number one, that we just ask the code enforcement office, when school's back in session, to maybe take a closer look at that area and making sure that the process is fine.

797
01:19:35,862 --> 01:19:37,063
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd like to hear from the neighbors.

798
01:19:37,123 --> 01:19:39,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a good compromise.

799
01:19:40,684 --> 01:19:43,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I yell to the neighbors.

800
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:44,651
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll open up the public hearing.

801
01:19:45,091 --> 01:19:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Last thing I'll say is my first job in Medford was a pizza delivery driver, and I'm pretty sure I was making more than what they're paying out of DoorDash and GrubHub, and that was... Definitely.

802
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:00,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate the idea of bringing this back here as good local jobs.

803
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:07,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm going to open, well, the public hearing has been open and we continued it from the last meeting.

804
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:15,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone, the now amended proposal is to have extended hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday until midnight.

805
01:20:16,786 --> 01:20:22,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition or otherwise to this proposal?

806
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:28,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe, Ms.

807
01:20:28,683 --> 01:20:30,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Carter, you are in favor, correct?

808
01:20:31,144 --> 01:20:31,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

809
01:20:32,405 --> 01:20:32,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

810
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:38,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else who'd like to speak, raise your hand on Zoom, and I'll recognize you.

811
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Mary.

812
01:20:39,227 --> 01:20:42,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary, if you could provide your name and address for the record, please.

813
01:20:43,108 --> 01:20:44,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just requested an unmute.

814
01:20:45,849 --> 01:20:54,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, my name is Mary Hayes-Doyle, and I am the owner of 170 Main Street, and I am opposing the extended hours.

815
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:58,477
[SPEAKER_16]: think it is a compromise.

816
01:20:58,677 --> 01:21:00,699
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have a problem with Sunday night till midnight.

817
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,762
[SPEAKER_16]: But I have a prepared statement.

818
01:21:04,822 --> 01:21:06,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure everyone seems to have made up their mind.

819
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:09,485
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure if I should read through it.

820
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:13,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I will read through it.

821
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:14,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

822
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:23,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Members of the Medford City Council, I'm asking you to deny this request is located right in the middle of a densely populated block

823
01:21:24,364 --> 01:21:30,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Unlike stores a few blocks closer to Medford Square, Pinky's is located in primarily a residential area.

824
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:40,390
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm concerned about the noise after 11 o'clock that will be generated from the delivery services, which can be disruptive, especially between 11 o'clock and two o'clock.

825
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:48,553
[SPEAKER_16]: As I mentioned in my prior letter to each of you, neighbors deserve to have a residential neighborhood be quiet and peaceful during the sleeping hours.

826
01:21:49,293 --> 01:21:51,894
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to my two family that will be impacted,

827
01:21:52,332 --> 01:21:57,816
[SPEAKER_16]: There are dozens of other apartments in close proximity to Pinky's that will be directly impacted.

828
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:01,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not anti-business, I support Medford business.

829
01:22:02,499 --> 01:22:05,862
[SPEAKER_16]: The last meeting you granted extended hours to Snappy Patty's.

830
01:22:06,582 --> 01:22:09,224
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree in that situation, that was the right choice.

831
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:20,392
[SPEAKER_16]: That establishment is located in West Medford Square in a business district, not nearly as congested as the area of Main Street where Pinky's is located.

832
01:22:23,164 --> 01:22:33,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Another reason to support not extending Pinky's hours is that there are plenty of other pizza stores near Tufts that cater to students' late-night delivery.

833
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:41,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Shouldn't the council be more concerned with the impact to the residents rather than the pizza shop in this situation?

834
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:43,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Please deny the request.

835
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:48,100
[SPEAKER_16]: The neighbors do not want this late-night, early-morning operation in our neighborhood.

836
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:55,158
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that several of the neighbors sent emails to you.

837
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:59,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Please show consideration to our working and elderly neighbors.

838
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:03,324
[SPEAKER_16]: I think pinkies should keep their current hours.

839
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your consideration.

840
01:23:08,508 --> 01:23:09,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your comment.

841
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:14,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further comment on this extended hours permit?

842
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:25,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, Vice President Collins, we do have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli.

843
01:23:25,262 --> 01:23:26,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you going to comment or make a motion?

844
01:23:27,338 --> 01:23:34,140
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30 and 60 day review and also requesting the code enforcement.

845
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be code enforcement report back to us 30 days and 60 days of any complaints.

846
01:23:38,242 --> 01:23:42,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also when school is back in, maybe we wanna set a date, maybe October 1.

847
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, October 1 to get a quick, after the Tufts opens up, we say October 1 for another report.

848
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:54,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And also report back October 1st of any complaints from the neighbours on the extended hours.

849
01:23:56,328 --> 01:24:07,314
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice-President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

850
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:09,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins?

851
01:24:10,021 --> 01:24:10,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

852
01:24:10,822 --> 01:24:11,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lazzaro?

853
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:12,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

854
01:24:12,862 --> 01:24:13,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Fletcher?

855
01:24:13,562 --> 01:24:13,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

856
01:24:14,143 --> 01:24:14,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Strudelli?

857
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:15,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

858
01:24:15,743 --> 01:24:16,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Sands?

859
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:16,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

860
01:24:16,744 --> 01:24:17,284
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears?

861
01:24:17,404 --> 01:24:17,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

862
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:19,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in favor of none negative, the motion passes.

863
01:24:20,325 --> 01:24:26,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for working through this process and look forward to getting it reviewed and implemented.

864
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:34,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Next item is 24353, petition for a lodging house license, Tufts University.

865
01:24:34,697 --> 01:24:40,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Petition for a lodging house license for Tufts University located at 28 Winthrop Street, Medford, MA 02155.

866
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:47,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We have on file letter of compliance, state tax ID, workers' compensation, petition, treasurer, building department, fire department, police, traffic impact report.

867
01:24:48,157 --> 01:24:54,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And the health department we have addressing the council, Rocco DiRico, government relations director, Tufts University, 14 Capen Street, Bedford MA 02155.

868
01:24:54,459 --> 01:25:00,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, anything that you would like to say before we hear from Mr. DiRico?

869
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:08,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Mr. DiRico is just an amazing individual, and anything he says is like diamonds flowing from my heart.

870
01:25:09,591 --> 01:25:10,271
[SPEAKER_06]: from his tongue.

871
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:13,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we certainly would like some diamonds flowing.

872
01:25:13,433 --> 01:25:14,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We welcome them.

873
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:16,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have $2.5 million, we need it.

874
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:22,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a joke.

875
01:25:22,698 --> 01:25:24,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there won't be any traffic tonight.

876
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:26,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, thanks for bearing with us for a couple hours.

877
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:27,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

878
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:29,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor President.

879
01:25:30,523 --> 01:25:36,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like to downplay expectations, Councilor Scarpelli.

880
01:25:36,866 --> 01:25:37,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for

881
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:45,057
[SPEAKER_03]: being that extremely difficult, but I do appreciate you guys hearing from us today.

882
01:25:45,118 --> 01:25:52,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here representing Tufts University, Rocker Dorico, 14 Capen Street, Medford.

883
01:25:54,269 --> 01:25:59,330
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lodging house license for 28 Winthrop Street.

884
01:26:00,811 --> 01:26:04,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That property used to be called 24 Capon just so folks know.

885
01:26:06,252 --> 01:26:18,635
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford Fire Department, Engineering Department and other departments asked us to switch it to 28 Winthrop because the entrance is now on Winthrop Street and there's a 24 Capon Street extension.

886
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:20,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to note the address change.

887
01:26:21,936 --> 01:26:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this project was approved by unanimously approved by the Community Development Board.

888
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:29,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and is now complete.

889
01:26:29,759 --> 01:26:35,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's passed all the city inspections by all the relevant city departments.

890
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:40,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we are now here to apply for a lodging house license, which is kind of the last step.

891
01:26:41,523 --> 01:26:46,325
[SPEAKER_03]: This property is gonna house 28 undergraduates and one RA.

892
01:26:47,986 --> 01:26:52,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of our coho development in the Medford Hillside.

893
01:26:53,228 --> 01:27:01,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of that development, Tufts agrees to continue to pay property taxes on this property.

894
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:07,934
[SPEAKER_03]: The other stipulations that we always agree to with these properties, there's gonna be one student per bedroom.

895
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:18,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Each apartment's gonna have its own kitchen and living room, and students who live in these houses are required to park their car on campus should they bring a car to the university.

896
01:27:19,506 --> 01:27:22,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer any questions that the council may have.

897
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we open the public hearing, Vice President Collins.

898
01:27:28,336 --> 01:27:29,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here today.

899
01:27:29,898 --> 01:27:33,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you reaching out to members of the council last week to let us know this was coming.

900
01:27:35,444 --> 01:27:38,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to paraphrase a lot of what you just presented.

901
01:27:39,525 --> 01:27:53,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to see a petition come before us, and we know that the building has already been renovated from, and as people know, I was a Tufts University student back in the day, so I've seen a lot of hovels on or near campus.

902
01:27:53,133 --> 01:28:01,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to see this one rehabilitated and densified, and that it's already gone through all the necessary procedures.

903
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:04,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's, as one Councilor, that's what I like to see.

904
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:06,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate Tufts investing in

905
01:28:07,278 --> 01:28:11,066
[SPEAKER_02]: housing more tough students near or even better on campus.

906
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:14,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for this bona fide good project.

907
01:28:14,995 --> 01:28:15,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

908
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:17,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve after we open the hearing.

909
01:28:18,533 --> 01:28:19,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

910
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:20,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

911
01:28:20,415 --> 01:28:20,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

912
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:26,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I, you know, being this age, I have a lot of friends who go to Tufts or who've recently gone to Tufts.

913
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:28,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I also live just one block away.

914
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:37,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, in a lot of conversations with Tufts students, one big thing that they really want is just more housing on campus, more on campus options.

915
01:28:38,453 --> 01:28:39,614
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a path towards that.

916
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:41,396
[SPEAKER_11]: This is that, actually.

917
01:28:42,597 --> 01:28:47,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Furthermore, it helps our housing crisis when more students are housed on campus.

918
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:54,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a win-win for everyone, really, for community members and for Tufts students and for Tufts University.

919
01:28:55,971 --> 01:28:58,292
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's really important to consider.

920
01:28:58,392 --> 01:29:00,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Generally, these are really good projects.

921
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:12,078
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also part of the platform which I signed, the Med for People's platform, which talks about working with Tufts to get more on-campus housing.

922
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:16,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would happily second Vice President Collins' motion.

923
01:29:17,261 --> 01:29:17,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're too late.

924
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:21,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli already did it.

925
01:29:21,303 --> 01:29:23,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

926
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a question, Rocco.

927
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any community meeting tomorrow night, 630, 6 o'clock on zoom.

928
01:29:33,962 --> 01:29:34,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

929
01:29:34,162 --> 01:29:39,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sign up on our Facebook page or any of our social media channels.

930
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:39,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

931
01:29:39,926 --> 01:29:42,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw that.

932
01:29:42,867 --> 01:29:44,207
[SPEAKER_04]: At least five of us can't be there.

933
01:29:44,227 --> 01:29:45,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a zoning meeting at the same time.

934
01:29:46,968 --> 01:29:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the other two folks who aren't on that committee can.

935
01:29:50,548 --> 01:29:51,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did want to put that out there.

936
01:29:52,109 --> 01:29:53,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a lot of news about the housing.

937
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:59,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw something in Tufts Now about some new housing changes that are happening, trying to bring some more stuff on campus.

938
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:02,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the dormitory on Boston Ave still happening?

939
01:30:03,669 --> 01:30:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we are still moving forward with that.

940
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:14,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say, too, that this is part of a larger housing plan in addition to doing 28 Winthrop Street.

941
01:30:14,555 --> 01:30:18,477
[SPEAKER_03]: We also added a new dormitory on 29 Sawyer Avenue in Somerville.

942
01:30:19,117 --> 01:30:30,684
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also renovating Blakely Hall, which when Councilor Collins was there, was the graduate dorm, but the neighborhood has kind of, the cities have indicated that they prefer having the undergraduates on campus.

943
01:30:31,204 --> 01:30:33,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're converting that to an undergraduate dorm.

944
01:30:33,646 --> 01:30:37,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be another 120 beds on campus for undergraduates.

945
01:30:38,429 --> 01:30:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And the door, we're still committed to building a new dorm.

946
01:30:41,411 --> 01:30:44,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still committed to building it on Boston Avenue.

947
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:50,777
[SPEAKER_03]: The original design for the building, the costs have skyrocketed since we originally proposed it.

948
01:30:51,297 --> 01:30:56,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're now just working through a variety of different options to figure out how to fund the project.

949
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're still committed to building

950
01:30:59,322 --> 01:31:01,143
[SPEAKER_03]: a large scale dorm on Boston Avenue.

951
01:31:01,604 --> 01:31:02,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

952
01:31:02,484 --> 01:31:08,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many units would be added on campus by, I don't know, whatever your timeline is.

953
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:09,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to impose a date.

954
01:31:09,168 --> 01:31:11,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you have a date with a number attached to it?

955
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:12,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yeah.

956
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:17,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to give specific dates because everything has to go through permitting and construction timelines.

957
01:31:17,233 --> 01:31:22,457
[SPEAKER_03]: What I will say is, you know, we're bringing on 75 new beds this year.

958
01:31:24,057 --> 01:31:28,078
[SPEAKER_03]: will be 120 new beds next year.

959
01:31:28,758 --> 01:31:33,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, our original projections for the residence hall was 400 beds.

960
01:31:33,999 --> 01:31:36,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would obviously be the biggest chunk.

961
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:43,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're hoping that this, the new version of that dorm will be at least 400 beds.

962
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:44,521
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

963
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:45,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

964
01:31:46,282 --> 01:31:47,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro.

965
01:31:47,922 --> 01:31:52,243
[SPEAKER_13]: How much will it cost for students to live on this building that we're approving today?

966
01:31:52,782 --> 01:31:53,662
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.

967
01:31:53,722 --> 01:32:09,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that our housing rates start around 10,000 a year, I believe, for freshmen and sophomores, but as you get up, and because in these units you get your own bedroom, they cost more than the freshmen and sophomore dorms.

968
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:14,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanna say it's around 12 to 14, but I can get the council exact figures on that.

969
01:32:15,609 --> 01:32:16,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just for the time that,

970
01:32:18,663 --> 01:32:20,264
[SPEAKER_13]: classes or concessions for the academic year.

971
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

972
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:29,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, unlike living off, if you live off campus, you know, you have to do a 12 month lease on campuses, a nine month lease.

973
01:32:30,969 --> 01:32:31,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

974
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:33,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

975
01:32:34,531 --> 01:32:36,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions, members of the council?

976
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was, this is a petition on a public hearing, so I'm not opening a public hearing.

977
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:41,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have one more question.

978
01:32:42,735 --> 01:32:47,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Any chance Tufts would support the institutional master plan home rule petition?

979
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:50,416
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not.

980
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:58,461
[SPEAKER_03]: We are protected by the Dover Amendment, as you know, in Medford and Somerville.

981
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:15,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do do things like community meetings to share our plans with the community, but we're opposed to a master plan just because of the restrictions it puts on our campus and what we've experienced in Boston where we are required to do an institutional master plan.

982
01:33:16,574 --> 01:33:21,676
[SPEAKER_03]: we really just are constantly filing amendments to that and changing it and things like that.

983
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:31,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the projects that we propose go through the same process that other projects go through, which is we go through the Community Development Board in the city of Medford to get approval for them.

984
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:32,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

985
01:33:32,761 --> 01:33:34,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope someday you'll reconsider.

986
01:33:35,222 --> 01:33:36,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the honest answer.

987
01:33:37,883 --> 01:33:44,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion on the motion of Council Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

988
01:33:44,807 --> 01:33:45,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

989
01:33:47,637 --> 01:33:47,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

990
01:33:47,777 --> 01:33:47,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

991
01:33:47,877 --> 01:33:48,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

992
01:33:48,358 --> 01:33:48,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

993
01:33:49,438 --> 01:33:49,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

994
01:33:49,538 --> 01:33:49,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

995
01:33:49,638 --> 01:33:49,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

996
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:51,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

997
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:51,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, is there.

998
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:55,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you already voted because

999
01:34:15,899 --> 01:34:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 9.15.

1000
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1001
01:34:20,581 --> 01:34:22,462
[SPEAKER_04]: 24.074, resolution review annual surveillance report.

1002
01:34:22,882 --> 01:34:25,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Bedford City Council review the annual surveillance report.

1003
01:34:29,186 --> 01:34:29,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

1004
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:32,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1005
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:53,849
[SPEAKER_02]: This was tabled from our last regular meeting because the report in the packet missed the crucial first two pages, which differentiated this report from a separate report, which was the annual surveillance report submitted by city agencies that use surveillance technology.

1006
01:34:54,844 --> 01:35:04,171
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, this is the City Council's reporting requirement under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which passed in.

1007
01:35:05,851 --> 01:35:35,043
[SPEAKER_02]: the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is

1008
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:41,047
[SPEAKER_02]: We passed this somewhat proactively and that there isn't a lot of surveillance technology currently being used by the city.

1009
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the time of the passage of the C cops ordinance, there's only one surveillance technology being used by the city.

1010
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:48,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by the police department.

1011
01:35:48,651 --> 01:35:49,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's body worn cameras.

1012
01:35:50,312 --> 01:35:52,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Um in hashing out the details of the ordinance in, um,

1013
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:10,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We exempted body-worn cameras from some of the reporting requirements and oversight requirements and approval requirements to which all new surveillance technologies will be subject.

1014
01:36:12,948 --> 01:36:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Other main things to know about the ordinance under it, if a new surveillance technology comes before the council, or if a new technology is proposed to be used, it will come before the council.

1015
01:36:21,687 --> 01:36:37,012
[SPEAKER_02]: the council will discuss it, hold public meetings, ask questions about how much it will cost, what are the pros, what are the cons, what is the use for which this is being proposed, and then make a determination, do we approve this use, or do we deny it, or do we ask for changes to the proposed policy in order to approve it?

1016
01:36:38,253 --> 01:36:46,836
[SPEAKER_02]: This annual public report is something that the city council owes to the community to say, in the preceding calendar year,

1017
01:36:47,316 --> 01:36:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the requests for new surveillance technology that were approved.

1018
01:36:50,959 --> 01:36:53,741
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the new requests for surveillance technology that were denied.

1019
01:36:54,221 --> 01:36:56,343
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all the requests that we made changes to.

1020
01:36:57,043 --> 01:37:02,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are all of the annual surveillance reports that we received from the departments that actually use them.

1021
01:37:02,847 --> 01:37:04,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why this report is so short.

1022
01:37:05,549 --> 01:37:07,310
[SPEAKER_02]: because we made no approval in 2023.

1023
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:08,550
[SPEAKER_02]: We made no approvals.

1024
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:09,491
[SPEAKER_02]: We made no rejections.

1025
01:37:09,571 --> 01:37:18,894
[SPEAKER_02]: We made no changes, and that is because the only surveillance technology being used in the city in 2023, which, in fact, was only for, I think, about three weeks in December, was the body-worn cameras.

1026
01:37:19,395 --> 01:37:27,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And per the ordinance that we passed earlier that year, body-worn cameras are exempted from City Council approval process until 2028.

1027
01:37:27,998 --> 01:37:28,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So

1028
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:45,065
[SPEAKER_02]: This report just sums all of that up, and it also includes a copy of the annual surveillance report on body-worn cameras that the Medford Police Department submitted to us, and we discussed in a meeting of the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

1029
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:48,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the brief report that we're looking at.

1030
01:37:49,207 --> 01:37:49,507
Thank you.

1031
01:37:51,188 --> 01:37:51,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1032
01:37:51,528 --> 01:37:57,592
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to receive and place on file the annual surveillance report, seconded by Councilor Tseng, any discussion?

1033
01:37:59,178 --> 01:38:00,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, all those in favor.

1034
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed motion passes.

1035
01:38:04,663 --> 01:38:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is you George.

1036
01:38:07,947 --> 01:38:12,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 2324356 resolution to support work to ban equity theft state legislation be resolved.

1037
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:20,619
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council sent a letter of support to our state legislators for their work being done to protect homeowners from unfair taxing practices by cities and towns and the work to ban equity theft legislation.

1038
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:28,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael, what do you think of the practice of cities and towns taking the entire value of a home to recover tax debt that is less than the value of the property when homeowners fall behind in their property taxes?

1039
01:38:28,558 --> 01:38:31,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Senate docket number 2129, filed January 20th, 2023.

1040
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:32,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1041
01:38:33,059 --> 01:38:33,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1042
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:40,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And this resolution comes up because of a conversation with a very educated constituent, and he's here tonight.

1043
01:38:42,023 --> 01:38:45,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Guest on is, we had a discussion, we talked about

1044
01:38:46,204 --> 01:39:10,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I did some reading, and you realize that the negative effect that this puts on, especially, I looked at the fact of a senior citizen that was having issues with their taxes, and then finding a way to get out of it by selling their home, and then coming back and taking,

1045
01:39:11,596 --> 01:39:13,717
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole property instead of what is owed to them.

1046
01:39:13,777 --> 01:39:19,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that this is something this council should support and send some

1047
01:39:21,949 --> 01:39:26,351
[SPEAKER_06]: ascended to state legislators for their understanding.

1048
01:39:26,411 --> 01:39:36,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that we had, after our council speak, I know that I'd like for a community member to come up and really give his professional opinion.

1049
01:39:36,776 --> 01:39:37,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, thank you.

1050
01:39:37,456 --> 01:39:40,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And I brought this up with the treasurer, Collector Johnson, a couple of weeks ago.

1051
01:39:40,157 --> 01:39:42,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, we're not doing it.

1052
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:44,999
[SPEAKER_04]: The city of Medford is not engaging in that practice currently.

1053
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:54,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, definitely, I believe this legislation is a response to recent, or maybe not a response to, but parallel to recent court decisions outlawing the practice.

1054
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely makes sense to me.

1055
01:39:56,313 --> 01:39:59,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Councilor Leming, then any other councillors, and then we'll open it up to the public.

1056
01:40:00,713 --> 01:40:21,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, so I, I do I do support this, this resolution, I did some googling on this prior to the meeting you know there were stories of homeowners falling behind on property tax payments the city seizing an entire house worth, you know, 400,000 plus dollars to pay off $150,000 debt just

1057
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,484
[SPEAKER_09]: keeping the difference.

1058
01:40:25,544 --> 01:40:41,892
[SPEAKER_09]: So my question has to do more with, so I couldn't find online, and this could just be a failure of Googling on my part, Senate docket number 2129, or the relevant bills in the state house that were supporting this.

1059
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:43,593
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also would like to see a

1060
01:40:45,033 --> 01:40:50,214
[SPEAKER_09]: It mentions here to send a letter to support our state legislators.

1061
01:40:50,274 --> 01:41:02,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see a draft of that letter personally, or just some idea of the specific legislation in the state House and Senate, if there is any.

1062
01:41:06,777 --> 01:41:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, Councilor Kalia?

1063
01:41:10,137 --> 01:41:11,398
[SPEAKER_20]: I will try to find that.

1064
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:13,338
[SPEAKER_20]: I did find the exact number, 2129.

1065
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:17,410
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the number?

1066
01:41:17,731 --> 01:41:18,011
H4624.

1067
01:41:18,271 --> 01:41:27,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was it reported out of?

1068
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:34,525
[SPEAKER_05]: You said it was reported out of a committee?

1069
01:41:43,174 --> 01:41:46,755
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to come up and talk about it, if you can share that in the public participation.

1070
01:41:47,276 --> 01:41:47,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

1071
01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:49,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kelly.

1072
01:41:50,897 --> 01:42:00,540
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it was quite shocking to realize that it has been the practice of cities, at least has occasionally happened that they seize entire property.

1073
01:42:01,052 --> 01:42:09,400
[SPEAKER_20]: for a small amount of debt and then keep the profits, keep the rest of what they sell that probably for the sins, utterly absurd.

1074
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:11,522
[SPEAKER_20]: So I am in support.

1075
01:42:11,902 --> 01:42:19,689
[SPEAKER_20]: I will say that as I was canvassing, I remember talking to someone who lived next door to a micro lot.

1076
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:34,620
[SPEAKER_20]: that the city had appropriated from a, this was the story, so this is not verified, but this was from a resident saying that the micro lot between their house and their neighbor's house was something that the city had taken

1077
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:37,603
[SPEAKER_20]: because of past due taxes.

1078
01:42:39,124 --> 01:42:49,572
[SPEAKER_20]: And that it then was an eyesore filled with weeds and rats that worked with their nearby residents to try to come up with some sort of plan to purchase it from the city and the city refused.

1079
01:42:50,072 --> 01:42:56,377
[SPEAKER_20]: So at some point in time, Medford had been taking portions of lots

1080
01:42:57,901 --> 01:43:00,102
[SPEAKER_20]: to instead of back taxes.

1081
01:43:01,303 --> 01:43:17,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will also say that even if I'm happy to hear that the court has now determined this is not lawful, but even if the city of Medford is not currently doing something, administrations change, and it is important that we ensure that this is not allowed to happen in the future.

1082
01:43:18,714 --> 01:43:19,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1083
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:21,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will just add, you know,

1084
01:43:22,737 --> 01:43:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slightly different thing, and it is not, again, generally an issue in Medford, but the civil forfeiture issue in general is a huge issue of, you know, prior to any sort of legal determination, you know, and this fund, this basically funds county police departments in like Ohio and Tennessee, places, other places in this country, taking private property, people's personal property without the,

1085
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:50,960
[SPEAKER_04]: without any really due process, other than that it's civil forfeiture.

1086
01:43:51,020 --> 01:44:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of, to me, is a similar parallel, and certainly something that we don't want to be happening, and certainly something we don't want to be used as a revenue tool.

1087
01:44:01,143 --> 01:44:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, it's not the policy of the city, but obviously not something that we want as a state law or anything like that.

1088
01:44:08,065 --> 01:44:10,886
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, any further comments from members of the council?

1089
01:44:12,026 --> 01:44:13,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

1090
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:15,107
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we'll go to the podium.

1091
01:44:15,127 --> 01:44:16,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1092
01:44:17,008 --> 01:44:18,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have one hand on Zoom.

1093
01:44:21,749 --> 01:44:22,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1094
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:24,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Gaston Fiore, 61, Stignero.

1095
01:44:26,233 --> 01:44:29,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Before I begin, I would like to cite my references.

1096
01:44:30,177 --> 01:44:37,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Home equity theft in Massachusetts is the focus of federal lawsuit by Sean P. Murphy, the Boston Globe, January 25th, 2024.

1097
01:44:38,664 --> 01:44:45,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts rules that state's method of taking property for unpaid taxes is unconstitutional by Sean P. Murphy, the Boston Globe, April 21, 2024.

1098
01:44:47,612 --> 01:45:03,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Stealing homes right out from under vulnerable owners is just wrong by the editorial board, the Boston Globe, May 3, 2024, and Violating the Spirit of America, Home Equity Theft in Massachusetts by Angela C. Erickson, Joshua Polk, and Killeen Gallagher, the Pacific Legal Foundation.

1099
01:45:05,447 --> 01:45:08,110
[SPEAKER_17]: So first, let's define home equity theft.

1100
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:19,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Home equity theft is the practice of cities and towns taking the entire value of a home to recover tax debt that is less than the value of the property when homeowners fall behind on the property taxes.

1101
01:45:20,002 --> 01:45:28,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Most often, home equity theft involves people who have inherited real estate and own it without a mortgage but lack the income to pay the taxes.

1102
01:45:28,931 --> 01:45:37,108
[SPEAKER_17]: In some instances, property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars is taken by municipalities when the amount owed in taxes is a small fraction of that.

1103
01:45:38,459 --> 01:45:49,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts, it's only one of a handful of states that presently allow local governments to take not only the taxes they're owed, plus interest and fees, but also the rest of the equity in properties.

1104
01:45:50,202 --> 01:45:53,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Second, let's examine the legality of home equity theft.

1105
01:45:53,623 --> 01:46:05,746
[SPEAKER_17]: In May 2023, the US Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that municipalities may sell a taxpayer's home to recover unpaid taxes, but they cannot size the remaining equity in the property.

1106
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:17,931
[SPEAKER_17]: In Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota, the Supreme Court ruled that a tax taken by the county violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking private property without just compensation.

1107
01:46:19,195 --> 01:46:28,778
[SPEAKER_17]: That ruling, while striking down the Minnesota law, said existing laws in other states may be constitutional if they provide a process for property owners to recover their equity.

1108
01:46:29,618 --> 01:46:33,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts law is mostly silent on the question of equity.

1109
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:42,282
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the absence of an explicit prohibition, some municipalities have assumed the right to keep the full equity with few safeguards for property owners.

1110
01:46:43,322 --> 01:46:44,382
[SPEAKER_17]: In April 2024, so very recently,

1111
01:46:46,556 --> 01:46:53,639
[SPEAKER_17]: A Massachusetts court ruled that the way some municipalities pursue tax-taking cases against homeowners is unconstitutional.

1112
01:46:54,339 --> 01:47:04,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Judge Michael Callan of Hampton Superior Court ruled that such practices violate Article 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in addition to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S.

1113
01:47:04,244 --> 01:47:04,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Constitution.

1114
01:47:05,623 --> 01:47:23,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Callan said, the state law used by municipalities in tax taking, known as Chapter 60, does not provide a recovery process and therefore is, quote, unconstitutional as applied in circumstances such as here, where the tax debt is less than the value of the property, end quote.

1115
01:47:25,233 --> 01:47:32,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Callan also wrote that Chapter 60, quote, in its present form is untenable and requires legislative correction, end quote.

1116
01:47:33,663 --> 01:47:41,050
[SPEAKER_17]: The decision by Judge Cannon, however, does not set a statewide precedent that is binding on other courts hearing similar cases.

1117
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:45,174
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, the courts cannot fix this except case by case.

1118
01:47:46,015 --> 01:47:51,200
[SPEAKER_17]: As such, it is imperative that the state legislature enacts a bill that explicitly prohibits equity takings.

1119
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:56,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Third, let's examine the work of the state legislature regarding home equity theft.

1120
01:47:57,261 --> 01:48:01,244
[SPEAKER_17]: There are currently several pending bills at the legislature that would bar home equity theft.

1121
01:48:01,824 --> 01:48:13,854
[SPEAKER_17]: State Senator Mark Montigny, with the support of a number of colleagues, has filed legislation, S1876, that would curtail the ability of municipalities or private firms to collect more of the homeowner's equity than is actually owed.

1122
01:48:14,614 --> 01:48:18,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Senator Joe Comerford of Northampton has also filed legislation, S921,

1123
01:48:19,938 --> 01:48:27,985
[SPEAKER_17]: And recently, the Legislature Joint Committee on Revenue is drafting its own bill, which has just become publicly available on May 9th, and that's H4624.

1124
01:48:28,065 --> 01:48:34,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Fourth, let's examine some data on specific cases.

1125
01:48:35,351 --> 01:48:41,497
[SPEAKER_17]: So let me quote some quantitative data from the article by Erickson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation.

1126
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:42,177
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm quoting now.

1127
01:48:43,274 --> 01:48:52,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Quote, Massachusetts homeowners subjected to tax foreclosure lose 87% of their home equity on average, nearly $260,000 per home.

1128
01:48:53,224 --> 01:49:02,172
[SPEAKER_17]: In our study, that's a study by Erickson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation, of 31 Massachusetts localities representing one third of the state's population,

1129
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:09,857
[SPEAKER_17]: The government foreclosed and sold 254 homes for tax debt from January 2014 through June 2020.

1130
01:49:11,138 --> 01:49:20,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts law allowed the taking of an estimated $60 million in equity above what these homeowners owed in property tax debt.

1131
01:49:21,204 --> 01:49:34,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Another 154 homes were foreclosed for tax debts from January 2014 through December 2020 by a private investment company that purchased tax liens, the right to collect a tax debt from the state.

1132
01:49:35,369 --> 01:49:44,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts law allowed the taking of an estimated $37 million in equity above what these homeowners owed in property tax debt."

1133
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:52,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me consider, and I'm close to being done, two specific cases taken from the two articles by Sean Murphy in the Boston Globe.

1134
01:49:54,116 --> 01:50:01,401
[SPEAKER_17]: One specific case concerns Stephen Woodbridge, 62, who is reported as unemployed and living in subsidized housing.

1135
01:50:01,822 --> 01:50:04,324
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2017, the city of Greenfield targeted Woodbridge's property.

1136
01:50:05,044 --> 01:50:11,307
[SPEAKER_17]: The property totaled almost 20 acres, including a 10-room house, and had been in the Woodbridge family for 70 years.

1137
01:50:12,007 --> 01:50:14,789
[SPEAKER_17]: The amount of unpaid taxes was a little less than $6,000.

1138
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:21,812
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2021, the city succeeded in gaining legal ownership of Woodbridge's property.

1139
01:50:22,312 --> 01:50:27,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Woodbridge was quickly evicted, and the city sold his house and six surrounding acres for $270,000 at auction.

1140
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:35,644
[SPEAKER_17]: The city added the remainder 13 wooded acres to a continuous city-owned park without compensating him.

1141
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:51,534
[SPEAKER_17]: The city reaped a cash profit of at least $220,000, this $270,000 sale price at auction, minus the $50,000 Woodbridge owing taxes, interest, and other costs accumulated while the tax taking case moved through the system.

1142
01:50:52,315 --> 01:51:00,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Woodbridge's debt had ballooned almost tenfold since 2017 because he was charged fees for the city's attorneys plus 16% interest on his debt.

1143
01:51:03,178 --> 01:51:14,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Another specific case concerns Ashley Mills, 26, who is reported as living with her two-year-old son and disabled mother in the home she inherited from her grandmother that is her only financial asset.

1144
01:51:15,528 --> 01:51:25,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Mills first went into tax arrears in 2016, and a year later the city of Springfield began proxies against her on a debt of about $2,000, which included interest of 14%, later bumped up to 16%.

1145
01:51:29,938 --> 01:51:35,161
[SPEAKER_17]: As of late 2023, the debt had ballooned to about $22,000, mostly due to the high interest.

1146
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:41,284
[SPEAKER_17]: At that time, the asset value of Mills' property was $145,000, with a likely higher fair market value.

1147
01:51:41,864 --> 01:51:55,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Had the tax taking been completed, the city of Springfield would have been free to sell Mills' former property at auction, resulting in a likely windfall for the city of at least $123,000, equal to the amount of equity Mills had in the property.

1148
01:51:56,111 --> 01:51:57,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally, let's summarize.

1149
01:51:58,905 --> 01:52:01,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Home equity theft is simply immoral.

1150
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:05,054
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the perfect example of government overreach and abuse.

1151
01:52:05,796 --> 01:52:10,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me quote from the article by Erikson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation.

1152
01:52:11,414 --> 01:52:20,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Quote, while government has the power to collect and pay taxes from homeowners, no government has the right to take someone's home and its equity beyond what is owed.

1153
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:28,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Both the United States and Massachusetts constitutions protect homeowners' rights to just compensation and freedom from excessive fines.

1154
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:33,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Despite constitutional protections, a dozen states still sanction this kind of home equity theft.

1155
01:52:33,964 --> 01:52:39,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts homeowners desperately need reform of the unconstitutional tax foreclosure law.

1156
01:52:39,775 --> 01:52:51,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts lawmakers can lead that reform by protecting the equity homeowners have in their homes, despite their tax delinquency, and by ensuring that tax foreclosed homes are sold for fair market value, end quote.

1157
01:52:52,117 --> 01:52:56,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Home equity theft can and must be barred by legislation.

1158
01:52:56,378 --> 01:53:02,299
[SPEAKER_17]: I strongly encourage the city council to write a letter to the state legislature in support of its work to bar home equity theft.

1159
01:53:02,579 --> 01:53:03,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1160
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:05,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1161
01:53:07,048 --> 01:53:10,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1162
01:53:10,411 --> 01:53:11,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1163
01:53:14,093 --> 01:53:17,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, Andrew Castagnetti, Method, Massachusetts.

1164
01:53:19,297 --> 01:53:20,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your time.

1165
01:53:20,958 --> 01:53:21,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1166
01:53:21,559 --> 01:53:22,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

1167
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,782
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you, and thank you for being here.

1168
01:53:26,562 --> 01:53:26,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1169
01:53:27,523 --> 01:53:35,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Councilor George Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda to support our state legislators who are finally

1170
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:37,872
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to fix this problem.

1171
01:53:37,892 --> 01:53:40,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I am more than appalled.

1172
01:53:40,794 --> 01:53:43,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I am totally shocked when I heard about this.

1173
01:53:44,097 --> 01:53:45,658
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a travesty of justice.

1174
01:53:45,878 --> 01:53:48,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an injustice against the real estate owner.

1175
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:53,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe that Carl Malter Massachusetts would allow the 351 cities and towns to

1176
01:53:57,916 --> 01:54:03,638
[SPEAKER_01]: basically take by domain for non payment or real estate taxes and water bills, etc.

1177
01:54:04,298 --> 01:54:07,899
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell the house somehow and pocket the difference.

1178
01:54:08,419 --> 01:54:10,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is terrible.

1179
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,500
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grand theft.

1180
01:54:12,961 --> 01:54:26,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, if I had the power, I will also have the cities and towns, they should and they must pay treble damages with interest to the x owners or

1181
01:54:27,907 --> 01:54:29,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The ears, period.

1182
01:54:39,216 --> 01:54:40,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mr. Cassanetti.

1183
01:54:46,821 --> 01:54:48,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It appears you may have frozen.

1184
01:54:51,345 --> 01:54:52,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you, are you done Mr. Cassanetti?

1185
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:55,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I'm done, thank you.

1186
01:54:55,328 --> 01:54:56,569
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1187
01:54:59,557 --> 01:55:00,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion?

1188
01:55:00,478 --> 01:55:08,723
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins, is there an amendment to change the number to H4624?

1189
01:55:09,103 --> 01:55:19,809
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Collins, as amended by Councilor Collins, to change the number to H4624.

1190
01:55:22,895 --> 01:55:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, I'm sorry.

1191
01:55:23,996 --> 01:55:24,497
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1192
01:55:25,077 --> 01:55:25,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I oppose.

1193
01:55:25,678 --> 01:55:26,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1194
01:55:26,879 --> 01:55:32,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I skipped over 24354, Resolution Authorize Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee to publish City Council Newsletter.

1195
01:55:32,825 --> 01:55:39,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Sponsored by Councilor Leming and myself, be it resolved by the Medford City Council, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, shall I have the authority to draft and approve a regular newsletter.

1196
01:55:40,273 --> 01:55:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: summarizing the activities of the council and can vote to publish the newsletter about our mechanisms available without referring the draft newsletter to a regular council meeting for a vote.

1197
01:55:47,937 --> 01:55:52,180
[SPEAKER_04]: For the result of this paper be referred to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee as a standing agenda item.

1198
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

1199
01:55:53,941 --> 01:55:54,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1200
01:55:54,561 --> 01:56:03,566
[SPEAKER_09]: This is basically a resolution to address some of the concerns brought up at the last council meeting.

1201
01:56:03,866 --> 01:56:05,387
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea behind this is pretty simple.

1202
01:56:05,427 --> 01:56:08,849
[SPEAKER_09]: We've discussed the newsletter very extensively and

1203
01:56:09,449 --> 01:56:14,213
[SPEAKER_09]: regular council so far and the resident services public engagement committee meeting.

1204
01:56:14,253 --> 01:56:25,961
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea behind this is basically just to have it as an agenda item during those meetings in which we plan to draft and finalize and release the newsletter.

1205
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:32,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would motion to send this to the resident services and public to reverse to the resident services and public engagement committee.

1206
01:56:33,339 --> 01:56:38,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve and refer to resident services and public engagement by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1207
01:56:38,828 --> 01:56:47,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just add, yes, I mean, I think, you know, absent an authorization, for example, we, you know, we don't have to do it every term because it

1208
01:56:47,762 --> 01:56:48,383
[SPEAKER_04]: carries over.

1209
01:56:49,944 --> 01:56:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Subcommittee on licensing, permitting, and signs looks at things before they come to the regular council.

1210
01:56:56,209 --> 01:57:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We've authorized subcommittees and committees in the past to take action without having to come back to the council.

1211
01:57:03,456 --> 01:57:06,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are things that happen.

1212
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:08,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does have to be on paper.

1213
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,601
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not, then

1214
01:57:11,222 --> 01:57:16,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that gets reported in the committee is to come back out of committee, and generally that's true for almost every item anyway.

1215
01:57:17,324 --> 01:57:27,628
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a communication, you know, we've authorized committees to look at, you know, inviting people to have conversations or go out and look at different sites in the past.

1216
01:57:29,168 --> 01:57:38,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, outside of those kind of more investigatory and communicative things, anything that hasn't processed by ordinance or resolution or something else obviously needs a vote by the full council before it goes into effect.

1217
01:57:38,852 --> 01:57:40,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're taking a vote tonight.

1218
01:57:40,552 --> 01:57:46,254
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if it passes to authorize the committee to send those communications.

1219
01:57:46,474 --> 01:57:50,656
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng, any further discussion?

1220
01:57:52,633 --> 01:57:53,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be brief.

1221
01:57:53,274 --> 01:57:57,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to thank you, Councilor Lohmann, President Bears for putting this on the agenda.

1222
01:57:57,896 --> 01:58:05,339
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that Councilor Lohmann and I have been working really, really hard on, given the demand from the public to hear from us about the work that we're doing.

1223
01:58:06,219 --> 01:58:06,580
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've

1224
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:29,992
[SPEAKER_11]: put in a lot of guardrails to make sure that this is a transparent the creation of this newsletter is transparent and it's neutral um content wise um this goes you know going through the resident services subcommittee there are five eyes looking over it um it makes sense for that given time and but also the process that we're already putting into it makes sense for that um committee to be approving it um instead of

1225
01:58:30,612 --> 01:58:41,698
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, sending it here, dragging it out more weeks, and then re-litigating like typos and small things potentially in the group of seven when we already have a group of five that can do that job.

1226
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:46,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will note that the two people who are not members of that committee are myself and Vice President Collins.

1227
01:58:48,122 --> 01:58:49,502
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, all those in favor?

1228
01:58:50,063 --> 01:58:54,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

1229
01:58:55,306 --> 01:58:56,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1230
01:59:00,694 --> 01:59:02,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to be marked as a no?

1231
01:59:02,556 --> 01:59:02,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1232
01:59:03,036 --> 01:59:03,356
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1233
01:59:03,376 --> 01:59:03,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1234
01:59:03,997 --> 01:59:04,277
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1235
01:59:04,937 --> 01:59:05,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Be consistent.

1236
01:59:05,698 --> 01:59:06,299
[SPEAKER_05]: The clerk asked.

1237
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:09,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, clerk.

1238
01:59:09,501 --> 01:59:10,242
[SPEAKER_08]: If he hadn't asked.

1239
01:59:10,282 --> 01:59:10,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Meow.

1240
01:59:11,123 --> 01:59:12,223
[SPEAKER_08]: One second.

1241
01:59:12,324 --> 01:59:13,204
[SPEAKER_08]: One second here.

1242
01:59:13,224 --> 01:59:13,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Meow.

1243
01:59:13,444 --> 01:59:13,805
[SPEAKER_08]: 6X1, meow.

1244
01:59:13,825 --> 01:59:16,327
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is approved.

1245
01:59:26,685 --> 01:59:28,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all right.

1246
01:59:28,448 --> 01:59:29,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

1247
01:59:32,553 --> 01:59:33,254
[SPEAKER_04]: No meows.

1248
01:59:33,655 --> 01:59:34,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yes or no here.

1249
01:59:34,916 --> 01:59:34,956
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1250
01:59:38,218 --> 01:59:41,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we have one present for a compromise public comment.

1251
01:59:42,339 --> 01:59:45,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Public comment email Norman Kaplan leaf blower ordinance.

1252
01:59:45,621 --> 01:59:47,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to go on the record as follows.

1253
01:59:47,641 --> 01:59:52,863
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't send the fire department to put out 50% of the fire but unfortunately that's what the city council is doing.

1254
01:59:53,323 --> 02:00:01,186
[SPEAKER_04]: As I stated after midnight at the tortured city council meeting in March with evidence to prove it battery powered leaf blowers have reached velocity levels comparable to gas versions.

1255
02:00:01,926 --> 02:00:06,008
[SPEAKER_04]: In time, and likely soon, the battery models will become even more powerful.

1256
02:00:06,048 --> 02:00:10,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an example of the progress in battery technology.

1257
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:13,551
[SPEAKER_04]: The 2024 gas-powered Honda Civic goes 0 to 60 in 9.2 seconds.

1258
02:00:14,131 --> 02:00:17,633
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nissan LEAF all-electric 2024 goes in 6.7 seconds.

1259
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:19,614
[SPEAKER_04]: See motortrend.com.

1260
02:00:20,094 --> 02:00:21,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to go faster?

1261
02:00:21,074 --> 02:00:26,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump into the all-new electric Porsche Macan, which takes a mere 3.1 seconds, compared to the gas variant at 4.1 seconds.

1262
02:00:27,897 --> 02:00:30,978
[SPEAKER_04]: see Danielle's column in the April 25th 2024 Wall Street Journal.

1263
02:00:31,418 --> 02:00:36,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations certainly to the city council for finally curbing and eventually eliminating the toxic emissions from gas leaf blowers.

1264
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:50,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But why on earth has the council elected to do nothing to seasonally restrict, let alone eliminate the year-round dispersal of dirt, dust, animal feces, mold, fungi, pollens, pesticides, herbicides, and heavy metals which can linger in the air for hours after a powerful battery-operated blower has been turned off?

1265
02:00:50,563 --> 02:00:55,264
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wouldn't drink a glass of water with any of that stuff in it, I don't know why you would want to inhale it either.

1266
02:00:55,424 --> 02:00:56,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Norman Kaplan, 23, Headland Way.

1267
02:00:59,406 --> 02:01:02,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any further public comment in the council chamber on Zoom?

1268
02:01:02,534 --> 02:01:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go to the podium.

1269
02:01:05,321 --> 02:01:08,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please, and also raise your hand on Zoom.

1270
02:01:08,814 --> 02:01:10,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President, Gaston Fiore 61, Stingley Road.

1271
02:01:11,036 --> 02:01:13,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had a question for clarification.

1272
02:01:13,739 --> 02:01:20,646
[SPEAKER_17]: When Mr. DiRico spoke, I know he mentioned something about property taxes, but unfortunately I couldn't catch it.

1273
02:01:20,746 --> 02:01:30,676
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was wondering what is the real estate tax rate that TAFs is gonna pay for this lodging, if that's known?

1274
02:01:31,161 --> 02:01:33,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the answer for this lodging is zero.

1275
02:01:34,143 --> 02:01:38,846
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they're paying property taxes.

1276
02:01:40,007 --> 02:01:44,190
[SPEAKER_17]: They're paying property taxes on it?

1277
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:44,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1278
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1279
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:47,392
[SPEAKER_20]: The same rate as all residents, homeowners, sorry.

1280
02:01:47,992 --> 02:01:49,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, thank you.

1281
02:01:49,853 --> 02:01:51,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all right, sorry, I missed that.

1282
02:01:51,494 --> 02:01:53,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it'll be assessed and taxed at the standard residential rate.

1283
02:01:54,236 --> 02:01:56,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great, thank you so much, appreciate it.

1284
02:01:56,257 --> 02:01:56,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1285
02:01:57,998 --> 02:01:58,519
[SPEAKER_04]: A happy note.

1286
02:01:59,977 --> 02:02:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Calihan.

1287
02:02:01,678 --> 02:02:05,999
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Calihan to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1288
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:07,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I missed anything.

1289
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:09,961
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1290
02:02:10,561 --> 02:02:11,161
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1291
02:02:11,181 --> 02:02:11,641
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1292
02:02:11,821 --> 02:02:12,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

1293
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:12,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1294
02:02:12,822 --> 02:02:13,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting is adjourned.
