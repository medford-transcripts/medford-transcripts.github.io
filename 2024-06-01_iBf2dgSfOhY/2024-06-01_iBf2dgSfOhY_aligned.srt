Let's take a group photo.

135
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:35,103
Same drill as before.

136
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,970

We have one more set of citations to give out, so bear with us.

140
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:20,916
All right, last citation before we start the much less fun city council meeting.

141
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:24,844
I just want to read it really quickly we passed this on April 30.

142
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:39,174
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we congratulate the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility students at the Brooks Elementary School for their fundraiser to purchase safety devices for our local United States Postal Service mail carriers.

143
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:45,398
Be it further resolved that we invite these students to the May 14 City Council meeting to receive a citation for their fantastic work.

144
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:57,902
We also had from Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved the City Council recognize the amazing work of Savannah McLaughlin and Adam Costello, members of the CCSR, and 5th grade students from the Brooks Elementary School on providing safety whistles for postal workers.

145
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:02,403
We unanimously approve those resolutions and we are excited to offer these citations tonight.

146
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:05,184
And I will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli if he would like to say any words.

147
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:06,631
Thank you.

148
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:10,755
Tonight is a great example of what Method truly is about, right?

149
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:16,320
We have, tonight was just, we haven't had many of these in a long time, but this was a love fest.

150
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:19,483
And I, you know, this is what Method's all about.

151
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:30,493
So a group that was started a few years back, the CCSR, we have one of our leaders here, Mr. Richard Trotter is here tonight.

152
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,335
And I know that

153
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:45,691
when we heard about this story, and then we saw it on TV, and then you see it in action, because, you know, it sounds, well, that's cute, right?

154
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:50,173
And then all of a sudden, our postal worker walked down the street with the whistle.

155
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,190
And I said, and you see what's going on.

156
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,173
And there are some dangers.

157
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:56,555
Sadly, there are dangers.

158
00:27:57,016 --> 00:28:01,101
And we had two fifth graders that decided that they wanted to do something about it.

159
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:03,945
And it's easy just to sit back and do nothing.

160
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,870
But this is what's exciting when you have a fifth grade.

161
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:25,810
to fifth graders that can reach out to this school, that can reach out to an organization like CCSR, and then provide an avenue that they can do something really, really, really moving, and something that really shows the city and shows their friends and shows everybody that you take an initiative,

162
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,626
because you care, because you see something and you want to fix something.

163
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:34,891
So I give them our friends a lot of credit for what they've done.

164
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:36,713
I'm so happy they're here tonight with their families.

165
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:38,495
So thank you.

166
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:44,752
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

167
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:49,214
If we could invite up Mr. Trotta and Savannah and Adam.

168
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:51,095
First, we'll start with Savannah.

169
00:28:51,835 --> 00:29:05,682
The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to congratulate Savannah McLaughlin, member of the CCSR and fifth grade student from the Brooks Elementary School, for their fundraiser to purchase safety devices for our local USPS mail carriers.

170
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:10,564
The realization of this outstanding achievement will undoubtedly lead to successes and accomplishments throughout your life.

171
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:12,405
Come on up, Savannah.

172
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:20,126
That's for you.

173
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,267
You want to say something?

174
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,213
Awesome.

175
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:48,349
Now we have that the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to congratulate Adam Costello, member of the CCSR and fifth grade student from the Brooks Elementary School for their fundraiser to purchase safety devices for our local USPS mail carriers.

176
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:56,832
The realization of this outstanding achievement will undoubtedly lead to successes and accomplishments throughout your lives.

177
00:29:56,852 --> 00:29:57,153
Thank you.

178
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,974
You want to say something?

179
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:00,474

I just want to also say we have a general citation for the Brooke CCSR.

185
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:14,978

217
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:03,699

00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,043
So, the motion of Councilor saying to approve seconded by Councilor lemming.

219

00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,352

All those in favor?

230
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:52,978

233
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:59,065
I will go to the committee chair, Councilor Lemming.

234
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:06,710
Thank you, Council President.

235
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,513
So we discussed three items at the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

236
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:24,822
The first, we approved the social media policy, which was drafted by Councilor Singh and Councilor Lozaro, passed, reported favorably as a paper to the regular committee meeting.

237
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:29,866
We also established the first public listening session, which will

238
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:33,280
occur at the Medford Senior Center, 10 a.m.

239
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:44,614
on May 31st, and we also scheduled the first subcommittee meeting to sort of hash out the rules and procedures for these listening sessions, the first

240
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:52,400
the first meeting of that subcommittee will be tomorrow at 5 15 between myself, Councilor saying Councilor Callahan.

241
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:01,426
And finally, we approved the first draft of the human of the new Human Rights Commission ordinance.

242
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:06,009
Thank you very much to Councilor saying for all the work you put into that.

243
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:06,549
And it was

244
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:13,302
referred favorably to, okay, okay, sorry, it was kept in committee.

245
00:37:13,322 --> 00:37:14,222
Apologies for that.

246
00:37:15,162 --> 00:37:17,282
And yeah, that's what happened.

247
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,203
So I would motion to approve.

248
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:19,763
Second.

249
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:23,044
On the motion of Council, allowing to approve the committee report, seconded by Councilor Sang.

250
00:37:23,104 --> 00:37:23,924
All those in favor?

251
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:24,184
Aye.

252
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:24,784
Opposed?

253
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:25,644
Motion passes.

254
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:34,047
24-0C33 and 24-083 offered by Vice President Collins, planning and permitting committee, May 8th, 2024, report to follow.

255
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:35,707
Vice President Collins.

256
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:46,250
We met with the council zoning consultant and our discussion centered on updating some of the critical definitions that have been flagged for updating.

257
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,573
We also discussed the timeline of the project over the next several months.

258
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:50,934
Motion to approve.

259
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:51,674
Thank you.

260
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:56,017
And I believe there's an error on the agenda that is on us.

261
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:58,299
Would you amend to remove the 2-4?

262
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,401
We're just, we're just, it's a Claire Blair.

263
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:03,564
There's just one additional paper number.

264
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:04,424
All right.

265
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:08,248
On the motion of Councillor Collins to approve seconded by Councillor saying all those in favor.

266
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,329
Opposed.

267
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,791
Motion passes.

268
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,033
Refer to committee for further discussion.

269
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:15,696
24-351 offered by Councillor Lemming.

270
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:17,538
Give me one second here.

271
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:25,300
be it resolved, whereas veterans in the city of Medford need a place to live and are often discriminated against when searching for housing.

272
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:31,983
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the veteran services director shall have the authority to offer available funds to entities that choose to rent to qualified veterans.

273
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:36,906
Be it further resolved that this be discussed with the veteran services director and the city's legal representation in committee.

274
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,667
I'll turn it over to Councilor Lemming.

275
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,588
What committee would you like to refer this to?

276
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,970
And the intent of this section is to keep these relatively short.

277
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,532
So I know there's a proposed agenda here.

278
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:54,860
I would like to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee mainly because that primarily covers Veterans Affairs.

279
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:09,652
I've also invited over the Veterans Services Director, Veronica Shaw, for this, but essentially this is a paper that would allow the Veterans Services Director to establish a program

280
00:39:10,262 --> 00:39:19,264
under which she may offer monetary incentives to landlords who choose to rent out to qualified veterans.

281
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:29,326
I've been asking KP Law for legal advice around this, as well as talking with the city's chief of staff around this issue.

282
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:35,648
So yeah, I would motion to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

283
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:40,911
All right, on the motion to refer to resident services and public engagement by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Collins.

284
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,953
Director Shaw, is there anything you want to add at this time?

285
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:48,656
You've been with us for a while, so I want to give you the chance to speak on this paper and why this issue is so important.

286
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:49,957
Thank you.

287
00:39:57,743 --> 00:39:59,765
And you may need to adjust the microphone.

288
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:00,926
There you go.

289
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,107
Thank you for having me.

290
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:11,497
So what I would like to be able to do is offer landlords, either private, I prefer private corporations,

291
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,667
think it would probably be discriminatory if I said no to them.

292
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:21,928
I would like to offer them $500 in exchange for them renting to veterans.

293
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:28,890
There is a lot of stigma around veterans and a lot of landlords just choose not to rent to them.

294
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,611
And that snowballs to homelessness.

295
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,612
and I'm hoping that this will help.

296
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:42,294
I'd like to start small, offering to four landlords this fiscal year.

297
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:57,479
The funds will come out of my cash aid budget, and they would, if they continue to allow that veteran to stay with them, they would get that every year, as long as both parties are agreeing to it.

298
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:02,590
Any questions on the motion?

299
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,192
I'll go to Councilor Zara, Councilor Sang, Councilor Kellyanne.

300
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:11,734
As I raise my hand, I realize this is something we can discuss in committee, so I take it back.

301
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:12,474
Never mind, thank you.

302
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:13,135
Thank you.

303
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:19,821
Councilors, I just wanted to thank you for taking so much time out of your evening to be with us.

304
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,382
I know you've done a lot of homework for this.

305
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:25,465
I think this is something I mean, if I speak for myself, I very much support.

306
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:27,287
I hope the council supports.

307
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:34,372
We, I think, you know, we often forget that homelessness and this housing crisis touches

308
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,519
wide swaths of our population, including veterans.

309
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,903
And I think it's really easy for us not to see that.

310
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:45,429
It's really important that we bring it to light and do what we can to make it work.

311
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,535
I think we're curious about all the work that we can do.

312
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:52,599
I know you have a lot of research, but we have more time to talk about it.

313
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:55,464
Thank you, Councilor Gallo.

314
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:56,465
Thank you so much.

315
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:01,409
I'm excited that you and Councilor Lemming are bringing this to us.

316
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,750
I have many questions.

317
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,051
I'm excited to get into it.

318
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:08,995
And I'm also excited that we have this section where it's clearly marked.

319
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,817
This is simply what we're referring to committee.

320
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,259
I will save all of my questions for committee.

321
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:14,933
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

322
00:42:14,953 --> 00:42:20,219
On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Seng to refer this paper to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

323
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:20,960
All those in favor?

324
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,280
Aye.

325
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,041

Thank you, Director.

328

Thank you.

329
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:26,806
Vice President Collins.

330
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:29,929
I would motion to suspend the rules to take 24-355 and then 24-100.

331
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:40,860
On the motion of Vice President Collins to suspend the rules to take papers 24355 and 24100, seconded by?

332
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,641
Second.

333
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:43,022
Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

334
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:43,442
Aye.

335
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:44,303
Opposed?

336
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:45,304
Motion passes.

337
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:48,326
24355, review open meeting law complaint.

338
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:52,290
Open meeting law complaint from Deanne Andrasano, dated April 24th, 2024.

339
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,451
Acknowledge and review complaint.

340
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,552
Discuss council's response to complaint.

341
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,615
Vote to take any remedial action if necessary and appropriate.

342
00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:00,036
Votes may be taken.

343
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:15,353
We have here an open meeting law complaint summarizing, essentially, that there was a social media post summarizing a previous meeting, and there's a suggestion that that is a violation of the open meeting law.

344
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:21,277
We do have a response from the city's legal counsel here.

345
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:26,722
Please be advised that this office represents the city of Memphis carry this KP law to

346
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:34,070
Carrie Benidon, Esquire Director, Division of Open Government, Office of the Attorney General, 1 Ashburton Place, Boston, MA, 02108.

347
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,155
City of Medford City Council have a meeting law complaint from Deanna Dersano, dated April 24th, 2024.

348
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:42,178
Please be advised that this office represents the City of Medford, Massachusetts.

349
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:46,702
The Medford City Council, the Council is in receipt of an open meeting law complaint filed by D.N.

350
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:51,368
Andresano dated April 24th, 2024, a copy of which is attached here too as exhibit one.

351
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:57,837
Following receipt of the complaint, the Council requested a brief extension of the deadline to respond, which was granted by the Division of Open Government.

352
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:04,019
On May 14th, the Council met at a properly posted meeting notice for such purposes to discuss the complaint and consider its response.

353
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:15,742
The Council has carefully reviewed the allegations contained in the complaint and following such discussion has authorized this office to submit the following response on its behalf in accordance with General Law Chapter 30A Section 23 and 940 CMR 29.055.

354
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:20,103
Essentially, that's what we would be doing tonight.

355
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:22,044
We're reviewing this response and this would be

356
00:44:22,644 --> 00:44:26,147
would submit to the Division of Open Government.

357
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:38,475
Essentially, the process requires that any open meeting law complaint received by the Division of Open Government is received by the City, that the City Council or the body that the complaint is against considers that, and then replies.

358
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:47,021
And I will just read here the main headlines of the response drafted by Council.

359
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:51,984
One, posting a summary of the Council's April 2nd meeting to Reddit did not violate the open meeting law.

360
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:52,312
you

361
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,633
because the communication was not directed to a quorum of the public body.

362
00:44:56,373 --> 00:45:00,836
Two, including contextual information in a social media post did not violate the open meeting law.

363
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:07,540
Conclusion, the City Council respectfully submits that there has been no actionable violation of the open meeting law and considers this matter resolved.

364
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,341
If you have any questions, please contact me.

365
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,002
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

366
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,923
Very truly yours, Janelle Austin.

367
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,025
And we do have Attorney Austin on the line.

368
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,826
I would like to recognize Attorney Austin.

369
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:21,088
If there's anything else you'd like to add, and then we'll hear from members of the Council.

370
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:22,129
Attorney Austin.

371
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:35,028
You're recognized.

372
00:45:37,093 --> 00:45:39,118
Oh, you just muted yourself.

373
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:39,379
Here we go.

374
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:39,820
Let's try again.

375
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:42,994
Thank you, members of the Council.

376
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:47,378
I appreciate your time this evening to review this open meeting law complaint.

377
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,460
I agree with Council President Behrs.

378
00:45:50,921 --> 00:46:02,931
Essentially, the process with respect to an open meeting law complaint is that a copy of that complaint be distributed to the members of the Council, which has transpired for compliance with the open meeting law.

379
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:09,256
By way of background, there was an open meeting law that was recently filed

380
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:21,145
We were able to obtain an extension of time to allow the council adequate time to review the allegations in the open meeting law complaint and really have time to meet this evening to discuss and deliberate on the response.

381
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,247
The complaint itself was dated April 24, 2024.

382
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:26,769
We did obtain an extension of time to respond until

383
00:46:30,672 --> 00:46:34,575
May 24th, to allow the Council to review this evening.

384
00:46:35,176 --> 00:46:41,641
Based on the allegations of the complaint, I'm certainly available this evening to answer any specific questions.

385
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:49,407
In terms of reviewing the draft, there has been a draft response that has been provided to members of the Council.

386
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,929
I'm happy to review any of the specifics in there.

387
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:59,816
Certainly, in my opinion, to comply with the Open Meeting Law, the Council can review that draft, review the allegations of the complaint this evening,

388
00:47:00,436 --> 00:47:04,581
and discuss whether it feels like any remedial action is required.

389
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:18,799
In my experience, in terms of open meeting law compliance, I have reviewed the allegations of the complaint and feel comfortable with the response that has been provided to the council, specifically as Council President Behrs had read into the record.

390
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:29,942
Essentially, the Open Meeting Law prohibits, as all of you know, deliberation amongst a quorum of the Council, either outside of a properly posted meeting.

391
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:34,763
So, we're here deliberating this evening on a variety of matters within the Council's jurisdiction.

392
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:45,746
To the extent that occurred outside of a properly posted meeting, including via email, social media, or text, then the Open Meeting Law provisions would be implicated.

393
00:47:46,626 --> 00:48:01,031
In this instance, it's my understanding that there was a Reddit post for informational purposes only, and there wasn't a quorum of the City Council commenting or deliberating on that social media post outside of a properly posted meeting.

394
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:14,436
That's the information that our office has been provided, and consistent with that information and the factual circumstances that are at issue in the complaint, a draft response was provided to the Council for its consideration this evening.

395
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,797
happy to answer any other specific questions.

396
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:28,400
Essentially, this evening we would be looking for a vote to acknowledge the complaint as well as to, you know, to approve a response.

397
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:36,103
There has been a draft response provided and potentially designate, whether it be Vice President Collins or Council President Behrs,

398
00:48:36,803 --> 00:48:48,970
representative of the council to finalize the response, we would issue a copy to the complainant, as well as a copy to the Attorney General's Division of Open Government, consistent to comply with the Open Meeting Law.

399
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:50,310
Thank you.

400
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,932
Happy to answer any other questions anyone may have.

401
00:48:52,952 --> 00:48:54,532
Thank you, Attorney Officer.

402
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:56,493
We go to Vice President Collins and Council Chair Pelley.

403
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:57,334
Vice President Collins.

404
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,226
Thank you so much, President Behrs.

405
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:05,208
Thank you also, Attorney Austin, for being with us tonight and also for your work on this matter.

406
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:14,650
I have reviewed this complaint with Attorney Austin prior to this meeting, being the party that was named specifically in the complaint.

407
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:21,412
And I know that she and her colleagues have reviewed this and reviewed my Reddit post in question very thoroughly.

408
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:26,493
I was pleased to read their very thoroughly researched response and their

409
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,613
They're finding that that does not constitute an OML violation.

410
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:36,115
I myself have, you know, looked over the draft response.

411
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:37,956
I've given it some time.

412
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,116
I'm comfortable submitting this.

413
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,717
I think the response is thorough.

414
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:41,337
It's adequate.

415
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:48,700
It backs up all the relevant points, which are that the Reddit post in question contained no open meeting law violation.

416
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,302
I will indulge myself to say that as an elected, as the named party in the complaint,

417
00:49:54,915 --> 00:50:18,536
I am fully aware and respectful of the fact that the things that I say might not always be popular, but I know that always doesn't necessarily equate with a rule or regulation being broken, and I appreciate having legal clarity around the difference between those two things and the attorney's attention to detail in helping us articulate what the Reddit posts, what my Reddit posts did and did not include.

418
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:28,210
forward a motion to acknowledge the complaint and approve this draft response after my fellow counselors have had time to review and ask any questions that they might have.

419
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:44,260
And I have more I could say on the topic, but I think that the top lines are, you know, for myself as an elected, when I first gained office, I immediately researched the open meeting law to make sure that I understood it, understood the parameters, the point of open meeting law.

420
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:53,741
is to ensure that all issues of public import that are before a public body only ever take place among a quorum of that body in public session.

421
00:50:53,761 --> 00:51:01,504
And that's so that the community can be there whenever a quorum of that body is debating things that are important to the community, things that are public matters.

422
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:03,285
I take that really seriously.

423
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:04,525
I think it's a really important rule.

424
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:09,527
We have open meetings for a reason, and those conversations should happen in open meetings.

425
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:12,007
I do these Reddit posts to be informative.

426
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:22,090
Community members have asked me to do them because I think it is understandably really hard to keep up with the nuts and bolts of what's going on in City Council and elsewhere in City Hall.

427
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:29,092
And that was the intent of these Reddit posts, continues to be to just be informative, to share these on a popular online platform that people use.

428
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:34,263
not to be a forum for debate amongst members of the body.

429
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:43,045
And, you know, of course, I appreciate, you know, the opportunity for a legal mind to take a look and say, I confirm there is no deliberation.

430
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:44,266
That's never my intent.

431
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:49,467
And that has never been the case in the post that I have been sharing on Reddit.

432
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:54,388
So thank you, Attorney Austin and my fellow counselors for their time in considering this.

433
00:51:55,387 --> 00:51:56,388
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

434
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:57,109
No, thank you.

435
00:51:57,129 --> 00:52:08,621
So I think this is the process that... No, you... Sorry, this is the... So I think that the process we're seeing is on point.

436
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:09,141
I think that...

437
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:14,280
you know, I personally didn't see any violations myself.

438
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:24,584
And I think that this is just an example for our newer counselors that voted against legal response for my question from last couple of weeks.

439
00:52:25,384 --> 00:52:30,306
What that triggers now is the public asking for

440
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:48,595
their opinion okay so what happens is so I did reach out to legal opinion just just point of information that it's because we have absence of a city solicitor I it shouldn't be a motion it's just a request the administration so it doesn't need it doesn't need um

441
00:52:49,555 --> 00:52:53,739
a passing of the council if a sitting member of this council asks for a legal opinion.

442
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:02,066
So that'll be brought up again and I'll just ask the questions that I had at our previous meeting with any legal questions.

443
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:03,747
I think that's the process that works.

444
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:08,891
Unfortunately, what we're seeing is the lack of a city solicitor really hinders a lot of issues.

445
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:09,512
I think that, again,

446
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:24,244
This situation will be handled by a city solicitor, and we probably wouldn't have to pay more money to a outside law firm to rule on this, which is pretty self-explanatory.

447
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:27,266
So I'm glad it worked out.

448
00:53:27,646 --> 00:53:34,252
And again, just a point of information that's gonna be down the line.

449
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:38,075
I think that's important that we know as a council, if you have a question legally,

450
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:42,278
you could just refer it to the city administration to get legal opinion.

451
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:43,119
Thank you.

452
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:48,683
Yes, and any councillors welcome to send legal questions to me and I can forward them to the administration.

453
00:53:50,825 --> 00:54:07,098
On the motion of Councillor Collins to acknowledge receipt of the open meeting law complaint to accept this draft response as drafted, and I'm happy to be the final work with the Attorney Austin if that's part of the motion as well.

454
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:12,653
All right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan after, we have a second on that motion from Councilor Stanton.

455
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:13,134
Councilor Callahan.

456
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:15,155
Oh, okay, got it.

457
00:54:16,395 --> 00:54:25,240
All right, on that motion, essentially to say that there was no open meeting law violation, no remedial action is necessary, and we will submit this to the Division of Open Government.

458
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:27,581
All those in favor?

459
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:28,102
Aye.

460
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:28,802
Opposed?

461
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:29,602
Motion passes.

462
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:29,642
24-100.

463
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:31,764
Give me one second here.

00:54:41,297 --> 00:54:50,964

00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:23,102
So we will return to open session once that is concluded.

493
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,489
Awesome.

494
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,521
Motion to reconvene by Vice President.

495
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,141
We don't need a motion?

496
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:02,362
Let's just be careful.

497
00:57:02,522 --> 00:57:04,562
Motion to reconvene by Vice President Collins, seconded by?

Opposed?

501
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:08,924

Opposed?

507
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:30,544

Petition is here tonight.

514
00:58:05,518 --> 00:58:06,498
Okay, we- Good evening.

515
00:58:06,698 --> 00:58:07,459
Good evening.

516
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:08,759
Thank you for waiting.

517
00:58:08,859 --> 00:58:10,459
Yeah, we appreciate that.

518
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:16,201
So now, taking over the existing business that's there, are you changing ownership or?

519
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:19,542
No, I own finance out of body.

520
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:23,823
I just want to edit auto-sell used cars.

521
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:31,725
So that's why I want to edit class two and auto-sell used cars.

522
00:58:33,035 --> 00:58:36,197
to the my business out of finance out of body.

523
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:39,699
So, so this is your existing business?

524
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,340
Yes.

525
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,701
And you just want to?

526
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:46,804
And you want to add a license for auto sales cars?

527
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:48,545
Do you want to sell cars?

528
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:50,146
Yes.

529
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:52,148
This wasn't clear.

530
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:55,610
So I think that that is there a lot there?

531
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,170
Is there?

532
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,032
I don't see that there's a lot.

533
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:03,213
at that location where you can just you can, you can show the cars, is it?

534
00:59:05,215 --> 00:59:06,997
I just want to sell a couple cars.

535
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:12,924
I don't want to get a big cars just to keep the business busy with the other body.

536
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:15,787
And a couple cars.

537
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,271
Yeah, we have a space in the building.

538
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:21,616
where are you gonna store these?

539
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:32,581
You have to help me understand that your auto body shop doesn't have any exterior parking for display of used cars.

540
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,382
Yes, we do.

541
00:59:35,523 --> 00:59:35,763
Where?

542
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,105
The 26th Street.

543
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:41,086
So we have two buildings.

544
00:59:41,146 --> 00:59:45,368
We have 81th Street and then we have 26th Street.

545
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:51,071
That's not clear, Mr. President.

546
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:56,575
That's, you know, I think your petition's a little misleading.

547
00:59:56,615 --> 01:00:03,561
That's why it's a little, when I looked, I looked at the address of 26 R Mystic.

548
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:04,181
Yes.

549
01:00:04,321 --> 01:00:05,762
That's an auto body shop.

550
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:06,543
Yes.

551
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,304
Right, but it's a side street.

552
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:11,907
Yes, it's behind the street.

553
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:18,673
Right, so I don't, there isn't, what I'm saying is, you're saying now there's another address that you bring your used cars?

554
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,409
No, the same others.

555
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:27,431
So.

556
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:41,874
As I did my research and what I saw is that I didn't see that, so I would have to see what I could do here.

557
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:47,175
I looked at Google Maps and I drew by, so I'm trying to figure out where.

558
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,780
I have Google Maps open right now.

559
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,300
I could share.

560
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,221
Yeah, I was trying to pull it up.

561
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:56,901
Give me a second.

562
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:59,623
Yeah, I think that's so.

563
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,245
I'm going to pull it up on the screen.

564
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:05,247
Right, if you can, because I don't see parking there.

565
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:07,508
I don't see a lot.

566
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:13,252
And the biggest issue we have in those areas are parking.

567
01:01:13,772 --> 01:01:16,074
And whenever, you know,

568
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:22,823
just to the fact that overflow from auto body shops park their cars temporarily on the street.

569
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:23,724
I can understand that.

570
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:33,469
I don't want to affect that business, but if you're putting in placing used car there and just sitting there, you know, and on the street, I can't, I couldn't support that.

571
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:34,350
Yeah.

572
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:35,891
Could you point out, this is the map.

573
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:37,431
Can you see the map on the screen up here?

574
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:40,593
This is 26R.

575
01:01:40,753 --> 01:01:42,234
This is your frontage here.

576
01:01:42,254 --> 01:01:43,395
Where would the cars be parked?

577
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,101
The parks will be parked in the building, inside the building.

578
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:49,482
Inside this building?

579
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:49,942
Yes.

580
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:50,722
Okay.

581
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:52,663
So what do you do in the building?

582
01:01:53,863 --> 01:01:55,404
That's an auto body building inside.

583
01:01:56,404 --> 01:02:01,726
Yes, but we have a big location and I don't use the whole building to auto body.

584
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,821
That's why I'm asking to try to sell a couple cars.

585
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:08,602
So you would have room inside the building for how many vehicles?

586
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:09,803
Like four.

587
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:14,245
We have a space for like 40 vehicles in the whole thing.

588
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:18,147
But I need a space for, so I got like three, four cars.

589
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:29,484
Yeah, if I can, I think instead of wasting time, what I do is I'd like to maybe send the code enforcement officer and ask them to go visit that, because I don't see it.

590
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:34,227
I think if you're doing business for auto body, you need the indoor space for auto body.

591
01:02:37,448 --> 01:02:42,911
That means if you're gonna take spots inside, where are you gonna move the cars that you're working on?

592
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:44,211
Outside, right?

593
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:45,692
No, inside.

594
01:02:47,404 --> 01:02:48,684
I do have Director Hunt here.

595
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:50,045
I'm going to recognize Director Hunt.

596
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:55,406
Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning Development Sustainability.

597
01:02:56,226 --> 01:02:56,846
Good evening.

598
01:02:57,446 --> 01:02:58,706
Thank you, Council President.

599
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:06,368
I just also, I would personally recommend that you would want to table this as Councilor Scarpelli is mentioning.

600
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:13,789
Also, because I do not believe that this use is allowed as of right by the, I didn't have a chance to pull up the zoning this evening.

601
01:03:14,938 --> 01:03:28,338
see this on the agenda I apologize in advance, but for the zoning changes that were made last fall, all the auto body uses are by special permit, and so it would need to go through a special permit process.

602
01:03:29,207 --> 01:03:31,309
in order to be considered at this location.

603
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:38,974
And I'm just saying that off the cuff, and I would actually want to check the zoning and check the rules in order to be certain of that.

604
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:44,959
But I'd hate to see you approve something inappropriately without us doing the proper due diligence on it.

605
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,302
Yeah, I just don't want to deny it, if we don't know enough.

606
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:56,447
So if we can table it till May 28 meeting or enough time for everybody to do their due diligence.

607
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:06,881
The clerk has said to me that I believe he concurs with Alicia Hunt that it's a special permit.

608
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:07,482
Right.

609
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:12,285
It's certainly going to need more research on this and may need a special permit.

610
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:18,128
If Director Hunt is saying it needs a special permit, then I'm going to defer to her, but we're going to do some research on our end.

611
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:19,229
Yes, I table this.

612
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:19,849
All right.

613
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:20,610
Vice President Collins.

614
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:26,680
I was going to make a similar motion to table or convene in planning and permitting to determine.

615
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,280
The clerk has also suggested a June 11th.

616
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:33,941
Because if it's a special permit, it's going to need to be advertising butters and it's going to need to be notified.

617
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:36,022
Maybe after we start doing the process.

618
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:37,182
Councilor Lemming.

619
01:04:38,862 --> 01:04:46,024
Director Hahn, just for clarification, what board would grant the special permit?

620
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:48,784
Would it be this one or the Community Development Board?

621
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:51,705
Or where would they get that?

622
01:04:52,737 --> 01:05:00,462
Um, that's what I need a few minutes to look up because some of the, um, auto bottle uses were set to be.

623
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:08,186
It's a used it's a special permit for use and some were set to be city council.

624
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:17,491
Some are city board and some are board of appeals and I need to actually check the tables to see which 1 I feel confident though that.

625
01:05:18,737 --> 01:05:24,904
clerk her to bees and my staff can connect on this and figure out what the process should be.

626
01:05:25,445 --> 01:05:29,229
But I have high confidence that we're going to need to advertise a public hearing.

627
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:30,510
That's why you need more time.

628
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:34,475
Because if it's a public hearing, it requires two weeks notice in the paper.

629
01:05:35,076 --> 01:05:37,038
So that's why you can't table it for too soon.

630
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,563
Council President, I also have an additional question.

631
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:46,549
Just to clarify on a point that was brought up by Councillor Scarpelli.

632
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:54,199
So he stated that if there's room that's taken up to display cars, the four cars that you intend to sell, there will be less

633
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:59,562
space that would be used to repair the cars or to work on them.

634
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:02,524
What are your thoughts on this?

635
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:10,749
Are you just not using that space within your shop right now to fix cars or what's the space currently being used for?

636
01:06:12,364 --> 01:06:17,927
That's separate, and behind the building, it's in the same building, but it's empty.

637
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,468
I don't use it for a body show right now.

638
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:25,911
The space we use for a body show, we don't touch it.

639
01:06:26,753 --> 01:06:31,536
Okay, so you don't use the space that you're proposing to use to display cars for anything, correct?

640
01:06:31,596 --> 01:06:33,477
Yeah, that's empty right now.

641
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:35,539
Okay, just to clarify that part.

642
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:40,662
I think, if I could, it sounds like we're going to need some more time on our end.

643
01:06:40,862 --> 01:06:41,662
We're going to probably need

644
01:06:42,663 --> 01:06:52,351
some coordination again to speak with the city clerk's office and the planning office to make sure that we go through the right process and get you the right permit that you need.

645
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:58,456
One thing that could probably help us with that too, if you could bring maybe some pictures of the space or send some pictures of the space

646
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:26,466
to the planning department and the clerk and that could be included in the packet that we could see where you plan to put the vehicles that you're not using it now where you know just a little bit of a picture so we can understand because yeah you know you're there a lot you know how flood you know the roads are covered with cars yeah yeah thank you appreciate that so um you know i think there's a motion right now to table uh to june 11th um sorry for the delay on that um but yeah if you could take some photos and if you could communicate with our city clerk

647
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:35,153
and our planning department, and Councilor Scarpelli maybe, I don't know if you could, whichever one of you has a business card, if you could share that.

648
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,635
He's been working with Annie in her office.

649
01:07:36,655 --> 01:07:45,783
Okay, and the clerk's office, you've been working with Annie Kelly, Ann Marie Kelly, I think their number's 781-393-2425 as well.

650
01:07:46,803 --> 01:07:51,087
But there's a motion on the floor to table till June 11th by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by

651
01:07:52,128 --> 01:07:53,169
Vice President Collins.

652
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:58,212
So we'll try to get all this worked out behind the scenes and hopefully have you back June 11th.

653
01:07:58,272 --> 01:07:58,553
Okay.

654
01:07:59,093 --> 01:08:00,114
Thank you.

655
01:08:00,194 --> 01:08:01,234
All right.

656
01:08:01,715 --> 01:08:02,415
On the motion.

657
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:03,596
All those in favor.

658
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:04,697
Opposed.

659
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:05,477
Motion passes.

660
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:10,581
Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

661
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:11,462

01:08:11,482 --> 01:08:12,402
Opposed.

663
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:13,343

The public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council on Tuesday, May 14th, 2024.

The annual action plan contains the proposed use of community development block grant funds for the program year, which extends from July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.

670
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:51,651
The Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability

676
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:40,852
And we did receive revised figures as we discussed this at our committee of the whole meeting last week, there was actually an increase of $131,239 from the awarded by HUD through CDBG to the city of Medford.

677
01:09:46,258 --> 01:10:05,104
We had the presentation by our public service agencies and we do have attached here the adjustments to the public service agencies, an increase of four, $500 for the community family, our buddy Palin center, an increase of $10,000 for Megan transport LLC, an increase of $2000 for the senior center, an increase of.

$185 for the Bedford Public Schools, $5,000 for SCM Community Transportation, $1,000 for the Welcome Project, and $1,000 for the West Bedford Community Center.

679
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:25,634
We do have Laurel Siegel and Director Hunt on.

680
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:31,816
And I will recognize Laurel now if there's anything else you'd like to add to this before we open the public hearing.

681
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,277
Thank you for the presentation.

682
01:10:35,117 --> 01:10:36,777
I don't have anything further to add.

683
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:38,658
I think you were pretty thorough, but I appreciate it.

684
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:40,829
Thank you.

685
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,932
So I'll go to Vice President Collins and I'll open the public hearing.

686
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:46,214
Oh, you can open it first.

687
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:46,914
No, you should go.

688
01:10:47,294 --> 01:10:47,915
Great, thank you.

689
01:10:48,976 --> 01:10:51,618
Thank you, Laurel, for being on the call tonight.

690
01:10:51,698 --> 01:11:00,665
Last Wednesday in Committee of the Whole, we had a more detailed presentation about all of the proposals for how to allocate our block grant funding for the year.

691
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:04,328
And it's great to see that that number has increased a little bit.

692
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:06,550
None of the final figures have been released.

693
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:19,955
I know for myself as one councilor, I really appreciated the detail into what that grant funding is doing in our community this year and hearing about some of the previous grantees just building on and continuing the work that they do in our community.

694
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:25,097
And most of that work is directed at serving the neediest and most marginalized members of our community.

695
01:11:26,137 --> 01:11:29,118
It's always great to hear about how those funds are getting spent.

696
01:11:29,138 --> 01:11:32,980
So I know we have to open the hearing, but I would motion to approve.

697
01:11:34,268 --> 01:11:43,333
motion of vice president cons to approve the motion to authorize the action plan seconded by Councilor Sir Kelly.

698
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:46,055
First, I need to open the public hearing.

699
01:11:46,075 --> 01:11:53,178
So I want to open the public hearing to anyone in favor, opposed or otherwise to this position, please raise your hand on zoom or come to the podium in person.

700
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:56,580
Let us know what you think of this action plan.

701
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,501
So public hearing is open.

702
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:01,563
Laurel, I'm guessing that the city is in favor.

703
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:03,981
That is correct, thank you.

704
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:05,182
Great.

705
01:12:06,282 --> 01:12:12,784
Anyone else who'd like to comment on this public hearing on program year 50 of the community development block grant annual action plan?

706
01:12:19,646 --> 01:12:21,646
Seeing none, the public hearing is closed.

707
01:12:21,786 --> 01:12:26,788
On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

708
01:12:37,762 --> 01:12:38,702
Councilor Callahan, yes.

709
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:40,543
Vice President Collins.

710
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:40,723
Yes.

711
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:41,944
Councilors are.

712
01:12:42,084 --> 01:12:42,264
Yes.

713
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:43,284
Councilor lemon.

714
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:43,645
Yes.

715
01:12:44,105 --> 01:12:44,825
Councilor Scarpelli.

716
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:45,125
Yes.

717
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:46,206
Councilor saying yes.

718
01:12:46,426 --> 01:12:46,986
President bears.

719
01:12:47,006 --> 01:12:47,246
Yes.

720
01:12:47,686 --> 01:12:49,327
Negative the motion passes.

721
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:50,548
Thank you, Laurel.

722
01:12:50,588 --> 01:12:51,328
Thank you, Dr. Hunt.

723
01:12:51,428 --> 01:12:57,851
Thank you to all of our applicants and recipients for CDBG funds for the 50th year of CDBG.

724
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:04,652
24068, Picky's Pizza, 165 Main Street, special permit for hours, continued.

725
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:08,815
Legal notice, their own Medford City Clerk's Office notice of a public hearing, Medford City Council.

726
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:17,721
Public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council and the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, City Hall 85, George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA on April 30, 2024 at 7pm, assumed to be posted no later than Friday, April 26, 2024.

727
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:41,472
on a petition from CS Properties, LLC, DBA Pinky's Famous Pizza, 165 Main Street, Medford, MA 02155 for a special permit to amend its hours of operation in accordance with the Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94-7.2.1, to operate extended hours of its business, 165 Main Street, Medford, MA 02155, said site being located in Apartment 1, District as follows.

728
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:45,174
Extended hours of operation requested, Monday to Thursday, 11 p.m.

729
01:13:45,194 --> 01:13:47,334
to 1 a.m., Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 11 p.m.

730
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:47,635
to 2 a.m.

731
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:55,105
and plan may be seen in the office of the City Clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford MA, call 781-393-2425 for any aids and accommodations.

732
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,308
The City of Medford is an EEOA 504 employer.

733
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:00,033
By order of the City Council, Adam Milner to the City Clerk.

734
01:14:01,744 --> 01:14:05,307
So we have this continued from our April 30th meeting.

735
01:14:05,327 --> 01:14:10,650
We had several communications from residents who were concerned about changes to the hours.

736
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:16,535
I believe the petitioner was able to speak with the chair of licensing, permitting and science subcommittee, Councillor Scarpelli.

737
01:14:17,175 --> 01:14:19,537
And I do believe they are present here on the call.

738
01:14:19,837 --> 01:14:20,577
I see them here.

739
01:14:21,438 --> 01:14:26,942
So I will turn it over to Councillor Scarpelli, and then I'll turn it over to the petitioner to see if there's an amendment to the request.

740
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:27,882
Councilor Scarpa.

741
01:14:27,942 --> 01:14:29,023
Thank you, Mr. President.

742
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:35,326
I did have one of the other pieces that we wanted to have a meeting with the code enforcement officer.

743
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:49,654
He reported back to us that there has been no issues or concerns in that neighborhood surrounding Pinky's for any of their business issues that have been fine.

744
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,055
So that was one of the concerns.

745
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:55,097
I did talk to the owner and

746
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:02,526
I made some recommendations after talking with the neighbors, and again, this is their decision.

747
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:09,732
So I leave it to the owner to give us an idea of what they might be looking at, and then we can move from there, Mr. President.

748
01:15:10,193 --> 01:15:10,433
Great.

749
01:15:10,493 --> 01:15:11,674
The council recognized Ms.

750
01:15:11,714 --> 01:15:18,199
Carr from Pinky's Famous Pizza to share if there's been any changes to your request to the council.

751
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:42,274
hello so um um first of all i'm sorry i couldn't be there personally i actually have a scheduled delivery for baby tomorrow so my doctor was just stay home today so i was like i'll just attend via zoom i hope you guys can see me and hear me yes we can see you and thank you for being here we totally understand

752
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:43,370
No problem.

753
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:53,018
So yes, I did talk to the counselor and I understand I don't want to step on anyone's toes in the neighbor, you know, neighbors.

754
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:55,400
I understand, you know, it could be loud and stuff.

755
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:58,943
We were thinking that the drivers don't really stay there for too long.

756
01:16:00,144 --> 01:16:03,307
Even Uber and, you know, DoorDash, they have a time limit

757
01:16:03,587 --> 01:16:06,428
like five to 10 minutes, they need to quickly grab the orders and leave.

758
01:16:06,588 --> 01:16:14,972
But I understand there are other complaints from other businesses that Uber eats, drivers don't really listen because we don't really have control over them.

759
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:25,877
So I was suggested maybe we could do right now, Monday to Thursday till 11, which is right now, that's what it is.

760
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:30,019
For weekends, maybe we could just do 12 a.m.

761
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:31,160
instead of one or two.

762
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:42,777
And maybe in future, if we could have our own drivers instead of doing business with the companies, which we would like anyways, because they take a lot of percentage from us anyways.

763
01:16:43,538 --> 01:16:53,227
So for now, if we can get approval till 12am for weekends, like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Friday, Saturday, at least, that would be also big help.

764
01:16:55,037 --> 01:17:05,206
All right, so the petitioner has amended the proposal to just have this be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, extended from 11 to 12 a.m.

765
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,629
So let's reflect that in the record.

766
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:09,650
Mr. Clerk, you got it?

767
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,572
Is there any discussion by members of the council before I open it up?

768
01:17:13,992 --> 01:17:16,233
I think I know that we've been talking with the neighbors.

769
01:17:16,253 --> 01:17:17,673
I don't know if they're on right now.

770
01:17:17,693 --> 01:17:23,216
Yeah, I'll ask if there's any, well, if I just could go to the council, then I'll open the public hearing.

771
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:26,898
Any questions by members of the council?

772
01:17:27,078 --> 01:17:29,139
Vice President Collins, and then Council Member.

773
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:29,999
Thank you.

774
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:30,779
Yeah, I don't have a question.

775
01:17:30,799 --> 01:17:32,940
I just wanted to say I appreciate the flexibility on this.

776
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,701
I think that this is a

777
01:17:35,114 --> 01:17:45,601
very reasonable proposal, and I appreciate that the petitioner was willing to have conversations with Councilor Scarpelli, Throat Enforcement, and the neighbors to come back with something that I hope will indeed help your business.

778
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:52,666
Also, maybe some of those neighbor concerns just because of the behavior of delivery drivers as we're in the city.

779
01:17:52,986 --> 01:17:53,266
Thank you.

780
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:54,447
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

781
01:17:55,404 --> 01:18:02,569
Yeah, I would also just like to say, I go to Pinky's a good amount here and there.

782
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:12,295
What I do like about it is the fact that they do have a temporary parking spot just off Summer Street that's right in front of the store.

783
01:18:12,415 --> 01:18:23,143
So just the idea that drivers would just come there really quickly, get pizza, and then go back with very little fuss makes a lot of sense to me visually.

784
01:18:23,223 --> 01:18:25,124
So I could see that, but obviously,

785
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:34,227
hear from the neighbors and the houses directly surrounding there, but you know, y'all make very good pizza.

786
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:34,628
Thank you.

787
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:40,190
Thank you.

788
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:45,632
Yes, really thank you for not just your flexibility, but your creativity.

789
01:18:46,212 --> 01:18:51,294
And I'm excited for you to explore having your own drivers where I think you can keep

790
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:57,602
more of the proceeds here in the city of Medford amongst you and your employees as well.

791
01:18:57,682 --> 01:19:01,684
So I love the creativity of that idea and thank you so much for that as well.

792
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:04,445
Thank you.

793
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:14,249
I would know that the neighbors we talked about either two or three days appreciate the petitioner working with us.

794
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:16,350
What we did decide is that

795
01:19:17,315 --> 01:19:19,436
We'll do a 30-day, 60-day review.

796
01:19:19,976 --> 01:19:35,242
And then what the neighbors did ask, because Tufts might be their number one, that we just ask the code enforcement office, when school's back in session, to maybe take a closer look at that area and making sure that the process is fine.

797
01:19:35,862 --> 01:19:37,063
But I'd like to hear from the neighbors.

798
01:19:37,123 --> 01:19:39,524
I think this is a good compromise.

799
01:19:40,684 --> 01:19:43,288
I yell to the neighbors.

800
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:44,651
All right, we'll open up the public hearing.

801
01:19:45,091 --> 01:19:54,265
Last thing I'll say is my first job in Medford was a pizza delivery driver, and I'm pretty sure I was making more than what they're paying out of DoorDash and GrubHub, and that was... Definitely.

802
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:00,641
So I appreciate the idea of bringing this back here as good local jobs.

803
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:07,203
So yeah, I'm going to open, well, the public hearing has been open and we continued it from the last meeting.

804
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:15,346
Is there anyone, the now amended proposal is to have extended hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday until midnight.

805
01:20:16,786 --> 01:20:22,188
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition or otherwise to this proposal?

806
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:28,663
I believe, Ms.

807
01:20:28,683 --> 01:20:30,204
Carter, you are in favor, correct?

808
01:20:31,144 --> 01:20:31,444
Yes.

809
01:20:32,405 --> 01:20:32,725
Great.

810
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:38,246
Anyone else who'd like to speak, raise your hand on Zoom, and I'll recognize you.

811
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,187
I see Mary.

812
01:20:39,227 --> 01:20:42,968
Mary, if you could provide your name and address for the record, please.

813
01:20:43,108 --> 01:20:44,448
I've just requested an unmute.

814
01:20:45,849 --> 01:20:54,531
Yes, my name is Mary Hayes-Doyle, and I am the owner of 170 Main Street, and I am opposing the extended hours.

815
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:58,477
think it is a compromise.

816
01:20:58,677 --> 01:21:00,699
I do have a problem with Sunday night till midnight.

817
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,762
But I have a prepared statement.

818
01:21:04,822 --> 01:21:06,843
I'm not sure everyone seems to have made up their mind.

819
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:09,485
So I'm not sure if I should read through it.

820
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:13,889
Okay, so I will read through it.

821
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:14,289
Thank you.

822
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:23,356
Members of the Medford City Council, I'm asking you to deny this request is located right in the middle of a densely populated block

823
01:21:24,364 --> 01:21:30,626
Unlike stores a few blocks closer to Medford Square, Pinky's is located in primarily a residential area.

824
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:40,390
I'm concerned about the noise after 11 o'clock that will be generated from the delivery services, which can be disruptive, especially between 11 o'clock and two o'clock.

825
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:48,553
As I mentioned in my prior letter to each of you, neighbors deserve to have a residential neighborhood be quiet and peaceful during the sleeping hours.

826
01:21:49,293 --> 01:21:51,894
In addition to my two family that will be impacted,

827
01:21:52,332 --> 01:21:57,816
There are dozens of other apartments in close proximity to Pinky's that will be directly impacted.

828
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:01,499
I'm not anti-business, I support Medford business.

829
01:22:02,499 --> 01:22:05,862
The last meeting you granted extended hours to Snappy Patty's.

830
01:22:06,582 --> 01:22:09,224
I agree in that situation, that was the right choice.

831
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:20,392
That establishment is located in West Medford Square in a business district, not nearly as congested as the area of Main Street where Pinky's is located.

832
01:22:23,164 --> 01:22:33,251
Another reason to support not extending Pinky's hours is that there are plenty of other pizza stores near Tufts that cater to students' late-night delivery.

833
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:41,156
Shouldn't the council be more concerned with the impact to the residents rather than the pizza shop in this situation?

834
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:43,637
Please deny the request.

835
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:48,100
The neighbors do not want this late-night, early-morning operation in our neighborhood.

836
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:55,158
I know that several of the neighbors sent emails to you.

837
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:59,402
Please show consideration to our working and elderly neighbors.

838
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:03,324
I think pinkies should keep their current hours.

839
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,446
Thank you for your consideration.

840
01:23:08,508 --> 01:23:09,449
Thank you for your comment.

841
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:14,493
Any further comment on this extended hours permit?

842
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:25,202
Oh, sorry, Vice President Collins, we do have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli.

843
01:23:25,262 --> 01:23:26,423
Were you going to comment or make a motion?

844
01:23:27,338 --> 01:23:34,140
All right, we have a motion from Councillor Scarpelli to approve with a 30 and 60 day review and also requesting the code enforcement.

845
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,621
So that would be code enforcement report back to us 30 days and 60 days of any complaints.

846
01:23:38,242 --> 01:23:42,803
And then also when school is back in, maybe we wanna set a date, maybe October 1.

847
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:49,865
Yeah, October 1 to get a quick, after the Tufts opens up, we say October 1 for another report.

848
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:54,467
And also report back October 1st of any complaints from the neighbours on the extended hours.

849
01:23:56,328 --> 01:24:07,314
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice-President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

850
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:09,941
Vice President Collins?

851
01:24:10,021 --> 01:24:10,201
Yes.

852
01:24:10,822 --> 01:24:11,722
Councillor Lazzaro?

853
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:12,282
Yes.

854
01:24:12,862 --> 01:24:13,422
Councillor Fletcher?

855
01:24:13,562 --> 01:24:13,823
Yes.

856
01:24:14,143 --> 01:24:14,883
Councillor Strudelli?

857
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:15,163
Yes.

858
01:24:15,743 --> 01:24:16,323
Councillor Sands?

859
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:16,503
Yes.

860
01:24:16,744 --> 01:24:17,284
President Bares?

861
01:24:17,404 --> 01:24:17,624
Yes.

862
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:19,664
I'm in favor of none negative, the motion passes.

863
01:24:20,325 --> 01:24:26,847
Thank you all for working through this process and look forward to getting it reviewed and implemented.

864
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:34,677
Next item is 24353, petition for a lodging house license, Tufts University.

865
01:24:34,697 --> 01:24:40,185
Petition for a lodging house license for Tufts University located at 28 Winthrop Street, Medford, MA 02155.

866
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:47,535
We have on file letter of compliance, state tax ID, workers' compensation, petition, treasurer, building department, fire department, police, traffic impact report.

867
01:24:48,157 --> 01:24:54,399
And the health department we have addressing the council, Rocco DiRico, government relations director, Tufts University, 14 Capen Street, Bedford MA 02155.

868
01:24:54,459 --> 01:25:00,341
Councilor Scarpelli, anything that you would like to say before we hear from Mr. DiRico?

869
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:08,344
I think Mr. DiRico is just an amazing individual, and anything he says is like diamonds flowing from my heart.

870
01:25:09,591 --> 01:25:10,271
from his tongue.

871
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:13,213
Well, we certainly would like some diamonds flowing.

872
01:25:13,433 --> 01:25:14,114
We welcome them.

873
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:16,555
And if you have $2.5 million, we need it.

874
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:22,398
That was a joke.

875
01:25:22,698 --> 01:25:24,159
Hey, there won't be any traffic tonight.

876
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:26,501
So, you know, thanks for bearing with us for a couple hours.

877
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:27,121
We appreciate it.

878
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:29,662
Thank you, Councilor President.

879
01:25:30,523 --> 01:25:36,826
And I really like to downplay expectations, Councilor Scarpelli.

880
01:25:36,866 --> 01:25:37,807
So thank you for

881
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:45,057
being that extremely difficult, but I do appreciate you guys hearing from us today.

882
01:25:45,118 --> 01:25:52,147
So we are here representing Tufts University, Rocker Dorico, 14 Capen Street, Medford.

883
01:25:54,269 --> 01:25:59,330
We have a lodging house license for 28 Winthrop Street.

884
01:26:00,811 --> 01:26:04,572
That property used to be called 24 Capon just so folks know.

885
01:26:06,252 --> 01:26:18,635
The Medford Fire Department, Engineering Department and other departments asked us to switch it to 28 Winthrop because the entrance is now on Winthrop Street and there's a 24 Capon Street extension.

886
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:20,756
So just to note the address change.

887
01:26:21,936 --> 01:26:26,378
Um, this project was approved by unanimously approved by the Community Development Board.

888
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:29,099
Um, and is now complete.

889
01:26:29,759 --> 01:26:35,041
Um, it's passed all the city inspections by all the relevant city departments.

890
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:40,563
Um, and we are now here to apply for a lodging house license, which is kind of the last step.

891
01:26:41,523 --> 01:26:46,325
This property is gonna house 28 undergraduates and one RA.

892
01:26:47,986 --> 01:26:52,608
It's part of our coho development in the Medford Hillside.

893
01:26:53,228 --> 01:27:01,271
And as part of that development, Tufts agrees to continue to pay property taxes on this property.

894
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:07,934
The other stipulations that we always agree to with these properties, there's gonna be one student per bedroom.

895
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:18,445
Each apartment's gonna have its own kitchen and living room, and students who live in these houses are required to park their car on campus should they bring a car to the university.

896
01:27:19,506 --> 01:27:22,509
I'm happy to answer any questions that the council may have.

897
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,313
Before we open the public hearing, Vice President Collins.

898
01:27:28,336 --> 01:27:29,838
Thank you for being here today.

899
01:27:29,898 --> 01:27:33,882
Appreciate you reaching out to members of the council last week to let us know this was coming.

900
01:27:35,444 --> 01:27:38,027
Just to paraphrase a lot of what you just presented.

901
01:27:39,525 --> 01:27:53,053
It's great to see a petition come before us, and we know that the building has already been renovated from, and as people know, I was a Tufts University student back in the day, so I've seen a lot of hovels on or near campus.

902
01:27:53,133 --> 01:28:01,559
It's great to see this one rehabilitated and densified, and that it's already gone through all the necessary procedures.

903
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:04,100
I think that's, as one counselor, that's what I like to see.

904
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:06,562
We appreciate Tufts investing in

905
01:28:07,278 --> 01:28:11,066
housing more tough students near or even better on campus.

906
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:14,854
So thank you so much for this bona fide good project.

907
01:28:14,995 --> 01:28:15,275
Thank you.

908
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:17,941
Motion to approve after we open the hearing.

909
01:28:18,533 --> 01:28:19,374
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

910
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:20,095
Councillor Seng.

911
01:28:20,415 --> 01:28:20,815
Thank you.

912
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:26,501
I, you know, being this age, I have a lot of friends who go to Tufts or who've recently gone to Tufts.

913
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:28,543
I also live just one block away.

914
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:37,712
And, you know, in a lot of conversations with Tufts students, one big thing that they really want is just more housing on campus, more on campus options.

915
01:28:38,453 --> 01:28:39,614
This is a path towards that.

916
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:41,396
This is that, actually.

917
01:28:42,597 --> 01:28:47,740
Furthermore, it helps our housing crisis when more students are housed on campus.

918
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:54,263
It's a win-win for everyone, really, for community members and for Tufts students and for Tufts University.

919
01:28:55,971 --> 01:28:58,292
So that's really important to consider.

920
01:28:58,392 --> 01:29:00,293
Generally, these are really good projects.

921
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:12,078
It's also part of the platform which I signed, the Med for People's platform, which talks about working with Tufts to get more on-campus housing.

922
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:16,300
And so I would happily second Vice President Collins' motion.

923
01:29:17,261 --> 01:29:17,881
Well, you're too late.

924
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:21,283
Councilor Scarpelli already did it.

925
01:29:21,303 --> 01:29:23,564
Any further discussion by members of the Council?

926
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:25,699
I just have a question, Rocco.

927
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,942
I don't have any community meeting tomorrow night, 630, 6 o'clock on zoom.

928
01:29:33,962 --> 01:29:34,142
Yep.

929
01:29:34,162 --> 01:29:39,544
You can sign up on our Facebook page or any of our social media channels.

930
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:39,644
Yep.

931
01:29:39,926 --> 01:29:42,327
Yeah, I saw that.

932
01:29:42,867 --> 01:29:44,207
At least five of us can't be there.

933
01:29:44,227 --> 01:29:45,947
We have a zoning meeting at the same time.

934
01:29:46,968 --> 01:29:49,428
I don't know if the other two folks who aren't on that committee can.

935
01:29:50,548 --> 01:29:51,689
But I did want to put that out there.

936
01:29:52,109 --> 01:29:53,769
I saw a lot of news about the housing.

937
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:59,530
And I saw something in Tufts Now about some new housing changes that are happening, trying to bring some more stuff on campus.

938
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:02,951
Is the dormitory on Boston Ave still happening?

939
01:30:03,669 --> 01:30:06,270
Yes, we are still moving forward with that.

940
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:14,475
I should say, too, that this is part of a larger housing plan in addition to doing 28 Winthrop Street.

941
01:30:14,555 --> 01:30:18,477
We also added a new dormitory on 29 Sawyer Avenue in Somerville.

942
01:30:19,117 --> 01:30:30,684
We're also renovating Blakely Hall, which when Councilor Collins was there, was the graduate dorm, but the neighborhood has kind of, the cities have indicated that they prefer having the undergraduates on campus.

943
01:30:31,204 --> 01:30:33,586
So we're converting that to an undergraduate dorm.

944
01:30:33,646 --> 01:30:37,428
So that'll be another 120 beds on campus for undergraduates.

945
01:30:38,429 --> 01:30:41,371
And the door, we're still committed to building a new dorm.

946
01:30:41,411 --> 01:30:44,773
We're still committed to building it on Boston Avenue.

947
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:50,777
The original design for the building, the costs have skyrocketed since we originally proposed it.

948
01:30:51,297 --> 01:30:56,480
So we're now just working through a variety of different options to figure out how to fund the project.

949
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,921
But we're still committed to building

950
01:30:59,322 --> 01:31:01,143
a large scale dorm on Boston Avenue.

951
01:31:01,604 --> 01:31:02,424
Okay.

952
01:31:02,484 --> 01:31:08,188
And how many units would be added on campus by, I don't know, whatever your timeline is.

953
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:09,108
I don't want to impose a date.

954
01:31:09,168 --> 01:31:11,250
Are you sure you have a date with a number attached to it?

955
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:12,110
Sure, yeah.

956
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:17,193
I don't want to give specific dates because everything has to go through permitting and construction timelines.

957
01:31:17,233 --> 01:31:22,457
What I will say is, you know, we're bringing on 75 new beds this year.

958
01:31:24,057 --> 01:31:28,078
will be 120 new beds next year.

959
01:31:28,758 --> 01:31:33,459
And then, you know, our original projections for the residence hall was 400 beds.

960
01:31:33,999 --> 01:31:36,000
So that would obviously be the biggest chunk.

961
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:43,301
And so we're hoping that this, the new version of that dorm will be at least 400 beds.

962
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:44,521
All right.

963
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:45,522
Thank you.

964
01:31:46,282 --> 01:31:47,002
Councilor Lazaro.

965
01:31:47,922 --> 01:31:52,243
How much will it cost for students to live on this building that we're approving today?

966
01:31:52,782 --> 01:31:53,662
That's a great question.

967
01:31:53,722 --> 01:32:09,827
I know that our housing rates start around 10,000 a year, I believe, for freshmen and sophomores, but as you get up, and because in these units you get your own bedroom, they cost more than the freshmen and sophomore dorms.

968
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:14,969
So I wanna say it's around 12 to 14, but I can get the council exact figures on that.

969
01:32:15,609 --> 01:32:16,890
And that's just for the time that,

970
01:32:18,663 --> 01:32:20,264
classes or concessions for the academic year.

971
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:21,224
That's correct.

972
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:29,948
So, you know, unlike living off, if you live off campus, you know, you have to do a 12 month lease on campuses, a nine month lease.

973
01:32:30,969 --> 01:32:31,249
Thank you.

974
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:33,610
Thank you.

975
01:32:34,531 --> 01:32:36,572
Any other questions, members of the council?

976
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,533
And I was, this is a petition on a public hearing, so I'm not opening a public hearing.

977
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:41,774
I just have one more question.

978
01:32:42,735 --> 01:32:47,257
Any chance Tufts would support the institutional master plan home rule petition?

979
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:50,416
We would not.

980
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:58,461
We are protected by the Dover Amendment, as you know, in Medford and Somerville.

981
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:15,513
And we do do things like community meetings to share our plans with the community, but we're opposed to a master plan just because of the restrictions it puts on our campus and what we've experienced in Boston where we are required to do an institutional master plan.

982
01:33:16,574 --> 01:33:21,676
we really just are constantly filing amendments to that and changing it and things like that.

983
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:31,101
So all the projects that we propose go through the same process that other projects go through, which is we go through the Community Development Board in the city of Medford to get approval for them.

984
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:32,741
Okay.

985
01:33:32,761 --> 01:33:34,942
Well, I hope someday you'll reconsider.

986
01:33:35,222 --> 01:33:36,363
Thank you for the honest answer.

987
01:33:37,883 --> 01:33:44,786
Any further discussion on the motion of Council Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

988
01:33:44,807 --> 01:33:45,727
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

989
01:33:47,637 --> 01:33:47,757
Yes.

990
01:33:47,777 --> 01:33:47,857
Yes.

991
01:33:47,877 --> 01:33:48,077
Yes.

992
01:33:48,358 --> 01:33:48,538
Yes.

993
01:33:49,438 --> 01:33:49,518
Yes.

994
01:33:49,538 --> 01:33:49,618
Yes.

995
01:33:49,638 --> 01:33:49,839
Thank you.

996
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:51,199
Thank you, Mr President.

997
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:51,720
Oh, is there.

998
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:55,182
I hope you already voted because

999
01:34:15,899 --> 01:34:16,219
It's 9.15.

1000
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,561
All right.

1001
01:34:20,581 --> 01:34:22,462
24.074, resolution review annual surveillance report.

1002
01:34:22,882 --> 01:34:25,904
Be it resolved that the Bedford City Council review the annual surveillance report.

1003
01:34:29,186 --> 01:34:29,706
Vice President Collins.

1004
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:32,229
Thank you.

1005
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:53,849
This was tabled from our last regular meeting because the report in the packet missed the crucial first two pages, which differentiated this report from a separate report, which was the annual surveillance report submitted by city agencies that use surveillance technology.

1006
01:34:54,844 --> 01:35:04,171
In contrast, this is the City Council's reporting requirement under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which passed in.

1007
01:35:05,851 --> 01:35:35,043
the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is

1008
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:41,047
We passed this somewhat proactively and that there isn't a lot of surveillance technology currently being used by the city.

1009
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:47,470
Um, at the time of the passage of the C cops ordinance, there's only one surveillance technology being used by the city.

1010
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:48,631
It was by the police department.

1011
01:35:48,651 --> 01:35:49,672
It's body worn cameras.

1012
01:35:50,312 --> 01:35:52,974
Um in hashing out the details of the ordinance in, um,

1013
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:10,746
We exempted body-worn cameras from some of the reporting requirements and oversight requirements and approval requirements to which all new surveillance technologies will be subject.

1014
01:36:12,948 --> 01:36:21,154
Other main things to know about the ordinance under it, if a new surveillance technology comes before the council, or if a new technology is proposed to be used, it will come before the council.

1015
01:36:21,687 --> 01:36:37,012
the council will discuss it, hold public meetings, ask questions about how much it will cost, what are the pros, what are the cons, what is the use for which this is being proposed, and then make a determination, do we approve this use, or do we deny it, or do we ask for changes to the proposed policy in order to approve it?

1016
01:36:38,253 --> 01:36:46,836
This annual public report is something that the city council owes to the community to say, in the preceding calendar year,

1017
01:36:47,316 --> 01:36:50,939
These are all the requests for new surveillance technology that were approved.

1018
01:36:50,959 --> 01:36:53,741
These are all the new requests for surveillance technology that were denied.

1019
01:36:54,221 --> 01:36:56,343
These are all the requests that we made changes to.

1020
01:36:57,043 --> 01:37:02,467
And here are all of the annual surveillance reports that we received from the departments that actually use them.

1021
01:37:02,847 --> 01:37:04,809
And that is why this report is so short.

1022
01:37:05,549 --> 01:37:07,310
because we made no approval in 2023.

1023
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:08,550
We made no approvals.

1024
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:09,491
We made no rejections.

1025
01:37:09,571 --> 01:37:18,894
We made no changes, and that is because the only surveillance technology being used in the city in 2023, which, in fact, was only for, I think, about three weeks in December, was the body-worn cameras.

1026
01:37:19,395 --> 01:37:27,938
And per the ordinance that we passed earlier that year, body-worn cameras are exempted from City Council approval process until 2028.

1027
01:37:27,998 --> 01:37:28,158
So

1028
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:45,065
This report just sums all of that up, and it also includes a copy of the annual surveillance report on body-worn cameras that the Medford Police Department submitted to us, and we discussed in a meeting of the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

1029
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:48,667
So that's the brief report that we're looking at.

1030
01:37:49,207 --> 01:37:49,507
Thank you.

1031
01:37:51,188 --> 01:37:51,508
Thank you.

1032
01:37:51,528 --> 01:37:57,592
On the motion of Vice President Collins to receive and place on file the annual surveillance report, seconded by Councilor Sang, any discussion?

1033
01:37:59,178 --> 01:38:00,539
Seeing none, all those in favor.

1034
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,762
Opposed motion passes.

1035
01:38:04,663 --> 01:38:07,866
I think this is you George.

1036
01:38:07,947 --> 01:38:12,271
Yes, 2324356 resolution to support work to ban equity theft state legislation be resolved.

1037
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:20,619
The city council sent a letter of support to our state legislators for their work being done to protect homeowners from unfair taxing practices by cities and towns and the work to ban equity theft legislation.

1038
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:28,498
Michael, what do you think of the practice of cities and towns taking the entire value of a home to recover tax debt that is less than the value of the property when homeowners fall behind in their property taxes?

1039
01:38:28,558 --> 01:38:31,459
Senate docket number 2129, filed January 20th, 2023.

1040
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:32,999
Councilor Scarpa.

1041
01:38:33,059 --> 01:38:33,800
Thank you, Mr. President.

1042
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:40,262
And this resolution comes up because of a conversation with a very educated constituent, and he's here tonight.

1043
01:38:42,023 --> 01:38:45,224
Guest on is, we had a discussion, we talked about

1044
01:38:46,204 --> 01:39:10,115
I did some reading, and you realize that the negative effect that this puts on, especially, I looked at the fact of a senior citizen that was having issues with their taxes, and then finding a way to get out of it by selling their home, and then coming back and taking,

1045
01:39:11,596 --> 01:39:13,717
the whole property instead of what is owed to them.

1046
01:39:13,777 --> 01:39:19,940
So I think that this is something this council should support and send some

1047
01:39:21,949 --> 01:39:26,351
ascended to state legislators for their understanding.

1048
01:39:26,411 --> 01:39:36,436
So I know that we had, after our council speak, I know that I'd like for a community member to come up and really give his professional opinion.

1049
01:39:36,776 --> 01:39:37,396
Sure, thank you.

1050
01:39:37,456 --> 01:39:40,137
And I brought this up with the treasurer, Collector Johnson, a couple of weeks ago.

1051
01:39:40,157 --> 01:39:42,398
And she said, we're not doing it.

1052
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:44,999
The city of Medford is not engaging in that practice currently.

1053
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:54,110
And yeah, definitely, I believe this legislation is a response to recent, or maybe not a response to, but parallel to recent court decisions outlawing the practice.

1054
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,273
So definitely makes sense to me.

1055
01:39:56,313 --> 01:39:59,598
I'll go to Councillor Lemming, then any other councillors, and then we'll open it up to the public.

1056
01:40:00,713 --> 01:40:21,883
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, so I, I do I do support this, this resolution, I did some googling on this prior to the meeting you know there were stories of homeowners falling behind on property tax payments the city seizing an entire house worth, you know, 400,000 plus dollars to pay off $150,000 debt just

1057
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,484
keeping the difference.

1058
01:40:25,544 --> 01:40:41,892
So my question has to do more with, so I couldn't find online, and this could just be a failure of Googling on my part, Senate docket number 2129, or the relevant bills in the state house that were supporting this.

1059
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:43,593
And I also would like to see a

1060
01:40:45,033 --> 01:40:50,214
It mentions here to send a letter to support our state legislators.

1061
01:40:50,274 --> 01:41:02,936
I would like to see a draft of that letter personally, or just some idea of the specific legislation in the state House and Senate, if there is any.

1062
01:41:06,777 --> 01:41:07,577
Great, Councilor Kalia?

1063
01:41:10,137 --> 01:41:11,398
I will try to find that.

1064
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:13,338
I did find the exact number, 2129.

1065
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:17,410
What's the number?

1066
01:41:17,731 --> 01:41:18,011
H4624.

1067
01:41:18,271 --> 01:41:27,659
And what was it reported out of?

1068
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:34,525
You said it was reported out of a committee?

1069
01:41:43,174 --> 01:41:46,755
If you're going to come up and talk about it, if you can share that in the public participation.

1070
01:41:47,276 --> 01:41:47,776
Great, thank you.

1071
01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:49,536
Councillor Kelly.

1072
01:41:50,897 --> 01:42:00,540
Yes, it was quite shocking to realize that it has been the practice of cities, at least has occasionally happened that they seize entire property.

1073
01:42:01,052 --> 01:42:09,400
for a small amount of debt and then keep the profits, keep the rest of what they sell that probably for the sins, utterly absurd.

1074
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:11,522
So I am in support.

1075
01:42:11,902 --> 01:42:19,689
I will say that as I was canvassing, I remember talking to someone who lived next door to a micro lot.

1076
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:34,620
that the city had appropriated from a, this was the story, so this is not verified, but this was from a resident saying that the micro lot between their house and their neighbor's house was something that the city had taken

1077
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:37,603
because of past due taxes.

1078
01:42:39,124 --> 01:42:49,572
And that it then was an eyesore filled with weeds and rats that worked with their nearby residents to try to come up with some sort of plan to purchase it from the city and the city refused.

1079
01:42:50,072 --> 01:42:56,377
So at some point in time, Medford had been taking portions of lots

1080
01:42:57,901 --> 01:43:00,102
to instead of back taxes.

1081
01:43:01,303 --> 01:43:17,693
And I will also say that even if I'm happy to hear that the court has now determined this is not lawful, but even if the city of Medford is not currently doing something, administrations change, and it is important that we ensure that this is not allowed to happen in the future.

1082
01:43:18,714 --> 01:43:19,975
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1083
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:21,996
And I will just add, you know,

1084
01:43:22,737 --> 01:43:46,358
It's a slightly different thing, and it is not, again, generally an issue in Medford, but the civil forfeiture issue in general is a huge issue of, you know, prior to any sort of legal determination, you know, and this fund, this basically funds county police departments in like Ohio and Tennessee, places, other places in this country, taking private property, people's personal property without the,

1085
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:50,960
without any really due process, other than that it's civil forfeiture.

1086
01:43:51,020 --> 01:44:00,623
So it kind of, to me, is a similar parallel, and certainly something that we don't want to be happening, and certainly something we don't want to be used as a revenue tool.

1087
01:44:01,143 --> 01:44:07,985
And right now, it's not the policy of the city, but obviously not something that we want as a state law or anything like that.

1088
01:44:08,065 --> 01:44:10,886
So with that, any further comments from members of the council?

1089
01:44:12,026 --> 01:44:13,887
Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

1090
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:15,107
First, we'll go to the podium.

1091
01:44:15,127 --> 01:44:16,968
Name and address for the record, please.

1092
01:44:17,008 --> 01:44:18,128
Then we have one hand on Zoom.

1093
01:44:21,749 --> 01:44:22,530
Thank you, Mr. President.

1094
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:24,652
Gaston Fiore, 61, Stignero.

1095
01:44:26,233 --> 01:44:29,516
Before I begin, I would like to cite my references.

1096
01:44:30,177 --> 01:44:37,643
Home equity theft in Massachusetts is the focus of federal lawsuit by Sean P. Murphy, the Boston Globe, January 25th, 2024.

1097
01:44:38,664 --> 01:44:45,570
Massachusetts rules that state's method of taking property for unpaid taxes is unconstitutional by Sean P. Murphy, the Boston Globe, April 21, 2024.

1098
01:44:47,612 --> 01:45:03,562
Stealing homes right out from under vulnerable owners is just wrong by the editorial board, the Boston Globe, May 3, 2024, and Violating the Spirit of America, Home Equity Theft in Massachusetts by Angela C. Erickson, Joshua Polk, and Killeen Gallagher, the Pacific Legal Foundation.

1099
01:45:05,447 --> 01:45:08,110
So first, let's define home equity theft.

1100
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:19,341
Home equity theft is the practice of cities and towns taking the entire value of a home to recover tax debt that is less than the value of the property when homeowners fall behind on the property taxes.

1101
01:45:20,002 --> 01:45:28,190
Most often, home equity theft involves people who have inherited real estate and own it without a mortgage but lack the income to pay the taxes.

1102
01:45:28,931 --> 01:45:37,108
In some instances, property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars is taken by municipalities when the amount owed in taxes is a small fraction of that.

1103
01:45:38,459 --> 01:45:49,242
Massachusetts, it's only one of a handful of states that presently allow local governments to take not only the taxes they're owed, plus interest and fees, but also the rest of the equity in properties.

1104
01:45:50,202 --> 01:45:53,083
Second, let's examine the legality of home equity theft.

1105
01:45:53,623 --> 01:46:05,746
In May 2023, the US Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that municipalities may sell a taxpayer's home to recover unpaid taxes, but they cannot size the remaining equity in the property.

1106
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:17,931
In Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota, the Supreme Court ruled that a tax taken by the county violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking private property without just compensation.

1107
01:46:19,195 --> 01:46:28,778
That ruling, while striking down the Minnesota law, said existing laws in other states may be constitutional if they provide a process for property owners to recover their equity.

1108
01:46:29,618 --> 01:46:33,059
Massachusetts law is mostly silent on the question of equity.

1109
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:42,282
And in the absence of an explicit prohibition, some municipalities have assumed the right to keep the full equity with few safeguards for property owners.

1110
01:46:43,322 --> 01:46:44,382
In April 2024, so very recently,

1111
01:46:46,556 --> 01:46:53,639
A Massachusetts court ruled that the way some municipalities pursue tax-taking cases against homeowners is unconstitutional.

1112
01:46:54,339 --> 01:47:04,224
Judge Michael Callan of Hampton Superior Court ruled that such practices violate Article 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in addition to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S.

1113
01:47:04,244 --> 01:47:04,784
Constitution.

1114
01:47:05,623 --> 01:47:23,932
Callan said, the state law used by municipalities in tax taking, known as Chapter 60, does not provide a recovery process and therefore is, quote, unconstitutional as applied in circumstances such as here, where the tax debt is less than the value of the property, end quote.

1115
01:47:25,233 --> 01:47:32,377
Callan also wrote that Chapter 60, quote, in its present form is untenable and requires legislative correction, end quote.

1116
01:47:33,663 --> 01:47:41,050
The decision by Judge Cannon, however, does not set a statewide precedent that is binding on other courts hearing similar cases.

1117
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:45,174
In other words, the courts cannot fix this except case by case.

1118
01:47:46,015 --> 01:47:51,200
As such, it is imperative that the state legislature enacts a bill that explicitly prohibits equity takings.

1119
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:56,005
Third, let's examine the work of the state legislature regarding home equity theft.

1120
01:47:57,261 --> 01:48:01,244
There are currently several pending bills at the legislature that would bar home equity theft.

1121
01:48:01,824 --> 01:48:13,854
State Senator Mark Montigny, with the support of a number of colleagues, has filed legislation, S1876, that would curtail the ability of municipalities or private firms to collect more of the homeowner's equity than is actually owed.

1122
01:48:14,614 --> 01:48:18,257
Senator Joe Comerford of Northampton has also filed legislation, S921,

1123
01:48:19,938 --> 01:48:27,985
And recently, the Legislature Joint Committee on Revenue is drafting its own bill, which has just become publicly available on May 9th, and that's H4624.

1124
01:48:28,065 --> 01:48:34,271
Fourth, let's examine some data on specific cases.

1125
01:48:35,351 --> 01:48:41,497
So let me quote some quantitative data from the article by Erickson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation.

1126
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:42,177
I'm quoting now.

1127
01:48:43,274 --> 01:48:52,343
Quote, Massachusetts homeowners subjected to tax foreclosure lose 87% of their home equity on average, nearly $260,000 per home.

1128
01:48:53,224 --> 01:49:02,172
In our study, that's a study by Erickson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation, of 31 Massachusetts localities representing one third of the state's population,

1129
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:09,857
The government foreclosed and sold 254 homes for tax debt from January 2014 through June 2020.

1130
01:49:11,138 --> 01:49:20,204
Massachusetts law allowed the taking of an estimated $60 million in equity above what these homeowners owed in property tax debt.

1131
01:49:21,204 --> 01:49:34,629
Another 154 homes were foreclosed for tax debts from January 2014 through December 2020 by a private investment company that purchased tax liens, the right to collect a tax debt from the state.

1132
01:49:35,369 --> 01:49:44,012
Massachusetts law allowed the taking of an estimated $37 million in equity above what these homeowners owed in property tax debt."

1133
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:52,915
Let me consider, and I'm close to being done, two specific cases taken from the two articles by Sean Murphy in the Boston Globe.

1134
01:49:54,116 --> 01:50:01,401
One specific case concerns Stephen Woodbridge, 62, who is reported as unemployed and living in subsidized housing.

1135
01:50:01,822 --> 01:50:04,324
In 2017, the city of Greenfield targeted Woodbridge's property.

1136
01:50:05,044 --> 01:50:11,307
The property totaled almost 20 acres, including a 10-room house, and had been in the Woodbridge family for 70 years.

1137
01:50:12,007 --> 01:50:14,789
The amount of unpaid taxes was a little less than $6,000.

1138
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:21,812
In 2021, the city succeeded in gaining legal ownership of Woodbridge's property.

1139
01:50:22,312 --> 01:50:27,755
Woodbridge was quickly evicted, and the city sold his house and six surrounding acres for $270,000 at auction.

1140
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:35,644
The city added the remainder 13 wooded acres to a continuous city-owned park without compensating him.

1141
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:51,534
The city reaped a cash profit of at least $220,000, this $270,000 sale price at auction, minus the $50,000 Woodbridge owing taxes, interest, and other costs accumulated while the tax taking case moved through the system.

1142
01:50:52,315 --> 01:51:00,297
Woodbridge's debt had ballooned almost tenfold since 2017 because he was charged fees for the city's attorneys plus 16% interest on his debt.

1143
01:51:03,178 --> 01:51:14,367
Another specific case concerns Ashley Mills, 26, who is reported as living with her two-year-old son and disabled mother in the home she inherited from her grandmother that is her only financial asset.

1144
01:51:15,528 --> 01:51:25,656
Mills first went into tax arrears in 2016, and a year later the city of Springfield began proxies against her on a debt of about $2,000, which included interest of 14%, later bumped up to 16%.

1145
01:51:29,938 --> 01:51:35,161
As of late 2023, the debt had ballooned to about $22,000, mostly due to the high interest.

1146
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:41,284
At that time, the asset value of Mills' property was $145,000, with a likely higher fair market value.

1147
01:51:41,864 --> 01:51:55,211
Had the tax taking been completed, the city of Springfield would have been free to sell Mills' former property at auction, resulting in a likely windfall for the city of at least $123,000, equal to the amount of equity Mills had in the property.

1148
01:51:56,111 --> 01:51:57,512
Finally, let's summarize.

1149
01:51:58,905 --> 01:52:01,369
Home equity theft is simply immoral.

1150
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:05,054
It's the perfect example of government overreach and abuse.

1151
01:52:05,796 --> 01:52:10,202
Let me quote from the article by Erikson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation.

1152
01:52:11,414 --> 01:52:20,878
Quote, while government has the power to collect and pay taxes from homeowners, no government has the right to take someone's home and its equity beyond what is owed.

1153
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:28,302
Both the United States and Massachusetts constitutions protect homeowners' rights to just compensation and freedom from excessive fines.

1154
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:33,644
Despite constitutional protections, a dozen states still sanction this kind of home equity theft.

1155
01:52:33,964 --> 01:52:39,007
Massachusetts homeowners desperately need reform of the unconstitutional tax foreclosure law.

1156
01:52:39,775 --> 01:52:51,217
Massachusetts lawmakers can lead that reform by protecting the equity homeowners have in their homes, despite their tax delinquency, and by ensuring that tax foreclosed homes are sold for fair market value, end quote.

1157
01:52:52,117 --> 01:52:56,138
Home equity theft can and must be barred by legislation.

1158
01:52:56,378 --> 01:53:02,299
I strongly encourage the city council to write a letter to the state legislature in support of its work to bar home equity theft.

1159
01:53:02,579 --> 01:53:03,139
Thank you very much.

1160
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:05,540
Thank you.

1161
01:53:07,048 --> 01:53:10,270
I'm going to go to Mr. Castaneda on Zoom.

1162
01:53:10,411 --> 01:53:11,912
Name and address for the record, please.

1163
01:53:14,093 --> 01:53:17,876
Thank you, Councilor Beers, Andrew Castaneda, Method, Massachusetts.

1164
01:53:19,297 --> 01:53:20,858
I appreciate your time.

1165
01:53:20,958 --> 01:53:21,299
Thank you.

1166
01:53:21,559 --> 01:53:22,079
Can you hear me?

1167
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,782
We can hear you, and thank you for being here.

1168
01:53:26,562 --> 01:53:26,963
Thank you.

1169
01:53:27,523 --> 01:53:35,389
I want to thank Councilor George Scott Pelley for putting this on the agenda to support our state legislators who are finally

1170
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:37,872
trying to fix this problem.

1171
01:53:37,892 --> 01:53:40,714
I am more than appalled.

1172
01:53:40,794 --> 01:53:43,857
I am totally shocked when I heard about this.

1173
01:53:44,097 --> 01:53:45,658
It's a travesty of justice.

1174
01:53:45,878 --> 01:53:48,980
It's an injustice against the real estate owner.

1175
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:53,364
I can't believe that Carl Malter Massachusetts would allow the 351 cities and towns to

1176
01:53:57,916 --> 01:54:03,638
basically take by domain for non payment or real estate taxes and water bills, etc.

1177
01:54:04,298 --> 01:54:07,899
and sell the house somehow and pocket the difference.

1178
01:54:08,419 --> 01:54:10,460
I mean, this is terrible.

1179
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,500
It's grand theft.

1180
01:54:12,961 --> 01:54:26,865
Furthermore, if I had the power, I will also have the cities and towns, they should and they must pay treble damages with interest to the x owners or

1181
01:54:27,907 --> 01:54:29,849
The ears, period.

1182
01:54:39,216 --> 01:54:40,236
Thank you Mr Cassanetti.

1183
01:54:46,821 --> 01:54:48,082
It appears you may have frozen.

1184
01:54:51,345 --> 01:54:52,846
Are you, are you done Mr Cassanetti?

1185
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:55,308
Yes I'm done, thank you.

1186
01:54:55,328 --> 01:54:56,569
All right, thank you.

1187
01:54:59,557 --> 01:55:00,458
Any further discussion?

1188
01:55:00,478 --> 01:55:08,723
On the motion by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins, is there an amendment to change the number to H4624?

1189
01:55:09,103 --> 01:55:19,809
On the motion by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Collins, as amended by Councillor Collins, to change the number to H4624.

1190
01:55:22,895 --> 01:55:23,876
Mr. Clerk, I'm sorry.

1191
01:55:23,996 --> 01:55:24,497
All those in favor?

1192
01:55:25,077 --> 01:55:25,598
I oppose.

1193
01:55:25,678 --> 01:55:26,318
Motion passes.

1194
01:55:26,879 --> 01:55:32,224
I skipped over 24354, Resolution Authorize Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee to publish City Council Newsletter.

1195
01:55:32,825 --> 01:55:39,792
Sponsored by Councilor Lemming and myself, be it resolved by the Medford City Council, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, shall I have the authority to draft and approve a regular newsletter.

1196
01:55:40,273 --> 01:55:47,377
summarizing the activities of the council and can vote to publish the newsletter about our mechanisms available without referring the draft newsletter to a regular council meeting for a vote.

1197
01:55:47,937 --> 01:55:52,180
For the result of this paper be referred to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee as a standing agenda item.

1198
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,220
Councilor Lemming.

1199
01:55:53,941 --> 01:55:54,341
Thank you.

1200
01:55:54,561 --> 01:56:03,566
This is basically a resolution to address some of the concerns brought up at the last council meeting.

1201
01:56:03,866 --> 01:56:05,387
The idea behind this is pretty simple.

1202
01:56:05,427 --> 01:56:08,849
We've discussed the newsletter very extensively and

1203
01:56:09,449 --> 01:56:14,213
regular council so far and the resident services public engagement committee meeting.

1204
01:56:14,253 --> 01:56:25,961
The idea behind this is basically just to have it as an agenda item during those meetings in which we plan to draft and finalize and release the newsletter.

1205
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:32,846
So I would motion to send this to the resident services and public to reverse to the resident services and public engagement committee.

1206
01:56:33,339 --> 01:56:38,808
Motion to approve and refer to resident services and public engagement by Councillor Lemming, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1207
01:56:38,828 --> 01:56:47,261
And I'll just add, yes, I mean, I think, you know, absent an authorization, for example, we, you know, we don't have to do it every term because it

1208
01:56:47,762 --> 01:56:48,383
carries over.

1209
01:56:49,944 --> 01:56:55,789
Subcommittee on licensing, permitting, and signs looks at things before they come to the regular council.

1210
01:56:56,209 --> 01:57:03,035
We've authorized subcommittees and committees in the past to take action without having to come back to the council.

1211
01:57:03,456 --> 01:57:06,038
So those are things that happen.

1212
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:08,180
But it does have to be on paper.

1213
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,601
If it's not, then

1214
01:57:11,222 --> 01:57:16,924
Everything that gets reported in the committee is to come back out of committee, and generally that's true for almost every item anyway.

1215
01:57:17,324 --> 01:57:27,628
This is a communication, you know, we've authorized committees to look at, you know, inviting people to have conversations or go out and look at different sites in the past.

1216
01:57:29,168 --> 01:57:38,812
But, you know, outside of those kind of more investigatory and communicative things, anything that hasn't processed by ordinance or resolution or something else obviously needs a vote by the full council before it goes into effect.

1217
01:57:38,852 --> 01:57:40,492
So we're taking a vote tonight.

1218
01:57:40,552 --> 01:57:46,254
We'll see if it passes to authorize the committee to send those communications.

1219
01:57:46,474 --> 01:57:50,656
On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang, any further discussion?

1220
01:57:52,633 --> 01:57:53,114
I'll be brief.

1221
01:57:53,274 --> 01:57:57,596
I just wanted to thank you, Councilor Lohmann, President Bares for putting this on the agenda.

1222
01:57:57,896 --> 01:58:05,339
This is something that Councilor Lohmann and I have been working really, really hard on, given the demand from the public to hear from us about the work that we're doing.

1223
01:58:06,219 --> 01:58:06,580
You know, we've

1224
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:29,992
put in a lot of guardrails to make sure that this is a transparent the creation of this newsletter is transparent and it's neutral um content wise um this goes you know going through the resident services subcommittee there are five eyes looking over it um it makes sense for that given time and but also the process that we're already putting into it makes sense for that um committee to be approving it um instead of

1225
01:58:30,612 --> 01:58:41,698
you know, sending it here, dragging it out more weeks, and then re-litigating like typos and small things potentially in the group of seven when we already have a group of five that can do that job.

1226
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:46,841
And I will note that the two people who are not members of that committee are myself and Vice President Collins.

1227
01:58:48,122 --> 01:58:49,502
On the motion, all those in favor?

1228
01:58:50,063 --> 01:58:54,125
Opposed?

1229
01:58:55,306 --> 01:58:56,026
Motion passes.

1230
01:59:00,694 --> 01:59:02,435
Do you want to be marked as a no?

1231
01:59:02,556 --> 01:59:02,856
Sure.

1232
01:59:03,036 --> 01:59:03,356
OK.

1233
01:59:03,376 --> 01:59:03,636
Why not?

1234
01:59:03,997 --> 01:59:04,277
OK.

1235
01:59:04,937 --> 01:59:05,438
Be consistent.

1236
01:59:05,698 --> 01:59:06,299
The clerk asked.

1237
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:09,121
I'm sorry, clerk.

1238
01:59:09,501 --> 01:59:10,242
If he hadn't asked.

1239
01:59:10,282 --> 01:59:10,542
Meow.

1240
01:59:11,123 --> 01:59:12,223
One second.

1241
01:59:12,324 --> 01:59:13,204
One second here.

1242
01:59:13,224 --> 01:59:13,424
Meow.

1243
01:59:13,444 --> 01:59:13,805
6X1, meow.

1244
01:59:13,825 --> 01:59:16,327
The motion is approved.

1245
01:59:26,685 --> 01:59:28,388
Oh, all right.

1246
01:59:28,448 --> 01:59:29,970
Well, no.

1247
01:59:32,553 --> 01:59:33,254
No meows.

1248
01:59:33,655 --> 01:59:34,896
It's yes or no here.

1249
01:59:34,916 --> 01:59:34,956
No.

1250
01:59:38,218 --> 01:59:41,779
Okay, here we have one present for a compromise public comment.

1251
01:59:42,339 --> 01:59:45,040
Public comment email Norman Kaplan leaf blower ordinance.

1252
01:59:45,621 --> 01:59:47,001
I'd like to go on the record as follows.

1253
01:59:47,641 --> 01:59:52,863
You don't send the fire department to put out 50% of the fire but unfortunately that's what the city council is doing.

1254
01:59:53,323 --> 02:00:01,186
As I stated after midnight at the tortured city council meeting in March with evidence to prove it battery powered leaf blowers have reached velocity levels comparable to gas versions.

1255
02:00:01,926 --> 02:00:06,008
In time, and likely soon, the battery models will become even more powerful.

1256
02:00:06,048 --> 02:00:10,390
Here's an example of the progress in battery technology.

1257
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:13,551
The 2024 gas-powered Honda Civic goes 0 to 60 in 9.2 seconds.

1258
02:00:14,131 --> 02:00:17,633
The Nissan LEAF all-electric 2024 goes in 6.7 seconds.

1259
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:19,614
See motortrend.com.

1260
02:00:20,094 --> 02:00:21,014
Want to go faster?

1261
02:00:21,074 --> 02:00:26,897
Jump into the all-new electric Porsche Macan, which takes a mere 3.1 seconds, compared to the gas variant at 4.1 seconds.

1262
02:00:27,897 --> 02:00:30,978
see Danielle's column in the April 25th 2024 Wall Street Journal.

1263
02:00:31,418 --> 02:00:36,859
Congratulations certainly to the city council for finally curbing and eventually eliminating the toxic emissions from gas leaf blowers.

1264
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:50,463
But why on earth has the council elected to do nothing to seasonally restrict, let alone eliminate the year-round dispersal of dirt, dust, animal feces, mold, fungi, pollens, pesticides, herbicides, and heavy metals which can linger in the air for hours after a powerful battery-operated blower has been turned off?

1265
02:00:50,563 --> 02:00:55,264
If you wouldn't drink a glass of water with any of that stuff in it, I don't know why you would want to inhale it either.

1266
02:00:55,424 --> 02:00:56,685
Norman Kaplan, 23, Headland Way.

1267
02:00:59,406 --> 02:01:02,253
Is there any further public comment in the council chamber on Zoom?

1268
02:01:02,534 --> 02:01:05,080
I will go to the podium.

1269
02:01:05,321 --> 02:01:08,429
Name and address for the record, please, and also raise your hand on Zoom.

1270
02:01:08,814 --> 02:01:10,996
Thank you, Mr. President, Gaston Fury 61, Stingley Road.

1271
02:01:11,036 --> 02:01:13,178
I just had a question for clarification.

1272
02:01:13,739 --> 02:01:20,646
When Mr. DiRico spoke, I know he mentioned something about property taxes, but unfortunately I couldn't catch it.

1273
02:01:20,746 --> 02:01:30,676
So I was wondering what is the real estate tax rate that TAFs is gonna pay for this lodging, if that's known?

1274
02:01:31,161 --> 02:01:33,803
I believe the answer for this lodging is zero.

1275
02:01:34,143 --> 02:01:38,846
No, no, they're paying property taxes.

1276
02:01:40,007 --> 02:01:44,190
They're paying property taxes on it?

1277
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:44,350
Yes.

1278
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,570
Okay.

1279
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:47,392
The same rate as all residents, homeowners, sorry.

1280
02:01:47,992 --> 02:01:49,673
Thank you, thank you.

1281
02:01:49,853 --> 02:01:51,254
Okay, all right, sorry, I missed that.

1282
02:01:51,494 --> 02:01:53,896
Apparently it'll be assessed and taxed at the standard residential rate.

1283
02:01:54,236 --> 02:01:56,217
Okay, great, thank you so much, appreciate it.

1284
02:01:56,257 --> 02:01:56,598
Thank you.

1285
02:01:57,998 --> 02:01:58,519
A happy note.

1286
02:01:59,977 --> 02:02:01,297
Councilor Calihan.

1287
02:02:01,678 --> 02:02:05,999
On the motion of Councilor Calihan to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Seng.

1288
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:07,960
I don't think I missed anything.

1289
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:09,961
All right.

1290
02:02:10,561 --> 02:02:11,161
All those in favor?

1291
02:02:11,181 --> 02:02:11,641
All right.

1292
02:02:11,821 --> 02:02:12,201
Opposed?

1293
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:12,802
Motion passes.

1294
02:02:12,822 --> 02:02:13,402
Meeting is adjourned.
