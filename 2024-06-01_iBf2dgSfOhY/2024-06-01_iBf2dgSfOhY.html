    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2328.594s">I</a>  would like to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee mainly because that primarily covers Veterans Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2334.9s">I've</a>  also invited over the Veterans Services Director, Veronica Shaw, for this, but essentially this is a paper that would allow the Veterans Services Director to establish a program <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2350.262s">under</a>  which she may offer monetary incentives to landlords who choose to rent out to qualified veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2360.564s">I've</a>  been asking KP Law for legal advice around this, as well as talking with the city's chief of staff around this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2370.667s">So</a>  yeah, I would motion to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.</p>

So I think that the process we're seeing is on point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3128.681s">I</a>  think that... <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3130.799s">you</a>  know, I personally didn't see any violations myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3134.34s">And</a>  I think that this is just an example for our newer Councilors that voted against legal response for my question from last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3145.384s">What</a>  that triggers now is the public asking for <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3151.306s">their</a>  opinion okay so what happens is so I did reach out to legal opinion just just point of information that it's because we have absence of a city solicitor I it shouldn't be a motion it's just a request the administration so it doesn't need it doesn't need um <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3169.555s">a</a>  passing of the council if a sitting member of this council asks for a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3174.199s">So</a>  that'll be brought up again and I'll just ask the questions that I had at our previous meeting with any legal questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3182.466s">I</a>  think that's the process that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3183.787s">Unfortunately,</a>  what we're seeing is the lack of a city solicitor really hinders a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3188.911s">I</a>  think that, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3192.054s">This</a>  situation will be handled by a city solicitor, and we probably wouldn't have to pay more money to a outside law firm to rule on this, which is pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3204.304s">So</a>  I'm glad it worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3207.646s">And</a>  again, just a point of information that's gonna be down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3214.292s">I</a>  think that's important that we know as a council, if you have a question legally, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3218.735s">you</a>  could just refer it to the city administration to get legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3222.778s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3223.719s">Yes,</a>  and any councillors welcome to send legal questions to me and I can forward them to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3230.825s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to acknowledge receipt of the open meeting law complaint to accept this draft response as drafted, and I'm happy to be the final work with the Attorney Austin if that's part of the motion as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3248.151s">All</a>  right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan after, we have a second on that motion from Councilor Stanton. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3252.673s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3254.314s">Oh,</a>  okay, got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3256.395s">All</a>  right, on that motion, essentially to say that there was no open meeting law violation, no remedial action is necessary, and we will submit this to the Division of Open Government. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3266.941s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3267.601s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3268.402s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3268.862s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-100.pdf"><font color="green">24-100</font></a>.

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3660.523s">I'm</a>  going to pull it up on the screen.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3663.505s">Right,</a>  if you can, because I don't see parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3666.828s">I</a>  don't see a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3669.549s">And</a>  the biggest issue we have in those areas are parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3673.772s">And</a>  whenever, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3677.78s">just</a>  to the fact that overflow from auto body shops park their cars temporarily on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3682.883s">I</a>  can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3683.744s">I</a>  don't want to affect that business, but if you're putting in placing used car there and just sitting there, you know, and on the street, I can't, I couldn't support that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3694.21s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3694.37s">Could</a>  you point out, this is the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3695.911s">Can</a>  you see the map on the screen up here? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3697.451s">This</a>  is 26R. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3700.753s">This</a>  is your frontage here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3702.254s">Where</a>  would the cars be parked?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3704.78s">The</a>  parks will be parked in the building, inside the building.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3708.601s">Inside</a>  this building?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3709.622s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3710.382s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3711.322s">So</a>  what do you do in the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3713.863s">That's</a>  an auto body building inside.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3716.404s">Yes,</a>  but we have a big location and I don't use the whole building to auto body. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3722.639s">That's</a>  why I'm asking to try to sell a couple cars.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3725.961s">So</a>  you would have room inside the building for how many vehicles?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3729.042s">Like</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3730.363s">We</a>  have a space for like 40 vehicles in the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3735.145s">But</a>  I need a space for, so I got like three, four cars.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3740.1s">Yeah,</a>  if I can, I think instead of wasting time, what I do is I'd like to maybe send the code enforcement officer and ask them to go visit that, because I don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3750.225s">I</a>  think if you're doing business for auto body, you need the indoor space for auto body. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3757.448s">That</a>  means if you're gonna take spots inside, where are you gonna move the cars that you're working on? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3763.471s">Outside,</a>  right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3765.052s">No,</a>  inside.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3767.404s">I</a>  do have Director Hunt here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3768.704s">I'm</a>  going to recognize Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3773.085s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Planning Development Sustainability.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3776.226s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3777.446s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3779.226s">I</a>  just also, I would personally recommend that you would want to table this as Councilor Scarpelli is mentioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3786.948s">Also,</a>  because I do not believe that this use is allowed as of right by the, I didn't have a chance to pull up the zoning this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3794.938s">see</a>  this on the agenda I apologize in advance, but for the zoning changes that were made last fall, all the auto body uses are by special permit, and so it would need to go through a special permit process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3809.207s">in</a>  order to be considered at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3811.329s">And</a>  I'm just saying that off the cuff, and I would actually want to check the zoning and check the rules in order to be certain of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3819.014s">But</a>  I'd hate to see you approve something inappropriately without us doing the proper due diligence on it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3826.119s">Yeah,</a>  I just don't want to deny it, if we don't know enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3830.422s">So</a>  if we can table it till May 28 meeting or enough time for everybody to do their due diligence.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3840.017s">The</a>  clerk has said to me that I believe he concurs with Alicia Hunt that it's a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3847.282s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3848.562s">It's</a>  certainly going to need more research on this and may need a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3852.985s">If</a>  Director Hunt is saying it needs a special permit, then I'm going to defer to her, but we're going to do some research on our end. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3858.168s">Yes,</a>  I table this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3859.489s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3859.869s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3862.179s">I</a>  was going to make a similar motion to table or convene in planning and permitting to determine.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3866.7s">The</a>  clerk has also suggested a June 11th.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3869.761s">Because</a>  if it's a special permit, it's going to need to be advertising butters and it's going to need to be notified.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3874.181s">Maybe</a>  after we start doing the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3876.582s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3878.862s">Director</a>  Hahn, just for clarification, what board would grant the special permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3886.044s">Would</a>  it be this one or the Community Development Board? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3888.804s">Or</a>  where would they get that?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3892.737s">Um,</a>  that's what I need a few minutes to look up because some of the, um, auto bottle uses were set to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3900.482s">It's</a>  a used it's a special permit for use and some were set to be city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3908.246s">Some</a>  are city board and some are board of appeals and I need to actually check the tables to see which 1 I feel confident though that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3918.737s">clerk</a>  her to bees and my staff can connect on this and figure out what the process should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3925.445s">But</a>  I have high confidence that we're going to need to advertise a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3929.269s">That's</a>  why you need more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3931.011s">Because</a>  if it's a public hearing, it requires two weeks notice in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3935.076s">So</a>  that's why you can't table it for too soon.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3939.12s">Council</a>  President, I also have an additional question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3942.624s">Just</a>  to clarify on a point that was brought up by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3946.589s">So</a>  he stated that if there's room that's taken up to display cars, the four cars that you intend to sell, there will be less <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3954.919s">space</a>  that would be used to repair the cars or to work on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3960.683s">What</a>  are your thoughts on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3962.564s">Are</a>  you just not using that space within your shop right now to fix cars or what's the space currently being used for?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3972.364s">That's</a>  separate, and behind the building, it's in the same building, but it's empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3978.207s">I</a>  don't use it for a body show right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3981.248s">The</a>  space we use for a body show, we don't touch it.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3986.753s">Okay,</a>  so you don't use the space that you're proposing to use to display cars for anything, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3991.596s">Yeah,</a>  that's empty right now.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3993.737s">Okay,</a>  just to clarify that part.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3995.919s">I</a>  think, if I could, it sounds like we're going to need some more time on our end. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4000.862s">We're</a>  going to probably need <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4002.663s">some</a>  coordination again to speak with the city clerk's office and the planning office to make sure that we go through the right process and get you the right permit that you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4013.432s">One</a>  thing that could probably help us with that too, if you could bring maybe some pictures of the space or send some pictures of the space <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4019.116s">to</a>  the planning department and the clerk and that could be included in the packet that we could see where you plan to put the vehicles that you're not using it now where you know just a little bit of a picture so we can understand because yeah you know you're there a lot you know how flood you know the roads are covered with cars yeah yeah thank you appreciate that so um you know i think there's a motion right now to table uh to june 11th um sorry for the delay on that um but yeah if you could take some photos and if you could communicate with our city clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4047.086s">and</a>  our planning department, and Councilor Scarpelli maybe, I don't know if you could, whichever one of you has a business card, if you could share that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4055.233s">He's</a>  been working with Annie in her office.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4056.655s">Okay,</a>  and the clerk's office, you've been working with Annie Kelly, Ann Marie Kelly, I think their number's 781-393-2425 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4066.803s">But</a>  there's a motion on the floor to table till June 11th by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4072.128s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4074.25s">So</a>  we'll try to get all this worked out behind the scenes and hopefully have you back June 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4078.272s">Okay.</a> </p>

Hassett Drive, Medford MA on April 30, 2024 at 7pm, assumed to be posted no later than Friday, April 26, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4401.483s">on</a>  a petition from CS Properties, LLC, DBA Pinky's Famous Pizza, 165 Main Street, Medford, MA 02155 for a special permit to amend its hours of operation in accordance with the Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94-7.2.1, to operate extended hours of its business, 165 Main Street, Medford, MA 02155, said site being located in Apartment 1, District as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4421.552s">Extended</a>  hours of operation requested, Monday to Thursday, 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4425.194s">to</a>  1 a.m., Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4427.394s">to</a>  2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4428.675s">and</a>  plan may be seen in the office of the City Clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford MA, call 781-393-2425 for any aids and accommodations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4435.125s">The</a>  City of Medford is an EEOA 504 employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4437.849s">By</a>  order of the City Council, Adam Milner to the City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4441.744s">So</a>  we have this continued from our April 30th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4445.327s">We</a>  had several communications from residents who were concerned about changes to the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4451.431s">I</a>  believe the petitioner was able to speak with the chair of licensing, permitting and science subcommittee, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4457.175s">And</a>  I do believe they are present here on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4459.837s">I</a>  see them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4461.438s">So</a>  I will turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli, and then I'll turn it over to the petitioner to see if there's an amendment to the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4467.062s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4467.942s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4469.103s">I</a>  did have one of the other pieces that we wanted to have a meeting with the code enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4475.847s">He</a>  reported back to us that there has been no issues or concerns in that neighborhood surrounding Pinky's for any of their business issues that have been fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4490.174s">So</a>  that was one of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4492.135s">I</a>  did talk to the owner and <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4496.381s">I</a>  made some recommendations after talking with the neighbors, and again, this is their decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4502.967s">So</a>  I leave it to the owner to give us an idea of what they might be looking at, and then we can move from there, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4510.193s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4510.493s">The</a>  council recognized Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4511.714s">Carr</a>  from Pinky's Famous Pizza to share if there's been any changes to your request to the council.</p>

    <p>[Prabhjot Kaur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4523.889s">hello</a>  so um um first of all i'm sorry i couldn't be there personally i actually have a scheduled delivery for baby tomorrow so my doctor was just stay home today so i was like i'll just attend via zoom i hope you guys can see me and hear me yes we can see you and thank you for being here we totally understand <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4542.97s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4543.871s">So</a>  yes, I did talk to the Councilor and I understand I don't want to step on anyone's toes in the neighbor, you know, neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4553.078s">I</a>  understand, you know, it could be loud and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4555.681s">We</a>  were thinking that the drivers don't really stay there for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4560.144s">Even</a>  Uber and, you know, DoorDash, they have a time limit <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4563.587s">like</a>  five to 10 minutes, they need to quickly grab the orders and leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4566.588s">But</a>  I understand there are other complaints from other businesses that Uber eats, drivers don't really listen because we don't really have control over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4576.153s">So</a>  I was suggested maybe we could do right now, Monday to Thursday till 11, which is right now, that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4586.538s">For</a>  weekends, maybe we could just do 12 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4590.059s">instead</a>  of one or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4592.367s">And</a>  maybe in future, if we could have our own drivers instead of doing business with the companies, which we would like anyways, because they take a lot of percentage from us anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4603.538s">So</a>  for now, if we can get approval till 12am for weekends, like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Friday, Saturday, at least, that would be also big help.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4615.037s">All</a>  right, so the petitioner has amended the proposal to just have this be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, extended from 11 to 12 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4626.447s">So</a>  let's reflect that in the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4628.749s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, you got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4630.49s">Is</a>  there any discussion by members of the council before I open it up?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4633.992s">I</a>  think I know that we've been talking with the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4636.253s">I</a>  don't know if they're on right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4637.693s">Yeah,</a>  I'll ask if there's any, well, if I just could go to the council, then I'll open the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4643.816s">Any</a>  questions by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4647.078s">Vice</a>  President Collins, and then Council Member.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4649.699s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4650.039s">Yeah,</a>  I don't have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4650.799s">I</a>  just wanted to say I appreciate the flexibility on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4653.02s">I</a>  think that this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4655.114s">very</a>  reasonable proposal, and I appreciate that the petitioner was willing to have conversations with Councilor Scarpelli, Throat Enforcement, and the neighbors to come back with something that I hope will indeed help your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4666.061s">Also,</a>  maybe some of those neighbor concerns just because of the behavior of delivery drivers as we're in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4672.986s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4673.506s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4675.404s">Yeah,</a>  I would also just like to say, I go to Pinky's a good amount here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4682.929s">What</a>  I do like about it is the fact that they do have a temporary parking spot just off Summer Street that's right in front of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4692.415s">So</a>  just the idea that drivers would just come there really quickly, get pizza, and then go back with very little fuss makes a lot of sense to me visually. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4703.223s">So</a>  I could see that, but obviously, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4706.164s">hear</a>  from the neighbors and the houses directly surrounding there, but you know, y'all make very good pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4714.287s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4717.529s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4721.51s">Yes,</a>  really thank you for not just your flexibility, but your creativity. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4726.212s">And</a>  I'm excited for you to explore having your own drivers where I think you can keep <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4731.82s">more</a>  of the proceeds here in the city of Medford amongst you and your employees as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4737.682s">So</a>  I love the creativity of that idea and thank you so much for that as well.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4742.044s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4745.165s">I</a>  would know that the neighbors we talked about either two or three days appreciate the petitioner working with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4754.869s">What</a>  we did decide is that <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4757.315s">We'll</a>  do a 30-day, 60-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4759.976s">And</a>  then what the neighbors did ask, because Tufts might be their number one, that we just ask the code enforcement office, when school's back in session, to maybe take a closer look at that area and making sure that the process is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4775.862s">But</a>  I'd like to hear from the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4777.123s">I</a>  think this is a good compromise.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4780.684s">I</a>  yell to the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4783.389s">All</a>  right, we'll open up the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4785.091s">Last</a>  thing I'll say is my first job in Medford was a pizza delivery driver, and I'm pretty sure I was making more than what they're paying out of DoorDash and GrubHub, and that was... Definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4795.74s">So</a>  I appreciate the idea of bringing this back here as good local jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4800.922s">So</a>  yeah, I'm going to open, well, the public hearing has been open and we continued it from the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4807.844s">Is</a>  there anyone, the now amended proposal is to have extended hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday until midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4816.786s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to speak in favor, in opposition or otherwise to this proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4827.423s">I</a>  believe, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4828.683s">Carter,</a>  you are in favor, correct?</p>

    <p>[Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4831.144s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4832.405s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4833.785s">Anyone</a>  else who'd like to speak, raise your hand on Zoom, and I'll recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4838.266s">I</a>  see Mary. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4839.227s">Mary,</a>  if you could provide your name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4843.108s">I've</a>  just requested an unmute.</p>

    <p>[Mary Doyle]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4845.849s">Yes,</a>  my name is Mary Hayes-Doyle, and I am the owner of 170 Main Street, and I am opposing the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4857.216s">think</a>  it is a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4858.677s">I</a>  do have a problem with Sunday night till midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4863.06s">But</a>  I have a prepared statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4864.822s">I'm</a>  not sure everyone seems to have made up their mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4866.943s">So</a>  I'm not sure if I should read through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4869.505s">Okay,</a>  so I will read through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4873.949s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4875.09s">Members</a>  of the Medford City Council, I'm asking you to deny this request is located right in the middle of a densely populated block <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4884.364s">Unlike</a>  stores a few blocks closer to Medford Square, Pinky's is located in primarily a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4891.187s">I'm</a>  concerned about the noise after 11 o'clock that will be generated from the delivery services, which can be disruptive, especially between 11 o'clock and two o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4901.35s">As</a>  I mentioned in my prior letter to each of you, neighbors deserve to have a residential neighborhood be quiet and peaceful during the sleeping hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4909.293s">In</a>  addition to my two family that will be impacted, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4912.332s">There</a>  are dozens of other apartments in close proximity to Pinky's that will be directly impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4918.516s">I'm</a>  not anti-business, I support Medford business. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4922.499s">The</a>  last meeting you granted extended hours to Snappy Patty's. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4926.582s">I</a>  agree in that situation, that was the right choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4930.105s">That</a>  establishment is located in West Medford Square in a business district, not nearly as congested as the area of Main Street where Pinky's is located. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4943.164s">Another</a>  reason to support not extending Pinky's hours is that there are plenty of other pizza stores near Tufts that cater to students' late-night delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4954.511s">Shouldn't</a>  the council be more concerned with the impact to the residents rather than the pizza shop in this situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4962.337s">Please</a>  deny the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4963.898s">The</a>  neighbors do not want this late-night, early-morning operation in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4972.176s">I</a>  know that several of the neighbors sent emails to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4976.539s">Please</a>  show consideration to our working and elderly neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4981.043s">I</a>  think pinkies should keep their current hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4984.145s">Thank</a>  you for your consideration.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4988.508s">Thank</a>  you for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4990.21s">Any</a>  further comment on this extended hours permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5000.478s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Vice President Collins, we do have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5005.262s">Were</a>  you going to comment or make a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5007.338s">All</a>  right, we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve with a 30 and 60 day review and also requesting the code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5014.2s">So</a>  that would be code enforcement report back to us 30 days and 60 days of any complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5018.242s">And</a>  then also when school is back in, maybe we wanna set a date, maybe October 1.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5022.923s">Yeah,</a>  October 1 to get a quick, after the Tufts opens up, we say October 1 for another report.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5029.905s">And</a>  also report back October 1st of any complaints from the neighbours on the extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5036.328s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice-President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5110.311s">Well,</a>  we certainly would like some diamonds flowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5113.433s">We</a>  welcome them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5114.334s">And</a>  if you have $2.5 million, we need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5116.655s">That</a>  was a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5122.698s">Hey,</a>  there won't be any traffic tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5124.179s">So,</a>  you know, thanks for bearing with us for a couple hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5126.521s">We</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5127.541s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5130.523s">And</a>  I really like to downplay expectations, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5136.866s">So</a>  thank you for <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5138.729s">being</a>  that extremely difficult, but I do appreciate you guys hearing from us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5145.118s">So</a>  we are here representing Tufts University, Rocker Dorico, 14 Capen Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5154.269s">We</a>  have a lodging house license for 28 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5160.811s">That</a>  property used to be called 24 Capon just so folks know. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5166.252s">The</a>  Medford Fire Department, Engineering Department and other departments asked us to switch it to 28 Winthrop because the entrance is now on Winthrop Street and there's a 24 Capon Street extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5178.675s">So</a>  just to note the address change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5181.936s">Um,</a>  this project was approved by unanimously approved by the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5186.398s">Um,</a>  and is now complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5189.759s">Um,</a>  it's passed all the city inspections by all the relevant city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5196.261s">Um,</a>  and we are now here to apply for a lodging house license, which is kind of the last step. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5201.523s">This</a>  property is gonna house 28 undergraduates and one RA. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5207.986s">It's</a>  part of our coho development in the Medford Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5213.228s">And</a>  as part of that development, Tufts agrees to continue to pay property taxes on this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5221.291s">The</a>  other stipulations that we always agree to with these properties, there's gonna be one student per bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5228.474s">Each</a>  apartment's gonna have its own kitchen and living room, and students who live in these houses are required to park their car on campus should they bring a car to the university. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5239.506s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions that the council may have.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5242.529s">Before</a>  we open the public hearing, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5248.336s">Thank</a>  you for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5249.898s">Appreciate</a>  you reaching out to members of the council last week to let us know this was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5255.444s">Just</a>  to paraphrase a lot of what you just presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5259.525s">It's</a>  great to see a petition come before us, and we know that the building has already been renovated from, and as people know, I was a Tufts University student back in the day, so I've seen a lot of hovels on or near campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5273.133s">It's</a>  great to see this one rehabilitated and densified, and that it's already gone through all the necessary procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5281.579s">I</a>  think that's, as one Councilor, that's what I like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5285.181s">We</a>  appreciate Tufts investing in <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5287.278s">housing</a>  more tough students near or even better on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5291.086s">So</a>  thank you so much for this bona fide good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5294.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5296.037s">Motion</a>  to approve after we open the hearing.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5298.533s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5299.394s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5300.415s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5300.835s">I,</a>  you know, being this age, I have a lot of friends who go to Tufts or who've recently gone to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5306.521s">I</a>  also live just one block away. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5309.704s">And,</a>  you know, in a lot of conversations with Tufts students, one big thing that they really want is just more housing on campus, more on campus options. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5318.453s">This</a>  is a path towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5320.195s">This</a>  is that, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5322.597s">Furthermore,</a>  it helps our housing crisis when more students are housed on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5328.62s">It's</a>  a win-win for everyone, really, for community members and for Tufts students and for Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5335.971s">So</a>  that's really important to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5338.392s">Generally,</a>  these are really good projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5340.373s">It's</a>  also part of the platform which I signed, the Med for People's platform, which talks about working with Tufts to get more on-campus housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5352.279s">And</a>  so I would happily second Vice President Collins' motion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5357.261s">Well,</a>  you're too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5358.201s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli already did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5361.303s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5364.639s">I</a>  just have a question, Rocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5368.02s">I</a>  don't have any community meeting tomorrow night, 630, 6 o'clock on zoom.</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5373.962s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5374.162s">You</a>  can sign up on our Facebook page or any of our social media channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5379.564s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5379.926s">Yeah,</a>  I saw that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5382.867s">At</a>  least five of us can't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5384.227s">We</a>  have a zoning meeting at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5386.968s">I</a>  don't know if the other two folks who aren't on that committee can. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5390.548s">But</a>  I did want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5392.109s">I</a>  saw a lot of news about the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5394.529s">And</a>  I saw something in Tufts Now about some new housing changes that are happening, trying to bring some more stuff on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5400.33s">Is</a>  the dormitory on Boston Ave still happening?</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5403.669s">Yes,</a>  we are still moving forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5406.631s">I</a>  should say, too, that this is part of a larger housing plan in addition to doing 28 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5414.555s">We</a>  also added a new dormitory on 29 Sawyer Avenue in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5419.117s">We're</a>  also renovating Blakely Hall, which when Councilor Collins was there, was the graduate dorm, but the neighborhood has kind of, the cities have indicated that they prefer having the undergraduates on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5431.204s">So</a>  we're converting that to an undergraduate dorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5433.646s">So</a>  that'll be another 120 beds on campus for undergraduates. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5438.429s">And</a>  the door, we're still committed to building a new dorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5441.411s">We're</a>  still committed to building it on Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5445.073s">The</a>  original design for the building, the costs have skyrocketed since we originally proposed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5451.297s">So</a>  we're now just working through a variety of different options to figure out how to fund the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5456.58s">But</a>  we're still committed to building <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5459.322s">a</a>  large scale dorm on Boston Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5461.604s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5462.484s">And</a>  how many units would be added on campus by, I don't know, whatever your timeline is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5468.208s">I</a>  don't want to impose a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5469.168s">Are</a>  you sure you have a date with a number attached to it?</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5471.49s">Sure,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5472.13s">I</a>  don't want to give specific dates because everything has to go through permitting and construction timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5477.233s">What</a>  I will say is, you know, we're bringing on 75 new beds this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5484.057s">will</a>  be 120 new beds next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5488.758s">And</a>  then, you know, our original projections for the residence hall was 400 beds. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5493.999s">So</a>  that would obviously be the biggest chunk. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5498.06s">And</a>  so we're hoping that this, the new version of that dorm will be at least 400 beds. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5503.321s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5505.122s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5506.282s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5507.922s">How</a>  much will it cost for students to live on this building that we're approving today?</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5512.782s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5513.722s">I</a>  know that our housing rates start around 10,000 a year, I believe, for freshmen and sophomores, but as you get up, and because in these units you get your own bedroom, they cost more than the freshmen and sophomore dorms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5529.867s">So</a>  I wanna say it's around 12 to 14, but I can get the council exact figures on that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5535.609s">And</a>  that's just for the time that, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5538.663s">classes</a>  or concessions for the academic year.</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5540.644s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5541.244s">So,</a>  you know, unlike living off, if you live off campus, you know, you have to do a 12 month lease on campuses, a nine month lease.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5550.969s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5553.25s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5554.531s">Any</a>  other questions, members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5556.992s">And</a>  I was, this is a petition on a public hearing, so I'm not opening a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5560.454s">I</a>  just have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5562.735s">Any</a>  chance Tufts would support the institutional master plan home rule petition?</p>

    <p>[DiRico]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5569.215s">We</a>  would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5571.196s">We</a>  are protected by the Dover Amendment, as you know, in Medford and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5579.042s">And</a>  we do do things like community meetings to share our plans with the community, but we're opposed to a master plan just because of the restrictions it puts on our campus and what we've experienced in Boston where we are required to do an institutional master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5596.574s">we</a>  really just are constantly filing amendments to that and changing it and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5601.796s">So</a>  all the projects that we propose go through the same process that other projects go through, which is we go through the Community Development Board in the city of Medford to get approval for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5611.121s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5612.761s">Well,</a>  I hope someday you'll reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5615.222s">Thank</a>  you for the honest answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5617.883s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion of Council Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5624.807s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5671.869s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5674.451s">This</a>  was tabled from our last regular meeting because the report in the packet missed the crucial first two pages, which differentiated this report from a separate report, which was the annual surveillance report submitted by city agencies that use surveillance technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5694.844s">In</a>  contrast, this is the City Council's reporting requirement under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which passed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5705.851s">the</a>  city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is the city of Newark, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5735.443s">We</a>  passed this somewhat proactively and that there isn't a lot of surveillance technology currently being used by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5741.727s">Um,</a>  at the time of the passage of the C cops ordinance, there's only one surveillance technology being used by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5747.63s">It</a>  was by the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5748.651s">It's</a>  body worn cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5750.312s">Um</a>  in hashing out the details of the ordinance in, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5758.837s">We</a>  exempted body-worn cameras from some of the reporting requirements and oversight requirements and approval requirements to which all new surveillance technologies will be subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5772.948s">Other</a>  main things to know about the ordinance under it, if a new surveillance technology comes before the council, or if a new technology is proposed to be used, it will come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5781.687s">the</a>  council will discuss it, hold public meetings, ask questions about how much it will cost, what are the pros, what are the cons, what is the use for which this is being proposed, and then make a determination, do we approve this use, or do we deny it, or do we ask for changes to the proposed policy in order to approve it? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5798.253s">This</a>  annual public report is something that the city council owes to the community to say, in the preceding calendar year, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5807.316s">These</a>  are all the requests for new surveillance technology that were approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5810.959s">These</a>  are all the new requests for surveillance technology that were denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5814.221s">These</a>  are all the requests that we made changes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5817.043s">And</a>  here are all of the annual surveillance reports that we received from the departments that actually use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5822.847s">And</a>  that is why this report is so short. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5825.549s">because</a>  we made no approval in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5827.37s">We</a>  made no approvals. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5828.59s">We</a>  made no rejections. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5829.571s">We</a>  made no changes, and that is because the only surveillance technology being used in the city in 2023, which, in fact, was only for, I think, about three weeks in December, was the body-worn cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5839.395s">And</a>  per the ordinance that we passed earlier that year, body-worn cameras are exempted from City Council approval process until 2028. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5847.998s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5850.677s">This</a>  report just sums all of that up, and it also includes a copy of the annual surveillance report on body-worn cameras that the Medford Police Department submitted to us, and we discussed in a meeting of the Public Health and Community Safety Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5866.446s">So</a>  that's the brief report that we're looking at.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5871.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5871.528s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Collins to receive and place on file the annual surveillance report, seconded by Councilor Tseng, any discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5879.178s">Seeing</a>  none, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5881.24s">Opposed</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5884.663s">I</a>  think this is you George. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5887.947s">Yes,</a>  2324356 resolution to support work to ban equity theft state legislation be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5892.971s">The</a>  city council sent a letter of support to our state legislators for their work being done to protect homeowners from unfair taxing practices by cities and towns and the work to ban equity theft legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5901.155s">Michael,</a>  what do you think of the practice of cities and towns taking the entire value of a home to recover tax debt that is less than the value of the property when homeowners fall behind in their property taxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5908.558s">Senate</a>  docket number 2129, filed January 20th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5912.159s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5913.059s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5913.86s">And</a>  this resolution comes up because of a conversation with a very educated constituent, and he's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5922.023s">Guest</a>  on is, we had a discussion, we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5926.204s">I</a>  did some reading, and you realize that the negative effect that this puts on, especially, I looked at the fact of a senior citizen that was having issues with their taxes, and then finding a way to get out of it by selling their home, and then coming back and taking, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5951.596s">the</a>  whole property instead of what is owed to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5953.777s">So</a>  I think that this is something this council should support and send some <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5961.949s">ascended</a>  to state legislators for their understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5966.411s">So</a>  I know that we had, after our council speak, I know that I'd like for a community member to come up and really give his professional opinion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5976.776s">Sure,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5977.456s">And</a>  I brought this up with the treasurer, Collector Johnson, a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5980.157s">And</a>  she said, we're not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5982.458s">The</a>  city of Medford is not engaging in that practice currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5986.98s">And</a>  yeah, definitely, I believe this legislation is a response to recent, or maybe not a response to, but parallel to recent court decisions outlawing the practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5994.15s">So</a>  definitely makes sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=5996.313s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Leming, then any other councillors, and then we'll open it up to the public.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6000.713s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli, so I, I do I do support this, this resolution, I did some googling on this prior to the meeting you know there were stories of homeowners falling behind on property tax payments the city seizing an entire house worth, you know, 400,000 plus dollars to pay off $150,000 debt just <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6024.704s">keeping</a>  the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6025.544s">So</a>  my question has to do more with, so I couldn't find online, and this could just be a failure of Googling on my part, Senate docket number 2129, or the relevant bills in the state house that were supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6041.952s">And</a>  I also would like to see a <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6045.033s">It</a>  mentions here to send a letter to support our state legislators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6050.274s">I</a>  would like to see a draft of that letter personally, or just some idea of the specific legislation in the state House and Senate, if there is any.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6066.777s">Great,</a>  Councilor Kalia?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6070.137s">I</a>  will try to find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6071.598s">I</a>  did find the exact number, 2129.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6076.95s">What's</a>  the number? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6078.271s">And</a>  what was it reported out of? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6087.899s">You</a>  said it was reported out of a committee?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6103.174s">If</a>  you're going to come up and talk about it, if you can share that in the public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6107.276s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6107.796s">Councilor</a>  Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6110.897s">Yes,</a>  it was quite shocking to realize that it has been the practice of cities, at least has occasionally happened that they seize entire property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6121.052s">for</a>  a small amount of debt and then keep the profits, keep the rest of what they sell that probably for the sins, utterly absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6130.121s">So</a>  I am in support. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6131.902s">I</a>  will say that as I was canvassing, I remember talking to someone who lived next door to a micro lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6140.41s">that</a>  the city had appropriated from a, this was the story, so this is not verified, but this was from a resident saying that the micro lot between their house and their neighbor's house was something that the city had taken <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6155.701s">because</a>  of past due taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6159.124s">And</a>  that it then was an eyesore filled with weeds and rats that worked with their nearby residents to try to come up with some sort of plan to purchase it from the city and the city refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6170.072s">So</a>  at some point in time, Medford had been taking portions of lots <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6177.901s">to</a>  instead of back taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6181.303s">And</a>  I will also say that even if I'm happy to hear that the court has now determined this is not lawful, but even if the city of Medford is not currently doing something, administrations change, and it is important that we ensure that this is not allowed to happen in the future.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6198.714s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6200.235s">And</a>  I will just add, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6202.737s">It's</a>  a slightly different thing, and it is not, again, generally an issue in Medford, but the civil forfeiture issue in general is a huge issue of, you know, prior to any sort of legal determination, you know, and this fund, this basically funds county police departments in like Ohio and Tennessee, places, other places in this country, taking private property, people's personal property without the, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6228.319s">without</a>  any really due process, other than that it's civil forfeiture. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6231.02s">So</a>  it kind of, to me, is a similar parallel, and certainly something that we don't want to be happening, and certainly something we don't want to be used as a revenue tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6241.143s">And</a>  right now, it's not the policy of the city, but obviously not something that we want as a state law or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6248.065s">So</a>  with that, any further comments from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6252.026s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6254.067s">First,</a>  we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6255.127s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6257.008s">Then</a>  we have one hand on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6261.749s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6262.57s">Gaston</a>  Fiore, 61, Stignero. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6266.233s">Before</a>  I begin, I would like to cite my references. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6270.177s">Home</a>  equity theft in Massachusetts is the focus of federal lawsuit by Sean P. Murphy, the Boston Globe, January 25th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6278.664s">Massachusetts</a>  rules that state's method of taking property for unpaid taxes is unconstitutional by Sean P. Murphy, the Boston Globe, April 21, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6287.612s">Stealing</a>  homes right out from under vulnerable owners is just wrong by the editorial board, the Boston Globe, May 3, 2024, and Violating the Spirit of America, Home Equity Theft in Massachusetts by Angela C. Erickson, Joshua Polk, and Killeen Gallagher, the Pacific Legal Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6305.447s">So</a>  first, let's define home equity theft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6308.71s">Home</a>  equity theft is the practice of cities and towns taking the entire value of a home to recover tax debt that is less than the value of the property when homeowners fall behind on the property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6320.002s">Most</a>  often, home equity theft involves people who have inherited real estate and own it without a mortgage but lack the income to pay the taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6328.931s">In</a>  some instances, property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars is taken by municipalities when the amount owed in taxes is a small fraction of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6338.459s">Massachusetts,</a>  it's only one of a handful of states that presently allow local governments to take not only the taxes they're owed, plus interest and fees, but also the rest of the equity in properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6350.202s">Second,</a>  let's examine the legality of home equity theft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6353.623s">In</a>  May 2023, the US Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that municipalities may sell a taxpayer's home to recover unpaid taxes, but they cannot size the remaining equity in the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6366.526s">In</a>  Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota, the Supreme Court ruled that a tax taken by the county violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking private property without just compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6379.195s">That</a>  ruling, while striking down the Minnesota law, said existing laws in other states may be constitutional if they provide a process for property owners to recover their equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6389.618s">Massachusetts</a>  law is mostly silent on the question of equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6393.559s">And</a>  in the absence of an explicit prohibition, some municipalities have assumed the right to keep the full equity with few safeguards for property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6403.322s">In</a>  April 2024, so very recently, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6406.556s">A</a>  Massachusetts court ruled that the way some municipalities pursue tax-taking cases against homeowners is unconstitutional. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6414.339s">Judge</a>  Michael Callan of Hampton Superior Court ruled that such practices violate Article 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in addition to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6424.244s">Constitution.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6425.623s">Callan</a>  said, the state law used by municipalities in tax taking, known as Chapter 60, does not provide a recovery process and therefore is, quote, unconstitutional as applied in circumstances such as here, where the tax debt is less than the value of the property, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6445.233s">Callan</a>  also wrote that Chapter 60, quote, in its present form is untenable and requires legislative correction, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6453.663s">The</a>  decision by Judge Cannon, however, does not set a statewide precedent that is binding on other courts hearing similar cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6461.731s">In</a>  other words, the courts cannot fix this except case by case. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6466.015s">As</a>  such, it is imperative that the state legislature enacts a bill that explicitly prohibits equity takings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6472.181s">Third,</a>  let's examine the work of the state legislature regarding home equity theft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6477.261s">There</a>  are currently several pending bills at the legislature that would bar home equity theft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6481.824s">State</a>  Senator Mark Montigny, with the support of a number of colleagues, has filed legislation, S1876, that would curtail the ability of municipalities or private firms to collect more of the homeowner's equity than is actually owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6494.614s">Senator</a>  Joe Comerford of Northampton has also filed legislation, S921, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6499.938s">And</a>  recently, the Legislature Joint Committee on Revenue is drafting its own bill, which has just become publicly available on May 9th, and that's H4624. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6508.065s">Fourth,</a>  let's examine some data on specific cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6515.351s">So</a>  let me quote some quantitative data from the article by Erickson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6521.557s">I'm</a>  quoting now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6523.274s">Quote,</a>  Massachusetts homeowners subjected to tax foreclosure lose 87% of their home equity on average, nearly $260,000 per home. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6533.224s">In</a>  our study, that's a study by Erickson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation, of 31 Massachusetts localities representing one third of the state's population, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6542.833s">The</a>  government foreclosed and sold 254 homes for tax debt from January 2014 through June 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6551.138s">Massachusetts</a>  law allowed the taking of an estimated $60 million in equity above what these homeowners owed in property tax debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6561.204s">Another</a>  154 homes were foreclosed for tax debts from January 2014 through December 2020 by a private investment company that purchased tax liens, the right to collect a tax debt from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6575.369s">Massachusetts</a>  law allowed the taking of an estimated $37 million in equity above what these homeowners owed in property tax debt." <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6586.53s">Let</a>  me consider, and I'm close to being done, two specific cases taken from the two articles by Sean Murphy in the Boston Globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6594.116s">One</a>  specific case concerns Stephen Woodbridge, 62, who is reported as unemployed and living in subsidized housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6601.822s">In</a>  2017, the city of Greenfield targeted Woodbridge's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6605.044s">The</a>  property totaled almost 20 acres, including a 10-room house, and had been in the Woodbridge family for 70 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6612.007s">The</a>  amount of unpaid taxes was a little less than $6,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6617.45s">In</a>  2021, the city succeeded in gaining legal ownership of Woodbridge's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6622.312s">Woodbridge</a>  was quickly evicted, and the city sold his house and six surrounding acres for $270,000 at auction. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6630.416s">The</a>  city added the remainder 13 wooded acres to a continuous city-owned park without compensating him. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6637.15s">The</a>  city reaped a cash profit of at least $220,000, this $270,000 sale price at auction, minus the $50,000 Woodbridge owing taxes, interest, and other costs accumulated while the tax taking case moved through the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6652.315s">Woodbridge's</a>  debt had ballooned almost tenfold since 2017 because he was charged fees for the city's attorneys plus 16% interest on his debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6663.178s">Another</a>  specific case concerns Ashley Mills, 26, who is reported as living with her two-year-old son and disabled mother in the home she inherited from her grandmother that is her only financial asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6675.528s">Mills</a>  first went into tax arrears in 2016, and a year later the city of Springfield began proxies against her on a debt of about $2,000, which included interest of 14%, later bumped up to 16%. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6689.938s">As</a>  of late 2023, the debt had ballooned to about $22,000, mostly due to the high interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6695.821s">At</a>  that time, the asset value of Mills' property was $145,000, with a likely higher fair market value. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6701.864s">Had</a>  the tax taking been completed, the city of Springfield would have been free to sell Mills' former property at auction, resulting in a likely windfall for the city of at least $123,000, equal to the amount of equity Mills had in the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6716.111s">Finally,</a>  let's summarize. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6718.905s">Home</a>  equity theft is simply immoral. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6722.05s">It's</a>  the perfect example of government overreach and abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6725.796s">Let</a>  me quote from the article by Erikson, Polk, and Gallagher from the Pacific Legal Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6731.414s">Quote,</a>  while government has the power to collect and pay taxes from homeowners, no government has the right to take someone's home and its equity beyond what is owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6741.719s">Both</a>  the United States and Massachusetts constitutions protect homeowners' rights to just compensation and freedom from excessive fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6749.142s">Despite</a>  constitutional protections, a dozen states still sanction this kind of home equity theft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6753.964s">Massachusetts</a>  homeowners desperately need reform of the unconstitutional tax foreclosure law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6759.775s">Massachusetts</a>  lawmakers can lead that reform by protecting the equity homeowners have in their homes, despite their tax delinquency, and by ensuring that tax foreclosed homes are sold for fair market value, end quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6772.117s">Home</a>  equity theft can and must be barred by legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6776.378s">I</a>  strongly encourage the city council to write a letter to the state legislature in support of its work to bar home equity theft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6782.579s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>
