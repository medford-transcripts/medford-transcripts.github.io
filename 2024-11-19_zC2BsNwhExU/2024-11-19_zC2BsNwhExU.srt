[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping to take paper 20398 out of order, Mr. President.

52
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:56,262
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a request for a transfer of $855,000 from our leak detection accounts to some special projects related to water sewer.

53
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

54
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:07,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Communications from the Mayor, 20-398, to the Honorable President and members of the Metro City Council, City Hall, Metro Massachusetts, 02155.

55
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body reprograms

56
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:23,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Surplus proceeds in the amount of $855,000 for the leak detection system project to the following capital projects.

57
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Hydraulic study, drainage system design and pipelining, $460,000.

58
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:28,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Water meters project, $175,000.

59
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:29,595

61
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:51,474
[SPEAKER_15]: DPW Commissioner Brian Karens and Finance Director Aleesha Nunley, Benjamin, are present to answer any of the Council's questions regarding this matter.

62
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

63
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, we have Aleesha Nunley with us.

64
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:01,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to unmute her, and we have Brian Karens.

65
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Brian, would you like to talk about the project a little bit?

66
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:12,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice-President, and members of the Council.

67
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: The paper that the Mayor has forwarded to you for your consideration is for water-related maintenance issues, as I would call it, within DPW.

68
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're well aware, DPW manages and maintains the domestic water service for the entire city.

69
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:36,692
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, okay, the domestic sewage.

70
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:38,125
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.

71
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:50,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to give you a snapshot, as far as water is concerned in the domestic water service, we have 144 miles of pipe underground that we have to maintain.

72
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:55,439
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, 119 miles is for sewer mains.

73
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,722
[SPEAKER_02]: That has nothing to do with the stormwater.

74
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:03,966
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just what services the commercial properties and also the residential properties.

75
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:11,542
[SPEAKER_02]: The first paper, though, has to do with drainage is Bowen Avenue.

76
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:25,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen Avenue is between Main Street and Mystic Avenue, and there's been for several years now an ongoing issue with flooding, particularly when we have heavy rains.

77
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we've been out there numerous times with the internal forces to make sure the lines are clear and everything else.

78
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:43,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically that neighborhood, starting with Bowen, we feel is a capacity problem.

79
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we would like to do, subject to your approval, is to get a company in and to actually do a study of the stormwater system in that entire neighborhood.

80
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:03,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, all of the stormwater for the city, the entire seven miles,

81
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:07,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It all goes into the Mystic River in some way, shape or form.

82
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:17,062
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, coming through our city is Winchester, Stoneham, Malden, Somerville.

83
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just further compounds it.

84
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:28,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Somerville would be coming down in that general area, in addition to the waters that we have gone through ourselves.

85
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we want to do is try to

86
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:47,856
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out exactly what is actually needed in that neighbourhood, starting with Bowen, to try to alleviate the flooding that's taking place there that is damaging people's lawns, driveways and everything else.

87
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:51,418
[SPEAKER_02]: The second request that you have

88
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:58,830
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, is, and I'll just sandwich it together, is for water meters and the reading devices.

89
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the reading devices are the heads of water meters.

90
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:20,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we keep in mind, the metering system for the city was installed in 2005-2006 for all the residential and all of the commercial meters in the city.

91
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:31,190
[SPEAKER_02]: DPW manages and monitors usage and consumption for anybody who has water and sewer services in the city.

92
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:46,382
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual number of metres, and they vary in size, five-eighths inch to an inch is your standard size for homes, and they go up to 10 inches in diameter, which would be for large commercial properties like the hotel and all that.

93
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:53,308
[SPEAKER_02]: We manage 14,875 meters in the city.

94
00:07:55,108 --> 00:08:00,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's happening is over time, they're showing their will.

95
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:09,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's happening is a lot of them are starting to lose their accuracy as far as what the actual consumption is.

96
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:14,677
[SPEAKER_02]: By either replacing heads or replacing the meters in their entirety,

97
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:26,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you would give a true, accurate figure, but not only the customer, but also the city, to properly build what people are actually using.

98
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The last request is for hydrants.

99
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:37,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, DPW manages, maintains, and repairs and replaces the hydrants in the city.

100
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:44,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over 1,300 hydrants that we have to maintain.

101
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:49,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, over time, they show their age and their wear.

102
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:55,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, sometimes we can rebuild them by replacing the shafts or the stems internally.

103
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Other times they're just worn out and deteriorated due to age and everything.

104
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:16,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a continuation, a yearly as far as replacing so many hydrants within the city to make sure that we have adequate water for fire suppression in the event the need arises.

105
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:22,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Commissioner Kearns.

106
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:25,458
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a number of questions from the council.

107
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,463
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll start off with Councilor Marks.

108
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:28,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

109
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:34,715
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank Alicia and Mr. Kerens for being on the call tonight.

111
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,977
[SPEAKER_13]: These are all, in my opinion, very worthy projects.

112
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:48,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone that's been on the council for a number of years knows Bowen Ave in that area has been a real concern for flooding over many years.

113
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:53,726
[SPEAKER_13]: When there's heavy rains, you better take your canoe out to traverse some of those streets.

114
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:54,947
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how bad it gets.

115
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,088
[SPEAKER_13]: That's no exaggeration.

116
00:09:56,788 --> 00:10:00,090
[SPEAKER_13]: And the homeowners have been putting up with this for a number of years.

117
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:07,713
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope this study leads to improvements to drainage and other infrastructure improvements in that particular area.

118
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:09,714
[SPEAKER_13]: The water meters.

119
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:15,256
[SPEAKER_13]: My question, I was on the council when we voted for water meters back in 2005.

120
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:23,780
[SPEAKER_13]: So I remember the nightmare prior to 2005 when we had a system that we used to estimate probably half the city.

121
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you know, when you get an estimated bill, it's not a true rendering of what you use for water.

122
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:35,930
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can imagine people paying bills for consumption that they didn't use.

123
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,391
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a nightmare.

124
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:42,235
[SPEAKER_13]: There were a lot of abatements going on at the time.

125
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was just a real bad time for the city.

126
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:51,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Brian, what is the life expectancy of the current meters that were put in 2005?

127
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:59,194
[SPEAKER_02]: They start to lose their calibration, I'd call it.

128
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:14,258
[SPEAKER_02]: After about 11 years, once they start reaching 11 years old and beyond that, all right, the calibration goes down, and goes down to where it could benefit us, but it also could benefit the consumer.

129
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:17,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really can't get a true accurate picture.

130
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually, all right, they end up, they just stop working.

131
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:34,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you have to get into, you know, estimating a bill for somebody by, you know, replacing either the heads, if they want, or the entire meters themselves, Mike.

132
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That way we can stay on top of it and give everybody, you know, a true accurate bill each month.

133
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:41,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

134
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:48,307
[SPEAKER_13]: This may not, this may be a question for Ron in the water department, but I'm going to ask it anyways.

135
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,810
[SPEAKER_13]: What, what percent right now are we estimating, if any?

136
00:11:54,463 --> 00:12:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the numbers of businesses or residents that are out there as far as estimate, I'd have to get you that actual number, Mike.

137
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:13,758
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people out there, but you're not talking hundreds and hundreds, but there are people out there that we're giving estimated bills to.

138
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:14,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

139
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:23,550
[SPEAKER_13]: And the plan for this money is not to start going around and systematically replace everyone's meter, which they're now 15 years old.

140
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,411
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just to have them.

141
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:33,233
[SPEAKER_13]: So if a meter does start to malfunction, you're going to have the ability to replace the head or replace the entire meter.

142
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually both, Mike.

143
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:39,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously to keep some on the shelf if you would.

144
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:53,232
[SPEAKER_02]: but we also do have meters out there that their accuracy is just beyond approach that if the money was approved and we did acquire these, we'd replace them right away.

145
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:54,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

146
00:12:54,803 --> 00:13:09,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, Mr. President, if I could, uh, just, um, uh, amend this if I could, or, uh, have a request to the city administration that we get an update on, uh, the, uh, re-metering.

147
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,002
[SPEAKER_13]: We're 15 years into a life expectancy of roughly 10 to 11 years.

148
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:22,545
[SPEAKER_13]: And we definitely don't want to go back to the days where we were estimating half our city.

149
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,166
[SPEAKER_13]: It created a lot of problems.

150
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,907
[SPEAKER_13]: There were residents that were over and underpaying.

151
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:31,028
[SPEAKER_13]: There were residents that were getting catch up bills.

152
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:42,512
[SPEAKER_13]: If councilors remember of two, three, four, $5,000, a catch up bill that the city finally figured out that the resident wasn't paying enough over the last several years.

153
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,353
[SPEAKER_13]: And we definitely don't want to go back to that period of time.

154
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:56,037
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that we look at the remediary of the city, Mr. President, which is a larger endeavor, but I think something we should be proactive about.

155
00:13:56,857 --> 00:14:03,987
[SPEAKER_13]: And my last question to Mr. Cairns is, I think all these particular uses, hydrant and so forth, are great.

156
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to put in a plug for catch basins.

157
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:30,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I still see, Brian, I don't have to tell you this, I don't preach it to the choir, there are still hundreds of catch basins around the city that are sunken in and pose a danger to residents and also are not serving as the function that they're supposed to, to cut off rain, runoff water, because they're sunk in and they're not doing their purpose.

158
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,158
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not capturing this water and cutting it out to the Mystic River.

159
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:45,643
[SPEAKER_13]: So I need to put a plug in for some additional funding for catch basin maintenance, repair, and replacement, as well as this paper, Mr. President.

160
00:14:45,903 --> 00:15:04,112
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would offer those two suggestions that the administration report back on a meter replacement plan, and also what the plan is for repairing or replacing our catch basins that currently exist are ones that are broken and caving in throughout the community.

161
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:06,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

162
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:09,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the wording to the amendments?

163
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:12,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the first one.

164
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still working on the second one.

165
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:23,727
[SPEAKER_15]: So after we get the wording, we have Councilor Bears, then Vice President Caraviello, then Councilor Knight.

166
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:25,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to wait.

167
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:26,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read back what I have.

168
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:32,669
[SPEAKER_03]: The first amendment is a request to the city administration that the council get an update on the remetering of the city.

169
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:35,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct, Councilor Marks?

170
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:36,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

171
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:45,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second one is requesting an update on the plan for repairing or replacing catch basins throughout the city.

172
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:45,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

173
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:46,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

174
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

175
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:48,162
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

176
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

177
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:50,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Clerk Arnabes.

178
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:52,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

179
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,484
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Councilor Bears.

180
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:55,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really glad to see you, Director Nunley, Benjamin, and Brian.

182
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here.

183
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, I just had one question.

184
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:07,365
[SPEAKER_04]: People in the Bowen Ave area are talking all the time about the flooding.

185
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,686
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge issue for them, quality of life issue.

186
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:18,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just wondering how far will this get us in getting to a solution to that?

187
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:23,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, I apologize, Councilor.

188
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:29,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I got cut off, I'm actually using the clerk's computer as we speak.

189
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:43,323
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the examination, the design, and the recommendations would take us basically the immediate streets, including

190
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:46,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start with Boeing and branch out.

191
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:56,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Between the institutional knowledge of several of our engineers, as well as the highway maintenance people, we feel we know how far we have to go.

192
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done our homework as best we can.

193
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, till you start getting underground and start hammering all of the lines that are already in existence, you know, we're just giving our best guess right here.

194
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:13,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

195
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:23,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this would you think you have the design and all of that would this actually get us to fixing it or is this just analyzing and figuring out how to fix it?

196
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:24,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably both.

197
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you know, we

198
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:47,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just right now, again, assuming the pocket problems in that area until we actually get a company in and closely examine not only the condition, but also the size of the existing storm drain pipes.

199
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:52,292
[SPEAKER_02]: and just where they connect into and from and where they go out.

200
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:57,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just our best guess.

201
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: We clearly know that there is waters that are coming in from Somerville heading into that direction.

202
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:11,688
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of that is compounding the problem, again, until we can, we don't know for sure.

203
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,370
[SPEAKER_04]: you.

204
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

205
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thank you for taking it up because the residents in that area.

206
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:18,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a major major issue for them.

207
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:18,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

208
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just had a question for Alicia.

209
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Um And.

210
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think you might have to unmute.

211
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:32,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Um so I guess my question is just, you know.

212
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:35,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is these are really important projects.

213
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:35,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But

214
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:43,815
[SPEAKER_04]: do everything we can to avoid cuts.

215
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:57,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any way that putting the funds towards these projects, which I agree are really important, could impact, are we putting money into this and this money maybe could be used later to maintain existing services or is this completely separate?

216
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,761
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a great question.

217
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:11,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, these capital costs were cut out of the enterprise fund budget and brought before your honorable body to be reprogrammed out of an existing project that's not gonna be utilized, therefore saving money

218
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,306
[SPEAKER_11]: on the enterprise side.

219
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,872
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the way we were kind of trying to negate some of the overages that we're seeing that's happening.

220
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,315
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to plug some deficits that we know are going to occur.

221
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:30,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am in the process of meeting with the Water and Sewer Commission, looking at the rates for next year.

222
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:31,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't done that yet.

223
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:34,385
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the planning phase of that and working on the budget.

224
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

225
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

226
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:37,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

227
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:41,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Alicia.

228
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:43,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

229
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:44,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Caraviello.

230
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

231
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, good to have you back.

232
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

233
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Councilor Marks brought up an important point about all the storm drains that are failing in the city.

234
00:19:56,672 --> 00:20:00,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I was going to bring that to the attention also.

235
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:05,056
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have a lot of manhole covers that are sinking.

236
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:09,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some may belong to the MWRA, gas companies.

237
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:12,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a multitude of them that belong to different companies.

238
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I correct, Mr. Kearns?

239
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,522
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely right, Mr. Vice President.

240
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:29,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the gas company, the electric company, in some cases, iCable, as well as, you know, Medford covers as well.

241
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:38,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you know, the arterial system is aging and has been aging.

242
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:47,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, between the severe winters and heavy truck traffic, you know, we just

243
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: We just really can't keep up with repairing what is ours.

244
00:20:53,163 --> 00:21:01,991
[SPEAKER_02]: What is not ours, if we take notice of it, we'll report it to the owner, whether it be one of the utility companies.

245
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: We request them to get out there as quickly as they can to repair their cupboards, but there's hundreds out there that need attention, Councilor.

246
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:29,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was my question, I was seeing that right now where traffic is on probably on the minimal side, if we can maybe get some of those companies to get out here and fix their stuff while the traffic is still on the slow side.

247
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:39,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And my next question is, this is coming out of the water and sewer enterprise account, what is the balance left in that?

248
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's about $6 million.

249
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:55,392
[SPEAKER_11]: This project that you're taking the money from the fund these projects right now has a $900,000 balance and we're programming 855 of it.

250
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:55,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

251
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:58,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And one last question.

252
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:04,262
[SPEAKER_09]: If we if Alicia I know a lot of times it seems to be a question over where

253
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,611
[SPEAKER_09]: the money that's in the Water and Soil Enterprise account comes from.

254
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:19,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be possible for the Water and Soil Commission to provide the Council with a breakdown on where those funds come from in the next few weeks?

255
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:28,842
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd have to ask the Water and Soil Commission, they're their own separate body, but you could send me a request and I could give you a breakdown of the

256
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:31,035
[SPEAKER_11]: if you send it to the mayor's office.

257
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:47,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if you could make this part in a form of a motion to request that the city council be provided a breakdown to where the funds from the Water and Sewer Commission come from.

258
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:49,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

259
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:53,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I make that as an amendment to the paper?

260
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:56,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, if you want to do that, yes.

261
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:00,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Does Clerk Hurtubise have that or?

262
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I got it.

263
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:03,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, perfect.

264
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:03,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

265
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:05,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

266
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:08,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

267
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

268
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:16,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be supporting this paper this evening.

269
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always good to see shovels in the ground and work getting done.

270
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:23,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that this expenditure is part of the mayor's capital plan.

271
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:26,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to offer an amendment to the paper as well.

272
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:29,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking that the mayor provide us with a copy of her capital plan.

273
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:36,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

274
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:39,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

275
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:41,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:42,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, just a quick question.

277
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:47,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry if I missed this, Alicia, you referenced that this is coming from a program that's no longer going on.

278
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:48,143
[SPEAKER_10]: What program is that?

279
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:50,145
[SPEAKER_10]: The leak detection system.

280
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:51,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

281
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:57,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions from the councilors?

[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

474
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:30,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the opportunity to speak with the finance director earlier in the month, and it's been brought to my attention that we will have a surplus of funds in our videographer's account.

475
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:39,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're looking at bringing on a zoning consultant, and the price of that zoning consultant was a little bit more than we had been allotted in the past.

476
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:44,951
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an effort for us to identify funding avenues to complete the contract.

477
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been brought to my attention

478
00:34:47,263 --> 00:34:54,005
[SPEAKER_05]: through a correspondence from the city clerk that we have found funding to fully fund the $47,500 for our zoning consultant.

479
00:34:54,525 --> 00:35:05,349
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd ask that this request stand, Mr. President, so that if there are any contingency fees or contingency expenses that are related to the implementation of our zoning consultant, we have some flexibility and some funds available.

480
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

481
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, Mr. President.

482
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,790

00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:12,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions?

484
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:14,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions from the public?

485
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:15,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Any emails?

486
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,528

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,790
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a question for Adam.

489
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:28,695
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason for the extra funds, I guess, is there like because lack of use for hours or do we know the reason?

490
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:32,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe we had budgeted for two videographers.

491
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:38,342
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our videographers took ill and has since resigned from the position or has left from the position.

492
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:41,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had some budgeted funds in the account for that purpose.

493
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:43,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a personnel related expense.

494
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:44,726

536
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me.

537
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:34,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Methodist Massport Community Advisory Committee representatives, Peter Houck and Luke Krasner, update the city council on the recent federal aviation commitment to study runway changes as identified in the MIT study.

538
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:35,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

539
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:38,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

540
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:39,777
[SPEAKER_13]: This is great news.

541
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:53,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, I think we see some positive results from many thousands of complaints filed by Medford residents regarding airplane noise that started back in 2013.

542
00:38:55,988 --> 00:39:07,740
[SPEAKER_13]: when Massport implemented a flight patent that unfairly and disproportionately pushed and exposed Method residents to noise from runway 33L.

543
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:13,546
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's been a bone of contention, not just with the city of Medford, but many surrounding communities.

544
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:22,509
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was over the last couple of years that I believe Medford took some great steps under the leadership of former Mayor Burke.

545
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:39,493
[SPEAKER_13]: There was efforts to join with surrounding communities, of which we joined with Arlington, Somerville, Belmont, Watertown, requesting the FAA study, the changes that were identified in the MIT study that was commissioned.

546
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:48,719
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know under the leadership now of current mayor, Lungo-Koehn, we are seeing results, Mr. President.

547
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:54,844
[SPEAKER_13]: The FAA recently said that they will look at the MIT study.

548
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,806
[SPEAKER_13]: And it'll take about two to three months.

549
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:01,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And they will make recommendations based on

550
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:13,937
[SPEAKER_13]: the study of the MIT, and they are committed to looking and making changes on behalf of the city of Medford.

551
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:25,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I personally want to thank Mr. President again, because I've been around, I remember the days that we didn't have a representative that sat on this advisory commission.

552
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:38,159
[SPEAKER_13]: So when they were making decisions back in 2013, and even prior to that, Method was not at the table to stand up and say, wait a minute, you're using Method as a dumping ground.

553
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:51,486
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm proud to say, Mr. President, I raised the red flag and I got a copy of the minutes back some eight years ago, and I showed the general public how we had no one representing our city.

554
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:58,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have to say it was Mayor McGlynn at the time, chose to put two representatives on the board.

555
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:03,030
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Peter Houck and Luke Presner, and they've done yeoman's work.

556
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,472
[SPEAKER_13]: in representing our community.

557
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:11,456
[SPEAKER_13]: If you've ever been to one of their presentations, they are extremely knowledgeable.

558
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:19,183
[SPEAKER_13]: I have people from surrounding communities that would like to steal them and say, how can we get them to represent our community?

559
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:20,343
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how great they are.

560
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:31,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I would only ask, Mr. President, that we be kept up to date on this June meeting that's going to take place with Massport Community Advisory Committee members, as well as the FAA.

561
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:49,145
[SPEAKER_13]: and that they appear at a future council meeting to give us an update to what direction we are going to move in as a community and if any resources or other things are needed that they'd be able to present that to the council, Mr. President.

562
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:50,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

563
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

564
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello.

565
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:54,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

566
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll echo Councilor Marks'

567
00:41:57,178 --> 00:42:04,580
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, support of, of Luke and Peter, again, uh, they've done a tremendous amount of work, uh, uh, since they've, uh, come on board.

568
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:12,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think this is also a good time to have the meeting where, uh, the plane travel is at a minimum right at the moment.

569
00:42:12,662 --> 00:42:21,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, uh, I think they can make some strides, uh, with that going forward because anything now, uh, will be adding on.

570
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:22,104
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll know, uh,

571
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:35,397
[SPEAKER_09]: what kind of traffic will be moving up coming in the next, you know, six, seven, eight months as the airline industry tries to ramp up again, get going.

572
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:42,103
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think now, you know, it's a good time to get a handle on this, where the plane travels, I mean, the plane travels at a minimum.

573
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:44,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

574
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:46,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

575
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:47,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

576
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:51,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and also

577
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,913
[SPEAKER_10]: echo the laudatory remarks on Peter and Luke.

578
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:56,915
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really phenomenal and are always there to answer questions.

579
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:01,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And also echo Vice President Caraviello, where right now plane travel is down.

580
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:11,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're getting a bit of a reprieve, but now is really the time where we have to keep advancing this because as Councilor Marks pointed out, Medford has been taking advantage of in the past and we don't wanna let up right now.

581
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:14,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do have concerns.

582
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:20,295
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something we need to raise right now as well, because I have concerns that there has been stuff coming out of the FAA of smaller airports

583
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:23,952
[SPEAKER_10]: having less flights going to them, but where do those flights go instead?

584
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:25,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they come into Boston instead?

585
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:29,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And do they go right over our Medford residents, you know, as an onslaught instead.

586
00:43:29,213 --> 00:43:34,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm thankful for Councilor Marks bringing this up and that this is moving forward.

587
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:41,156
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully we continue to work towards a resolution that can really make stuff more equitable for the residents in the area.

588
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:41,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

589
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:44,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you Councilor Morell.

590
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:45,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Peters.

591
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:47,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

592
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:53,495
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I want to echo what my colleagues have said and also echo really thank Peter and Luke for everything they've been doing.

593
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,356
[SPEAKER_04]: This issue is really important now.

594
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,477
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've had a little bit of a reprieve.

595
00:43:58,497 --> 00:43:59,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Air travel is down.

596
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:02,600
[SPEAKER_04]: But everyone is spending all their time at home now.

597
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are trying to work from home under this noise.

598
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:08,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just it's not doable for a lot of folks.

599
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it's been a real stress for people.

600
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:12,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope we can get their update.

601
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:16,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I know I'm on some email lists with folks who've been working on this.

602
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:17,868
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a meeting next week.

603
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:21,526
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Massport Community Advisory Council.

604
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:28,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's Massport Community Advisory Committee, CAC, where they're going to be discussing some options that Councilor Mark's referring to.

605
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's June 11th.

606
00:44:31,331 --> 00:44:36,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that some residents have requested that local officials try to be on that meeting if they can.

607
00:44:36,213 --> 00:44:39,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it's a Zoom digital meeting.

608
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just, I just wanted to put that out there as well.

609
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:45,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Pearce.

610
00:44:47,192 --> 00:44:48,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, any other questions from the Council?

611
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Member Marks, thank you for bringing this forward.

612
00:44:52,976 --> 00:45:04,964
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an absolutely very important issue, and we'll definitely schedule some time with Peter and Luke, who are absolutely the most knowledgeable people I know about this issue.

613
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:07,686
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's always great to listen to them and get an update.

614
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,687
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

615
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:15,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have any emails from the public on this, and is there any public participation on this matter?

616
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:19,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this topic.

617
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:21,837
[SPEAKER_03]: There are actually no emails on any agenda topic this evening.

618
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:23,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, perfect.

619
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:24,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

620
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:31,559
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

621
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

622
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

623
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Caraviello.

624
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:36,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

625
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:38,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

626
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:39,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

627
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:40,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

628
00:45:41,022 --> 00:45:41,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

629
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

630
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:43,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

631
00:45:43,382 --> 00:45:44,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

632
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:44,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

633
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:46,043
[SPEAKER_03]: President Falco.

634
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm the affirmative, zero on the negative, the motion passes.

635
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:53,374
[SPEAKER_15]: 2-0-393 offered by Vice President Caraviello.

636
00:45:53,714 --> 00:46:09,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas the city of Medford has appealed the decision that was granted in favor of the petitioner of the 40B project at 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway, be it resolved that the Medford City Council receive answers to the following questions from the city administration.

637
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:14,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Number one, what is the cost of the appeal and where will these funds come from?

638
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two,

639
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:21,587
[SPEAKER_15]: If the city of Medford is unsuccessful in its appeal, what is the next step?

640
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:32,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Number three, seeing that the state has ruled in favor of this petitioner, is it likely that the state will use the same formula and rule in favor of the other two petitioners?

641
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:34,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Will the city also be appealing these decisions?

642
00:46:35,556 --> 00:46:44,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Next question, what is the plan to address affordable housing crisis as described by the mayor of the city of Medford if we deny these three 40B projects?

643
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:54,551
[SPEAKER_15]: The last question is, what is the plan to reach our affordable housing threshold in order to stop 40B projects that continue coming to Medford?

644
00:46:55,132 --> 00:46:56,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Caraviello.

645
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:57,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

646
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:11,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this is going to be a question coming down the line for the next year or so with the proliferation of 40B projects coming into the city of Medford until we reach our threshold.

647
00:47:12,732 --> 00:47:14,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I was able to watch the meeting a couple of weeks ago.

648
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:21,080
[SPEAKER_09]: when the decision came in in favor of the petitioner at 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway.

649
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:42,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the big questions was, the formula that's used between the city of Medford number and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts number, along with the private petitioner's numbers, we were off about 70 points, which is a huge discrepancy.

650
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,749
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's somewhat of a concern to me.

651
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,382
[SPEAKER_09]: The Board of Appeals has appealed that decision to the next level.

652
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:58,525
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we funding this appeal, Mr. President, is my first question.

653
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:06,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this going to cost us money if we hire a separate attorney to do this appeal?

654
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:18,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And second, we have two more petitioners right behind this one here, one being on the Felsway, where the box factory is, and another one

655
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:20,298
[SPEAKER_09]: being on Mystic Avenue.

656
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:27,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know this first project doesn't get us to our limit and maybe the next two will.

657
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:54,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing that these are uh, I mean, is the city gonna deny those because I don't see the state using a different formula to uh, They're on on those two, uh applicants any different than they did on the first one so, uh, uh, are we going to appeal all those or are we going to maybe try to negotiate a a uh, some type of settlement with these, uh people to get up to our uh,

658
00:48:55,292 --> 00:49:16,406
[SPEAKER_09]: our our thresholds because uh again uh in a long uh with the new census coming out our threshold may go higher so that's something we have to keep an eye out for um but do we have any other you know does the administration have a plan to uh for affordable housing i mean uh

659
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:22,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, this is the only avenue that we currently have for affordable housing in the city of Medford.

660
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:31,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see the federal government coming forward and building any housing projects similar to what they did on Willis Avenue or Riverside Avenue.

661
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:38,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, on the other side of this, these three projects, if the city were to embrace them,

662
00:49:39,912 --> 00:50:02,350
[SPEAKER_09]: uh in these uh difficult times would probably generate just in building fees mr president uh over two million dollars which uh uh would wipe out our deficit that the the building department is currently facing uh with the building premise and along with putting some boots on the ground people working in the city of medford so um again this is a this is a discussion we have to have going forward

663
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:10,475
[SPEAKER_09]: to how do we get to our thresholds without allowing these projects to come forward?

664
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:14,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll leave that up to my other Councilors for discussion.

665
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:17,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

666
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:19,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

667
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:19,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Layton.

668
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:24,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Hang on, Councilor Layton, you need one minute.

669
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:29,789
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

670
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:31,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

671
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:31,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

672
00:50:33,068 --> 00:50:35,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate Councilor Caraviello for bringing this issue up.

673
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:55,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding that 100% of the units in the 40B proposal would go towards our 10% affordability quota, even though I believe that the number of units in the actual development would be about 25 to 30% affordable.

674
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's my understanding, Mr. President,

675
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:06,017
[SPEAKER_05]: because these 40 P projects to bring some affordable housing into the community that the entire development discounted towards that 10% quota.

676
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:14,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we need to take a long hard look at, Mr. President, and quite frankly, you know, I think it's time to negotiate.

677
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:18,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to call these developers in and sit down with them and work towards

678
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:29,420
[SPEAKER_05]: coming up with a friendly 40B project that's going to be something that can benefit the community and something that can give us some sort of community impact benefits, Mr. President.

679
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:37,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I look at it, you know, we just lost the safe harbor fight and we've pretty much lost all leverage in negotiation.

680
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:44,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the question comes is, you know, if we're going to get a 40B project, do we want a 40B that's friendly or do we want a 40B that's going to run us over?

681
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to fight them every step of the way?

682
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to bring them to the table and sit down and work with them?

683
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:59,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we need to call these developers into the room, Mr. President, and sit down with them and bring them to the table and talk about what concerns we have as a community and what direction we'd like to see them going.

684
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:02,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't thank Councilor Caraviello enough for bringing this issue up.

685
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:12,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to amend the paper just to ask if these services are services that are covered under the $60,000 retainer that we've given KP Law, or if they are covered as a la carte services.

686
00:52:13,737 --> 00:52:17,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would support the council's resolve this evening and thank you for bringing it forward.

687
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:20,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

688
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:22,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Clerk Herlovich, do you have the amendment?

689
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:26,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I've got the amendment.

690
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:32,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these services covered under the $60,000 KP law agreement, or are they considered a la carte services?

691
00:52:33,178 --> 00:52:33,979
[SPEAKER_15]: You are correct.

692
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:35,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello.

693
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:37,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

694
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:54,036
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I didn't mention that the last three projects that came on board in the city of Medford, which is River's Edge, Modera, and the other River's Edge have generated close to $3 million in taxes.

695
00:52:55,377 --> 00:53:02,324
[SPEAKER_09]: for our city, which is a far cry more than we were getting for those properties in the state that they were.

696
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:08,630
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, these three projects would probably generate three to four million.

697
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:14,756
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we're not looking at just today, Mr. President, we're looking at going down the line for the financial stability of our city.

698
00:53:16,557 --> 00:53:25,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, right now, we're in tough times, and like I said, just the zoning—I mean, excuse me, just the building fees are a tremendous amount of money.

699
00:53:28,061 --> 00:53:35,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if any of these projects were to start today, we wouldn't see any money on these probably till the next two years.

700
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:44,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, like I say, the problem that we have today with our budget isn't going to be going away anytime soon.

701
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:55,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we have to look toward the future and generating more money for the city because unfortunately, we are a business and we do need to make money to keep on going.

702
00:53:56,977 --> 00:53:59,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello, Council of Marks.

703
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:01,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

704
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:03,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.

705
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:17,740
[SPEAKER_13]: He brings a lot of valid points up regarding much-needed affordable housing, which I think we all can agree upon, additional revenue from building permits and so forth, which I think we all agree upon.

706
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:26,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the one issue, Mr. President, we do have to look at is that the fact that this law has been around for five decades.

707
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:34,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you look at the statistics, 80% of the communities in Massachusetts fall below the 10% threshold.

708
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:41,513
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though this law has been out there for five decades, it's done very little to add affordable housing.

709
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:49,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And I agree with my colleagues, I agree with Councilor Knight said, I think a friendly 40B is something we should be looking at as a community.

710
00:54:50,259 --> 00:55:08,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think there are housing production plans that, within the last two years, 150 cities and towns have taken advantage of, which is a way of creating a blueprint in a community that allows you to move forward on these larger projects that have affordability components.

711
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are less contentious.

712
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:19,646
[SPEAKER_13]: They're good ways of moving forward with developers and suiting the needs of a community, but also not rolling over either, Mr. President.

713
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:29,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, you know, if we talk about fairness, let's face it, these particular projects, a thousand units are within a square mile of each other.

714
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:33,627
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not spread around the community, Mr. President.

715
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:44,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I could just tell you, Mr. President, in my neighborhood alone, they've added hundreds, if not thousands of units in the last year and a half in one neighborhood, Mr. President.

716
00:55:45,414 --> 00:55:52,318
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think when we have to take a look at this, and maybe when we start looking at zoning, this will be an issue we do take a look at, Mr. President.

717
00:55:52,698 --> 00:56:03,325
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have to make sure that if we're going to create these projects, especially these larger projects, that they're created fairly and evenly distributed around the community, Mr. President.

718
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,586
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's vital.

719
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:06,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are things that I think we have to look at.

720
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:14,933
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't fault the administration for standing up on behalf of the community and saying, these are mitigating factors we're going to be looking for.

721
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:17,535
[SPEAKER_13]: These are things that we want to safeguard neighborhoods.

722
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:19,456
[SPEAKER_13]: These are issues that we're concerned about.

723
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:20,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't fault them for that.

724
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:29,308
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would like to see a collaborative effort when the developers do come in so we can work on this and not waste money with attorneys.

725
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:32,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the only one that gains are the attorneys making money.

726
00:56:33,214 --> 00:56:35,878
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'd like to see a collaborative effort.

727
00:56:36,538 --> 00:56:43,143
[SPEAKER_13]: when this happens, and I'd like to see a little more thought, Mr. President, to make sure that these projects are equally dispersed.

728
00:56:43,503 --> 00:56:52,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Why should one neighborhood experience thousands of more traffic trips and thousands of more cars on the street while other neighborhoods don't see anything at all, Mr. President?

729
00:56:52,870 --> 00:57:04,900
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, if we're going to stand up and talk about fairness, we have to have the discussion, although it may be painful because people don't want to talk about it, Mr. President, but it's something that we need to discuss as a council.

730
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thank my colleagues for bringing this up.

731
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

732
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:12,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Peers.

733
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:14,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

734
00:57:14,528 --> 00:57:21,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I have a couple of comments, but I just want to say, and no personal at all question to you, Councilor Caraviello, but

735
00:57:21,953 --> 00:57:26,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree we need to keep revenue coming in, but we are not a business in the normal sense.

736
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Our demand goes up when times are bad.

737
00:57:29,137 --> 00:57:30,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a time when we can...

738
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:32,412
[SPEAKER_04]: pull back, you know, it's very different.

739
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I just wanted to put that out there and again, nothing to you directly, Mr. Vice president.

740
00:57:36,396 --> 00:57:39,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, we do need to generate money every year.

741
00:57:39,678 --> 00:57:39,839
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

742
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:48,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hear that, you know, we can, we can call it whatever we want, but we do money funds have to be, you know, the tax dollars only raise X amount of dollars.

743
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:53,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, you know, new growth is, is a big, a big part of our budget every year.

744
00:57:54,482 --> 00:57:56,303
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and I agree with that 100%.

745
00:57:56,343 --> 00:57:58,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So my comment substantively, it's just the word business.

746
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:01,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it in government people, it's just a personal thing.

747
00:58:01,885 --> 00:58:04,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

748
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:06,306
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the substance, I tend to agree.

749
00:58:06,326 --> 00:58:10,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree we have an affordable housing crisis.

750
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:11,888
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do more.

751
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:16,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, I tend to agree with what everyone has said, because we do need the growth.

752
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,010
[SPEAKER_04]: We do need to maintain revenue.

753
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:23,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing about the 40B process is it removes some of our leverage in exactly that question.

754
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:25,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I, I agree.

755
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:26,392
[SPEAKER_04]: We need these projects.

756
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:32,518
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more affordable housing, but 40 B gives us less power to negotiate with the developers.

757
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:37,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can do these projects in a different way, that's always something I'm in favor of.

758
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:40,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously these applications are in it's comprehensive permit.

759
00:58:40,026 --> 00:58:45,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 40 B. So the cards kind of left the barn on, on, on these projects, but going forward,

760
00:58:46,032 --> 00:58:53,138
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have more leverage to negotiate better agreements and bring more revenue in and meet community needs if we're doing these projects outside of 40B.

761
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:56,020
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just my view on it.

762
00:58:58,082 --> 00:58:59,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

763
00:58:59,764 --> 00:59:01,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

764
00:59:03,547 --> 00:59:05,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, Vice President Caraviello.

765
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:06,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

766
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:10,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Markson is right and Councilor Nunez is right.

767
00:59:10,192 --> 00:59:10,733
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're gonna fight,

768
00:59:11,387 --> 00:59:14,948
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to have any leverage with these people that are coming.

769
00:59:14,988 --> 00:59:20,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So I say, you know, the administration sit down, negotiate with them.

770
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:27,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can collect some taxes a little before the time is due.

771
00:59:29,114 --> 00:59:33,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, right now, there's a lot of options that are on the table.

772
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:38,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say, if we're going to fight everything, then we'll have no leverage.

773
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,539
[SPEAKER_09]: to ever do anything.

774
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:50,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope the administration is listening and sits down with these groups, and hopefully we'll reach that threshold and we'll move on.

775
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:56,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's say, again, we have very few avenues for affordable housing in this area.

776
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

777
01:00:00,748 --> 01:00:02,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions from the council?

778
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:06,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions from the public?

779
01:00:13,548 --> 01:00:13,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Will.

780
01:00:14,608 --> 01:00:18,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

781
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:26,133
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think this is another great opportunity for me to talk about the two issues I talk about almost every time.

782
01:00:27,694 --> 01:00:38,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that we could get more housing if we repeal the parking minimums, first of all, because right now what we're doing is we're mandating that a large portion of our city needs to be parking lots.

783
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:42,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And those don't pay much taxes and they don't create much value.

784
01:00:43,634 --> 01:00:47,215
[SPEAKER_00]: One way you could tell they're not creating value is if they're empty, which they often are.

785
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:53,137
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is the land value taxation.

786
01:00:53,157 --> 01:00:58,419
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about we're gonna develop and that's going to bring in more revenue.

787
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,440
[SPEAKER_00]: We say this development will be good.

788
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:05,082
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be more housing for our residents, maybe more jobs for our residents.

789
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:07,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the same breath, we say,

790
01:01:08,592 --> 01:01:15,017
[SPEAKER_00]: this'll be good because it'll bring in revenue because we'll basically assess a fine on that good thing they did.

791
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:27,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I gotta say, why is the person who owns land that's not being used very well paying that same amount?

792
01:01:28,845 --> 01:01:32,947
[SPEAKER_00]: You have land in the city of Medford that's not really being used for very much.

793
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:35,628
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being used for housing.

794
01:01:35,788 --> 01:01:41,290
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being used for parking lots that are half used near Wellington Circle, for example.

795
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Very expensive land near an Orange Line station.

796
01:01:44,431 --> 01:01:48,433
[SPEAKER_00]: You think how many people in this country would love to have such good access to transit?

797
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:50,754
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a parking lot there.

798
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:58,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write a script, so that's kind of the reason I'm rambling a bit.

799
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:05,051
[SPEAKER_00]: But my basic point is that it's not smart.

800
01:02:07,714 --> 01:02:08,995
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously not your thing.

801
01:02:09,015 --> 01:02:13,699
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way taxation has been done since before the United States was founded.

802
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:19,464
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not wise to hope that people do good things for your city.

803
01:02:21,225 --> 01:02:29,908
[SPEAKER_00]: and then tax them when they do those good things, like provide housing, and reduce their taxes when they do bad things.

804
01:02:30,688 --> 01:02:33,509
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put in blight, you get a discount on your taxes.

805
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:35,730
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put in a nice building, your taxes go up.

806
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:47,594
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have so much land, and if somebody wants to put in some blight and reduce the tax base, that doesn't seem like a very sustainable system.

807
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,155
[SPEAKER_09]: One information, Mr. President,

808
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:52,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Information Vice President Caraviello.

809
01:02:53,101 --> 01:03:00,085
[SPEAKER_09]: To the Commissioner of the Borough of Christian, we're not reducing the tax base, we're increasing the tax base.

810
01:03:01,205 --> 01:03:12,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, the property on 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway, when that building is up, we'll be paying close to $1 million a year in taxes.

811
01:03:12,512 --> 01:03:16,054
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not collecting nearly that amount from that property right now.

812
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:26,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what the value of the other properties are, but I know we won't be collecting that type of funding from the building that's there.

813
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:36,849
[SPEAKER_09]: But when a full-fledged building is up there, that number is going to be close to $1 million, similar to Modera, which pays like $1.3 million in taxes.

814
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:41,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with that.

815
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:50,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 40B programs could under the existing taxation scheme be a great thing because you will get something built and they'll pay taxes on it.

816
01:03:51,986 --> 01:03:56,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we sometimes talk about the free market as if it's an evil thing.

817
01:03:56,249 --> 01:04:00,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because we, that's because there's various, there's good reasons for that.

818
01:04:01,533 --> 01:04:06,437
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had a taxation scheme, I think,

819
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:23,423
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't tax the buildings and you only tax the land, people who are under utilizing the land would be a lot more tempted to build something productive on it, something that's a blessing to the community, something that provides housing.

820
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:26,026
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say when you want to run for office?

821
01:04:26,506 --> 01:04:30,049
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, I want to provide more housing and I'm going to provide more jobs.

822
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:33,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get in and you,

823
01:04:34,795 --> 01:04:37,076
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's done this again past 400 years.

824
01:04:37,676 --> 01:04:39,277
[SPEAKER_00]: You get in and what do you say?

825
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we're gonna have taxes on housing and jobs.

826
01:04:43,698 --> 01:04:46,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it seems to me that it's working backwards because uh

827
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:52,718
[SPEAKER_00]: you get less of what you tax.

828
01:04:53,158 --> 01:04:55,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way we do it in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

829
01:04:56,019 --> 01:05:01,541
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do in at least, depending on how you count, 47 out of the 50 states.

830
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:03,702
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do it in most countries in the world.

831
01:05:03,962 --> 01:05:07,483
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's silly and we should do it better.

832
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

833
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:11,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other comments?

834
01:05:14,145 --> 01:05:14,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions?

835
01:05:16,026 --> 01:05:16,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Move to questions.

836
01:05:19,351 --> 01:05:21,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I believe Councilor Bears, you had your hand up.

837
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:22,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

838
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:26,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that, you know, I tend to agree with Mr. Navarre that our tax code is ridiculous.

839
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of ways we could make it better.

840
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:32,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts gives us the power to do it.

841
01:05:34,201 --> 01:05:35,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

842
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:43,487
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, seconded by... Second.

843
01:05:44,268 --> 01:05:47,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

844
01:05:48,658 --> 01:05:51,039
[SPEAKER_03]: As amended by Councilor Knight, I believe.

845
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:53,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, as amended by Councilor Knight, my apologies.

846
01:05:54,361 --> 01:05:54,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

847
01:05:55,741 --> 01:05:55,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

848
01:05:56,482 --> 01:05:57,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Caraviello.

849
01:05:57,762 --> 01:05:57,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

850
01:05:58,623 --> 01:05:59,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

851
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:00,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

852
01:06:00,864 --> 01:06:01,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

853
01:06:01,964 --> 01:06:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

854
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:03,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

855
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:04,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

856
01:06:04,426 --> 01:06:05,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

857
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:05,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

858
01:06:06,287 --> 01:06:06,987
[SPEAKER_03]: President Falco.

859
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:10,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

860
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:26,513
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-394 offered by Council and I, be it resolved that the Medford City Council publish a schedule of pre-budget and regular budget meetings for the purpose of establishing the fiscal year 21 city budget Council and I. What do you think, Johnny?

861
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:28,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good to me.

862
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to give you an update.

863
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:44,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I, so we received a memo from the mayor on, I believe it was Friday, saying that she was going to present the budget to us on the 16th, Tuesday the 16th.

864
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:51,601
[SPEAKER_15]: I called the chief of staff to ask him when we will be receiving our budget books.

865
01:06:52,161 --> 01:06:54,243
[SPEAKER_15]: He did not have a definitive answer for me.

866
01:06:54,263 --> 01:06:57,125
[SPEAKER_15]: He said things are still in flux.

867
01:06:57,606 --> 01:06:59,868
[SPEAKER_15]: So he was thinking that we would probably get them

868
01:07:01,904 --> 01:07:12,437
[SPEAKER_15]: 15th to the 16th, which I thought was really tight, because I, you know, we need my eyes, we need some time to review the budget, especially before the mayor is going to be presenting the budget.

869
01:07:12,498 --> 01:07:14,480
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not voting on it that night.

870
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:25,724
[SPEAKER_15]: But still I would like, I know myself, I like my budget book in advance so we can ask some good questions.

871
01:07:26,245 --> 01:07:31,967
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm gonna touch base with him next week about this very issue that you're asking me about.

872
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:43,331
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can probably even talk about it maybe on Thursday night when we meet regarding the budget with Tony Roselli and members of the city's finance team.

873
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:44,992
[SPEAKER_15]: So Councilor-

874
01:07:46,902 --> 01:07:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table till next week, Mr. President.

875
01:07:48,623 --> 01:07:49,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table till next week.

876
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:52,026
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have some more information, then we'll be able to set up a schedule.

877
01:07:52,046 --> 01:07:52,366
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

878
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:53,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

879
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:54,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect.

880
01:07:54,828 --> 01:07:56,589
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to table.

881
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:57,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

882
01:07:58,231 --> 01:07:59,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by Vice President Caraviello.

883
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:00,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Clerk Bernanke, please call the roll.

884
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:07,898
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the table until next week, so I'll put it back on the agenda.

885
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:09,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

886
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:10,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

887
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:11,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

888
01:08:12,782 --> 01:08:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Caraviello.

889
01:08:13,943 --> 01:08:14,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

890
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:15,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

891
01:08:16,235 --> 01:08:17,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Council marks.

892
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:19,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Council Morell.

893
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's a scapelli.

894
01:08:21,943 --> 01:08:23,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, doesn't falcon.

895
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:25,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 70 affirmative zero negative.

896
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:28,953
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes in the paper has been tabled.

897
01:08:30,914 --> 01:08:47,569
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-395 offered by Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell, whereas many food pickup and delivery apps and websites charge exorbitant fees and commissions that hurt our local restaurants, and whereas these fees may endanger the ability of local restaurants to survive this economic crisis.

898
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:53,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council expresses its support for HD,

899
01:08:54,035 --> 01:09:00,477
[SPEAKER_15]: 5-0-5-4, an act relative to restaurant delivery commissions during the COVID-19 state of emergency.

900
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:12,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation, as well as House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Spilka, and Governor Baker.

901
01:09:13,162 --> 01:09:14,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears with Councilor Morell.

902
01:09:16,063 --> 01:09:17,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

903
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take this one first.

904
01:09:19,184 --> 01:09:21,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know,

905
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:30,339
[SPEAKER_04]: When the app, when web 2.0 and apps and all that stuff started coming and said, you know, we're going to get rid of the middleman between you and everything else.

906
01:09:30,419 --> 01:09:37,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And in reality, what it's done is it's actually created middlemen and Grubhub and Uber Eats and DoorDash are the perfect example.

907
01:09:37,765 --> 01:09:41,888
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 years ago, you want a pizza delivered, you called the restaurant, they delivered your pizza.

908
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:44,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're paying an app 30% to get that pizza.

909
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:47,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, it's kind of ridiculous.

910
01:09:48,595 --> 01:09:50,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to do something to rein it in.

911
01:09:50,456 --> 01:09:54,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's especially tough right now when you have all takeout or delivery.

912
01:09:54,338 --> 01:09:55,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have the in-service dining.

913
01:09:55,938 --> 01:09:57,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Demand is so down for restaurants.

914
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the intent of putting this forward.

915
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:07,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I spoke to Representative Donato over the weekend, and he said that the House has put this into a bill for statewide.

916
01:10:07,243 --> 01:10:10,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So what this bill would have done is let us, locals, communities, decide on this.

917
01:10:11,005 --> 01:10:14,587
[SPEAKER_04]: The House has actually said, we're going to cap it at 15% statewide.

918
01:10:15,147 --> 01:10:17,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are moving that bill forward.

919
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:25,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't moved through the Senate yet, so I think it's still worth us sending this resolution up in support of this concept.

920
01:10:26,374 --> 01:10:39,057
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am encouraged that the State House is planning to do a statewide bill capping these fees at 15%, which should really help out the restaurants who have been, in a sense, getting exploited by these apps.

921
01:10:41,357 --> 01:10:42,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

922
01:10:42,277 --> 01:10:42,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

923
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:44,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

924
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:45,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, Councilor Bears,

925
01:10:46,668 --> 01:10:47,409
[SPEAKER_10]: really said it all.

926
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:51,731
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is just to help our local restaurants that are struggling to survive right now.

927
01:10:51,791 --> 01:11:00,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And as the resolution says, this is can really be the difference between life or death for these local businesses and the way some of these third party apps work.

928
01:11:00,637 --> 01:11:06,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes businesses restaurants actually lose money on individual orders, because of the way the rate fee is structured.

929
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:13,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are restaurants, a lot of them that do have, you know, you call their phone number, you can put in an order, but people are just so

930
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:30,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is just something that I ask our Councilors to show support for our local restaurants and again to this concept as it is kind of like many things in this time.

931
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,443
[SPEAKER_10]: It is moving and shifting and our legislators are taking it up.

932
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:39,827
[SPEAKER_10]: But just to express the support for our local businesses and the movement of this at the state level.

933
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:46,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

934
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:49,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, thank you, Councilor Dez and Councilor Morell for looking into this.

935
01:11:50,066 --> 01:12:02,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I too had a conversation with Representative Donato just about this very same issue and I'm so glad to see that the representatives so focused on making sure that the businesses on our main streets can survive because that's what it's about.

936
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:03,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about our downtowns.

937
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:05,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about Main Street, Mr. President.

938
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:14,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these third party apps don't do anything, but actually take away from the profits of these businesses that are investing in our community.

939
01:12:14,302 --> 01:12:27,126
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when we sit down and, uh, we have a community event, the first people to step up, uh, CB scoops, uh, a meat cheese pizza, um, you know, uh, Roswell's pizza places like that.

940
01:12:27,146 --> 01:12:29,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a minute that anybody picks up the phone and call us.

941
01:12:29,106 --> 01:12:31,267
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other people running there to give us donations.

942
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:31,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean,

943
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:36,849
[SPEAKER_05]: God, Marty Murphy, when Marty Murphy was in business, I think he gave away more food than he sold.

944
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:42,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And these third-party apps, Mr. President, they really take away from that intimacy, number one, in the community.

945
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: But number two, they're taking away from the hard-earned

946
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:52,719
[SPEAKER_05]: the hard-earned spoils that should go to these businesses that have been so committed to making sure that our community is doing well.

947
01:12:53,320 --> 01:13:03,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to put a B paper forward requesting that our Chamber of Commerce investigate maybe a Medford app that chronicles all the food

948
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:13,388
[SPEAKER_05]: in the community that does delivery services and maybe provide an online platform for them to be able to have people audit through, it'll cut out the middleman.

949
01:13:14,028 --> 01:13:22,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a suggestion, Mr. President, that maybe our Chamber of Commerce can take a look at, but I certainly thank my council colleagues for bringing this resolution forward, and I support it wholeheartedly.

950
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:27,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd also like to thank Representative Donato once again for his leadership delivering for Main Street and Methodist.

951
01:13:29,432 --> 01:13:30,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

952
01:13:31,427 --> 01:13:33,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Clerk, do you have the wording of the B paper?

953
01:13:33,568 --> 01:13:34,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it, yes.

954
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:38,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to read it back, or are we good?

955
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:39,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way.

956
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:43,858
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I just want to make sure you have it.

957
01:13:44,559 --> 01:13:45,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I got it.

958
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,120
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, perfect.

959
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,702
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, any other questions from the council?

960
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:49,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes, Councilor Marks.

961
01:13:50,004 --> 01:13:50,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

962
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:52,967
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this up.

963
01:13:55,156 --> 01:14:01,183
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my understanding that this would only apply during the COVID emergency.

964
01:14:01,643 --> 01:14:03,966
[SPEAKER_13]: And once that's lifted, this would no longer apply.

965
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:09,392
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure that's on record and my colleagues are aware of that.

966
01:14:10,193 --> 01:14:13,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And secondly, Mr. President, what actually troubles me more

967
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:26,180
[SPEAKER_13]: than the exorbitant fees that they're charging, to be quite honest with you, is the fact that many of these small business owners have opted to offer discounts if you call them directly.

968
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:39,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And because Grubhub and DoorDash and Uber Eats has such a market power, that they're able to prevent the restaurants from offering their own incentive for people to call them directly.

969
01:14:40,407 --> 01:14:42,289
[SPEAKER_13]: and at a discount.

970
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:51,036
[SPEAKER_13]: So they really have cornered the market, Mr. President, especially now with COVID and the need for delivery and so forth.

971
01:14:52,157 --> 01:15:00,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think anything we can do to help the small business at least get through this timeframe, I think is warranted.

972
01:15:00,424 --> 01:15:02,926
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will support this tonight, Mr. President.

973
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:04,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

974
01:15:04,627 --> 01:15:05,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

975
01:15:06,448 --> 01:15:08,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and to Councilor Marks' point, I think

976
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:21,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to have this for the emergency, but we should maybe try to take this up again after and see if the Commonwealth might give the municipality some authority here to really look at this, because Councilor Marks is right.

977
01:15:21,964 --> 01:15:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just sending millions of dollars a year out of the community through these apps down to Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

978
01:15:27,947 --> 01:15:29,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't need it, we need it.

979
01:15:29,308 --> 01:15:32,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Peters.

980
01:15:32,969 --> 01:15:36,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions or comments regarding this from the Council?

981
01:15:37,351 --> 01:15:38,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Mr. Navarre.

982
01:15:45,446 --> 01:15:47,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say, I support this.

983
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:59,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that if I had my way, and I think most of the councilors would agree, because Councilor Marks was going in this direction.

984
01:16:00,802 --> 01:16:02,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say there should just be no hidden fees.

985
01:16:03,464 --> 01:16:06,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Customers should pay the fee unless the restaurant opts into something else.

986
01:16:08,724 --> 01:16:14,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's no cap, they could charge a million bucks if you want, and the customer has to pay it.

987
01:16:15,365 --> 01:16:15,865
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

988
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:18,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I would do.

989
01:16:18,266 --> 01:16:29,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that, I'd love to see that be sort of a demand, because sometimes I think at Beacon Hill, they like to do these little tweaks and stuff, but if you do this, you don't ever have to tweak it again.

990
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just take care of itself.

991
01:16:33,629 --> 01:16:34,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you, Mr. Navarre.

992
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, let's see.

993
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, then it seems like there's no other questions.

994
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:45,182
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the B paper offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1024
01:17:35,472 --> 01:17:35,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

1025
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1026
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:38,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1027
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:39,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1028
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:40,903
[SPEAKER_03]: President Falco?

1029
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:44,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 70 in favor of zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1030
01:17:44,446 --> 01:18:05,003
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-396 offered by Council of Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city administration take any action possible to ensure that nonprofit daycare and social service organizations have access to small business relief funds being administered or advertised by the city of Medford Council of Bears.

1031
01:18:06,269 --> 01:18:07,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:22,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, I mean, the effects of this economic crisis and the pandemic are, you know, who knows what they're all going to be, but one of them has been already a real decimation of the childcare industry and our daycare industry.

1033
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:28,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really worrying for trying to go back to, you know, new normal or whatever we want to call it.

1034
01:18:28,343 --> 01:18:32,486
[SPEAKER_04]: When schools are open, people are back in work and we have a childcare industry that's in the state that it's in.

1035
01:18:33,367 --> 01:18:35,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all received a message from some folks

1036
01:18:36,023 --> 01:18:38,004
[SPEAKER_04]: who are worried about their own daycare in this city.

1037
01:18:38,764 --> 01:18:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: They've only been able to access some of the government programs and a significant portion of the funds, especially some of the funds that are coming down to municipalities are not able to go to a nonprofit organizations.

1038
01:18:51,369 --> 01:18:57,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So this resolution, one, I know that Tufts has a fund for nonprofits.

1039
01:18:57,272 --> 01:18:58,492
[SPEAKER_04]: They're issuing one time $1,000 grants.

1040
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,751
[SPEAKER_04]: $10,000 is not going to get a daycare very far in terms of payroll and rent and all the things that come with it.

1041
01:19:06,412 --> 01:19:25,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever possible, I've spoken with some folks in the administration and I understand that the law is difficult, but whatever we can do to provide some assistance to our daycares and social service organizations that are really struggling right now, I think the city administration should look into that, you know, with extra attention.

1042
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:29,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, Vice President Cardinal.

1043
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:30,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:33,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank Councilor Bears for bringing this up.

1045
01:19:34,078 --> 01:19:43,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Being on the committee that's working on this, there have been some day kids that have applied for the funding for this.

1046
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:50,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is, I don't think there are any nonprofits, but most of the small businesses in the community

1047
01:19:52,712 --> 01:19:54,153
[SPEAKER_09]: that have been affected have applied.

1048
01:19:55,533 --> 01:20:01,795
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem that we've seen already is we have more applicants than we have funds already.

1049
01:20:02,395 --> 01:20:12,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And if everybody takes the $10,000 that's out there, unless there's a second round of funding, they're going to have to say no to some people.

1050
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:18,820
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want the Councilor Bezos to know there were some daycare centers that were on there and they have applied for the funding.

1051
01:20:20,476 --> 01:20:21,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1052
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:24,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

1053
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:26,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

1054
01:20:28,059 --> 01:20:29,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1055
01:20:30,299 --> 01:20:34,661
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1056
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:36,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Clerk Cunningham, please call the roll.

1057
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:38,202

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1059
01:20:39,863 --> 01:20:40,783

1062
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:43,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1063
01:20:44,104 --> 01:20:44,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

1064
01:20:45,064 --> 01:20:45,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1065
01:20:45,905 --> 01:20:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell?

1066
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:47,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1067
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:48,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1068
01:20:49,121 --> 01:20:49,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1069
01:20:49,722 --> 01:20:50,522
[SPEAKER_03]: President Falco.

1070
01:20:51,483 --> 01:20:56,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1071
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:58,469
[SPEAKER_15]: 2-0-397 offered by Councilor Morell.

1072
01:20:59,029 --> 01:21:14,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence for the more than 100,000 Americans we have lost to coronavirus in to mark the June 1st National Day of Mourning and Lament.

1073
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:16,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell.

1074
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1075
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:30,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I had several community members reach out to me and I'm sure my fellow Councilors about this day of mourning, um, that was actually yesterday, uh, to mark the terrible loss of more than 100,000 American, I'm sorry, 100,000 Americans.

1076
01:21:31,204 --> 01:21:38,085
[SPEAKER_10]: So losses that have likely touched every single one of us, um, through our friends, our family, our colleagues and our community members.

1077
01:21:38,366 --> 01:21:43,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it's worth noting that the coronavirus has been particularly deadly to already marginalized members of our communities.

1078
01:21:44,348 --> 01:21:49,852
[SPEAKER_10]: the elderly in care homes, communities of color, those living in poverty.

1079
01:21:50,513 --> 01:22:09,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think we must take the time as we have in previous meetings to mourn those that we've lost and to make a promise to ourselves to do better by those communities that are facing disproportionate impacts of this virus and this disease.

1080
01:22:15,475 --> 01:22:16,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilmember?

1081
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:20,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that results from it?

1082
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:23,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see George moving.

1083
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:28,465
[SPEAKER_10]: We lost you for about maybe 15 seconds, sorry.

1084
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:31,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, figures.

1085
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:39,674
[SPEAKER_10]: But as I was saying, I'll pick up somewhere in the middle, but the... Are you guys frozen again?

1086
01:22:41,296 --> 01:22:41,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1087
01:22:41,616 --> 01:22:42,116
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we can hear you.

1088
01:22:42,136 --> 01:22:44,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, everyone stop moving, sorry.

1089
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:53,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So the coronavirus has been particularly deadly to already marginalized members of our community, elderly in care homes, communities of color, those living in poverty.

1090
01:22:53,392 --> 01:23:14,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just ask that we take a moment, as we have a few weeks in a row, but now the cumulative number of those lost, just to mourn those that have been lost and especially make a promise to ourselves to do better by those communities that are facing disproportionate impacts of this disease, because they have to be in the front lines, because they live in crowded housing, because they live in polluted neighborhoods.

1091
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:21,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do have I do know we have at least one community member here that wants to speak after any councilor members Want to add anything?

1092
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:29,064
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank you all for considering this Thank You councilor Morell council appears Thank You.

1093
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:29,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1094
01:23:29,764 --> 01:23:36,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean The scope of this tragedy and the impact on the Medford community and our entire country.

1095
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:39,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I Don't think we're we I don't think it's set in yet.

1096
01:23:40,471 --> 01:23:42,753
[SPEAKER_04]: We've lost a hundred thousand people across the country and

1097
01:23:43,165 --> 01:23:45,946
[SPEAKER_04]: We've lost over 100 people just in nursing homes here in Medford.

1098
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:58,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Councilor Morell's point, especially about who's been impacted and the communities that have been hit hardest, you know, this has been a difficult couple months and then the difficult couple weeks too.

1099
01:23:59,052 --> 01:24:09,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, communities of color, low income communities, environmental justice communities that have really been hurt by the coronavirus crisis are now also, you know, facing the emotional hurt and the

1100
01:24:10,157 --> 01:24:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: and the real pain of these protests and the protests against the murders of black men.

1101
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is a time of mourning.

1102
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:25,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, it's hard for me to even put into words what we're going through as a nation right now.

1103
01:24:25,904 --> 01:24:29,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just glad that we residents and people are taking the time to mourn.

1104
01:24:29,746 --> 01:24:34,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to have to talk about it more and more over the next few months and years.

1105
01:24:36,809 --> 01:24:37,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, council members.

1106
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:39,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other comments from the council?

1107
01:24:40,813 --> 01:24:44,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Council Member Earl, you mentioned that someone wanted to speak on this?

1108
01:24:45,017 --> 01:24:49,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think Judy is in the audience.

1109
01:24:49,101 --> 01:24:50,702
[SPEAKER_10]: She reached out about this.

1110
01:24:55,092 --> 01:24:56,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1111
01:24:57,393 --> 01:25:11,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a retired chaplain, and as Councilor bears said sometimes these losses are hard to put into words and I'm conscious of how important ritual is for helping us all to cope with grief and loss.

1112
01:25:11,781 --> 01:25:14,343
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate the council's

1113
01:25:15,163 --> 01:25:31,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say thank you to all of you for your receptivity and especially Councilor Beres and Councilor Morell for offering this opportunity as a community for us to remember who and what we've lost and to have some opportunity for community greeting.

1114
01:25:32,037 --> 01:25:32,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1115
01:25:44,581 --> 01:25:46,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, somebody else wants to speak, I believe.

1116
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:47,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1117
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:49,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, wait, I apologize.

1118
01:25:50,467 --> 01:25:50,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1119
01:25:50,867 --> 01:25:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Jess Sparrow had her hand raised.

1120
01:25:53,049 --> 01:25:53,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

1121
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:53,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1122
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:03,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to unmute her.

1123
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:19,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi, I am sorry.

1124
01:26:19,225 --> 01:26:20,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have anything to say.

1125
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:24,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just expressing my agreement with other things that were happening.

1189
01:29:40,594 --> 01:29:46,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Silverstein from KP Law highlighted items that still needed to be addressed.

1190
01:29:47,379 --> 01:29:54,886

1191
01:29:55,886 --> 01:29:58,689

[SPEAKER_13]: No, Mr. President, if I could.

1198
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:13,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.

1199
01:30:14,731 --> 01:30:31,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, you know, this has been a long process, you know, and I think we're all proud, I think I speak for everyone, of the end results of many, many months and years of hard work.

1200
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:43,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to personally thank where this all started, which was the Zoning Subcommittee, and it was led by Vice President Caraviello with members Scarpelli and Knight.

1201
01:30:43,948 --> 01:30:46,472
[SPEAKER_13]: They did yeoman's work putting together a document that was

1202
01:30:47,232 --> 01:30:49,994
[SPEAKER_13]: really complex and a lot of moving parts.

1203
01:30:50,714 --> 01:30:55,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we came out with a document that fits this city.

1204
01:30:56,297 --> 01:30:58,899
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a cookie cutter document.

1205
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:02,441
[SPEAKER_13]: This is unique to the city of Medford and how it applies.

1206
01:31:03,141 --> 01:31:05,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it works well within our community.

1207
01:31:06,263 --> 01:31:08,684
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows establishments to come in.

1208
01:31:09,205 --> 01:31:10,966
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows them to flourish.

1209
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,648
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also addresses the will of the general public,

1210
01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:20,673
[SPEAKER_13]: voted a majority to allow marijuana shops within the city of Medford.

1211
01:31:21,194 --> 01:31:23,736
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank your leadership, Mr. President.

1212
01:31:24,177 --> 01:31:26,679
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this got a little contentious with some of the issues.

1213
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:34,527
[SPEAKER_13]: You kept us on path, and I think we came out with a document that really I feel very comfortable with.

1214
01:31:35,728 --> 01:31:37,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to thank my colleagues.

1215
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:39,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1216
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:42,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, if we could thank President Falco.

1217
01:31:42,051 --> 01:31:45,052
[SPEAKER_09]: He was on the committee, I think, for the first two years.

1218
01:31:45,892 --> 01:31:55,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the zoning committee's had a number of reiterations through the whole process.

1219
01:31:55,435 --> 01:31:56,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks, thank you very much.

1220
01:31:56,776 --> 01:31:57,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

1221
01:31:57,516 --> 01:31:58,656
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you, everyone.

1222
01:31:59,316 --> 01:32:04,958
[SPEAKER_15]: This really has been a team effort, but I really feel like

1223
01:32:05,742 --> 01:32:08,244
[SPEAKER_15]: we kind of really vetted everything and looked at everything.

1224
01:32:08,544 --> 01:32:14,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel like the, you know, the finished product is going to be something that's really good.

1225
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:27,740
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think, you know, we went through all the, like you mentioned earlier, Vice President Caraviello, it's been years and I think a lot of input went into it and a lot of time and effort and energy.

1226
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And they thank everyone for their hard work on this.

1227
01:32:30,543 --> 01:32:30,663
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

1228
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:36,189
[SPEAKER_15]: On the vote for the committee report on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by?
