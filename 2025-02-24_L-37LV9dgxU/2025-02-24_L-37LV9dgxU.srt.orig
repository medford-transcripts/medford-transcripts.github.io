[SPEAKER_16]: So 14 in the affirmative.

71
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Jenny, I think you skipped me.

72
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:57,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

73
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:58,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I came back in.

74
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I just need my permissions back to be able to unmute myself and turn my video on because I switched devices.

75
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:11,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so 14 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

76
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:12,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Minutes are approved.

77
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:20,159
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get the other two minutes on the next agenda and we'll take care of those then.

78
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,897
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a couple of things to do this evening.

79
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:30,081
[SPEAKER_16]: The first is I wanted to provide an update on phase one of the MSBA process.

80
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:32,382
[SPEAKER_16]: So as you know, we've been in the eligibility phase.

81
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:38,006
[SPEAKER_16]: We submitted all of our deliverables back in July.

82
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:46,771
[SPEAKER_16]: And over the course of the rest of the summer and into the fall, we were working with the MSBA to look at and certify our enrollment totals.

83
00:03:48,987 --> 00:04:02,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Those totals, you know, that sort of set stage for how big of a high school we're planning for and there was some back and forth between us and the folks.

84
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:13,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, who did their own enrollment study and then really just sort of get to know Medford and some of our plans around, um, things like housing growth and student.

85
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:21,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, student growth and what we were seeing, so that went so we had to sort of go back and forth with them.

86
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:26,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and we finished that process in, um.

87
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,230
[SPEAKER_16]: you know sometimes we finished our end of that process in August.

88
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,832
[SPEAKER_16]: The MSBA had work to do on their end.

89
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:45,179
[SPEAKER_16]: So they did they did their work and then they notified us in December that they forwarded us an agreement to sign around the enrollment.

90
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:55,426
[SPEAKER_16]: So just by way of some information we have about 1,200 students right now and that's been pretty consistent for high school for the high school side.

91
00:04:56,186 --> 00:05:17,039
[SPEAKER_16]: We requested an enrollment of 1,500 for high school, and we settled on 1,395, which is almost 200 students more than our current 1,200.

92
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,242
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was a lot of growth and progress for us, which I think sets us up well for the

93
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:48,553
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the, the future and the kinds of things that we're expecting to see here in Medford, both with, um, attracting students who may be selecting other high schools, um, in part, because they go to the building and they see it and they have questions about whether that's the place they want to be, um, as well as, um, providing for, um, expanded, um, families moving into Medford, um, who will want to use the, who will want to use the, um,

94
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,269
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, the high school as a place to send their children.

95
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,772
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have some room to grow, which is great and amazing.

96
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:02,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and, um, we signed that we signed those agreements.

97
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:12,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we have signed, um, um, Dr. Cushing, maybe we could disable the chat as well.

98
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:12,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

99
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:14,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I will now as well.

100
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, thank you.

101
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:17,869
[SPEAKER_16]: And,

102
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:27,079
[SPEAKER_16]: We are done with the MSBA Module 1 work.

103
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:45,683
[SPEAKER_16]: On Wednesday, the board of the MSBA will hear a recommendation from their staff to move us on to what they call Phase 2 or Module 2, which is where we get to start doing the fun things like bringing on the professionals that will help us through this process.

104
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,488
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're really excited about that.

105
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:59,036
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, that meeting will happen, um, Wednesday morning, and then, um, there will be meetings to onboard us to MSBA's expectations of the process.

106
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:00,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Um.

107
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:09,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Shortly thereafter, um, our delegation has sent the MSBA a letter of support on our behalf.

108
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:16,570
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was signed by, um, Senator Jalen, representatives Donato, Barbara, and, um.

109
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:26,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Garbalee, so the MSBA is in receipt of that letter of recommendation and we're just really excited to be able to do this next thing.

110
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,252
[SPEAKER_16]: We're so excited, in fact, that we have already started doing the next thing.

111
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:41,416
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of the meetings that we had earlier this month was of the OPM selection committee who tackled building

112
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:48,799
[SPEAKER_16]: the request for services, which is the very first document in the next phase of the process.

113
00:07:49,820 --> 00:08:01,309
[SPEAKER_16]: We will review that tonight with a goal to make any amendments that this committee sees fit and get ready to send that to the MSBA tomorrow.

114
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:11,918
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to send that to them tomorrow so that we can be in the queue for their review, which takes about two weeks, and then we can move forward on an aggressive timeline.

115
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:22,598
[SPEAKER_16]: which will, um, have us, um, interviewing and bringing in, um, uh, an owner's project manager here before the end of June.

116
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,219
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, it's a, it's a quick time.

117
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,579
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a quick tight timeline.

118
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:31,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish it could be even faster than that because getting the team on board is incredibly important.

119
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,461
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's, you know, that's when the real work can begin.

120
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:41,422
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, the educators have sort of done their work, um, so far with setting the stage around what kind of,

121
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,413
[SPEAKER_16]: educational opportunities we're trying to provide.

122
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:52,102
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we get to the sort of meaty questions that everyone in the community has, which is really exciting.

123
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:56,026
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a quick update on phase one.

124
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:57,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any questions?

125
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:12,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

126
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:18,211
[SPEAKER_16]: If you think of anything, just, um, let me know and we will, um, we will move on from there.

127
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:25,897
[SPEAKER_16]: So in phase two, our next agenda item is, um, is, uh, our plans for phase two.

128
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:38,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I covered some of that already, but the, the goal is for us to be, um, moving quickly through this process so that we can onboard the team and really get, um, to the meat of the feasibility study.

129
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Oh, Emily, did you have a question?

130
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:48,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, yes.

131
00:09:48,543 --> 00:10:10,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to ask really quickly if you could tell me about the estimated number for how, so I was reading through and the estimates for how many students would be housed in the building, what the timeline is for that, like how, what the stretch of time was that was anticipated for the building to be used.

132
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they that's a great question.

133
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:16,646
[SPEAKER_16]: So they, they did a study that looked out.

134
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,027
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to say it was about 15 years.

135
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:25,868
[SPEAKER_16]: And 1 of the things that we went back and forth with them about was exactly that that range.

136
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:26,228
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

137
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:31,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Our enrollment projections within MPS show that.

138
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:57,989
[SPEAKER_16]: mostly in agreement in the first 10 to 15 years of the building's life or from now but that you know as we looked out past 15 years that's where we saw the growth that was more significant so that was part of the conversation that we had particularly around some of the housing developments that are coming down the pike and

139
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:06,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Not just like the planned projects and the permitted projects, which they ask about explicitly, but also some of the bigger.

140
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:17,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Ideas and places where we are anticipating there could be substantial transformative projects in the city, like the air rights over Wellington.

141
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:22,697
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are the kinds of things that we had to go through with them to.

142
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:27,484
[SPEAKER_16]: sort of describe and look at.

143
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:37,710
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we shared our projections with them and our projections sort of carry us much further into time than that original 15 year span.

144
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,352
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did make some significant progress there.

145
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:53,700
[SPEAKER_16]: So I do believe that based on everything that we were able to use as the basis, we will not be out of space the minute we start or even, you know, in the first couple of decades.

146
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:56,967
[SPEAKER_16]: which is great news.

147
00:11:56,987 --> 00:12:00,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions about that?

148
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:10,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so in phase two, there's a couple of things.

149
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:18,603
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been doing a lot of reading and the OPM selection committee has been doing a lot of reading as well about what phase two entails.

150
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:23,586
[SPEAKER_16]: And it entails, you know, bringing on the owner's project manager.

151
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,188
[SPEAKER_16]: MSBA has a very prescriptive process for that.

152
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,969
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been reading about that process.

153
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,932
[SPEAKER_16]: The very first step is that we have to draft an RFS.

154
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,213
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll look at that in just a few minutes.

155
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:42,256
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they will have to review that it takes them a couple of weeks to review it and then they'll give us the green light to go ahead and post it.

156
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:43,836
[SPEAKER_16]: It has to be posted.

157
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,497
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to do a site visit.

158
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:49,138
[SPEAKER_16]: We will get responses back and.

159
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:56,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, bring the list down to a short list, interview candidates, and make a selection.

160
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:02,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Once we make a selection, we negotiate the price.

161
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,182
[SPEAKER_16]: At that point, that's not part of the RFS process.

162
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:09,765
[SPEAKER_16]: It happens afterwards, which was a surprise to me.

163
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:12,488
[SPEAKER_16]: That's most of the RFPs that I work on in my world.

164
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:14,770
[SPEAKER_16]: They're sort of two things happen at the same time.

165
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,352
[SPEAKER_16]: But this process is a little bit different.

166
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:32,778
[SPEAKER_16]: And once we have made our selection and we have done those negotiations, we then have to bring our selected OPM to a review panel with MSBA and they have to give us the green light for that selection.

167
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:41,962
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is a, those review panel meetings happen on a monthly basis and we are targeting the June meeting to be

168
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,611
[SPEAKER_16]: all buttoned up and ready to go to get their approval so we can move forward.

169
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:58,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Once the OPM is on board, then we work to bring on the designer, which is the architect, so that we can get ready to start the feasibility study.

170
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:06,821
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's sort of the trajectory of this next phase is OPM, designer, and then we actually get to the fun stuff.

171
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:17,471
[SPEAKER_16]: but I'm looking forward to having the OPM on board because they will help manage some of the things that we are doing here as a committee, some of the outreach and that kind of thing.

172
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,552
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, we will, we will look forward to that.

173
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:25,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions about phase two process?

174
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:34,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

175
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:35,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

176
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:42,707
[SPEAKER_16]: I am going to share my screen if I am allowed to do that Dr. Cushing.

177
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:46,032
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good to go.

178
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:47,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

179
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,992
[SPEAKER_16]: And I am going to bring up this RFS template.

180
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:59,796
[SPEAKER_16]: I think a couple of things to know about this template is you must use this template.

181
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,958
[SPEAKER_16]: This is part of the process and the requirement from MSBA.

182
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:15,623
[SPEAKER_16]: And they've done a pretty nice job of being able to describe what it is that they're asking for communities to provide input to.

183
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:27,897
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit hard to look at this document because it is in track change mode.

184
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:32,301
[SPEAKER_16]: So if that makes you a little bit crazy, I apologize.

185
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:39,847
[SPEAKER_16]: That is also a requirement of MSBA so that they can quickly and easily find the changes that we've made.

186
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:48,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Here is our RFS, there's a whole bunch of lead-in information here, and then we get to the actual meet.

187
00:15:48,555 --> 00:16:09,048
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as you can see, everything that is in bold and in italics, that's where they're asking us to provide input, and everything that's struck out and filled in with comments and track changes that were the result of the work that the OPM Selection Subcommittee did.

188
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,412
[SPEAKER_16]: So this introduction is obviously very boilerplate.

189
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,093
[SPEAKER_16]: We're saying, this is Medford.

190
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,054
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Medford high school, that kind of thing.

191
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:21,016
[SPEAKER_16]: So those changes have been made.

192
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:28,399
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there is the other thing that we are asked to talk about here in this introduction.

193
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops, sorry.

194
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, are sort of what we think the total cost of the project.

195
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:44,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Could be, and this is an estimate, and it's, I think, an effort to give an understanding of.

196
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:48,341
[SPEAKER_16]: How big do we think the scope of this could be and so the.

197
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:56,856
[SPEAKER_16]: OPM selection committee identified 200 million to 600 million as a very wide range.

198
00:16:57,877 --> 00:17:00,998
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a wide range because there's a lot of unknown right now.

199
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:10,623
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also a very wide range because any number of solutions could be viable for us and we don't know yet which of those solutions

200
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:17,708
[SPEAKER_16]: from building something completely new to substantially renovating what we have.

201
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:20,488
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't yet know how that will shake out.

202
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,489
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what the feasibility study is for.

203
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,389
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is what we came up with.

204
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:34,731
[SPEAKER_16]: And to me, it's just a signal for those folks who are watching that we understand that there could be any number of solutions here.

205
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:39,572
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are wanting and interested in exploring them all.

206
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:55,496
[SPEAKER_16]: The background is the next section and I will leave this up just for you to read it and I will happily read it out loud to provide a little bit of information about the background of this project.

207
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:03,874
[SPEAKER_16]: The city of Medford located in the greater Boston area is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence.

208
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:12,641
[SPEAKER_16]: The district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world.

209
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:19,287
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford High School, established in the mid-20th century, has served as a cornerstone of the city community's financial infrastructure.

210
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:26,475
[SPEAKER_16]: However, over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators, or the broader community.

211
00:18:27,035 --> 00:18:35,925
[SPEAKER_16]: The facility's aging systems, limited space, and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to the high school campus.

212
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:48,127
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford Comprehensive School Building Committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives, and community members with a variety of backgrounds.

213
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:56,756
[SPEAKER_16]: The committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning and execution of the Medford High School project, ensuring that it meets academic, social, and safety needs of students.

214
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:11,585
[SPEAKER_16]: The committee has brought support to also pursue expansion of its portfolio of Chapter 74 programs, its early childhood programs, and to co-locate the current Curtis-Tufts program to increase access to student activities for students at the Curtis-Tufts.

215
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:20,109
[SPEAKER_16]: The district's grade configuration includes elementary schools K-5, middle schools 6-8, and the high school 9-12.

216
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:25,232
[SPEAKER_16]: The existing high school facility now serves approximately 1,200 students and is expected to see future growth.

217
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:33,858
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, fine and performing arts spaces and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large.

218
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:41,043
[SPEAKER_16]: The district is also pursuing consolidation of our early childhood programming into a single location to alleviate space concerns that are for elementary schools.

219
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:52,567
[SPEAKER_16]: As part of an ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the member of public schools submitted a statement of interest to the highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building shortcomings.

220
00:19:53,067 --> 00:20:00,269
[SPEAKER_16]: The accepted serves as a reference for the current project and outlines the key areas of concern, such as structural integrity.

221
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:03,591
[SPEAKER_16]: accessibility, energy efficiency, and technology integration.

222
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:11,675
[SPEAKER_16]: The project aim is to not only enhance the learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come.

223
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:22,382
[SPEAKER_16]: This request for services seeks to engage a qualified owners project manager who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise in design, construction, and project management.

224
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:38,353
[SPEAKER_16]: The goal is to create a state-of-the-art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration, and academic excellence, and do the project with substantial community input from the community at large and specifically from the students and staff who will work, learn, and thrive in the new building.

225
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:45,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Questions or comments about anything that you've seen so far?

226
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:56,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

227
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:06,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we'll move on the project description objectives and scope of service have some sort of small things.

228
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:29,186
[SPEAKER_16]: that we had to fill in, and then we were asked to provide some specific information regarding the identified school, including but not limited to total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building, and or site, if any, building conditions and problems, current grade structure, enrollment, and MSBA agreed upon enrollment.

229
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:43,947
[SPEAKER_16]: So in this section, we've added some information to answer that request, which says the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School complex was constructed during the late 60s and opened in the fall of 1970.

230
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:45,089
[SPEAKER_16]: From its opening in

231
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:52,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Until 2017, it housed 2 distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

232
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:56,988
[SPEAKER_16]: In 2017, the Medford School Committee voted to merge the 2 schools into 1 comprehensive high school.

233
00:21:57,348 --> 00:22:08,418
[SPEAKER_16]: But despite the forward-looking vision aimed at establishing 1 flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the Medford community, the facility is designed for delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s.

234
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:17,921
[SPEAKER_16]: The challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated with increasing severity by infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable.

235
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:27,204
[SPEAKER_16]: MPS envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programs and a host of vocational programs sanctioned under Chapter 74.

236
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:32,105
[SPEAKER_16]: The 55-year-old aging facility housing MHS is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions.

237
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:44,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford High School currently serves a combined 1210 students in grades 9 to 12. we also support students in project transition aged 18 to 22 over 50% of our high school students are CTE students.

238
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:46,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, the Medford.

239
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:58,561
[SPEAKER_16]: A pre-K program that includes 100 students and a daycare for children's ages two months to five years has an enrollment of 74 students.

240
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:03,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Together, the total enrollment of students at MHS is 84.

241
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:07,306
[SPEAKER_16]: So we should fix that number.

242
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:08,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I will fix that.

243
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,651
[SPEAKER_16]: The district's agreed upon enrollment for the projection for a new Medford High School is

244
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:29,941
[SPEAKER_16]: 1695 of this figure, 1395 are 9 to 12 high school students, 200 are pre-k students, and 100 are students in the district state care program.

245
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions about that section?

246
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:41,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

247
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:48,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Project objectives under consideration by the owner.

248
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:58,461
[SPEAKER_16]: So this, this section actually was a place where we had a lot of discussion in our subcommittee meeting around, like, what are the things that we want to call out?

249
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,722
[SPEAKER_16]: We, so we've made this list.

250
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:10,245
[SPEAKER_16]: I also, in my work to sort of tighten up a few things, did take a peek at a couple of other RFSs from other communities.

251
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So this list is very much open for,

252
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:22,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Suggestion and questions, if we, if there's anything else we want to add that helps people understand sort of what we're trying to do.

253
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:33,272
[SPEAKER_16]: So we talk about the Northeast collaborative for high performance schools and or the US Green Building Council's lead for schools rating system qualification and analysis of potential.

254
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:42,373
[SPEAKER_16]: To be a net zero energy building life cycle costs of operational of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets.

255
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,055
[SPEAKER_16]: We are interested in a CM at risk delivery method.

256
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:51,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Potentially we have identified potential other sites.

257
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:55,162
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a vetting process that our is going to need to be aware of.

258
00:24:56,298 --> 00:25:03,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property if a new if a new project remains in the current place.

259
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:09,944
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as, you know, there's 1 way in and 1 way out of Medford high and that is a significant sort of.

260
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:15,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Bottleneck as we flow people in and out of the building, so we would want to be looking at that.

261
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:24,303
[SPEAKER_16]: update the serving existing condition information of buildings on the Medford High site, including any hazardous materials.

262
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:29,887
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's any number of things that could happen on the campus that they have to be aware of.

263
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:39,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Provide design alternatives for renovation, addition, renovation, and new construction options for the high school to meet the educational specification of the school building committee and the MSBA.

264
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:48,541
[SPEAKER_16]: provide a schedule, construction cost estimate, operating cost estimate, and life cycle sustainability analysis for each option.

265
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:55,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Constraints of the district, it's assumed that school will be in session on this site for the duration of the project.

266
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:59,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So phase construction and possible use of swing space may be required.

267
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:08,017
[SPEAKER_16]: And then under that bullet, I think the other things that we've talked a lot about is like we will have some extra work to do from a planning perspective.

268
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:13,706
[SPEAKER_16]: To ensure learning continuity for all students, but particularly for our vocational programs.

269
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:18,433
[SPEAKER_16]: We may need to purchase.

270
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:28,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Modular something to support this project, depending on what happens and we know that that's a thing that we might need to consider.

271
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:41,857
[SPEAKER_16]: We might need to provide and maintain a, you know, we will need to provide and maintain a secure and positive educational environment during construction and then also sort of seeking somebody that has some experience with phase construction projects.

272
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:42,177
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

273
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:50,738
[SPEAKER_16]: That is sort of the list of things that the OPM Selection Committee came up with.

274
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:56,561
[SPEAKER_16]: If there are any other thoughts or suggestions here, I'm happy to take them.

275
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:12,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Alongside LEED, there's another similar certification that's called WELL certification, W-E-L-L, that is a more kind of holistic look at

276
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:21,024
[SPEAKER_03]: the health and sustainability of the project that takes the user into account and not just the sustainability of the building.

277
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:24,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something to consider as well.

278
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,588
[SPEAKER_02]: W-E-L-L, Marista?

279
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

280
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:28,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

281
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

282
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Perfect.

283
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I added that.

284
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:39,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I put a minor edit in the chat just to button up the CN at-risk delivery method bullet.

285
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:40,018
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

286
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:56,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Updating evaluation of CM at risk delivery method, including a final recommendation.

287
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Philip.

288
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,101
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

289
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:10,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll put a note in there just about the notes of life cycle slash sustainability.

290
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I just lost the exact language, but.

291
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:16,447
[SPEAKER_10]: like life cycle analysis versus life cycle costs.

292
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:18,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, those are two different things.

293
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:21,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to make sure we are stating the one that we want.

294
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to put something in the chat about that.

295
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:24,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

296
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:26,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Libby.

297
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

298
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:40,018
[SPEAKER_13]: The site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property to the public roads or something, just something minor like that.

299
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:49,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you that any potential alternative alternate sites just.

300
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:53,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd finish that and just say, like, for construction of new high school facility.

301
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:57,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to tell him what the alternative sites for.

302
00:28:57,106 --> 00:29:02,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

303
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:14,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions there.

304
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:38,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so the next section that requires our attention is the evaluation criteria.

305
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:48,091
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in this section, we had a lot of discussion about this as well and you can see that a lot of this does come from.

306
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,187
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, come from MSBA's template.

307
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,708
[SPEAKER_16]: The text in green was added.

308
00:29:56,489 --> 00:30:06,296
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing that we talked a lot about was the point scale, and this will be used by the OPM Selection Committee to rate and evaluate all the bids that we receive.

309
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:16,202
[SPEAKER_16]: And sort of the calculus of how we put this together was to award

310
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:22,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, standard sort of thresholds of points for different things that range from, like.

311
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:31,865
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to have this, but it's very likely everyone's going to have this skill to, um, the, the more customized things at higher number of points.

312
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:32,305
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

313
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:43,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, if you look at this, what you'll see is some 10 point option, some 10 point items to me, those are things that feel very, uh, like.

314
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,490
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, sort of table stake key, right?

315
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:51,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Like an, who is doing this work all the time is more than likely going to have those things.

316
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:58,000
[SPEAKER_16]: The 20 point scale sort of steps up a little bit where now there is some variability and.

317
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:02,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Discretion in terms of how those things might get delivered.

318
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:08,968
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 points does talk a little bit more about.

319
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:10,730
[SPEAKER_16]: You know.

320
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,882
[SPEAKER_16]: their overall capacity to do these kinds of projects.

321
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:28,873
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, sort of some bigger point values around key personnel who will work with us at 40 points, as well as 50 points for past performance.

322
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:35,277
[SPEAKER_16]: And I stole this from Arlington, which you can see, so I'll fix that.

323
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:36,298
[SPEAKER_16]: St.

324
00:31:36,318 --> 00:31:36,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford.

325
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:37,599
[SPEAKER_16]: So,

326
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:44,528
[SPEAKER_16]: The selection committee felt like this sort of point allocation.

327
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:51,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Worked, but I would be very curious if there's anyone in the room who has other thoughts or suggestions about.

328
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,832
[SPEAKER_16]: About that, because now is the time to sort of set that methodology in place.

329
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:07,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Question you add minor points like 5 or 10 or anything like that for.

330
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:11,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Cost evaluation?

331
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:11,416
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

332
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:24,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we have learned through this process so far is that there is no cost response that comes with bids.

333
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:33,569
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a process where we evaluate, it's a value-based contract.

334
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:35,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And once you select somebody,

335
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:40,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you move into a phase where you negotiate with them and you talk about price.

336
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:53,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Having said that part of the documents that will be delivered with this are all of the public exhibits with MSPA and it's well on record that we have a certain.

337
00:32:54,785 --> 00:33:04,989
[SPEAKER_16]: amount of money set aside for the feasibility study, which we had to break down to say this much is for the OPM, this much is for the designer, and this much is for incidental.

338
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:22,657
[SPEAKER_16]: So all of that will be well known to people in terms of what our scope and budget is, but my understanding is that all of that price conversation comes after you make your selection first, which is a little bit unusual, but that's how this process works.

339
00:33:34,955 --> 00:33:38,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question on the section just slightly above, if you don't mind.

340
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:38,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

341
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:39,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back up a little.

342
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:51,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Above the durations for the feasibility phase and stuff, there's a sentence that says, the work is divided into the project phases as listed in attachment A of this contract.

343
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:53,374
[SPEAKER_13]: I clicked on attachment A in the PDF.

344
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:58,816
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see any work, any project phases in that attachment.

345
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I just don't know if I missed it or.

346
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:04,478
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a handful of, yeah, you, you didn't miss it.

347
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:05,198
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not there.

348
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:15,522
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a handful of other attachments that need to come together with this that are provided by MSBA that are not here right now, but they, we will have to provide those as well.

349
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:36,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions about the evaluation points and methodology?

350
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:44,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's a lot of, like, meat to take in.

351
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:59,135
[SPEAKER_16]: The next section does talk about a shortlist, and Philip, to your question about cost, this is where I thought that the cost conversation would happen is once you get to the shortlist and you're evaluating the

352
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:03,288
[SPEAKER_16]: proposals, and even then, that's not what happens in this process.

353
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:19,160
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically, once we get down to the short list of candidates and we invite them in for finalist interviews, the scale there is the quality of the reference checks for 30 points and 70 points for the quality of the finalist presentation.

354
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:25,425
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you have to make a selection before you get into that cost discussion.

355
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:29,088
[SPEAKER_16]: So that has been edited and updated based on some of the work the team

356
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:34,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Has done since our meeting to get clarification on that.

357
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:42,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Much of this is.

358
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:58,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Boilerplate and the next the next component of the of what is here is the list of who who is on the committee.

359
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:04,763
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to name those folks and talk a little bit about some of the details of what we plan to do.

360
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:16,869
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of how the shortlist will be done, so we're planning for 2 hour interviews and then how how we will actually negotiate.

361
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:28,678
[SPEAKER_16]: The, the price, and so I actually did steal from Arlington from Arlington's in terms of how we will do this, but essentially the chair of the.

362
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:40,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, review committee, the CFO of NPS, the superintendent and the budget director work together to negotiate a fee, um, with the 1st ranked, um, respondent.

363
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:40,722
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

364
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:47,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, all the rest of this came from Arlington, um, their RFS went through the same process.

365
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:51,889
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, um, I felt good about sort of pulling all of that in.

366
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:57,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and, um.

367
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:04,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Then the next thing that is outlined here is a timeline.

368
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:15,006
[SPEAKER_16]: So this timeline does assume that it will take the MSBA two weeks from Wednesday, essentially, to do their review.

369
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,327
[SPEAKER_16]: And it takes us about a week to get things posted.

370
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,631
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, from a procurement perspective.

371
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:31,816
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've given us a week of buffer, um, and then, uh, have sort of cascaded from there through, um, the series of activities and tried to plan.

372
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:35,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you'll see, there's like sort of a gap right in here.

373
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:43,863
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, that gap is, um, certainly, um, due to April vacation, um, knowing that that is a really hard time for people.

374
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:44,023
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

375
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:57,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I felt okay about that, especially because the OPM review panel meeting that we would be eligible to attend is not until 6-2, so we had plenty of time to navigate that April vacation timeframe.

376
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:05,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions about the timeline?

377
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:27,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, just about everything else is sort of filling in the name of our procurement officer.

378
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:33,008
[SPEAKER_16]: And, oh, sorry, Phil, did you have a question?

379
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:34,049
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Paul.

380
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you go back up a little bit?

381
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:35,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

382
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:42,914
[SPEAKER_13]: The part with Fiona, you had some, I just noticed that after her name is actually, yeah.

383
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:44,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

384
00:38:53,977 --> 00:39:05,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenny I just had some, um, I can take offline but just some logistics as far as, um, you know, how will advertise it and how responses and that sort of stuff.

385
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:09,011
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to boggle down the whole group but we can chat about that.

386
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,954
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a question as well about certifications.

387
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:21,696
[SPEAKER_16]: So there was a in here it's asked if we asked us to say what certifications we require.

388
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:27,138
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did a little bit of sleuthing and did talk to our legal counsel as well.

389
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:34,021
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is very similar to what Arlington articulated.

390
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:35,642
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think there's anything

391
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:44,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, particularly specific here that we need to require, um, instead to ask them what their certifications are.

392
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:56,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I would actually, if anybody who is more in this world than I am has any suggestions, if there's anything specific there, I'm happy to take those suggestions.

393
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

394
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:13,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

395
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:17,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that is just about everything that was changed.

396
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:18,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Paul?

397
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:19,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Scroll back up.

398
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one with Diona right there.

399
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:32,948
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very hard to, I love track changes, but at some point it gets to be like too much.

400
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:38,710
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll clean up the formatting and everything once the MSBA weighs in.

401
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:46,607
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, we will provide people our statement of interest.

402
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:50,009
[SPEAKER_16]: We will provide them our educational profile and our Chapter 74 forms.

403
00:40:50,429 --> 00:41:01,055
[SPEAKER_16]: All of those things will go with the package in addition to the forms that and contracts that MSBA requires.

404
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:06,698
[SPEAKER_16]: So all of that will go with this package when it goes out the door.

405
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:09,476
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's it.

406
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:24,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any other questions about this document?

407
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:26,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

408
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:37,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So my goal would be for us to take a vote to approve this as amended so that it can go to the MSBA tomorrow and be in queue for them.

409
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:45,081
[SPEAKER_16]: one day before they move us into the next phase so that we're in line and ready to go.

410
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion to do so?

411
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:49,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily?

412
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved, motion to approve.

413
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:57,790
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, motion to approve by Emily, seconded by?

414
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

415
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:00,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Erin?

416
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to stop the share so I can find my list.

417
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, let's see here.

418
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:11,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

419
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Mayor Lundo Kern.

420
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

421
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Glusi.

422
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:19,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

423
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:21,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing.

424
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

425
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:23,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan Bowen.

426
00:42:24,515 --> 00:42:24,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

427
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:26,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Marta Cabral.

428
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:27,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

429
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:29,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Libby Brown.

430
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:30,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

431
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Marissa Desmond.

432
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:34,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

433
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:36,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Maria Dorsey.

434
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:36,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

435
00:42:37,673 --> 00:42:38,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Hilliard.

436
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:39,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

437
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:40,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Tracy Keene.

438
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:41,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

439
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:43,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily Lazzaro.

440
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:44,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

441
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicole Morrell.

442
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

443
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron Lopate.

444
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:54,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron.

445
00:42:54,987 --> 00:42:55,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

446
00:42:56,597 --> 00:42:59,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Luke Prisner absent, uh, Jenny Graham.

447
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:05,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so 14 in the affirmative, 1, 0 in the negative, 1 absent, uh, motion passes.

448
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:07,297
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will.

449
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:12,119
[SPEAKER_16]: get this in the queue so that we can move, which is so exciting.

450
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:30,228
[SPEAKER_16]: The last thing on our list, as we were working through, as the OPM Selection Subcommittee was working through the creation of this document, we did have some discussion around the size of that committee.

451
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:34,310
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now, there are three voting members on the committee.

452
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,551
[SPEAKER_16]: It's myself, Dr. Cushing, and Aaron.

453
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:47,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 2 non-voting members on the committee, Fiona Maxwell, who's our Chief Procurement Officer, and John McLaughlin, who was not able to be here tonight.

454
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:56,967
[SPEAKER_16]: But we did talk a bit about whether it made sense for there to be 1 or 2 additional folks on this committee.

455
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:08,581
[SPEAKER_16]: probably two so that we can keep an odd number just so that the group that is sort of vetting all of this gets just a little bit bigger than it is right now.

456
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:25,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and I think the vision is that this group would be the group that sort of sits through all of the reviews, um, and, um, certainly, um, does all of the evaluation to bring a recommendation back to this committee before it's all said and done.

457
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:26,857
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um.

458
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:38,220
[SPEAKER_16]: That's I think it will be a significant amount of work and I am particularly interested in making sure that, um, some of the folks that we put on this committee to, um,

459
00:44:41,183 --> 00:44:43,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Advise in this process might be good.

460
00:44:46,405 --> 00:44:48,446
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, might be good additions to this group.

461
00:44:48,586 --> 00:45:05,293
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, the, the recommendation from, um, the subcommittee was that we add two voting members and maybe one non-voting member to the, to the group, um, to make sure that we have enough eyes on this really important decision.

462
00:45:05,313 --> 00:45:11,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I bring that back to this group because this group voted on that committee initially.

463
00:45:11,816 --> 00:45:15,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So we also would, um, need to vote to,

464
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:17,308
[SPEAKER_16]: make a change.

465
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:22,731
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will open that up if there's any questions or comments.

466
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:38,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume that this committee obviously is going to sit in on all of the interviews.

467
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,880
[SPEAKER_03]: The interviews, will they be like during the business day?

468
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:46,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that will depend on the committee.

469
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:56,683
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think whoever is on the committee, what we will have to do between now and the time this is published is make sure that there is availability and we can block those times.

470
00:45:58,024 --> 00:46:03,926
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think there is some flexibility on that timeline.

471
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:09,888
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure it's not uncommon for these kinds of things to happen, not inside the working day.

472
00:46:10,963 --> 00:46:13,245
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I think we have some flexibility there.

473
00:46:13,425 --> 00:46:16,228
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, you know, the timeline will will be.

474
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:20,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Fast and pretty tight, even if we are doing it after hours.

475
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:34,865
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

476
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:36,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

477
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:37,816
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any questions or comments.

478
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:39,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I'm one of the voting members for that.

479
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:48,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to, if everyone else feels confident about this decision, to increase the total number from at least from three to five, plus that additional non-voting member.

480
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to nominate at least one member who I think would be a really good asset.

481
00:46:53,381 --> 00:47:00,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when we had a conversation about who would be best for this committee, I know that their expertise in this area was something that stuck out for a lot of us.

482
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this a time to do that or should I wait a little bit longer?

483
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:05,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Go for it.

484
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:11,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they are willing, I'd love to nominate Libby Brown, um, to be one of the voting members.

485
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:17,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I, as I understand it, she has a really good knowledge on this type of these types of questions.

486
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:22,748
[SPEAKER_16]: So, so there's a motion to add Libby Brown to the committee.

487
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:28,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Second seconded by Marissa there.

488
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:37,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions or comments about that motion from the rest of the group?

489
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:48,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Just before we take a roll call vote, make sure Libby has the time and is interested.

490
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't sure if I should speak up.

491
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:53,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, I'm happy to be involved.

492
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:56,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've worked with many OPMs over the years.

493
00:47:56,105 --> 00:48:00,288
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have a good sense of what we're looking for here.

494
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:01,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

495
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:01,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

496
00:48:06,957 --> 00:48:08,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I will call the roll.

497
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:11,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Longo Kern.

498
00:48:13,798 --> 00:48:14,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

499
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:15,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Galluzzi.

500
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:16,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

501
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:18,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Cushing.

502
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:19,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

503
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:20,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Joan Boland.

504
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

505
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Marta Cabral.

506
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:23,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

507
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Libby Brown.

508
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

509
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:28,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Marissa Desmond.

510
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:29,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

511
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:31,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Maria Dorsey.

512
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:31,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

513
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:33,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Hilliard.

514
00:48:34,082 --> 00:48:34,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

515
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:35,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Tracy Keene.

516
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:58,487
[SPEAKER_16]: yes emily lazaro yes nicole morrell yes arnold potting yes luke prisner absent jenny graham yes 14 in the affirmative zero in the negative one absent welcome libby um thank you so um i do think um we are still

517
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:07,191
[SPEAKER_16]: thinking about one additional voting member and one non-voting member to add to this group?

518
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:14,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there people who are really excited to put their hand in the air and participate in this process?

519
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:21,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Or I see a hand from member Rousseau, who is a non-voting member, so he would be filling the non-voting spot.

520
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:28,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there other folks who are excited about this choice, about this opportunity?

521
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:38,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, we'll nominate Member Russo.

522
00:49:39,717 --> 00:49:42,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, nomination for Member Russo by Mayor Lungo Kern.

523
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a second?

524
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:46,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

525
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Second by Dr. Cushing.

526
00:49:51,107 --> 00:49:51,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, roll call.

527
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:52,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Lungo Kern.

528
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:55,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

529
00:49:55,972 --> 00:49:56,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Galluzzi.

530
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:57,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

531
00:49:58,053 --> 00:49:58,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing.

532
00:49:59,255 --> 00:49:59,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

533
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:00,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

534
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:00,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

535
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

536
00:50:01,212 --> 00:50:01,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

537
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:02,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

538
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:24,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Luke Prisner absent.

539
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Jenny Graham, yes.

540
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:28,602
[SPEAKER_16]: So 14 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 1 absent.

541
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:32,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome, Paul, to the team.

542
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:38,952
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I think there's maybe one more voting member to appoint.

543
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:48,478
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did have a brief conversation with Dr. Galussi about whether she wanted to be that person.

544
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,622
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we would love to have her, but she has a very full plate right now.

545
00:50:54,742 --> 00:51:02,588
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm totally open to hearing from you, Dr. Galussi, if you have a preference.

546
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:05,532
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, I'm happy to step up.

547
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:13,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I just also wanted to kind of see if there were other people that also wanted the opportunity to participate.

548
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:22,003
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm absolutely happy to step up and be a participating member of this committee.

549
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:33,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there other folks who might want to give Dr. Galluzzi some free time and join us instead?

550
00:51:35,314 --> 00:51:46,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Jenny, if I read Luke Preissner's email correctly this morning, he expressed interest in being part of a group that was making these decisions.

551
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:53,992
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if he's a voting member or not, but that's the way that I read it, that he was offering his services.

552
00:51:56,201 --> 00:51:59,122
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have a couple of email exchanges with Luke.

553
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:07,626
[SPEAKER_16]: And what he was referring to was sort of the creation of the document and willingness to help support that.

554
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:09,827
[SPEAKER_16]: So I didn't read it that way.

555
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:11,447
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know he was unable to come.

556
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:17,229
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would hate to put him on the spot like that.

557
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,391
[SPEAKER_16]: And he did see the agenda.

558
00:52:20,411 --> 00:52:23,472
[SPEAKER_16]: So if he had an inkling of that, I'm sure that he would have let me know.

559
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:30,481
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do expect that he will be very active on the communications and community engagement subcommittee.

560
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:30,761
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

561
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:35,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know we have a couple of other architects in our midst.

562
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:36,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that true?

563
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,771
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to put you on the spot, Brian.

564
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:43,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm one of the guiltiest charged.

565
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:45,474
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be of interest.

566
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:47,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I need to dig in a little bit more.

567
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:50,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, typically when I was involved, I was on the design end.

568
00:52:50,697 --> 00:52:58,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, typically just more of the tail end, not opposed to joining you guys.

569
00:52:58,361 --> 00:53:04,125
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think I just needed to dig in and see if I'm the right kind of person that you're looking for.

570
00:53:05,193 --> 00:53:06,254
[SPEAKER_12]: So how about a maybe?

571
00:53:06,274 --> 00:53:07,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

572
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:11,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think to your point, this is the first procurement.

573
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:14,040
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the OPM selection committee.

574
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,283
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be another whole procurement to bring on the designer.

575
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:32,373
[SPEAKER_16]: And so maybe we ask Dr. Galluzzi to be part of this process, and we plan to shift that selection committee to give people a break and pull you in at that time when we are onboarding that designer.

576
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:34,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that feel better?

577
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:34,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

578
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:34,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

579
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:42,360
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and again, you know, I'm happy to stretch if need be, and obviously would love to give anybody relief if they need it.

580
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,002
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I know sort of my, my skill set.

581
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:52,827
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there's, uh, if there's somebody better than me right now to fill in, but I'm happy to, to, um, switch horses in the middle of the race too.

582
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:53,067
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

583
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:54,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

584
00:53:55,169 --> 00:53:56,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

585
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Along the same lines as, um, Brian, I'd be happy to.

586
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,941
[SPEAKER_03]: to be in on the architect selection.

587
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:08,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more familiar with the questions and things that would be asked then, as opposed to asking the OPM.

588
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,063
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

589
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:15,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we'll hire you in just a few weeks, hopefully, for that process.

590
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:21,006
[SPEAKER_16]: So is there an official nomination to add Dr. Galluzzi to the OPM selection committee?

591
00:54:21,026 --> 00:54:22,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to nominate her.

592
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:25,868
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, so nominated by Dr. Cushing.

593
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:39,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second that, and also maybe, Dr. Galluzzi, if you want to have a conversation with Luke in the meantime, and maybe we could always switch it if it would relieve you from hours of work that you already have a ton of.

594
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:45,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So I second it, and I'm open to changing that vote if you get a positive from Luke.

595
00:54:46,886 --> 00:54:48,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

596
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:53,570
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so to appoint Dr. Galluzzi, Mayor Lungo-Kern.

597
