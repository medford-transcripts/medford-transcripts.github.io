00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:25,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Second.

59
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:25,936
[SPEAKER_24]: Just to clarify for anybody who's here tonight for that item, there will be no presentation about the domestic violence shelter this evening, and there will not be any public testimony taken on it this evening.

60
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:40,647
[SPEAKER_24]: You're welcome to send comments to OCD at Medford-MA.gov, and you're welcome to be here on the 18th to speak about that matter, but we will not be discussing that matter at all this evening.

61
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

62
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:54,963
[SPEAKER_21]: The next item is for public hearing is Mystic Avenue Corridor District, which is the MACD zoning amendment.

63
00:03:55,778 --> 00:04:02,402
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a continued public hearing regarding the proposed new Mystic Avenue Corridor District, which would involve the following changes.

64
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:10,506
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend section 94-2.1, division into districts to add the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

65
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:21,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend section 94-3.2, table of use regulations by incorporating the Mystic Avenue Corridor District into the existing table and to designate the uses permitted therein.

66
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:34,400
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, which is Table B, by incorporating the Mystic Avenue Corridor District and to state the dimensional requirements therein.

67
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:40,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend Section 94-12, which are definitions, to amend and add various definitions.

68
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:47,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Amend Section 94-9.0 to insert a new subsection to create the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

69
00:04:48,829 --> 00:05:03,412
[SPEAKER_21]: and amending the zoning map to create a new Mystic Avenue corridor district and to change the zoning district designation of various properties along Mystic Avenue to place them within said district as shown on the map entitled Mystic Avenue Corridor Zoning Map dated October 9, 2024.

70
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:14,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Director Hunt or Danielle Evans, if you can please give introductory remarks before I turn it over to Ms.

71
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily Ennis from Innes Associates.

72
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:23,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, I think that Daniel's expecting me to say a few things on that.

73
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:33,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Emily is going to go through this in more detail, but I just want to make sure that the members of the public and the newer members of the board are familiar.

74
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,423
[SPEAKER_24]: The city did a comprehensive plan.

75
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:39,576
[SPEAKER_24]: comprehensive plan, recommended changes.

76
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:47,501
[SPEAKER_24]: We hired a zoning consultant to help us to figure out the details of those changes to make recommendations.

77
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:55,667
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of her team is actually a lawyer, Jonathan Silverstein as well, to make sure that everything we're doing complies with zoning law.

78
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:03,052
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've been working with city council members, a subcommittee of the city council has been meeting regularly on this.

79
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:09,042
[SPEAKER_24]: and city staff along with Innes Associates to prepare the zoning.

80
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:13,866
[SPEAKER_24]: The zoning officially went to city council for them to hear.

81
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:19,931
[SPEAKER_24]: It is then automatically, they must refer it to this board for this board's opinions.

82
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:28,036
[SPEAKER_24]: this board has the opportunity to then make recommendations on the zoning in front of them back to the city council.

83
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:33,599
[SPEAKER_24]: The city council then votes on the zoning and then the mayor has to sign it to make it law.

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,860
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the process this evening.

85
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:41,524
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is the second meeting of the public hearing for this board to make recommendations.

86
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:47,007
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'll turn it over to Emily, who's gonna present all of this and even mentioned the comprehensive plan at all.

87
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

88
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, board members, members of the public.

89
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:59,080
[SPEAKER_18]: For the record, my name is Emily Ennis of Innes Associates.

90
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:12,693
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have some additional information that we can present, but we thought we'd start out by asking the members of the CD board if you have any questions or initial questions you'd like us to address.

91
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:16,074
[SPEAKER_18]: We gave you a lot of information at the last meeting.

92
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:23,897
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that you're all well prepared for the first part of it, but we did provide some recommendations from city staff.

93
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:26,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there was some perhaps some questions on that.

94
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:38,683
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thought I'd just start and open up and see if there's anything else I can address initially and then we can provide some additional information to supplement any questions that you've asked us.

95
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,319
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the board have any other questions at this point?

96
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:03,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Hearing none, would you like to continue, Ms.

97
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:03,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Ennis?

98
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:05,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, happy to.

99
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,567
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to share my screen.

100
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:31,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And the first thing I'm going to call up is one of the things that we had talked about afterwards that we thought would be helpful for board members, although many of you participated in the comprehensive planning process, but also for members of the public who maybe either hadn't participated or hadn't seen the information was just a little bit of background.

101
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,806
[SPEAKER_18]: of why we're looking at Mystic Avenue.

102
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:58,131
[SPEAKER_18]: So the comprehensive plan, which was finished a few years ago, really looked at the entire city and made zoning recommendations for changes to the city to bring in the community input that we heard during the comprehensive planning process, codify that as part of updates to the zoning ordinance.

103
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:00,172
[SPEAKER_18]: So the vision for

104
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:24,028
[SPEAKER_18]: changes to the built environment, which would include housing options, economic development options, resiliency, climate resiliency, open space, all of these things that can be controlled either in whole or in part by zoning would then get codified, updated in the ordinance so that future development could be able to address them.

105
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:35,333
[SPEAKER_18]: So you see these blobs on my screen on the right hand side, and this is the land use map, the future land use map that was prepared as part of the comprehensive planning process.

106
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:40,795
[SPEAKER_18]: You see a bunch of purple lines, some red blobs, some green areas.

107
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:50,525
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the types of zoning districts or areas of zoning change that were envisioned by the comprehensive plan.

108
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:57,633
[SPEAKER_18]: So the purple blobs, the purple here because they're overlaid on yellow, those are what we call corridors.

109
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:00,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Corridors are streets, long streets.

110
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:12,766
[SPEAKER_18]: that lead from one place to the other but have a very different feel to them depending on the existing purpose and the anticipated purpose of the area.

111
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:19,792
[SPEAKER_18]: So you get something like Mystic Avenue or something like Salem Street, which we'll talk about with you next month.

112
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:25,140
[SPEAKER_18]: which is a street that connects places but is within a neighborhood.

113
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,274
[SPEAKER_18]: And what we're looking to do in a place like that is enhance what's there but pretty much keep a lot of what's already happening.

114
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:43,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Mystic Avenue, I think we thought of the comprehensive plan and thought as we were developing the zoning, this is really a transformational area.

115
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:49,871
[SPEAKER_18]: What is there now is not consistent with what was envisioned in the comprehensive plan.

116
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:55,637
[SPEAKER_18]: So right now you have a lot of buildings that are kind of

117
00:10:56,457 --> 00:11:01,499
[SPEAKER_18]: in the middle of lots, they're not relating to the street, they're not relating to the pedestrian environment.

118
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:25,770
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some uses that are maybe not the highest and best use for a corridor like Mystic Avenue, which really connects the downtown area to transit, to transportation in terms of the highway, is bordered by residential areas, but have large lots on one side that are suitable for a different type of development.

119
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:35,659
[SPEAKER_18]: and lots on the other side that really need to think about how to transition from that development down to the residential neighborhoods, that level of intensity.

120
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:51,153
[SPEAKER_18]: And so in thinking about what makes a walkable corridor a corridor that can address very different conditions along its length, that's where the zoning proposal that is in front of you, in front of the City Council comes from.

121
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:55,256
[SPEAKER_18]: So we wanted to give that a little bit of context to what's happening.

122
00:11:55,296 --> 00:12:08,204
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can see here on this page, again, the right-hand side is the diagram that came out of the discussions of the Comprehensive Plan, and the left-hand side is the actions within the Comprehensive Plan.

123
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:20,492
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can see here implementing the Bicycle Infrastructure Master Plan here, thinking about the different uses that could happen here, implementing the complete streets.

124
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,033
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of

125
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:26,837
[SPEAKER_18]: infrastructure proposals that were going in, that were being considered at the time.

126
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:40,826
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the zoning proposals that, by changing the zoning, allows, over time, new development that could be enhanced by the infrastructure that can enhance the experience of

127
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:51,295
[SPEAKER_18]: both people who live in the area and people who work in the area, but also the job opportunities, the housing opportunities that we'd like to see there.

128
00:12:52,159 --> 00:13:03,590
[SPEAKER_18]: So as we look at the, here is the existing corridor and what it looks like, the existing conditions, you can see those sort of buildings that some of them are pushed back from the street.

129
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,571
[SPEAKER_18]: They're larger.

130
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,033
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of parking going on here.

131
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:16,782
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of not particularly well-defined pedestrian and vehicular conflicts going on.

132
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,704
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can see that the character kind of changes as we move down.

133
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:28,512
[SPEAKER_18]: So taking those existing conditions, looking at the existing uses where you can see this sort of mix.

134
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:35,159
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a real true mixed use district now, but not at its highest and best level.

135
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,342
[SPEAKER_18]: The individual uses are kind of

136
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:47,986
[SPEAKER_18]: So you've got these commercial uses, these industrial uses, these residential uses, but they're not really integrated together the way we'd like to see them.

137
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:51,588
[SPEAKER_18]: But you can already see that the variety of uses.

138
00:13:52,148 --> 00:14:01,472
[SPEAKER_18]: And so as we think about the current dimensional standards here, this is an example of the C2 district, the uses that are allowed.

139
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:13,480
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks quite complex when you try and analyze the existing zoning because the dimensional standards depend on the type of use that's happening in this area.

140
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:18,404
[SPEAKER_18]: It depends on whether or not you have three floors or four floors and how does that work.

141
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:23,528
[SPEAKER_18]: And our goal is to really simplify a lot of what's going on.

142
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:48,528
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's where you see with the new zoning map, these districts that we talked about last time, the mixed use, the mixed use two and three, the commercial down here, those transitions back and forth between allowing for a higher level of density along the 93, the infrastructure there, allowing the commercial where it's got access,

143
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:55,809
[SPEAKER_18]: And then allowing mix two as a transition to the residential, which is not being changed in this proposal.

144
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Allowing the transition with the mix one over to the downtown.

145
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,591
[SPEAKER_18]: And then seeing, okay, now we've got a much more simplified table of dimensional standards.

146
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:11,292
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not based on use, it's based on the district.

147
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:17,673
[SPEAKER_18]: It tries to create a more consistent way of building out each of the districts.

148
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:23,876
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you see here we've got the base heights and the solid color.

149
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:37,403
[SPEAKER_18]: The more transparent color for each of these types is to indicate that there is this incentive bonus for additional height, but they have to meet the additional requirements.

150
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:38,623
[SPEAKER_18]: to get that bonus.

151
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,124
[SPEAKER_18]: It is not automatic.

152
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:45,246
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's also the step backs at the upper level.

153
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:53,108
[SPEAKER_18]: So when you're on the street, a lot of people will worry about a canyon effect by having too many tall buildings right at the front of the street.

154
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:57,230
[SPEAKER_18]: We require the step back from the street so that widens out the view.

155
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:03,432
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't get the same impact as you would if these buildings were directly on the street.

156
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:07,233
[SPEAKER_18]: So this idea that we're simplifying the districts themselves,

157
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:17,600
[SPEAKER_18]: We're adding a wider mix of uses so that we can have that additional housing opportunity, the additional economic opportunity.

158
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:24,225
[SPEAKER_18]: We're making the standards more consistent and just easier to deal with.

159
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:33,007
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to add that as additional information for the board to consider, for the public to understand what we're doing.

160
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:37,528
[SPEAKER_18]: I can also go through in more detail if it is of interest.

161
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:45,351
[SPEAKER_18]: The development standards take you sort of directly into the zoning to look at that if there have been questions on that.

162
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,751
[SPEAKER_18]: But I hope that initial stage was a help.

163
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:50,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Happy to answer questions on that first set of information.

164
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Ms.

165
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:00,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Ennis.

166
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:03,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the board have any questions before I open it up to the public?

167
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:14,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I will now open up the public comment period.

168
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:20,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

169
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:25,466
[SPEAKER_21]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

170
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:28,949
[SPEAKER_21]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

171
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:34,513
[SPEAKER_21]: A reminder to all the participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide

172
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:38,336
[SPEAKER_21]: substantive comments as it is not part of the public record.

173
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:45,402
[SPEAKER_21]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

174
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:50,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue?

175
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

176
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:12,627
[SPEAKER_22]: I do not see any raised hands, Madam Chair.

177
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:13,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, there's one.

178
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Kwasniewski.

179
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi there, thank you.

180
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:28,154
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Laurel Ruma, I live at 149 Burgett Avenue.

181
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:42,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you define the canyoning effect a little bit more for us and what that means when you have that intentional gradiation of tall buildings that then go down to lower height buildings, especially in a neighborhood with houses across the street?

182
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:52,065
[SPEAKER_18]: With the permission of the chair, I'd be happy to.

183
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:52,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

184
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:53,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so in.

185
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:11,199
[SPEAKER_18]: So when we think of the canyoning effect or the canyoning effect that people have been concerned about, it tends to be when you have quite narrow streets and taller buildings right up to the lot line that can present a canyon effect.

186
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,480
[SPEAKER_18]: We are not doing that, right?

187
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,862
[SPEAKER_18]: We are allowing buildings up to a certain height and then you have to step the building back.

188
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:19,943
[SPEAKER_18]: This is actually a wider street.

189
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:27,167
[SPEAKER_18]: So that intentional step back of the taller buildings is meant to open that up.

190
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:33,392
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the idea of the other restrictions in terms of dimensional standards.

191
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:42,961
[SPEAKER_18]: We're having the taller buildings on the side of the street that backs up to 93 and the shorter buildings are the

192
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,984
[SPEAKER_18]: the ones that are on the residential side.

193
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:54,147
[SPEAKER_18]: And the intention is because you've got the taller buildings on this side, the shorter buildings on that side.

194
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,788
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm making sure my hands are within the window.

195
00:19:56,168 --> 00:20:06,694
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you're stepping down to the residential so that there's a lesser impact on the adjacent residential because you're moving the taller buildings away from the adjacent residential.

196
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ms.

197
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:12,931
[SPEAKER_21]: Ennis.

198
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:14,412
[SPEAKER_21]: We have another hand.

199
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,557
[SPEAKER_22]: A. Birney.

200
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:23,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that the screen name?

201
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:29,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you're calling me, Amy Birness.

202
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm at 138 Burgett.

203
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,667
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you for the information.

204
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:34,348
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very helpful.

205
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:37,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a great area of our town to be developed.

206
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:49,272
[SPEAKER_17]: And the next topic, I am curious for where you say on the 93 side, what is the height level of the buildings that is permissible there versus on the residential side?

207
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,951
[SPEAKER_18]: just pulling it up.

208
00:20:54,091 --> 00:21:01,417
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the 93 side, that is the MX3 or the mixed-use 3 district.

209
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:11,285
[SPEAKER_18]: The minimum height, the base height is 4 plus a tower of 6, which would be set back.

210
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:15,209
[SPEAKER_18]: So the base height would be 10 at that point.

211
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:22,839
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the maximum height would be 14, which is again that same 4, a step back to 10.

212
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,484
[SPEAKER_18]: The other side, the mixed use, is shorter.

213
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:32,393
[SPEAKER_18]: It's 4 stories as a base height, so you have that match of the base.

214
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:39,096
[SPEAKER_18]: before the tower on the taller side, and then it can go up only to six stories there.

215
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:48,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Remembering too that they have to have the parcel size to be able to get up to six stories as well, but that again is with the incentive bonus.

216
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:54,084
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to match the specifics of the incentive bonus to get either of the higher heights.

217
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:56,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you for that information.

218
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:56,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it.

219
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:57,786
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm done.

220
00:21:58,346 --> 00:21:59,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, bye.

221
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:03,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, and thank you, Ms.

222
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:03,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Ennis.

223
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:07,804
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe that's all.

224
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle, correct me if I'm mistaken.

225
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,045
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see any other.

226
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,106
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see any other hints.

227
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:25,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'm going to close the public comment period for this portion of the meeting, and I'll bring it back to the board for further questions or deliberations.

228
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:36,420
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, there was the portion, Emily hasn't presented the part where the changes that we're recommending from staff to what went in front of city council.

229
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:43,144
[SPEAKER_24]: You mean in addition from the changes from last meeting?

230
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:50,148
[SPEAKER_24]: No, those changes so that the board understands, because those would be recommendations from the board.

231
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:54,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, I'm going to have to close the door out, my door.

232
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:57,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

233
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,126
[SPEAKER_24]: She presented those at the last meeting.

234
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,647
[SPEAKER_24]: That went so late that I wasn't even sure.

235
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:09,589
[SPEAKER_24]: And I wanted to make sure that we had them correct, because we had an early version from Emily.

236
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:19,872
[SPEAKER_24]: And I want to make sure that the... I was trying to find in my files, there was not a document that's in the board's files with the recommended changes.

237
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:21,873
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to make sure we have them correct.

238
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:29,067
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to put them up on screen if that's helpful.

239
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Just let me know.

240
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:31,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

241
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:32,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

242
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me just put that up now.

243
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,630
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are three recommendations.

244
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,131
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to show them to you first, and then I'll come back to go through in detail.

245
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:51,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Two of them are recommendations to change the development incentives.

246
00:23:52,162 --> 00:24:03,870
[SPEAKER_18]: And the third is a height waiver recommendation to allow the possibility of changing the height.

247
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to deal with that first and then we'll go back to the development incentives.

248
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:19,660
[SPEAKER_18]: So the height waiver is just we find that sometimes there are parcels or buildings or projects that just

249
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,501
[SPEAKER_18]: They're almost there, but not quite.

250
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:29,605
[SPEAKER_18]: And so allowing that minimum height, so allowing a waiver allows you to get the project to the right place.

251
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:35,649
[SPEAKER_18]: All of the districts have minimum heights, and it's because we want to encourage that highest and best use.

252
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:47,936
[SPEAKER_18]: But there may be a case in which you have an excellent project that's something that meets the goals of the comprehensive plan, many of which I already talked about, but it's under that minimum height.

253
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:55,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we wanted to give the board, in talking with staff, wanted to give the board flexibility to waive that minimum.

254
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,022
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we've set it up to waive it by a special permit.

255
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:09,670
[SPEAKER_18]: from the Community Development Board if they meet that consistency with the purpose of the district, which of course is laid out in the zoning, but also the goals of the Medford Comprehensive Plan.

256
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,272
[SPEAKER_18]: So that gives you criteria to use for the judgment.

257
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:26,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Two of the recommendations for the development of incentive bonus, we are deleting the certified as LEED Gold or equivalent standard.

258
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:30,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now it's set up so if you get LEED Gold, you get one story.

259
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:37,953
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get LEED Platinum or equivalent, you get two stories, so an additional story for a maximum of two.

260
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:42,916
[SPEAKER_18]: We're finding the lead gold or equivalent is kind of too easy to reach these days.

261
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,177
[SPEAKER_18]: So many are doing it.

262
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:49,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So we wanted to move it to lead platinum or equivalent to get to a single additional story.

263
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:56,025
[SPEAKER_18]: You want the incentives to be achievable, but not easy to achieve, right?

264
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:59,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're looking for a public benefit from the incentives.

265
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:08,231
[SPEAKER_18]: The same thing, so these incentives were based on the Section 3A zoning from last year.

266
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:14,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had in that a provide active ground floor space at more than 75% of the ground floor.

267
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:20,915
[SPEAKER_18]: But in this case, in this particular district, that's actually a requirement for some of the districts.

268
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,176
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not appropriate to have this as an incentive.

269
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:25,797
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're asking you to delete it.

270
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:34,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Before I go on, Emily, I realize that this doesn't have certifiable as opposed to certified.

271
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:44,545
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's both a technical thing and general that they can't actually get certified until a year after the building opens.

272
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:45,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

273
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,566
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's certifiable, yes.

274
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:48,206
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

275
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:59,311
[SPEAKER_24]: And in fact, it's less important to the city that they literally get that certificate, so much as that they show us that they've met all the requirements to be able to get the certificate.

276
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:00,351
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

277
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,132
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we've made that discussion after we created this.

278
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:12,376
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, the board should know that this word should be certifiable as LEED, sorry, certifiable as LEED Platinum or equivalent standard.

279
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:17,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and we also did that because there are, it used to be that LEAD was the only standard.

280
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:22,810
[SPEAKER_18]: There are also many other standards that would meet city goals.

281
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,553
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why we put the equivalent standard.

282
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:41,082
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the final change, and this is a little bit more complex, you will see if you look at the original zoning that we proposed that there's two possible incentives related to affordability.

283
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:48,068
[SPEAKER_18]: We felt in discussions collectively that the way that was worded was confusing.

284
00:27:48,768 --> 00:28:03,246
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it looks more complex because it's a table, but in fact by giving the specific incentives, it allows you to actually see what's being required and it also makes it clear

285
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:07,810
[SPEAKER_18]: the difference between the project types.

286
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:18,176
[SPEAKER_18]: So, on the left-hand side, where we have the number of lots or units in the proposed projects, these divisions, 10 to 24, 25 to 49, 50 plus, are what exists in your current affordability requirements.

287
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:37,906
[SPEAKER_18]: and the minimum percentage of affordable units at 80% AMI, which is the second column from the left, is again, that's what's existing in your inclusionary zoning.

288
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:44,870
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we did was we broke it up for one additional floor in the first incentive bonus.

289
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,692
[SPEAKER_18]: We're asking for a deeper level of affordability.

290
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,132
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have a mix of 80%

291
00:28:52,633 --> 00:29:03,998
[SPEAKER_18]: units at 80% of AMI and units at 65% of AMI, but they still add up to the total percentage that's required in your inclusionary zoning.

292
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:11,561
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you give a deeper level, the 65% AMI, you get two additional floors.

293
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:17,408
[SPEAKER_18]: The second incentive is about the number of affordable units.

294
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:21,392
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have your minimum percentage at 80% AMI.

295
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:26,038
[SPEAKER_18]: We're asking that you give additional units at 80% AMI.

296
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,042
[SPEAKER_18]: in order to get the one additional floor or the two additional floor.

297
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:37,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this time it's a straight 3% or 5% of units.

298
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:43,548
[SPEAKER_18]: We did some calculations behind this to get to the numbers of percentage.

299
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:54,554
[SPEAKER_18]: You could, if you are the developer, say you want just one additional floor, you can choose whether you want to do deeper affordability or more units.

300
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:59,918
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want two additional floors, you could actually do this three different ways.

301
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:07,964
[SPEAKER_18]: You could either give extra deeper affordability, so you're going for more units that are more affordable.

302
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:18,672
[SPEAKER_18]: You could do the additional required units, so you could go greater than the number of required units, so that's option two.

303
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:24,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you could do one floor, deeper affordability, and one floor, more units.

304
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:37,912
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that gives them flexibility in looking at the financing of how they have to do the units, to choose which methods that they want to use to achieve the incentive.

305
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

306
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:55,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Was this, were these changes part of 1120's meeting packet at least, even though they weren't for 12?

307
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:59,956
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to make sure that the public has had a chance to view these changes as well.

308
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,658
[SPEAKER_18]: These 2 slides are, that's a great question.

309
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:06,860
[SPEAKER_18]: These 2 slides are what I presented at our last meeting, so they should have been in that packet.

310
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:15,275
[SPEAKER_21]: So they were 1120 and because we were continuing, the public had access to this information already, okay.

311
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:21,137
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just wanted to make sure because it sounds like this is familiar information.

312
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:28,199
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just that it took me a little bit of time and I'm sure the rest of the board, there's the whole reason for it to be continued was to digest it.

313
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,719
[SPEAKER_21]: And it seems like it's the information that we've already been given.

314
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I just wanted to make sure.

315
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:45,299
[SPEAKER_18]: My understanding is that this was publicly available and the only change we're making to these two slides is the one that Director Hunt mentioned earlier about changing certified to certified.

316
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

317
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for the clarification.

318
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:59,227
[SPEAKER_21]: And with that, does the board have any questions, comments, or further suggested changes?

319
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:06,687
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one Jackie.

320
00:32:08,188 --> 00:32:12,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, please.

321
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:22,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to try to form the right mental model for the city's objective for the corridor, and for the incentive bonus.

322
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there just an overall target.

323
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:51,406
[SPEAKER_15]: that the city has, and apologies, I'm coming off a cold, so a little bit hard to speak, but is there an overall target that the city has for kind of the expansion of affordable housing or the availability of housing that it's trying to get to with the incentives, just at like a bigger picture level?

324
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:58,746
[SPEAKER_15]: for either the district itself, the Mystic Corridor District, or just more broadly for the city.

325
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:11,502
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think you might be getting at, we have a housing production plan that was done in 2021 that talks about affordability goals and ways of getting there.

326
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:17,148
[SPEAKER_24]: And some of that is allowing more larger buildings in more parts of the city.

327
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:22,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of it is increasing the amount of affordable units that are available in the city.

328
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,184
[SPEAKER_24]: all the buildings in the city.

329
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:40,423
[SPEAKER_24]: So I wouldn't say very specifically, oh, we want to see X number of units in on this corridor, so much as we've been thinking of this as a place where people can live and work and play and shop, like really like a more it's

330
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:54,375
[SPEAKER_24]: I would never say it would be like assembly row, but like conceptually, right, you might live upstairs, you might walk down the street and shop, there might be some commercial type buildings where you might work.

331
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:59,957
[SPEAKER_24]: That's sort of what we're going for on this street, more than a residential neighborhood.

332
00:34:01,297 --> 00:34:02,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Got it.

333
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:03,198
[SPEAKER_24]: That makes sense.

334
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:04,944
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

335
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:18,340
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I may, because it may not be clear to somebody tuning into this meeting for the first time, is that the three discussions of incentive bonuses I mentioned are not the only one.

336
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,401
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a full table.

337
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:25,889
[SPEAKER_18]: These are adjustments to the table, but there are a number of different public benefits that could be choosed.

338
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:53,667
[SPEAKER_18]: chosen, there goes my English for the night, chosen by a developer to get up to the level that they want to see there's this combination, but they all relate in some form to either affordability of housing, community amenities, most of which should be privately maintained, there's one for publicly maintained, or the idea of having an active, vibrant, walkable area.

339
00:34:55,648 --> 00:35:06,032
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and then the final the final sort of grouping is those that would address some form of climate resiliency or environmental resiliency or improvements to that area.

340
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:09,253
[SPEAKER_18]: It is very heavily impervious at the moment.

341
00:35:09,514 --> 00:35:14,896
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but that that combination addresses, I think, many of the goals of the comprehensive plan.

342
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:16,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you.

343
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:38,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I see raised hands, but we've already closed a public comment period, but I'm not sure if I should backtrack based on the new information that the public may think was provided.

344
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,236
[SPEAKER_20]: I think reopening it could be interesting.

345
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:54,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

346
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:56,596
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'd support that, Jackie.

347
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:58,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we need to make a motion to reopen?

348
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:08,878
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure if it's at the discretion of the chair, but Danielle, can you please allow Ms.

349
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,279
[SPEAKER_21]: or Mr. Alex Hackman to speak?

350
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:13,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

351
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:21,381
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, you should be able to unmute yourself, Mr. Hackman or Ms.

352
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:21,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Hackman.

353
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:22,201
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, right.

354
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,021
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, everybody.

355
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:23,701
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you hear me okay?

356
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:25,376
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

357
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:26,136
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks so much.

358
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:27,538
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry I missed my time earlier.

359
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:31,401
[SPEAKER_29]: I couldn't find the raise my hand button, but I have two comments.

360
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:34,663
[SPEAKER_29]: One's aspirational and one is mindful.

361
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:45,993
[SPEAKER_29]: The aspirational one is, I wonder if the board might dream about how really state-of-the-art public transportation could enhance this corridor.

362
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:47,434
[SPEAKER_29]: We have buses, which are great.

363
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:51,177
[SPEAKER_29]: You're going to have new bike lanes, which are great, but could you dream differently about something like

364
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:58,751
[SPEAKER_29]: a trolley that runs down the middle of this way over widened street, something that really encourages vibrancy of this new zone.

365
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:00,412
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's the aspirational.

366
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,553
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to plant that seed.

367
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:05,996
[SPEAKER_29]: The mindful comes in response to the climate resilience comment from Emily.

368
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,798
[SPEAKER_29]: And by the way, I'm sorry, Alex Hackman, 71 Hume Avenue.

369
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:12,220
[SPEAKER_29]: The climate resiliency talk, Emily, great presentation.

370
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,362
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm very supportive of this density.

371
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:20,131
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to point out that we're at elevation 9 or 8 along this stretch.

372
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:26,796
[SPEAKER_29]: There will be a time in the future when the ocean overtops the Amelia Earhart dams, whether it's storm events or sea level rise.

373
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:39,687
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think ahead to 100 years from now, when the city is going to be faced with removing these buildings, this is the former wetland of the Mystic River, the Mystic River, there will be a time when we are

374
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,711
[SPEAKER_29]: under water here.

375
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:47,877
[SPEAKER_29]: Would the city ever be very progressive and consider things like bonds for future building removals 100 years from now?

376
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:51,580
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for taking my comments.

377
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,544
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Mr. Heckman.

378
00:37:56,585 --> 00:38:00,449
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have one other which is Jamie Thompson, Thompson Realty.

379
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:08,517
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening, evening everyone.

380
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:22,927
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for opening that up I did just want to ask for some clarification on the new information, just for the public if you could qualify the area median income at 80% and 65% based on that incentive slide.

381
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:26,450
[SPEAKER_31]: What those dollar values would be.

382
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:36,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, I do not have that information with me at the moment, but we could certainly get them to the board for distribution.

383
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:50,001
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you who aren't aware, area median income is calculated at a regional level, so I'd have to jump into the details and pull it out.

384
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,502
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have it at my fingertips tonight.

385
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:00,366
[SPEAKER_19]: I see Danielle's hand up.

386
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:05,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Danielle?

387
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Danielle Evans, senior planner.

388
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:17,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so these change every year when HUD releases the new immediate income.

389
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,385
[SPEAKER_22]: And it is the area of, yeah, it's the Quincy Boston

390
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:33,525
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what they call it, metropolitan area, I think is what they use.

391
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:36,787
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have to look it up.

392
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:38,329
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to have these memorized.

393
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:42,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the Boston and Cambridge Newton MSA?

394
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:45,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so it's for the Middlesex County.

395
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:48,676
[SPEAKER_22]: So the median income at 80% for one person is $91,400.

396
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:50,297
[SPEAKER_22]: That's 80% of median income.

397
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:02,514
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the 80%.

398
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:08,515
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have to calculate the 65, but I can give you, actually.

399
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:13,597
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, I just sent you a link to the MHP tables.

400
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:16,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe you can get the same one.

401
00:40:17,138 --> 00:40:17,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they don't have the 65%.

402
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:24,520
[SPEAKER_22]: We probably have to find a table, because these tables are

403
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:30,244
[SPEAKER_22]: associated with programs that use those so they're not going to show you the 65% if they don't have a program for that.

404
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:38,546
[SPEAKER_18]: So, just so people can see here's Medford under the Middlesex County one this is the mass housing partnership.

405
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:43,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the 80% income by household size so as, as

406
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:54,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Danielle said 91,400 for a family or household rather of one, all the way up to a household of eight.

407
00:40:54,491 --> 00:41:03,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I think much of the time we look at sort of a household of three or four when we're just doing a quick table, but that's the current 2024 information.

408
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:48,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there no other hands i'm going to definitely signal that we are fully closing, uh the public hearing Or the public comment period at this point for this item And bringing it back to the board If there's any further questions Peter cals Uh, this is not so much a question as much as just doing my my job as a clerk to make sure we have a

409
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:57,628
[SPEAKER_14]: handle on the changes that we would be, I believe, if I'm following procedure correctly, recommending to the city council?

410
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what we're?

411
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:00,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I believe.

412
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:15,118
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we have to spell them out, but we recommend an approval of the zoning amendment with any of the additional changes that were identified at the last meeting and any tonight, if there was any made by the board, which there has not been.

413
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,840
[SPEAKER_21]: So I believe we would have to read them out

414
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:47,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's what I wanted to make sure that we are removing the lead gold standard from the development incentive bonus table, removing the active ground floor use from the development incentive table for this district, adding the height waiver as a special permit for this district,

415
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:53,512
[SPEAKER_14]: and add the modified table affordability requirements as presented.

416
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:58,235
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the changing certified.

417
00:42:58,255 --> 00:43:00,036
[SPEAKER_14]: And change certified to certifiable.

418
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:00,557
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

419
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:09,852
[SPEAKER_18]: If it is helpful to the board, I did make the change on the slide.

420
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:17,537
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can, if you do need to read them out in full, I can put them back up at any point that you need them.

421
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:23,101
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have the correct text.

422
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:26,844
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be helpful for me when I do the actual motion.

423
00:43:28,425 --> 00:43:28,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

424
00:43:29,486 --> 00:43:30,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

425
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:34,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, just pick a quick point of clarification.

426
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:43,969
[SPEAKER_20]: It was remove the LEED Gold certifiability, but add in the LEED Platinum certifiability.

427
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:49,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I understood it as, I understood the language is remove the LEED Gold, but the LEED Platinum is already there.

428
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,212
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

429
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:53,554
[SPEAKER_24]: The LEED Platinum is there for two stories.

430
00:43:53,854 --> 00:44:02,078
[SPEAKER_24]: So the recommendation is to change LEED Platinum from two stories to one and make it certifiable instead of certified.

431
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:03,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Got it.

432
00:44:04,284 --> 00:44:04,625
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

433
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Appreciate the, uh, just want to make sure the language is correct.

434
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:14,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

435
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing no other comments.

436
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,973
[SPEAKER_21]: If you can, please put up the changes and I will look.

437
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:22,454
[SPEAKER_21]: I will ask for a motion.

438
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:53,300
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would need a motion to change recommendations actually to recommend approval of the zoning amendments with the first change of at a table for the affordability requirements to the table of development incentive bonuses in section 94-9.x.4 development incentives.

439
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Second change.

440
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:10,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Delete from the table of development incentive bonuses in section 94-9.X.4 development incentives to certified as legal.

441
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:18,735
[SPEAKER_21]: or equivalent standard and modify certifiable as LEED Platinum or equivalent standard to one additional story.

442
00:45:20,336 --> 00:45:27,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Number three, delete from the table of development incentive bonuses in section 94-9.x.4.

443
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Development incentives provide active ground floor space at more than 75% of the ground floor.

444
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:41,683
[SPEAKER_21]: And four, add to section 94-9.x.3, dimensional requirements, dimensional requirements and waivers.

445
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:54,506
[SPEAKER_21]: I, height waiver two, the minimum height requirement may be waived by a special permit from the Community Development Board for projects that are consistent with the purpose of the district and the goals of the Medford Comprehensive Plan.

446
00:45:58,287 --> 00:45:58,787
[SPEAKER_14]: So moved.

447
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:01,208
[SPEAKER_21]: And a second.

448
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:04,645
[SPEAKER_21]: I second.

449
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Total roll call, Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

450
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:10,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

451
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:11,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Cowes?

452
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:12,791
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

453
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, wait.

454
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:14,713
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think I can vote, right?

455
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,334
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I wasn't here for the first part.

456
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:19,897
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll say aye, and then we'll figure it out later.

457
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:20,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

458
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:21,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right.

459
00:46:21,939 --> 00:46:23,781
[SPEAKER_21]: You weren't part of the, yes.

460
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:24,862
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

461
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:26,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Cowes?

462
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:27,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

463
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:28,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Ari Fishman?

464
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:29,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

465
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:31,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie String?

466
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:32,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

467
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:33,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens.

468
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:35,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

469
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:36,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben Lavallee.

470
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:37,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

471
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,057
[SPEAKER_21]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

472
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:45,942
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm an aye, and I believe we have quorum, even without Vice Chair Emily Hederman's vote.

473
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:48,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Ms.

474
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:48,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Ennis.

475
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:51,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And have a great evening.

476
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:54,130
[SPEAKER_19]: You as well.

477
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your patience with us.

478
00:47:01,372 --> 00:47:03,454
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to repeat for the public that the St.

479
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:13,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Clair Road Domestic Violence Shelter has been continued to Wednesday, 12-18-24, and there will be no presentations or public comment taken on this matter tonight.

480
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:20,370
[SPEAKER_21]: So the next item on our agenda for this evening is 401 Boston Ave, site plan review for Dover amendment.

481
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:26,679
[SPEAKER_21]: This is continued public hearing where the applicant will present any new information.

482
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,702
[SPEAKER_21]: The public will have an opportunity to provide comments on the new information later in the public hearing.

483
00:47:35,624 --> 00:47:38,205
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to ask the proponent.

484
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:41,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see Rocco.

485
00:47:42,308 --> 00:47:43,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here, Matt.

486
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:44,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

487
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:44,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

488
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:45,429
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you this evening?

489
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:46,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, Matt.

490
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:46,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

491
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie, how are you?

492
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:48,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty good.

493
00:47:48,411 --> 00:47:49,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

494
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:50,012
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

495
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:51,192
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to give you the floor.

496
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:54,082
[SPEAKER_21]: to present any new information.

497
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:57,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

498
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:03,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, my name is Rocco DiRico, and I'm the Executive Director of Government and Community Relations at Tufts University.

499
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:16,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Tufts University is a mission-driven nonprofit organization that educates more than 6,000 students on our campus, and a key part of that mission is providing housing to our students.

500
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:23,310
[SPEAKER_06]: As we discussed at the previous meeting, this project meets a lot of the city's and the university's shared goals.

501
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:33,337
[SPEAKER_06]: on-campus housing, mixed-use development, transit-oriented design, an energy-efficient building, and it will meet the City's new Stretch Energy Code.

502
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:43,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I think also importantly, it will revitalize a key section of Boston Avenue, which currently serves as a gateway to Medford for people as they step off the Green Line.

503
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:50,731
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can ask the team from Elkis Manfredi to share the PowerPoint, and I

504
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: can share with you the new information that we have for you tonight.

505
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:07,627
[SPEAKER_24]: I just changed their permissions.

506
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:08,788
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

507
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:10,349
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the conference room.

508
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

509
00:49:15,314 --> 00:49:16,595
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can go to the next slide.

510
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:35,815
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am here with my colleagues from Tufts University, Capstone Development Partners, who is the developer for this project, Earl in Construction is the general contractor, Elcas Manfredi is the architect.

511
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:42,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have our landscape architect on the call, our transportation engineer, our civil engineer.

512
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,440
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can go to the next slide.

513
00:49:46,558 --> 00:49:52,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have spent the last six months meeting with neighbors, elected officials, city department heads and other key stakeholders.

514
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:59,149
[SPEAKER_06]: We heard your feedback, acknowledge your concerns, and we've acted on your requests.

515
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:07,397
[SPEAKER_06]: We hear what you're saying, we value your input, and we are continuing to improve the project.

516
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:09,539
[SPEAKER_06]: We can go to the next slide.

517
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:28,865
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some of the comments that we heard over the course of those meetings, and we are here tonight to present new information and ways that we have factored those things into our project.

518
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:31,128
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can go to the next slide.

519
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:40,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So this project will provide much needed public realm improvements on Boston Avenue.

520
00:50:41,013 --> 00:50:59,940
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of those things that we heard at the meetings on that last slide, we will be adding new sidewalks on both sides of Boston Ave, new crosswalks, new trees, a blue bike station, new retail options that we believe will make Boston Ave more sustainable, more walkable, and more accessible.

521
00:51:01,201 --> 00:51:05,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, we're here to present new information that we're going to discuss.

522
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:08,948
[SPEAKER_06]: First, a traffic impact study and parking assessment.

523
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:12,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, civil stormwater management.

524
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:17,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, we'll discuss public realm improvements and community benefits.

525
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:22,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff Bandini from Niche Engineering.

526
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rocco.

527
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate the introduction.

528
00:51:27,902 --> 00:51:29,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.

529
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:32,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Jeff Bandini, Senior Project Manager with Niche Engineering.

530
00:51:33,305 --> 00:51:39,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were tasked with putting together the traffic impact study and parking assessment associated with the project.

531
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:53,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So as part of that, we put together first our traffic impact study and collected data at four locations within the study area, primarily along Boston Avenue so that we could best understand the impacts of the project.

532
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:57,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, we looked at the crash data.

533
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:01,718
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand that safety is important for this development and within the city.

534
00:52:01,778 --> 00:52:06,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to make sure that we're comparing existing crash data to understand if there would be any.

535
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:17,203
[SPEAKER_05]: mitigation that may be needed as part of this project associated with any sort of crash data information that we saw historically as part of our research.

536
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:26,769
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at the Institute of Transportation Engineers trip generation for fill build out of a project of this size and scope.

537
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:36,154
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand that ITE trip generation in this project, as much as ITE is a good

538
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:43,617
[SPEAKER_05]: brings historical value to what this building means in terms of size and use.

539
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:57,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Its location on the Tufts University campus provides a little bit of a unique perspective from a traffic and parking study perspective, which I'll get into a little bit in the preceding slides.

540
00:52:58,264 --> 00:53:04,373
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, we applied the full ITE trip generation to this project to understand what the full build out of that would mean.

541
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:09,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, what associated impacts that would be as part of the project.

542
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:34,545
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, and since I mentioned ITE being a conservative estimate, and part of that is because we understand that the project is going to draw from the existing pedestrian bicycle and MBTA network, which, you know, this study area and the Tufts University campus provides tremendous accessibility from a multimodal approach and doesn't necessarily rely on vehicle trips.

543
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:40,688
[SPEAKER_05]: to bring students to campus, and that's part of what I'll get into again in a little bit.

544
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:55,358
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mentioned the ITE trip generation, so essentially what that would mean is a nominal increase in vehicle trips if you use the ITE conservative numbers, but again, suggesting that the project is anticipated to draw a lot of those trips from the multimodal realm.

545
00:53:56,638 --> 00:53:57,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide, please.

546
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:04,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just a little bit on the parking assessments of part of the traffic impact study.

547
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:12,951
[SPEAKER_05]: The project site would incorporate part of the Hill Hall parking lot, which right now is 80 spaces during our traffic impact study.

548
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:20,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And during a Nelson Nygaard study that was conducted parking study that was conducted recently, the lot is fairly underutilized.

549
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:20,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

550
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:30,546
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, via its replacement as part of the project, the displacement of vehicles within the lot is fairly minimal compared to the amount of spaces within it.

551
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:47,657
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of our coordination with Tufts University and our research into the parking assessment, 11% of juniors and seniors have parking passes, so we use that number to assess what that would mean in terms of potential future capacity that's needed as part of the project.

552
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:50,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, freshmen and sophomore students

553
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:54,105
[SPEAKER_05]: by policy are not permitted to park on campus.

554
00:54:55,767 --> 00:55:06,919
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of the coordination with Tufts, we found that freshmen sophomores right now are parking on campus due to a loophole in being able to sign up for parking passes.

555
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:17,203
[SPEAKER_05]: which Tufts is committed to updating their system and compliance so that we can decrease the number of freshmen and sophomores parking on campus.

556
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:28,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that way, some of that displacement will lead into additional parking capacity that would be permitted for use by additional vehicles associated with the project.

557
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:54,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a result of the displacement of the vehicles on the existing Hill Hall lot, the utilization of existing juniors and seniors, the displacement of the freshmen and sophomore students, we anticipate sufficient capacity in the Dowling Hall garage to include the project-related vehicles associated with the project.

558
00:55:55,412 --> 00:56:15,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Furthermore, I know it's an ongoing discussion with the university is certainly committed to monitoring parking demand in the future and is willing to adjust its existing policy as the current capacity and demand fluctuates as part of the project and other projects in the vicinity of the campus.

559
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:17,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide, please.

560
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:27,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a parking map that was put together as part of the Nelson Nygaard study, which I mentioned, and Nelson Nygaard conducted the study back in October.

561
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:45,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And this demonstrates just an understanding of where the project site is and where there are existing parking areas in the vicinity of the project site that do have additional capacity if needed to park additional vehicles.

562
00:56:46,514 --> 00:57:00,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Either associated with the project or some level of displacement as vehicles park for the existing site and that's that's to suggest that there are areas within the project site that do have additional capacity.

563
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:03,383
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to the darling hall garage, which I mentioned.

564
00:57:04,644 --> 00:57:16,656
[SPEAKER_05]: as part of the assessment of the displacement and the lots and the modification of that, or I should say a little bit more of the, you know, getting the freshmen and sophomores to no longer park on campus.

565
00:57:17,276 --> 00:57:21,000
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an understanding of the math of the existing parking that's available.

566
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide, please.

567
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:32,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So, here's the conclusion of what we found during our traffic impact study and parking assessment the project.

568
00:57:33,278 --> 00:57:45,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned the is the most conservative estimate I mentioned that residents of the building will walk and bike and use transit as a primary transportation mode and our.

569
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:50,953
[SPEAKER_05]: basically reliant or non-reliant on vehicles as part of this development.

570
00:57:51,734 --> 00:58:04,887
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, we understand the parking needs in and around the Tufts University campus and we understand how this is a housing project and there will be some parking associated with that.

571
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:05,868
[SPEAKER_05]: However,

572
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:30,740
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal of this project is to provide housing for students that currently live in Medford and the surrounding area and would anticipate that those residents would be the ones that are residing on the site and therefore will be less on campus or to and from campus vehicles along the transportation area.

573
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically the vehicles that travel to and from

574
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:41,102
[SPEAKER_05]: the study area will be vehicles that no longer have to do so because they'll be living on campus.

575
00:58:42,825 --> 00:58:48,248
[SPEAKER_05]: The capacity in the Dowling Hall garage, which I mentioned, and other Tufts parking lots would be able to accommodate.

576
00:58:48,268 --> 00:58:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: The project-related traffic for those that do decide to drive and want to park on campus.

577
00:58:55,731 --> 00:59:02,655
[SPEAKER_05]: But overall, as I mentioned, because of the displacement of the vehicles, the freshmen and sophomores no longer parking on campus.

578
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:11,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And the overall utilization, the project, we anticipate the project will have a minimal overall campus and study area impact on traffic and parking.

579
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

580
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:21,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it over to John Headland from the niche office.

581
00:59:22,128 --> 00:59:25,651
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to discuss the stormwater management associated with the project.

582
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:29,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?

583
00:59:31,036 --> 00:59:31,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

584
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:34,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm John Hedlund with Niche Engineering.

585
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:35,661
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a project civil engineer.

586
00:59:36,182 --> 00:59:40,424
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm here tonight to talk about the stormwater management, and I'll try to keep it at a higher level.

587
00:59:40,684 --> 00:59:45,467
[SPEAKER_13]: I am an engineer, so sometimes I get deep into the weeds on technical stuff, but I'll keep it at a higher level tonight.

588
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:50,130
[SPEAKER_13]: So a little information on the existing stormwater system for the parking lot.

589
00:59:50,170 --> 01:00:00,557
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was constructed prior to 2008 mass stormwater standards, and this means it provides minimal stormwater peak flow attenuation, water quality treatment, and groundwater recharge.

590
01:00:01,506 --> 01:00:10,383
[SPEAKER_13]: The project itself is proposing a comprehensive stormwater management system, and this is shown in blue along Boston Ave, and this consists of stormwater chambers.

591
01:00:13,946 --> 01:00:17,907
[SPEAKER_13]: It provides approximately 39,000 gallons of infiltration capacity.

592
01:00:17,927 --> 01:00:25,148
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means it can infiltrate 39,500 gallons of water into the groundwater.

593
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:27,889
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is increasing groundwater infiltration.

594
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:37,951
[SPEAKER_13]: It also provides treatment using deep hooded catch basins, water quality structures, stormwater chambers with isolator rows, and stormwater infiltration.

595
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:43,512
[SPEAKER_13]: So during the 100-year storm event, it will actually reduce

596
01:00:45,063 --> 01:00:48,565
[SPEAKER_13]: flow to the city system by 88,000 gallons of stormwater.

597
01:00:49,185 --> 01:00:56,429
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a roughly equal for perspective about a 25 by 45 by a five foot depth pool.

598
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:59,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Two of those pools not entering into the municipal system.

599
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:03,533
[SPEAKER_13]: It also reduces the peak flow rates into the system as well.

600
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:11,597
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanna note to the board that we have met with the city DPW numerous times and they've taken no objection to the stormwater approach.

601
01:01:12,197 --> 01:01:13,718
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that, I'll hand it off to David.

602
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, members of the board, good evening, everybody.

603
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:23,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm David Manfredi from Elkis Manfredi Architects.

604
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be very brief this evening.

605
01:01:25,506 --> 01:01:26,907
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard me several times.

606
01:01:28,248 --> 01:01:29,429
[SPEAKER_10]: You all know the site.

607
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:43,760
[SPEAKER_10]: It exists approximately halfway between College Ave and Winthrop Street, a long linear site on the south side of Boston Ave that is today occupied by two surface parking lots just west of Dowling Hall.

608
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:52,324
[SPEAKER_10]: and sits at the bottom of the hill, the hill that goes up to the green into residential quadrangle at the center of campus.

609
01:01:54,086 --> 01:02:02,351
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to talk tonight about improvements to public realm especially, and you've seen this image before.

610
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:12,418
[SPEAKER_10]: We are looking to make significant improvements on both sides of Boston Avenue that will provide benefits not just to the

611
01:02:12,987 --> 01:02:17,591
[SPEAKER_10]: the users of the street, but hopefully significant benefits for the neighborhood as well.

612
01:02:18,191 --> 01:02:23,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And that includes setting the buildings back, creating wide sidewalks.

613
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:36,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And most importantly, we are looking to relocate the power lines, the above ground power lines that are currently on the south side of Boston Ave to the north side of Boston Ave.

614
01:02:36,826 --> 01:02:42,371
[SPEAKER_10]: That will allow us first to remove what is not a particularly

615
01:02:43,358 --> 01:03:07,686
[SPEAKER_10]: attractive utility, but secondly, to plant real street trees to create what we call a complete street, meaning with a landscape zone, mature street trees, wide sidewalks, approximately 22 feet from curb to face the building for that entire stretch on the south side of the street from Dowling Hall to University Ave.

616
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:16,104
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also proposing to the MBTA to plant smaller trees, lower trees on the north side.

617
01:03:16,764 --> 01:03:28,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it would be a double row of trees, one row of trees on the south side of the street, another row of trees on the north side of the street between these two buildings and the neighborhood.

618
01:03:28,811 --> 01:03:34,735
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason that the trees on the north side would be smaller in stature

619
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:56,144
[SPEAKER_10]: is because they would live underneath the relocated power lines and provide that second buffer to the neighborhood, that green buffer to the neighborhood, without any issues about limbs dropping onto the MBTA tracks.

620
01:03:56,945 --> 01:03:57,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that is

621
01:03:58,104 --> 01:04:09,831
[SPEAKER_10]: That all requires approval by the MBTA and by the utility to relocate the power lines.

622
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:17,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to show you a section through here to make this a little clearer of what these improvements will provide.

623
01:04:17,515 --> 01:04:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: At the top, you see the plan.

624
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:22,038
[SPEAKER_10]: That's basically the plan you saw in the former slide.

625
01:04:22,518 --> 01:04:25,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Just reduced it now in scale all the way.

626
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,881
[SPEAKER_10]: If you see my arrow.

627
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:29,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see it.

628
01:04:29,076 --> 01:04:30,617
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

629
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:31,757
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Dowling Hall.

630
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:32,898
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our east building.

631
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:38,200
[SPEAKER_10]: The stairs between the two buildings are West Building and University Ave.

632
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:44,003
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're cutting a section right through the earth and through the buildings right here.

633
01:04:44,103 --> 01:04:47,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the section as it exists today.

634
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:54,607
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see a surface parking lot well above the street and that slope that you're all aware of.

635
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:56,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the existing

636
01:04:57,615 --> 01:05:12,819
[SPEAKER_10]: public realm, which is a 5'4 inch sidewalk, parallel parking, bike lane, two lanes of traffic, and again, the 4'6 bike lane and parallel parking, 6'10 sidewalk.

637
01:05:13,939 --> 01:05:26,583
[SPEAKER_10]: These cars are approximately, it varies, of course, but as much as 15 feet above the street, obviously,

638
01:05:27,565 --> 01:05:29,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I had lights shining to the north.

639
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:36,730
[SPEAKER_10]: The proposed section below, you can see that same dash line is the existing grade.

640
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:43,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Our building would sit at the elevation of the existing sidewalk.

641
01:05:44,154 --> 01:05:50,878
[SPEAKER_10]: The sidewalk would be approximately 22 feet, 22 foot six from face of building to curb.

642
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,040
[SPEAKER_10]: It would include a five foot six

643
01:05:54,585 --> 01:06:18,399
[SPEAKER_10]: landscape zone for these new street trees, nine foot sidewalk, fully accessible, and then an eight foot, what we're calling an outdoor seating space, if there is a restaurant on the ground floor, or if there's retail, but in good weather, would spill out onto that sidewalk, but all of that becoming part of the public realm.

644
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:34,623
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see again the parallel parking on both sides, the bike lane on both sides, and then the wider sidewalk on the north side, on the neighborhood side, and the new street trees adjacent to the curb on that wider sidewalk.

645
01:06:35,463 --> 01:06:39,664
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the sidewalk on the campus side.

646
01:06:40,304 --> 01:06:46,745
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see that wide sidewalk that from curb to face of building is the 22 foot 6 inches.

647
01:06:46,805 --> 01:06:47,605
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see where

648
01:06:48,235 --> 01:06:52,338
[SPEAKER_10]: There is this kind of seating zone for a restaurant that would spill out.

649
01:06:53,619 --> 01:07:02,425
[SPEAKER_10]: If it were retail that spilled out, the handrails go away and in the good weather, you're activating and energizing the industry.

650
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:12,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not gonna repeat all 14 public realm improvements that you heard us list just a couple of weeks ago.

651
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:17,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm only gonna point out number one, because it is the most important of this list,

652
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:27,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is that these two buildings will provide on-campus housing for approximately 677 juniors and seniors at Tufts.

653
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:36,612
[SPEAKER_10]: These juniors and seniors would, in all likelihood, be living in off-campus apartments in and around the campus.

654
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:46,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's every reason to believe that taking those students out of the neighborhood will reduce rent pressure in the neighborhood, will reduce traffic,

655
01:07:46,845 --> 01:08:01,994
[SPEAKER_10]: because they'll already be on campus rather than driving and parking on campus, as well as significant other benefits that always accrue when more students are living on urban campuses or semi-urban campuses around the country.

656
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:08,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I'll turn it back for one final important conclusion from Rockwell.

657
01:08:11,445 --> 01:08:12,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, David.

658
01:08:13,186 --> 01:08:26,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So as David mentioned, in addition to those commitments that we made on the previous slide, that were the results of our months of meeting with with neighbors, elected officials and department heads.

659
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:35,453
[SPEAKER_06]: We have also pledged to the city that we are committed to a one time contribution of $500,000 to address

660
01:08:38,654 --> 01:08:43,075
[SPEAKER_06]: the concerns of the neighbors that are impacted downhill from this project.

661
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:52,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And we look forward to working with the city on finding the best way to utilize those funds to benefit the neighborhood that surrounds our campus.

662
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:59,198
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I just want to thank the board for giving us the time to come back here and speak again tonight.

663
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

664
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:09,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much for going to all of your team members this evening for presenting.

665
01:09:11,827 --> 01:09:18,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Before I open it up to the board, I do believe that Peter Cowles has words that he wanted to say.

666
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:20,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

667
01:09:21,512 --> 01:09:22,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

668
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:27,175
[SPEAKER_14]: As I said last time, I work for NIFT Engineering.

669
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:31,478
[SPEAKER_14]: And so as a company policy, whenever something comes before a board,

670
01:09:32,937 --> 01:09:36,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I will, the initiatives worked on, I will have to recuse myself.

671
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,142
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Chairman Phearson, and thank you everyone.

672
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:41,364
[SPEAKER_14]: And that will be my only comment on this matter.

673
01:09:41,764 --> 01:09:41,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

674
01:09:43,205 --> 01:09:44,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Peter.

675
01:09:45,844 --> 01:10:03,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Before I open it up to the board, I wanted to bring it back to the city and just ask if the department head for transportation, transportation engineer is on this evening, just to give us a little bit more insight of the city's stance on the parking waiver.

676
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:08,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Or if Danielle or Director Hunt wanted to give any information or any insight there.

677
01:10:14,157 --> 01:10:19,782
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that Director Blake was able to join us tonight.

678
01:10:23,145 --> 01:10:30,832
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not gotten any written formal comments, but I was in a meeting where he attended yesterday with some of the Tufts project team.

679
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:38,699
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't want to speak on his behalf until I see those comments.

680
01:10:42,553 --> 01:10:51,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I just, only because I know that tonight is heavily based on a transportation presentation and questions that's going to surround it.

681
01:10:51,095 --> 01:11:11,160
[SPEAKER_21]: We've seen that, you know, I've seen actually evidence in my opinion that it's not going to, it's going to have a nominal increase in trips, even using a conservative manual, but I am not an expert in transportation, so I can't satisfy the public's questions on that.

682
01:11:13,384 --> 01:11:18,368
[SPEAKER_21]: And saying that, I will open up to the board if there's any other questions.

683
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,193
[SPEAKER_21]: At this point, before I open it up to the public.

684
01:11:26,294 --> 01:11:26,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Ari Fishman.

685
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the applicants for the presentation.

686
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:36,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I am curious if you can speak more about the

687
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:49,496
[SPEAKER_03]: concerns that the public brought at the last meeting about the significant shadowing that your own study found would affect quite a large number of streets.

688
01:11:50,236 --> 01:11:56,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping from the introductory slide that you would speak more about that, but it wasn't addressed.

689
01:11:57,042 --> 01:12:01,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of have heard significant concerns and I'm imagining how I would feel

690
01:12:02,995 --> 01:12:12,044
[SPEAKER_03]: if I suddenly started being in the dark at 2pm during the winter instead of at 4pm, and that seems like something that we should continue talking about.

691
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:19,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to hear some more from the applicants about any options to decrease the impact on the neighborhood.

692
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:19,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

693
01:12:21,814 --> 01:12:22,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ari.

694
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:38,092
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of the trees that we have added and the other features that we have added are meant to mitigate some of the additional shadows caused by the building.

695
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:51,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, that is why we came up with this community fund to best determine how to support those neighbors that are impacted by the shadows.

696
01:12:53,584 --> 01:12:56,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say we looked at reducing the height of the building.

697
01:12:57,486 --> 01:13:06,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we determined is that eliminating a floor or two off the building did not have a significant impact on the shadows.

698
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:09,674
[SPEAKER_06]: But for every floor we took off, that's

699
01:13:10,674 --> 01:13:13,777
[SPEAKER_06]: 60 more students that are, you know, living in the neighborhoods.

700
01:13:15,398 --> 01:13:19,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, you know, we wanted to make sure we got that point across.

701
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:28,969
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I would emphasize is that we all, the allowable zoning in the area which the city has set forth is 12 stories.

702
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:35,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we intentionally shaved off, you know, two stories before even proposing the building.

703
01:13:37,156 --> 01:13:38,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing our best to

704
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:49,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Satisfy two things, which is maximizing the amount of students that are living on campus and bring together a project that's good.

705
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's any other members of the team that want to speak to this, please just raise your hand.

706
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,161
[SPEAKER_30]: If I can add to that, Madam Chair.

707
01:13:58,821 --> 01:13:59,201
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

708
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:02,342
[SPEAKER_30]: Patrick Gallagher with Goulston and Storrs on behalf of the applicant.

709
01:14:02,602 --> 01:14:12,524
[SPEAKER_30]: And Ari, thank you for bringing up the fact that we did not raise shadows and I understand how that might seem conspicuous on our part.

710
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:23,967
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think the reason for not spending time on that today is we're trying to work and obviously on a compressed timeframe with the holiday last week.

711
01:14:24,885 --> 01:14:32,728
[SPEAKER_30]: But we're trying to work toward getting more information that we can specifically share with the neighbors who are affected and with the board.

712
01:14:33,909 --> 01:14:40,392
[SPEAKER_30]: We're hoping to have more conversations on this between today and our next hearing on December 18.

713
01:14:42,593 --> 01:14:48,855
[SPEAKER_30]: We felt like we just wouldn't have been in a position tonight to present new information.

714
01:14:49,976 --> 01:14:52,857
[SPEAKER_30]: But I want to assure the board that this is something where

715
01:14:53,383 --> 01:15:03,094
[SPEAKER_30]: spending a lot of time internally looking at and trying to figure out how do we address these concerns, which we understand are very real concerns of the neighbors.

716
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:06,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

717
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:09,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens.

718
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:16,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Apologies if you covered this in the last meeting.

719
01:15:16,441 --> 01:15:24,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't fully remember, but I think there was an astute comment from one of the members of the public.

720
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:45,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Just more broadly, the Tufts campus is a large campus, and there's additional sites to try to spread out construction or housing where it wouldn't necessarily need to be concentrated in a 10-story tall building.

721
01:15:48,975 --> 01:15:59,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but my question was just a little bit more to kind of wrap my head around, um, like how much of the kind of student housing shortage does this particular building solve?

722
01:16:00,698 --> 01:16:09,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and so, you know, just in terms of the students that don't have housing, um, you know, uh, is that like a thousand students or 2000 students?

723
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:12,721
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you're kind of biting off the 670 of them and then I'm not.

724
01:16:15,122 --> 01:16:26,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Too familiar with some of the master planning around Tufts, but is there then additional dorms and housing that Tufts will need other sites for?

725
01:16:27,785 --> 01:16:33,552
[SPEAKER_15]: over the next five years or 10 years in order to meet that shortfall?

726
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:44,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Or do you think about this project really as, hey, this is going to substantially bite off that shortage and really address the immediate or midterm needs?

727
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:50,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam, that's that's an excellent question.

728
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:56,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And to answer the specifics that you mentioned, we have approximately 2000 students that live off campus.

729
01:16:57,505 --> 01:17:02,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So this project will house 677 of them on campus.

730
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:05,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So that addresses about a third of the students living on campus.

731
01:17:07,033 --> 01:17:09,196
[SPEAKER_06]: But to your larger question we're not done there.

732
01:17:09,937 --> 01:17:18,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We are renovating Blakely Hall, which is also on the Medford side of the campus that will be an additional 120 beds for undergraduate students.

733
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a project.

734
01:17:22,774 --> 01:17:26,916
[SPEAKER_06]: in Medford called COHO, which stands for community housing.

735
01:17:28,036 --> 01:17:30,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're adding buildings to that.

736
01:17:30,397 --> 01:17:35,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are kind of smaller scale dorms, but together they help us add up to a dorm.

737
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:44,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are other sites on the Somerville side of the campus, for example, that we are currently looking at and evaluating for additional housing.

738
01:17:44,902 --> 01:17:58,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So, while this is a very big chunk of those students, I do want to assure you and the board and the members of the public that we're looking at all options that we can to add more housing on campus.

739
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:00,773
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks.

740
01:18:02,482 --> 01:18:11,144
[SPEAKER_21]: And to go along with that, Rocco, if you can just reiterate that you're not, this is not in a response to increase in enrollment that Tufts may have in the future.

741
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:16,145
[SPEAKER_21]: You're actually trying to bring more students off campus back to campus.

742
01:18:16,365 --> 01:18:24,246
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that are living off campus, because I remember attending Tufts, you only had housing for freshmen, correct?

743
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:28,407
[SPEAKER_21]: And since then you've increasingly have created housing.

744
01:18:28,447 --> 01:18:32,048
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to make, I wanted to be clear to the public that

745
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:34,669
[SPEAKER_21]: you're not responding to an increase in enrollment.

746
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,691
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct, Madam Chair, and you're right.

747
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:45,857
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first got to Tufts, the requirement is for all freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, which we currently provide.

748
01:18:46,657 --> 01:18:53,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So now what we're doing with these new housing projects is really trying to bring juniors and seniors back on campus.

749
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:58,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So that Coho development that I talked about, that's junior and senior housing.

750
01:18:58,786 --> 01:19:01,488
[SPEAKER_06]: This entire development will be junior and senior housing.

751
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:10,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are 100% right that the objective of this project is to bring juniors and seniors who are currently living off campus and bring them onto campus.

752
01:19:11,836 --> 01:19:12,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

753
01:19:13,477 --> 01:19:17,840
[SPEAKER_30]: And Madam Chair, if I may, I would also just emphasize to a point that Raka was making.

754
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:23,805
[SPEAKER_30]: This project, I think Tufts Views is really a generational opportunity.

755
01:19:24,757 --> 01:19:30,061
[SPEAKER_30]: to bring a large number of students back to campus under the umbrella of a single project.

756
01:19:30,821 --> 01:19:45,172
[SPEAKER_30]: And whereas to hit that number of 670 students in smaller projects, you'd be talking about a larger number of projects, potentially, you know, extending and impacting far more areas than

757
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,241
[SPEAKER_30]: this single project site.

758
01:19:47,822 --> 01:19:53,107
[SPEAKER_30]: So understanding and not to minimize any concerns around the size of this project.

759
01:19:53,687 --> 01:20:04,557
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think the size is also an opportunity that Tufts would not have from doing smaller discrete projects to bring a significant number of juniors and seniors back to campus.

760
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,261
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

761
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:16,907
[SPEAKER_21]: And if there are no other comments from the board, I'm going to open it up to direct on.

762
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:27,464
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, I sort of wanted to put this in that interim between public comments and the board comments.

763
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:33,966
[SPEAKER_24]: So I did want to acknowledge that Mayor Brianna met with residents.

764
01:20:34,446 --> 01:20:36,727
[SPEAKER_24]: She sent a letter to the President of Tufts.

765
01:20:36,807 --> 01:20:40,208
[SPEAKER_24]: She met with Tufts as well, sent a letter to the President of Tufts.

766
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:54,667
[SPEAKER_24]: And they did respond to this evening with a letter, along with sort of listing out what they feel are the benefits to the community, including mentioning this $500,000 community fund.

767
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:59,751
[SPEAKER_24]: which is the first that she or the staff had heard this idea.

768
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:15,476
[SPEAKER_24]: And I let her know very briefly that the letter is there, but we had city events all evening and she hasn't had a chance to actually review the letter or any of that yet to provide sort of her response to it.

769
01:21:16,536 --> 01:21:19,337
[SPEAKER_24]: But I did want people to know that those are out there.

770
01:21:22,098 --> 01:21:25,019
[SPEAKER_24]: There were some ideas that we had had about

771
01:21:28,771 --> 01:21:30,954
[SPEAKER_24]: How to respond to some of the resident concerns.

772
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:44,233
[SPEAKER_24]: We, I have reservations about a fund just to be clear that the city cannot receive money and distribute it back or directly like we couldn't do work on somebody's house or private property.

773
01:21:44,673 --> 01:21:49,215
[SPEAKER_24]: or give money to a resident if the city received it, that would literally be illegal.

774
01:21:50,476 --> 01:21:54,878
[SPEAKER_24]: So we could only like do sidewalks and traffic calming with money.

775
01:21:55,198 --> 01:22:07,605
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to sort of put that sort of framing, if there was a fund that Tufts administered or some other third party, there would be significantly more flexibility with money like that.

776
01:22:08,325 --> 01:22:11,427
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want everybody to be clear on how that,

777
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:13,968
[SPEAKER_24]: what's allowed and not allowed.

778
01:22:14,648 --> 01:22:22,832
[SPEAKER_24]: And there was one idea that I actually discussed with her yesterday that she wanted me to raise, and that's the idea of community solar.

779
01:22:23,412 --> 01:22:34,898
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is the idea where an organization has solar, and then other people other than the entity that owns the solar benefit from the renewable energy, the electricity,

780
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:37,479
[SPEAKER_24]: that they buy the electricity off of it.

781
01:22:38,500 --> 01:23:00,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Often we've been hearing from residents who are very much in favor of helping low-income people that they'd like to see as community solar project where low-income people could then buy the solar, the electricity at a discount so they'd get discounted electricity and benefit particularly people who couldn't afford to have solar on their own homes.

782
01:23:01,212 --> 01:23:17,686
[SPEAKER_24]: And so an idea of having a community solar project through Tufts where the residents whose homes by a solar expert could tell you whether or not you could have solar on your home based on the amount of shading at your location.

783
01:23:18,296 --> 01:23:24,980
[SPEAKER_24]: if they were found that they couldn't because of this project, that they could benefit from a solar project at Tufts.

784
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,523
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I just wanted to put that forward because that would be a direct response to a direct impact.

785
01:23:31,003 --> 01:23:31,804
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be possible.

786
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:39,288
[SPEAKER_24]: It wouldn't help with any shading, but would help with higher energy bills because of more shading, for example.

787
01:23:39,788 --> 01:23:41,990
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to put that out there as an idea.

788
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:49,077
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see any way that anybody could respond on the ability to do that upon hearing it at first.

789
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:50,739
[SPEAKER_24]: They'd have to look into it.

790
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:52,501
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

791
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:58,387
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I can manage the public comment queue for you.

792
01:23:58,407 --> 01:24:01,450
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you'd like me to speak about the written letters.

793
01:24:02,618 --> 01:24:12,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, yes, I'm just gonna do the public announcement and just set a little bit of housekeeping rules for the public commenting period.

794
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:13,156
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll open it first.

795
01:24:14,623 --> 01:24:16,044
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll open the public comment period.

796
01:24:16,304 --> 01:24:20,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat.

797
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:26,649
[SPEAKER_21]: If you are having technical difficulties, you can also send an email to OCD at method-ma.gov.

798
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:30,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

799
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:39,596
[SPEAKER_21]: A reminder to all participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it is not part of the public record.

800
01:24:40,336 --> 01:24:45,620
[SPEAKER_21]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message staff for assistance.

801
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Each participant will have 2 minutes to speak.

802
01:24:48,061 --> 01:24:51,244
[SPEAKER_21]: 1 of the things I wanted to just set straight is that.

803
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:59,935
[SPEAKER_21]: Tonight's comments will only be about new information and not comments that we've already rehashed in the past.

804
01:25:00,536 --> 01:25:13,026
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can only take into consideration things that are part of the site plan review that the CDB board can control, like height, bulk, parking, setbacks, design, but we cannot do labor agreements.

805
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:18,130
[SPEAKER_21]: We have no control over labor agreements, and I wanted to make that clear to the public before opening.

806
01:25:19,108 --> 01:25:23,009
[SPEAKER_21]: And with that, Director Hunt, can you please manage the public comment queue?

807
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:31,891
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that you're not able to read all emails and letters, but if you can please just give us some common issues or themes that you have read.

808
01:25:34,912 --> 01:25:43,174
[SPEAKER_24]: So I did share with the board an email this afternoon, late afternoon, so I can't imagine that anybody's had a chance to see it.

809
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:47,793
[SPEAKER_24]: that a couple of the letters had some illustrative photos in them.

810
01:25:48,594 --> 01:25:56,221
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I called their attention to the names of those letters in our public comments section if they wanted to see them.

811
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:02,086
[SPEAKER_24]: And sorry, I had it in front of me.

812
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:06,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to give a very brief summary

813
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:12,822
[SPEAKER_24]: In general, there were some concerns about whether Dover applied here.

814
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:29,247
[SPEAKER_24]: And I will tell you that we got a very clear statement from our lawyer that if Tufts owns the property or leases the property and the building houses Tufts students, that in their opinion, it is very clearly a Dover project and there is no question about that.

815
01:26:31,727 --> 01:26:33,588
[SPEAKER_24]: And sorry, I had a,

816
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,586
[SPEAKER_24]: A quick summary up in front of me.

817
01:26:42,813 --> 01:26:44,475
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to just sort of give you the numbers.

818
01:26:44,495 --> 01:26:50,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I can tell you there were, since the last meeting, we've received 12 letters from residents

819
01:26:51,178 --> 01:26:53,240
[SPEAKER_24]: that have concerns, issues.

820
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,441
[SPEAKER_24]: They're opposed to it.

821
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:56,322
[SPEAKER_24]: They feel the project is rushed.

822
01:26:56,763 --> 01:26:58,504
[SPEAKER_24]: They are concerned about the shadowing.

823
01:26:58,544 --> 01:27:02,367
[SPEAKER_24]: They're concerned about living right next to a 10-story building.

824
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:08,152
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're concerned about construction noise and construction impacts on them.

825
01:27:10,591 --> 01:27:25,078
[SPEAKER_24]: Then we received eight letters from residents who said they would really like to see more housing on the Tufts campus, that they like that it's near the T stop, and they'd like to see more housing built and built soon.

826
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:29,820
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the very brief summary of that.

827
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:36,163
[SPEAKER_24]: And all of those letters are available in full in the public comments folder.

828
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:42,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

829
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:46,043
[SPEAKER_21]: And do we have any members of the public that wish to speak this evening?

830
01:27:49,204 --> 01:27:56,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Madam Chair, I had a participant message me that they are unable to raise their hand.

831
01:27:57,425 --> 01:27:59,786
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to take this person first.

832
01:27:59,906 --> 01:28:01,346
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a birdie.

833
01:28:01,366 --> 01:28:03,886
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the screen name.

834
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:06,627
[SPEAKER_22]: I will

835
01:28:08,098 --> 01:28:09,399
[SPEAKER_17]: unmute this individual.

836
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh hi yes it's Amy again for summary.

837
01:28:11,722 --> 01:28:15,946
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm on my phone so it's really hard to get to the features and I didn't see that option listed.

838
01:28:15,986 --> 01:28:16,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I spoke earlier tonight.

839
01:28:17,628 --> 01:28:18,388
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Amy Burness.

840
01:28:18,428 --> 01:28:21,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm at 138 Burgett Avenue.

841
01:28:21,131 --> 01:28:25,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I was on the call two weeks ago so thank you for the new information tonight.

842
01:28:28,263 --> 01:28:28,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting piece.

843
01:28:28,983 --> 01:28:37,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't realize we were in a zone that allows 12 stories on top of a hill, on top of a community with one-story buildings.

844
01:28:37,165 --> 01:28:45,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Contrasting that over by 93, you're putting the bigger buildings, the zone over there for Mystic or the earlier topic tonight.

845
01:28:45,907 --> 01:28:51,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Yet in a residential area, clearly residential, we're allowed to have buildings that are 12-story.

846
01:28:51,269 --> 01:28:55,290
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that zoning should have been looked at a long time ago and fixed.

847
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:13,606
[SPEAKER_17]: The parking, I assume that we're in a parking permit zone now on our street, so hopefully that excludes anyone on Tufts campus so that our street doesn't become an easy parking for the building.

848
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:14,887
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be like one street over.

849
01:29:15,027 --> 01:29:17,129
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess my third comment is around

850
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:22,636
[SPEAKER_17]: The fund, so I don't know.

851
01:29:23,636 --> 01:29:26,516
[SPEAKER_17]: None of us like 10 stories towering over us.

852
01:29:26,576 --> 01:29:28,077
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't seem like any of that was addressed.

853
01:29:28,137 --> 01:29:32,058
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know at what point the shadow would make sense or why a building couldn't be somewhere else.

854
01:29:32,078 --> 01:29:35,098
[SPEAKER_17]: 500,000 for who?

855
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:44,500
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I would like to just put on record then those of us who are living in direct impact of this should have a very good say about it, whether it should be solar or I don't know.

856
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,281
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what the perfect use should be,

857
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:55,030
[SPEAKER_17]: There should be discussion if that fund is available, particularly for those of us on these streets where we're going to be living in the shadows of a large building.

858
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:56,632
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for my time.

859
01:29:57,958 --> 01:29:58,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

860
01:29:58,799 --> 01:30:04,562
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to reiterate, the city will have to have continued conversations with Tufts University regarding that fund.

861
01:30:04,622 --> 01:30:09,545
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not written in stone, as Director Hunt has already said this evening, the city cannot accept that fund.

862
01:30:09,945 --> 01:30:17,590
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're going to continue to have conversations with Tufts University going forward regarding parking and the shadow studies, just to give you an idea, Ms.

863
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:17,930
[SPEAKER_21]: Burney.

864
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:20,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Next.

865
01:30:24,614 --> 01:30:24,914
[SPEAKER_22]: Next.

866
01:30:35,862 --> 01:30:36,442
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, there we go.

867
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:37,683
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, everybody.

868
01:30:37,803 --> 01:30:39,923
[SPEAKER_29]: Alex Hackman 71 human Avenue.

869
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:42,544
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for the presentation site and the information.

870
01:30:42,564 --> 01:30:46,085
[SPEAKER_29]: This is super real for my household.

871
01:30:46,105 --> 01:30:47,146
[SPEAKER_29]: We're going to look right out of this.

872
01:30:47,566 --> 01:30:51,027
[SPEAKER_29]: My kitchen window here and right out of my diner window and boom, it's going to be right there.

873
01:30:51,047 --> 01:30:51,087
[SPEAKER_29]: So.

874
01:30:53,753 --> 01:31:04,396
[SPEAKER_29]: That said, we, in our household, are very supportive of higher density, of bringing kids back to campus, what it means for the units that will become available for other people in the community.

875
01:31:04,456 --> 01:31:07,597
[SPEAKER_29]: So kudos and appreciate all the information.

876
01:31:07,617 --> 01:31:09,778
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to raise two concerns, though.

877
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:14,880
[SPEAKER_29]: The first is about not the parking issue.

878
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:17,160
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not about the parking by the residents.

879
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:22,002
[SPEAKER_29]: It's about the parking, the temporary parking that is going to occur from deliveries.

880
01:31:23,028 --> 01:31:35,214
[SPEAKER_29]: We walk around Tufts campus every other day, we bike down the street regularly, and we know that delivery drivers park in the bike lanes, interrupt traffic.

881
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:42,498
[SPEAKER_29]: And we see this in the new Cummings building, which is right over here too, despite claims that this wouldn't happen.

882
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:46,340
[SPEAKER_29]: People are picking up their cup of coffee, blocking bike traffic there.

883
01:31:48,408 --> 01:31:53,992
[SPEAKER_29]: I really want us to avoid making a pinch point here, where this whole stretch is going to be redeveloped.

884
01:31:54,392 --> 01:32:02,438
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think if we mess this up, if we don't consider those kind of temporary drop-offs right, we could regret it.

885
01:32:02,478 --> 01:32:04,319
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just hope we can really think about

886
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:08,034
[SPEAKER_29]: Not the residential parking, but the intense drop-offs.

887
01:32:08,094 --> 01:32:12,356
[SPEAKER_29]: We know younger kids order a lot of stuff, including single cups of coffee early in the morning.

888
01:32:12,376 --> 01:32:13,656
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I see get dropped off.

889
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,137
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'd like that to be thought through.

890
01:32:16,157 --> 01:32:19,358
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, seriously, Pat, I do see that.

891
01:32:20,878 --> 01:32:23,819
[SPEAKER_29]: The other thing I'd like to say is we are going to fall into the shadow space here.

892
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:28,301
[SPEAKER_29]: We just invested tens of thousands of dollars to solar, and we're fortunate to do that.

893
01:32:28,381 --> 01:32:29,481
[SPEAKER_29]: We also bought heat pumps.

894
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:31,062
[SPEAKER_29]: We're really concerned about sustainability.

895
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:34,243
[SPEAKER_29]: And in the wintertime,

896
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,640
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, you know, losing those precious couple hours.

897
01:32:37,661 --> 01:32:39,002
[SPEAKER_29]: The afternoon is a big deal.

898
01:32:39,022 --> 01:32:40,683
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, the trees are going to help.

899
01:32:41,604 --> 01:32:45,007
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, but Mr. you mentioned that you had looked at.

900
01:32:45,988 --> 01:32:52,854
[SPEAKER_29]: The alternative impacts from the 8 or 9 story buildings, I'd like to ask if that could be put in the public space.

901
01:32:52,894 --> 01:32:54,935
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that was the question that my household's interested.

902
01:32:54,995 --> 01:32:56,156
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just a relative to what.

903
01:32:57,174 --> 01:32:57,794
[SPEAKER_29]: question.

904
01:32:58,715 --> 01:32:59,435
[SPEAKER_29]: We like density.

905
01:32:59,455 --> 01:33:01,316
[SPEAKER_29]: 10 stories is high, right?

906
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:01,897
[SPEAKER_29]: Density is great.

907
01:33:01,937 --> 01:33:05,479
[SPEAKER_29]: But how much less shading are we going to see for 8 or 9 stories?

908
01:33:06,099 --> 01:33:12,602
[SPEAKER_29]: So I really encourage that to be put in the public space so residents who are in this shadow zone can really think about that.

909
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:15,704
[SPEAKER_29]: With that, I'll wrap up my comments.

910
01:33:15,744 --> 01:33:16,284
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

911
01:33:16,304 --> 01:33:17,325
[SPEAKER_29]: Appreciate all the information.

912
01:33:18,278 --> 01:33:19,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. Hackman.

913
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:28,216
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to take all public comments before asking Tufts to respond to the questions they feel are necessary.

914
01:33:35,892 --> 01:33:36,873
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll call on the next one.

915
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:43,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, I want to ask Tufts if they could plan to, when they're responding, zoom in on that drop-off area.

916
01:33:44,419 --> 01:33:52,804
[SPEAKER_24]: Under most site plan reviews, we would look much more closely at the drop-off area to see how long it is, how many vehicles, how that's going to work.

917
01:33:52,865 --> 01:33:56,567
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the board should take a look.

918
01:33:57,007 --> 01:34:00,390
[SPEAKER_24]: The next member of the public is Lori Krieger.

919
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:06,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.

920
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:07,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

921
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:11,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And Madam Chair, I apologize for speaking too long last time.

922
01:34:11,524 --> 01:34:15,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I had three minutes written, but I couldn't edit in real time.

923
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:18,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So my biggest concern is

924
01:34:20,679 --> 01:34:21,160
[SPEAKER_09]: all of it.

925
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you saw the photos that I did.

926
01:34:23,421 --> 01:34:24,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you did.

927
01:34:24,762 --> 01:34:26,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Please take the time to do that.

928
01:34:26,724 --> 01:34:32,809
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing that I really want to hear is like one of the developers tonight said that they put the building at the bottom of the hill.

929
01:34:33,409 --> 01:34:36,191
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they put that the building at the middle of the hill.

930
01:34:37,092 --> 01:34:42,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And the side view, the elevation ends abruptly at the end of the train tracks.

931
01:34:43,036 --> 01:34:46,019
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's the rest of us, the other half of the hill.

932
01:34:46,699 --> 01:34:48,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think it's an extreme

933
01:34:49,733 --> 01:34:52,274
[SPEAKER_09]: placement by virtue that's in the middle of the hill.

934
01:34:52,794 --> 01:34:54,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to see what that looks like.

935
01:34:54,595 --> 01:34:57,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now the building's on the left of the picture.

936
01:34:57,636 --> 01:35:00,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Center it or put it right so we can see the whole story.

937
01:35:00,537 --> 01:35:05,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm really concerned that in most of these renderings that we get, we're not getting the whole story.

938
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:14,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Similarly, all of the photos around the project itself, where it's placed in space,

939
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:23,901
[SPEAKER_09]: is at a very, very wide angle view, which we know makes objects further away smaller and those closest to us bigger.

940
01:35:24,361 --> 01:35:32,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like our peripheral vision, but a 50 millimeter lens is what we see in terms of how things are squared up size and scale.

941
01:35:32,963 --> 01:35:38,744
[SPEAKER_09]: So show us that building again, but in a real situation, not this skewed one.

942
01:35:39,184 --> 01:35:41,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it look like it would look to a human being.

943
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:46,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So 50mm lens, we want to see what it really is going to look and feel like.

944
01:35:47,094 --> 01:35:51,320
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've also mentioned every floor of my house on the south side, I get to look in a dorm room.

945
01:35:51,841 --> 01:35:53,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to see 20 year old junk.

946
01:35:54,084 --> 01:35:55,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't want to.

947
01:35:57,369 --> 01:36:00,491
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's really important that you cannot replace the sun.

948
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,172
[SPEAKER_09]: You just cannot replace the sun.

949
01:36:02,712 --> 01:36:13,599
[SPEAKER_09]: If it has to be five stories, six stories, or seven stories so we can live our lives, our lives have already been upended for the good, for the train, for the T, for the Cummings Center.

950
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:19,122
[SPEAKER_09]: We support development for sure, but there are a whole lot of parking lots on Tufts.

951
01:36:19,162 --> 01:36:20,923
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole lot of place to do things.

952
01:36:21,463 --> 01:36:24,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And please,

953
01:36:25,003 --> 01:36:26,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't steal our son.

954
01:36:26,626 --> 01:36:27,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

955
01:36:28,008 --> 01:36:28,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ms.

956
01:36:28,509 --> 01:36:28,829
[SPEAKER_21]: Crager.

957
01:36:31,053 --> 01:36:33,797
[SPEAKER_24]: The next resident is Judith Weinstock.

958
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,141
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

959
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:56,663
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we spent a long time and a reasonable amount of time and even more time should be dedicated to the whole shadow effect of the building because it will be substantial for the group that is affected by it, some of them previously affected by the Cummins Center as well.

960
01:36:58,261 --> 01:37:14,508
[SPEAKER_26]: What I've not heard tonight at all are the effects of the light emissions from the 10-story building, which will have as dramatic an effect on the neighborhood as shadow, except that the light effect won't occur until the sun has set.

961
01:37:15,128 --> 01:37:24,432
[SPEAKER_26]: And then in the community below, it will feel like daytime at night, even more than it already does and substantially more.

962
01:37:25,165 --> 01:37:26,925
[SPEAKER_26]: And it has not been addressed.

963
01:37:26,965 --> 01:37:30,526
[SPEAKER_26]: It certainly hasn't been addressed in a way that mitigates the problem.

964
01:37:30,566 --> 01:37:42,688
[SPEAKER_26]: Planting trees is a lovely idea, but they're never going to grow high enough because they both can't and won't to mitigate the light emissions from that building.

965
01:37:43,188 --> 01:37:52,570
[SPEAKER_26]: So I really do think that the board needs to be looking very carefully, not just at what happens with shade and noise, but what happens with light emissions

966
01:37:53,150 --> 01:38:04,012
[SPEAKER_26]: at 3.30 in the afternoon, all winter long, when all the lights in the building over there will turn on and students will not turn them off at night because they're up at night.

967
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:05,812
[SPEAKER_26]: They're studying at night.

968
01:38:06,232 --> 01:38:16,534
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would really impress on the board that more really needs to be heard from the developer about how they're going to manage those light emissions.

969
01:38:16,654 --> 01:38:20,755
[SPEAKER_26]: And curtains inside the student rooms aren't going to cut it.

970
01:38:21,535 --> 01:38:23,797
[SPEAKER_26]: The students will not close their blinds.

971
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:33,104
[SPEAKER_26]: And so Lori's concern about having to look into 300 dorm rooms and see most of what's going on is probably not at all unfounded.

972
01:38:34,065 --> 01:38:44,132
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would like to hear a lot more about that as well as the board continues their due diligence looking at the project.

973
01:38:44,412 --> 01:38:44,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

974
01:38:45,825 --> 01:38:46,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ms.

975
01:38:46,345 --> 01:38:46,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Weinstein.

976
01:38:47,505 --> 01:39:01,769
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm assuming, Mr. Gallagher, when you spoke earlier about not being prepared to speak further on a response to the public for the solar, are you also preparing to speak further to the public on the light emissions?

977
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,290
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

978
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:13,572
[SPEAKER_30]: I think we're happy to address the questions as best we can, and it'll be a conversation that probably continues beyond tonight, but we can provide some responses.

979
01:39:14,413 --> 01:39:15,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

980
01:39:20,132 --> 01:39:23,174
[SPEAKER_24]: The next resident is Laura Jasinski.

981
01:39:23,194 --> 01:39:26,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, everybody.

982
01:39:27,077 --> 01:39:28,598
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Laura Jasinski.

983
01:39:28,618 --> 01:39:33,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 65 Burgett Ave and appreciate the additional information today.

984
01:39:33,362 --> 01:39:40,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think maybe echoing certainly what some of my neighbors have said, appreciate that we're making some progress in terms of mitigation.

985
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:53,652
[SPEAKER_12]: just as a voice saying I would still not trade the sunlight for the additional funds, but I think we're getting closer to having conversations, but just would be another voice in saying that that sunlight is invaluable.

986
01:39:53,813 --> 01:39:58,294
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really trying to look at massing of the building, the different shadow studies.

987
01:39:58,354 --> 01:40:04,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there other ways to help reduce or mitigate some of the loss of sunlight?

988
01:40:05,017 --> 01:40:08,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I do also want to say I like hearing things like looking at community solar.

989
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:25,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Things that are directly addressing the concerns that we're sharing and so I guess my, my questions or would ask the board to continue to ask these questions are twofold one would be, what is the process going to be to continue this conversation so that there's accountability in terms of how we.

990
01:40:26,822 --> 01:40:30,824
[SPEAKER_12]: either allocate those funds or continue to talk about mitigation after this process is over.

991
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:35,526
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would appeal to the board members to ask that and would ask that to Tufts directly.

992
01:40:36,066 --> 01:40:47,191
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the second is what are the policy changes that Tufts can make that are not going to be, you know, a wholesale solution, but are you going to require juniors to live on campus?

993
01:40:47,211 --> 01:40:48,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to require seniors to live on campus?

994
01:40:49,012 --> 01:40:50,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think the intentions of

995
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:59,075
[SPEAKER_12]: providing more housing in the neighborhood and affordable housing are great, but there has to be more than put a building up and they will come, I think.

996
01:40:59,815 --> 01:41:07,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm curious if Tufts can also speak to how they're going to make policy changes, how you can make policy changes about some of the lighting issues that have come up as well.

997
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:12,539
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to solve every problem all the time, because we are talking about individuals and 20 something year olds.

998
01:41:12,579 --> 01:41:19,201
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that that can also be a part of the solution and would like to continue to hear more about that from from Tufts as well.

999
01:41:20,482 --> 01:41:20,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1000
01:41:21,683 --> 01:41:22,203
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ms.

1001
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:41,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Jasinski, and I just wanted to just reiterate to the public that as far as the board, within our powers, actually, we have to do reasonable regulations that can actually mitigate what's reasonable to mitigate adverse impacts of waiving the requirements that the actual proponent's looking for.

1002
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:47,432
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll continue to have those conversations, but we're very limited in what we can ask the proponent to do.

1003
01:41:47,452 --> 01:41:47,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Again,

1004
01:41:49,913 --> 01:42:03,104
[SPEAKER_21]: We're happy that the proponent is having these conversations with the continued conversations with the public, but and hopefully we will get to a point where the public will be a lot more happier with the end result, but there's only so much the board can do.

1005
01:42:08,309 --> 01:42:13,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam chair, the next speaker is says Mike Krasinski, but it's Laurel Ruma.

1006
01:42:16,304 --> 01:42:17,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Alicia.

1007
01:42:18,185 --> 01:42:21,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the traffic state to me really felt like a parking study.

1008
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:34,317
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know how traffic moves around here and Alex's point about how dangerous as well as disruptive the traffic is in front of the Cummings building is is really true with a quick.

1009
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:53,410
[SPEAKER_08]: serve coffee shop with ride shares picking up and dropping off, food deliveries 24-7, the uptick as well as deliveries to the building itself, the uptick of traffic in the area that requires careful maneuvering not just for cars but pedestrians and cyclists as well is really significant.

1010
01:42:53,870 --> 01:43:01,234
[SPEAKER_08]: So the fact that there is no kind of traffic drop-off pickup in front of these two large buildings, which you know I have to say

1011
01:43:02,135 --> 01:43:10,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea how much food people ordered to just have delivered until I saw the Cummings building, you know, all day and all night.

1012
01:43:12,105 --> 01:43:22,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not insignificant and I feel like any real traffic study in 2024-25 would have to really visit that kind of disruption as well as

1013
01:43:23,677 --> 01:43:42,994
[SPEAKER_08]: know what we're not talking about which is 700 kids moving in and out of a building twice a year what does that look like how does that disrupt boston avenue i mean thoroughfare for the city but also emergency for thoroughfare um you know that is the kind of traffic study i expected you know i expect these kind of

1014
01:43:44,363 --> 01:43:53,789
[SPEAKER_08]: answers to be ready for the public if you're seeking approval for the building to be built, which kind of leads me into my next point, which is this entire process seems very rushed.

1015
01:43:54,289 --> 01:44:00,473
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about the need to do everything all at once without the proper studies, without the agreement.

1016
01:44:00,493 --> 01:44:02,915
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know if the $500,000 is actually real.

1017
01:44:02,955 --> 01:44:05,196
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know how it will be executed.

1018
01:44:06,577 --> 01:44:10,240
[SPEAKER_08]: We know this building won't have solar panels, so where is the solar farm going?

1019
01:44:11,654 --> 01:44:14,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a property around here is incredibly valuable.

1020
01:44:14,857 --> 01:44:19,740
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no way that Tufts is going to then just put solar panels in the middle of a parking lot when they could put up a building.

1021
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:25,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to be extraordinarily realistic about two things that don't exist now.

1022
01:44:26,005 --> 01:44:30,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have no through fare to actually ensure they do exist.

1023
01:44:30,609 --> 01:44:33,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And one is the trees on the north side of the property.

1024
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:35,833
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually the city's and the MBTA's property.

1025
01:44:36,293 --> 01:44:37,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And the second thing is this $500,000 fund.

1026
01:44:40,216 --> 01:44:44,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, these are things that the neighbors will, you know.

1027
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:55,184
[SPEAKER_08]: keep on keeping on about, but for example, when the power, when Tufts is building the co-generation plant, the power plant that's also in Boston Avenue, if you don't know, this is the view.

1028
01:44:55,204 --> 01:45:03,728
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a co-generation plant, it's a massive co-generation plant, so a massive power plant, a massive parking garage, and now it'll be two massive dorm buildings.

1029
01:45:04,228 --> 01:45:12,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically from the middle of the hill, as Lori says, you're looking at an entire wall of utilities and functional buildings for Tufts.

1030
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:16,426
[SPEAKER_08]: When that was being built, we asked.

1031
01:45:16,807 --> 01:45:17,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Four minutes left.

1032
01:45:17,747 --> 01:45:19,128
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to let you know.

1033
01:45:19,148 --> 01:45:20,049
[SPEAKER_21]: Four seconds.

1034
01:45:20,589 --> 01:45:20,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1035
01:45:20,909 --> 01:45:25,732
[SPEAKER_08]: But the point is, let's be realistic about what Tufts actually wants to do with this money.

1036
01:45:28,674 --> 01:45:29,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Understood.

1037
01:45:29,394 --> 01:45:29,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1038
01:45:33,857 --> 01:45:36,239
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is JFD8.

1039
01:45:36,679 --> 01:45:38,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Please provide your name for the record.

1040
01:45:41,202 --> 01:45:41,902
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, sure.

1041
01:45:42,162 --> 01:45:43,383
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is John Dillon.

1042
01:45:43,483 --> 01:45:46,584
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 11 Oldwood Road.

1043
01:45:47,564 --> 01:45:58,429
[SPEAKER_27]: And I did also want to chime in on this feels like a small version of Apple presentation with Steve Jobs, you know, announcing something at the last minute.

1044
01:46:00,357 --> 01:46:08,579
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm here to talk about the shadows, because yesterday I was in Stearns Field, and it was a very clear day.

1045
01:46:08,599 --> 01:46:11,960
[SPEAKER_27]: I have sent photos to this.

1046
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:21,383
[SPEAKER_27]: I took a photo of the sun as it was getting ready to go down just over Hillside House.

1047
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:27,902
[SPEAKER_27]: of the dorms where this building would be in front of.

1048
01:46:28,642 --> 01:46:38,946
[SPEAKER_27]: And at 3.13, most of the field was still very much in sunlight, bathed in it.

1049
01:46:40,987 --> 01:46:45,229
[SPEAKER_27]: At 20 minutes later, the sun disappeared already.

1050
01:46:45,269 --> 01:46:49,711
[SPEAKER_27]: It was 3.43 PM, a half an hour before sunset.

1051
01:46:51,025 --> 01:46:59,768
[SPEAKER_27]: uh, which was four 13, it's going to be four 15 by the time of the, uh, winter solstice.

1052
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:11,392
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're talking about a two minute difference by that time, almost the entire field was in shade, uh, with no, it's not, it wasn't clouds.

1053
01:47:11,472 --> 01:47:14,953
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just that the sun just, you know, took a little dip over the house.

1054
01:47:15,713 --> 01:47:17,094
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, and, uh,

1055
01:47:18,072 --> 01:47:19,874
[SPEAKER_27]: That was at 3.43 p.m.

1056
01:47:20,094 --> 01:47:22,596
[SPEAKER_27]: I know it's two weeks before the solstice, roughly.

1057
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:29,062
[SPEAKER_27]: But when I look at the map of what Tufts had posted,

1058
01:47:33,338 --> 01:47:51,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's just say it took a much sunnier view of the available sunlight around there, because it has only a tiny sliver of the field that is in shadow, and that's at 4.15 p.m.

1059
01:47:51,934 --> 01:47:52,675
[SPEAKER_27]: on the solstice.

1060
01:47:53,295 --> 01:47:55,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you explain the discrepancy?

1061
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:05,285
[SPEAKER_27]: And can I, does it call into question that shadow say, how accurate is it?

1062
01:48:06,185 --> 01:48:06,565
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1063
01:48:06,585 --> 01:48:12,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1064
01:48:14,147 --> 01:48:18,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, the next speaker is Stephen Lucez.

1065
01:48:20,789 --> 01:48:21,429
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, hi, Steve.

1066
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:24,390
[SPEAKER_27]: Huh?

1067
01:48:27,271 --> 01:48:27,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Try that again.

1068
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:31,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

1069
01:48:34,473 --> 01:48:35,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

1070
01:48:35,754 --> 01:48:36,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.

1071
01:48:36,294 --> 01:48:39,016
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Stephen Lewis and I live at 44 Woodbine Road.

1072
01:48:39,056 --> 01:48:40,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time tonight.

1073
01:48:40,497 --> 01:48:43,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just five items, some concerns and some statements.

1074
01:48:43,819 --> 01:48:44,780
[SPEAKER_01]: First, concern traffic.

1075
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:57,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Laurel mentioned, the traffic impact study, just based at similar to what she said, just based on the Cummings building traffic, the ride share, pick up and drop off, as well as food delivery.

1076
01:48:58,348 --> 01:49:00,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the ride share, they just

1077
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:07,273
[SPEAKER_01]: stop in the middle of the road, drop people off, because the building is there and there's not a crosswalk.

1078
01:49:07,313 --> 01:49:09,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there will be crosswalks at this, but students just

1079
01:49:10,523 --> 01:49:27,590
[SPEAKER_01]: cross where the um, you know where the entrance and exits the building comes out i've seen uh, you know pedestrian to vehicle accidents there so that I just Like laurel mentioned I just have uh Big concerns on the traffic impact study, which is food delivery and rideshare pickup.

1080
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:33,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you may have a rideshare lane There's they're not going to be I don't know how tufts is going to enforce them

1081
01:49:34,072 --> 01:49:37,094
[SPEAKER_01]: to not just stop on Boston Ave and pick up students right outside.

1082
01:49:37,155 --> 01:49:39,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know how that is going to be managed.

1083
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:41,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not managed at the Cummings building currently.

1084
01:49:42,338 --> 01:49:43,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a free-for-all over there.

1085
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:47,903
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, there'll be a restaurant, at least proposed.

1086
01:49:47,923 --> 01:49:54,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I've yet to see a good restaurant that doesn't generate some vehicular traffic, even if it's just for food pickup to external customers.

1087
01:49:54,267 --> 01:49:56,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind, again, that ride share dropping off.

1088
01:49:59,603 --> 01:50:16,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, kind of another statement on traffic you know Tufts mentioned this being this project being a corridor to Boston Ave, and that just sound whether it's people traffic crossing the street quite a bit or again more vehicular traffic I just further concerns there on on that intersection being busier.

1089
01:50:18,622 --> 01:50:27,675
[SPEAKER_01]: The canyon effect was mentioned on the Mystic Ave project, and again, like Laurel mentioned, you've got the power station, you've got the large parking garage, and now you're going to have this massive building.

1090
01:50:27,695 --> 01:50:33,323
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like that canyon effect is going to be something real, and it's just going to extend further down.

1091
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:35,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth item.

1092
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:39,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basis for this project is a shortfall of on-campus housing for students.

1093
01:50:40,363 --> 01:50:41,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, this isn't an accident.

1094
01:50:41,924 --> 01:50:45,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Tufts over the past two decades has just continued to increase enrollment.

1095
01:50:46,387 --> 01:50:48,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been some intention there.

1096
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:50,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what, maybe I've missed it.

1097
01:50:50,911 --> 01:50:54,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard guidance from Tufts on like what future enrollment is going to look like.

1098
01:50:55,034 --> 01:51:01,680
[SPEAKER_01]: In 10 years, if they just continue to increase enrollment, we're going to be in the same boat here and not really solved the problem.

1099
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:24,888
[SPEAKER_01]: uh fifth and last point uh the moving of the power lines being contingent upon the approval of the mbta and then being able to put up more trees sounds like a lot of red tape i'm just wondering how that impacts this project timeline will it move forward regardless if that doesn't get approved what happens will there just be more trees are we going to wait for mbta approval for this project to culminate to finalize plans

1100
01:51:26,089 --> 01:51:37,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And then actually, I said lastly, I have one more thing was a comment made at the end of the presentation by Pat Gallagher about looking to address the on-campus housing in one big project.

1101
01:51:37,777 --> 01:51:42,080
[SPEAKER_01]: This timeline is so rushed, that's an interesting question, but I don't think we'll know that.

1102
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:48,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an interesting question if other small projects sprinkled throughout campus would be more beneficial.

1103
01:51:49,145 --> 01:51:51,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that, it's interesting.

1104
01:51:54,268 --> 01:52:04,491
[SPEAKER_01]: the alternative to a 10 story building seems to be, that seems to be pretty attractive to have much smaller units sprinkled throughout campus than this one big thing shoved in a residential area.

1105
01:52:05,231 --> 01:52:05,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.

1106
01:52:06,071 --> 01:52:06,591
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have.

1107
01:52:08,012 --> 01:52:08,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1108
01:52:10,152 --> 01:52:13,253
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Scott Saitake.

1109
01:52:13,273 --> 01:52:18,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, I'm Scott Saitake, 131.

1110
01:52:21,603 --> 01:52:26,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll be in the shadow in the afternoons in the wintertime.

1111
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:35,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be wonderful if it could be shorter, or put somewhere else.

1112
01:52:35,713 --> 01:52:40,857
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I would mention, if we do have to have it, you talked about community solar.

1113
01:52:41,357 --> 01:52:46,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing to consider would be community geo, where we wouldn't need to find solar space, but we could put

1114
01:52:48,532 --> 01:52:51,354
[SPEAKER_07]: geothermal under streets and share it with the houses around.

1115
01:52:51,394 --> 01:52:56,898
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a few pilot projects in the area, and Tufts seems like it'd be a good partner for doing that.

1116
01:52:57,058 --> 01:53:02,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a researchy thing, so it could involve the university in that way as well.

1117
01:53:03,363 --> 01:53:04,003
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for me.

1118
01:53:04,343 --> 01:53:04,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1119
01:53:06,205 --> 01:53:06,765
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1120
01:53:06,785 --> 01:53:10,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Speaker is Jeremy Martin.

1121
01:53:11,797 --> 01:53:12,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

1122
01:53:12,798 --> 01:53:14,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Martin, 65 Burgett Avenue.

1123
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:22,364
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to ask a question about the issues with MBTA and the power lines.

1124
01:53:22,605 --> 01:53:32,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the team considered burying the power lines along this stretch as a way of getting more significant canopy trees on both sides of the street and avoiding that

1125
01:53:34,573 --> 01:53:35,274
[SPEAKER_00]: that limitation.

1126
01:53:36,255 --> 01:53:38,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question to Tufts and its team.

1127
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,701
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your solution?

1128
01:53:40,742 --> 01:53:45,408
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your offering if you are denied those trees or the ability to plant those trees?

1129
01:53:45,468 --> 01:53:49,113
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you providing to the community to help mitigate that building?

1130
01:53:51,273 --> 01:53:58,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, I'll reiterate the comment that we've seen a lot of great things in the presentations or improvements.

1131
01:53:59,336 --> 01:54:03,837
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard a lot about how the team is working to address our comments.

1132
01:54:03,897 --> 01:54:07,638
[SPEAKER_00]: We have yet to see that in a formal plan, a formal site plan.

1133
01:54:08,339 --> 01:54:12,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And until that is submitted to this board, those statements

1134
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:18,104
[SPEAKER_00]: are just presentation and the project should not be approved based on a presentation.

1135
01:54:18,164 --> 01:54:20,806
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be approved based on an actual submittal.

1136
01:54:20,846 --> 01:54:25,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not vote to approve this until you get the real information in front of you.

1137
01:54:26,349 --> 01:54:26,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1138
01:54:31,493 --> 01:54:34,375
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Lisa DiMatteo.

1139
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:39,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

1140
01:54:39,923 --> 01:54:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa DiMatteo, 138 Brookings Street.

1141
01:54:44,634 --> 01:54:47,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of really good comments have been made this evening.

1142
01:54:50,473 --> 01:54:52,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make just a few points.

1143
01:54:52,975 --> 01:54:56,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to highlight the rushed nature of this.

1144
01:54:57,758 --> 01:55:03,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere earlier in the presentation, someone from the Tufts group mentioned this has been six months of conversations.

1145
01:55:04,642 --> 01:55:13,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could have been under a rock for part of this, but I only remember the first public presentation happening at the end of September.

1146
01:55:13,368 --> 01:55:16,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was way less than six months ago.

1147
01:55:19,558 --> 01:55:35,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I will underline what's been said about approving a plan based on a real plan versus the lots of ideas that are out there, but no real assurances.

1148
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:40,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess

1149
01:55:43,758 --> 01:55:49,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll share a little annoyance about Tufts presentation of kind of like this one-sided story.

1150
01:55:49,781 --> 01:56:09,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that this is good for Tufts and good for Tufts students, and I'm not against this project at all, but I feel like we're overlooked, literally overlooked.

1151
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:28,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what you do with 500K, because I don't know that you can put a price on the cost of somebody's mental health with decreased sunlight and increased evening light.

1152
01:56:31,763 --> 01:56:32,183
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1153
01:56:32,783 --> 01:56:33,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1154
01:56:35,586 --> 01:56:36,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1155
01:56:37,307 --> 01:56:40,870
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Janie Tallarita.

1156
01:56:47,347 --> 01:56:51,709
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi there, Janie Tallarita at 68 Charnwood Road.

1157
01:56:51,729 --> 01:56:56,692
[SPEAKER_28]: And I guess just a couple of quick things.

1158
01:56:57,392 --> 01:57:00,594
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree with pretty much everything everyone has said so far.

1159
01:57:01,334 --> 01:57:14,481
[SPEAKER_28]: Also curious, there was a comment that that reduced number of stories was looked at and it was determined that wouldn't make much of a difference in terms of shade and I

1160
01:57:16,656 --> 01:57:21,740
[SPEAKER_28]: feel like we should, there should be actual studies and we should have the chance to see them.

1161
01:57:23,302 --> 01:57:24,463
[SPEAKER_28]: We being the community.

1162
01:57:26,965 --> 01:57:38,235
[SPEAKER_28]: There was a comment made that having one big development in one area and two massive buildings

1163
01:57:39,983 --> 01:57:51,492
[SPEAKER_28]: was better than spreading out housing because spreading it out would impact a whole bunch more neighborhoods and let's just keep it all in one place where it only impacts one neighborhood.

1164
01:57:52,073 --> 01:58:00,059
[SPEAKER_28]: But that impact on our neighborhood is as massive as those buildings are.

1165
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,504
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think that spreading it out would be less impactful.

1166
01:58:10,097 --> 01:58:16,121
[SPEAKER_28]: on a wider range of neighborhoods.

1167
01:58:17,242 --> 01:58:38,176
[SPEAKER_28]: And just, you know, it's not insignificant also the acknowledgement that Boston Ave from college almost all the way to Winthrop Street

1168
01:58:38,902 --> 01:58:48,308
[SPEAKER_28]: will just be one big, gigantic, massive wall of building overshadowing us.

1169
01:58:49,468 --> 01:59:01,096
[SPEAKER_28]: And just to confirm Lori's statement that the bottom of the hill is where the Mystic River is, not where Boston Ave is.

1170
01:59:01,116 --> 01:59:03,757
[SPEAKER_28]: That is the middle of the hill.

1171
01:59:05,558 --> 01:59:07,079
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think that's it.

1172
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:08,040
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1173
01:59:09,890 --> 01:59:10,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1174
01:59:13,053 --> 01:59:15,736
[SPEAKER_23]: The next speaker is Kelly and Claire Rhodes.

1175
01:59:17,177 --> 01:59:18,138
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much.

1176
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:19,800
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Kelly Rhodes.

1177
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:26,787
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm representing myself and my wife Claire Rhodes at 83 Charnwood Road, corner of Charnwood and Brookings.

1178
01:59:27,988 --> 01:59:31,512
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the most affected abutters to this situation and project.

1179
01:59:32,551 --> 01:59:46,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I firstly just want to say thank you to our mayor for hearing our concerns, listening to our neighbors, and then taking action to communicate to us to be able to advocate on our behalf.

1180
01:59:46,503 --> 01:59:50,746
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that was huge advocacy on her part, and we really appreciate that.

1181
01:59:51,547 --> 02:00:00,392
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to thank Ari for speaking up on behalf of the neighbors that were saying they were having major issues with the shadows and addressing that as a board member.

1182
02:00:00,412 --> 02:00:11,459
[SPEAKER_23]: And Alicia for also representing us as neighbors and being very clear with what was being communicated from Tufts to the neighbors at large.

1183
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:19,504
[SPEAKER_23]: With that said, I want to reiterate what my neighbors have said in terms of

1184
02:00:20,879 --> 02:00:36,204
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to be devastating to us as homeowners close to this situation, especially the abutters who are going to be directly affected, not only mental health, but with all of the other concerns that they have raised that we have raised in letters, etc.

1185
02:00:37,544 --> 02:00:45,126
[SPEAKER_23]: I also wanted to say that I believe Rocco talked about that trees were going to help mitigate the shade somehow.

1186
02:00:45,146 --> 02:00:49,247
[SPEAKER_23]: I was confused how that worked, so I'd love to hear that as well.

1187
02:00:50,447 --> 02:01:00,010
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also wanted to know the environmental impact of what they're proposing with the trees to try to mitigate some of the light emissions, etc.

1188
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:04,111
[SPEAKER_23]: what environmental impact that will have with our neighborhood.

1189
02:01:05,071 --> 02:01:13,073
[SPEAKER_23]: And as many people have said, this is seemingly rushed, especially because we're not getting any of the data or reporting that Tufts is identifying.

1190
02:01:13,913 --> 02:01:18,354
[SPEAKER_23]: And the neighborhood would like to see all documents and full transparency.

1191
02:01:18,795 --> 02:01:19,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much.

1192
02:01:21,195 --> 02:01:21,615
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1193
02:01:21,635 --> 02:01:28,117
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, I don't, oh, sorry, Elizabeth Bale is the last speaker.

1194
02:01:39,171 --> 02:01:50,199
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just, I just cannot pass up any opportunity to voice my strong objections to this project.

1195
02:01:51,400 --> 02:02:01,588
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've submitted written comments that lay out a bunch of my concerns, but this just massive, completely out of scale set of buildings

1196
02:02:03,367 --> 02:02:13,184
[SPEAKER_16]: is going to be a permanent negative change to the hillside area for everyone.

1197
02:02:13,285 --> 02:02:16,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I should say I live at 34 Emery Street, which is

1198
02:02:17,272 --> 02:02:34,043
[SPEAKER_16]: a few blocks away but it's this is our neighborhood and I really feel for the people who are direct abutters but it's still going to affect a lot more people and those more people did not get any notice to participate in this full discussion.

1199
02:02:34,723 --> 02:02:37,305
[SPEAKER_16]: I only found out about it at the end of October.

1200
02:02:37,505 --> 02:02:39,987
[SPEAKER_16]: I missed the September meeting somehow but

1201
02:02:40,727 --> 02:02:59,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Still, the communication somehow has to be improved so that something of this scale in a neighborhood like Medford Hillside, which has a definite character, can be so that people can know about it and have a chance to have an effect.

1202
02:03:00,603 --> 02:03:09,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I, I really cannot believe the zoning being maximum 12 feet in this area that really should have been changed.

1203
02:03:09,888 --> 02:03:16,092
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope if anybody's listening in this meeting who can affect zoning, um, that's crazy.

1204
02:03:16,672 --> 02:03:22,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, in that particular location, I want to call attention for the board to the.

1205
02:03:22,776 --> 02:03:25,858
[SPEAKER_16]: The long eloquent letter that Lori creeper sent.

1206
02:03:26,718 --> 02:03:38,208
[SPEAKER_16]: a couple of days ago, and that John Elliott amplified in writing today, pointing out the issue of the photographs taken with a wide angle.

1207
02:03:38,888 --> 02:03:44,052
[SPEAKER_16]: And he made a mock-up of what this will actually potentially look like at nine stories.

1208
02:03:44,092 --> 02:03:45,574
[SPEAKER_16]: He didn't even do the 10.

1209
02:03:46,474 --> 02:03:52,679
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just, I would like to know where around here is a 10-story building?

1210
02:03:53,458 --> 02:03:58,080
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, how can that possibly be even contemplated around here?

1211
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:59,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't understand.

1212
02:03:59,421 --> 02:04:05,804
[SPEAKER_16]: I was here for the whole meeting, so I've heard all the discussion about the Mystic Avenue corridor.

1213
02:04:06,385 --> 02:04:19,591
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thought there was a lot more sensitivity there, which is a more industrial commercial area, about the canyon effect and stepping back buildings and stuff like that.

1214
02:04:20,031 --> 02:04:21,532
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't hear any of that here.

1215
02:04:21,552 --> 02:04:23,093
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why.

1216
02:04:25,966 --> 02:04:29,028
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess that's all I have to say.

1217
02:04:30,029 --> 02:04:32,311
[SPEAKER_16]: I would scream, but I don't want to hurt your ears.

1218
02:04:33,191 --> 02:04:34,192
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's it.

1219
02:04:40,596 --> 02:04:42,898
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1220
02:04:43,818 --> 02:04:46,840
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it seems that actually this is a new speaker.

1221
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:48,121
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Mike Krasinski.

1222
02:04:52,195 --> 02:04:54,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess my comment is more for the board here.

1223
02:04:54,597 --> 02:05:01,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I kind of get the feeling that the board doesn't feel like they have a lot of power in this, right?

1224
02:05:01,082 --> 02:05:04,745
[SPEAKER_11]: But you do have the ability to regulate size and bulk.

1225
02:05:04,825 --> 02:05:10,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's going to seem hard against Dover and against a big developer, a big real estate developer like Tufts and Capstone.

1226
02:05:11,851 --> 02:05:15,815
[SPEAKER_11]: But the opportunity is going to come soon to do the right thing.

1227
02:05:16,015 --> 02:05:19,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the things to remember is Tufts really hasn't addressed

1228
02:05:20,533 --> 02:05:25,417
[SPEAKER_11]: the issues that the neighbors raised, the issues that the city has raised tonight in this meeting.

1229
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:28,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing has really changed from the last meeting until tonight.

1230
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:31,402
[SPEAKER_11]: The $500,000 fund really doesn't matter.

1231
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:34,905
[SPEAKER_11]: The trees which aren't approved don't matter until they're approved.

1232
02:05:35,725 --> 02:05:38,608
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all a lot of smoke and mirrors.

1233
02:05:39,088 --> 02:05:46,254
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look back at the JCC and you can read the DBA decision there, it says that Tufts, essentially in that case,

1234
02:05:49,607 --> 02:05:55,010
[SPEAKER_11]: In the dissenting opinion, it says that the Tufts tried to do a bait and switch.

1235
02:05:55,410 --> 02:06:01,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what they're doing here isn't much better, right?

1236
02:06:01,214 --> 02:06:04,235
[SPEAKER_11]: They're telling you they're making changes, but they're not really changing much.

1237
02:06:05,156 --> 02:06:11,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's going to seem hard to make the right decision, but because you feel like maybe

1238
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:17,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Tufts will challenge and appeal if you try to impose the conditions.

1239
02:06:18,318 --> 02:06:22,520
[SPEAKER_11]: But you do have the power for bulk and height to impose those conditions.

1240
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:31,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is at the border of a zone between an apartment two and a general residence in a single family zone.

1241
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:34,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there is opportunity there to regulate this building.

1242
02:06:34,845 --> 02:06:41,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's going to seem hard to do, and it's going to seem like a difficult decision to make, but I hope the board does the right thing.

1243
02:06:41,328 --> 02:06:42,229
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, that's my only comment.

1244
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:55,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, and I just wanted to reiterate that yes, the board does have control over regulating the bulk and the height.

1245
02:06:55,275 --> 02:07:02,860
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I want to reiterate that any restrictions imposed must be considered reasonable and not excessively burdensome.

1246
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:09,104
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a balance that the board must consider when it comes to the proponent's proposal.

1247
02:07:10,505 --> 02:07:14,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there any other public comments?

1248
02:07:16,667 --> 02:07:17,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Warren Krieger.

1249
02:07:19,608 --> 02:07:23,029
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, Lori Krieger has raised her hand again.

1250
02:07:23,049 --> 02:07:33,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Since there are no other... Yes, please allow Ms.

1251
02:07:33,992 --> 02:07:34,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Krieger to speak.

1252
02:07:35,393 --> 02:07:35,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1253
02:07:37,033 --> 02:07:37,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1254
02:07:37,874 --> 02:07:42,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to wonder, an excessive burden to whom?

1255
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:47,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, that's what I mean for Tufts.

1256
02:07:47,982 --> 02:07:51,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you mean for Tufts, but the burden for us is beyond excessive.

1257
02:07:52,065 --> 02:07:54,527
[SPEAKER_21]: And I definitely understand, and I do empathize with that.

1258
02:07:54,587 --> 02:08:03,454
[SPEAKER_21]: But I meant for the 40A, for the Dover Amendment Regulation, 40A statute is what I meant.

1259
02:08:04,074 --> 02:08:08,717
[SPEAKER_21]: The proponent cannot be severely burdened in what that regulation is.

1260
02:08:11,079 --> 02:08:11,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you can do.

1261
02:08:13,641 --> 02:08:14,522
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand, Ms.

1262
02:08:14,542 --> 02:08:14,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Krieger.

1263
02:08:24,409 --> 02:08:27,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing no other comments, I'm going to close the public comment period.

1264
02:08:32,472 --> 02:08:37,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I am just making sure that there's no other public comments.

1265
02:08:38,895 --> 02:08:52,220
[SPEAKER_21]: And I will open it up to the board to ask any additional questions or provide requests for more information that may be necessary for us to deliberate.

1266
02:08:53,062 --> 02:08:58,145
[SPEAKER_21]: or for us to better understand, to help out the public and their understanding.

1267
02:08:58,985 --> 02:09:10,050
[SPEAKER_21]: But I also want to make sure that we understand that there's only two questions before the board that we can handle, and that's, does this use qualify as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

1268
02:09:10,611 --> 02:09:14,353
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have already been given legal counsel that, yes, it does.

1269
02:09:15,313 --> 02:09:19,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Two, what are reasonable regulations that should apply to this project?

1270
02:09:19,676 --> 02:09:24,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Should the requested relief from parking requirements and relevant dimensional standards be granted?

1271
02:09:25,241 --> 02:09:32,026
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, what are the conditions of approval that are needed to mitigate any adverse impacts of waiver requirements?

1272
02:09:33,509 --> 02:09:36,474
[SPEAKER_21]: It is of my opinion that we don't have enough information.

1273
02:09:36,955 --> 02:09:41,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, although this will, uh, we don't have that information from the parking, uh, engineer.

1274
02:09:42,665 --> 02:09:46,833
[SPEAKER_21]: And neither do we have the information that Mr. Gallagher has, um, expressed.

1275
02:09:49,418 --> 02:10:05,989
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, before I go ahead to make a motion to continue to a date certain, again, I want to bring it back to the board, but also I was negligent in not allowing Tufts to answer questions that have arisen this evening.

1276
02:10:06,690 --> 02:10:17,897
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to, before the board makes any other comments, Mr. DeRico, if you want to provide a summary to any of the questions that you have heard this evening or concerns.

1277
02:10:18,515 --> 02:10:19,260
[SPEAKER_17]: No, he doesn't.

1278
02:10:21,215 --> 02:10:22,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1279
02:10:23,056 --> 02:10:25,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak again.

1280
02:10:25,877 --> 02:10:34,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to emphasize that we do hear the concerns of the neighbors, and they are very important to us.

1281
02:10:34,941 --> 02:10:43,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have made significant changes to the project to try to make it a better project for everyone involved.

1282
02:10:44,426 --> 02:10:48,728
[SPEAKER_06]: This is truly a generational opportunity for us to provide more on-campus housing.

1283
02:10:50,269 --> 02:11:03,806
[SPEAKER_06]: But we want to do it in a responsible way and we will and we've tried to add all the features that folks have mentioned that community meetings department head meetings community development board meetings into the project and those are some of the slides.

1284
02:11:04,567 --> 02:11:05,508
[SPEAKER_06]: we showed you today.

1285
02:11:05,968 --> 02:11:09,030
[SPEAKER_06]: We are happy to provide you with additional information.

1286
02:11:09,070 --> 02:11:10,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll continue to do that.

1287
02:11:11,871 --> 02:11:15,754
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a drop-off pickup zone that we showed in our plans.

1288
02:11:16,294 --> 02:11:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are cognizant of that issue, and we did include that in our plans.

1289
02:11:20,536 --> 02:11:23,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to be clear about that.

1290
02:11:24,519 --> 02:11:30,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there are other areas of the city that lack it, and that's why we included it in our project.

1291
02:11:34,084 --> 02:11:38,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are going to have another community meeting.

1292
02:11:39,988 --> 02:11:45,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be before the next board meeting on December 18th.

1293
02:11:46,573 --> 02:11:53,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will do everything we can to get the word out about that as quickly as possible, but also with the understanding that we need to put the meeting together quickly.

1294
02:11:55,078 --> 02:12:02,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be happy to share additional information at that meeting and everything that we've talked about we've submitted to this board.

1295
02:12:03,282 --> 02:12:11,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything additional that's asked of us tonight we'll submit more of it so it's we're being as clear and open and transparent as we can.

1296
02:12:11,205 --> 02:12:18,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to give Pat Gallagher, the opportunity to talk as well in case I missed anything.

1297
02:12:21,939 --> 02:12:35,063
[SPEAKER_30]: And Madam Chair, if I may, you had asked a specific question, whether we could talk about or respond to a concern about light and light spillage.

1298
02:12:36,564 --> 02:12:43,526
[SPEAKER_30]: There were also several questions on the drop-off pickup.

1299
02:12:44,886 --> 02:12:51,208
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the Elkis-Manfredi team can probably address all of those questions, and so we'll actually

1300
02:12:51,872 --> 02:12:56,895
[SPEAKER_30]: Turn to them and then I think after afterwards, we can also quickly respond.

1301
02:12:57,616 --> 02:13:01,518
[SPEAKER_30]: To a couple of the questions that were more traffic.

1302
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:11,525
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, specific and so maybe after the team, if I could ask Jeff to respond and I don't want there to be.

1303
02:13:12,797 --> 02:13:17,239
[SPEAKER_30]: a misperception about the traffic study that we had provided.

1304
02:13:17,519 --> 02:13:26,844
[SPEAKER_30]: We didn't present on the entire study tonight, just in the interest of time, but the entire study has been submitted and is available to the board.

1305
02:13:28,045 --> 02:13:33,528
[SPEAKER_30]: And we did discuss that with Director Blake and happy to take the board's questions.

1306
02:13:33,688 --> 02:13:34,048
[SPEAKER_30]: But I think

1307
02:13:34,903 --> 02:13:44,990
[SPEAKER_30]: If we could start with the team on the design pieces that I mentioned, and then Jeff Bandini on the traffic concerns.

1308
02:13:46,932 --> 02:13:51,495
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you're responding for the traffic, the concern more so is the drop off and pick up.

1309
02:13:51,575 --> 02:13:53,556
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know I understand that you said it was on.

1310
02:13:55,516 --> 02:13:56,117
[SPEAKER_21]: the submissions.

1311
02:13:56,417 --> 02:14:07,354
[SPEAKER_21]: However, if you can sort of explain to the public what even if you want to put it on the screen again and just like just explain it for the public and what your visions are for that.

1312
02:14:27,829 --> 02:14:28,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops, sorry.

1313
02:14:30,370 --> 02:14:43,294
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see on this plan, I should have pointed it out when we were on this plan, there are two dedicated parking spaces here between the two buildings that are dedicated for pickup and drop off.

1314
02:14:49,236 --> 02:14:51,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, did you say two spaces?

1315
02:14:51,637 --> 02:14:51,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

1316
02:14:55,244 --> 02:15:01,509
[SPEAKER_24]: Personally, as a city planner, as we've been reviewing other apartment buildings, I would recommend more than that.

1317
02:15:03,911 --> 02:15:13,859
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll certainly look at that.

1318
02:15:14,119 --> 02:15:21,705
[SPEAKER_30]: David, are we able to speak to, I think there have been some questions around how the light is going to be

1319
02:15:23,763 --> 02:15:27,464
[SPEAKER_30]: kind of viewed through the windows and what the light fixtures are going to be like.

1320
02:15:27,764 --> 02:15:36,147
[SPEAKER_30]: I know that was something that we spoke about a bit at the last meeting, but are you able just to quickly give an overview of that?

1321
02:15:36,567 --> 02:15:52,893
[SPEAKER_30]: I think especially compared with some of the existing buildings that are going to be, have been up on the Hill for much longer and just talking about the quality of the windows and the types of lighting in the new buildings as compared with what's there today.

1322
02:15:53,815 --> 02:15:58,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually, I was going to say exactly what you just said, Patrick.

1323
02:15:59,038 --> 02:16:08,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the best thing is to look at existing residential buildings that face the neighborhood today.

1324
02:16:08,264 --> 02:16:13,968
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a little farther back, but maybe they're 100 feet further away.

1325
02:16:14,509 --> 02:16:19,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And the light spill that's coming out of those residential buildings, and factor in the

1326
02:16:21,453 --> 02:16:35,660
[SPEAKER_10]: to your point, the improvement in light fixtures, the quality of light, and then I know a number of people have discounted the value of blinds and shades, but look at that with and without blinds and shades.

1327
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:44,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And also look at it relative to, you all know this is designed to be a passive house building.

1328
02:16:45,545 --> 02:16:50,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Passive house requirements, very strict control over

1329
02:16:51,210 --> 02:17:08,465
[SPEAKER_10]: the ratio of opaque to solid, meaning window to brick in this case, the amount of window in that facade or any facade of the building as measured today, as the building is drawn as you've seen in our renderings, is about 30%.

1330
02:17:10,427 --> 02:17:17,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can compare it to existing buildings that you're looking at every day or every evening, what those percentages are.

1331
02:17:23,753 --> 02:17:26,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll add one more thing since nobody jumped in there.

1332
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:47,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was mentioned that we have done studies on shadows, the difference in shadow impact between a 10-story building and an eight-story building, and we can be prepared at this next meeting to show you what that delta is.

1333
02:17:51,244 --> 02:17:57,187
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'll just add to that that I think Rocco had mentioned just a moment ago.

1334
02:17:57,207 --> 02:18:18,817
[SPEAKER_30]: Our goal is to have a follow-up meeting between this and the next hearing to share some more detail and just have an ability to talk in more depth and show the shadow studies in a way that this setting is not necessarily the easiest venue to do all of that in.

1335
02:18:20,417 --> 02:18:24,759
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's not to say that we're not going to show those same studies and provide them to the board.

1336
02:18:26,339 --> 02:18:42,445
[SPEAKER_30]: But the goal, I think, is to be able to show our analysis on why are we saying that we think the impact of going down in height is going to be maybe less than you might think otherwise.

1337
02:18:42,765 --> 02:18:48,367
[SPEAKER_30]: And so that's part of the goal of this meeting, that we're going to be organizing

1338
02:18:49,217 --> 02:18:50,778
[SPEAKER_30]: you know, the next week or so.

1339
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:55,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1340
02:18:55,940 --> 02:19:02,704
[SPEAKER_21]: And the only other question I have, and I'm not sure if you want the city to speak to this, is about the burying of the lines.

1341
02:19:03,424 --> 02:19:11,428
[SPEAKER_21]: And then additionally, what is the alternative if you can't get the permission from the MBTA?

1342
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:17,571
[SPEAKER_30]: So Madam Chair, on the first question, I'll

1343
02:19:18,136 --> 02:19:21,479
[SPEAKER_30]: take a quick stab, but I'll look at Jonathan to correct me.

1344
02:19:22,419 --> 02:19:37,511
[SPEAKER_30]: But in the meeting earlier this morning with Director Wartella, I think we all expressed that we would love to be able to bury the lines, but that National Grid is not amenable to that.

1345
02:19:38,092 --> 02:19:45,238
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I think that's why we're looking at our next best option of moving those lines across to the north side of Boston Avenue.

1346
02:19:46,518 --> 02:20:07,084
[SPEAKER_30]: And as to the other question on how do we move forward if the MBTA does not give us permission to do that, I think I would first note that we've had a lot of positive conversations with the MBTA, with their consultant, Graystone, with National Grid, and with the city.

1347
02:20:07,445 --> 02:20:15,027
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think, you know, with Director Hunt and her staff, with Director Blake, I think there is

1348
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:28,336
[SPEAKER_30]: A universal desire to improve the streetscape and we appreciate that the city has made it really clear that whatever the city can do to assist with that, including working with the MBTA.

1349
02:20:28,476 --> 02:20:31,739
[SPEAKER_30]: So, I think we're encouraged by the progress that we've made with them.

1350
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:33,861
[SPEAKER_30]: That being said, we are.

1351
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:46,349
[SPEAKER_30]: And we'll have updated plans to submit to the board in advance of the next meeting that we would consider to be treated as the control plans that we would ask the board to vote on.

1352
02:20:47,490 --> 02:20:53,795
[SPEAKER_30]: And those plans will show alternatives if, for example, the MBTA says you can't put polls right here.

1353
02:20:56,657 --> 02:21:01,081
[SPEAKER_30]: But again, it is our hope and goal to be able to do that.

1354
02:21:02,850 --> 02:21:05,072
[SPEAKER_30]: we're encouraged by the conversations that we've had.

1355
02:21:05,092 --> 02:21:16,680
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's a priority of the development team for many reasons, including the improvement that it'll affect on Boston Avenue.

1356
02:21:18,542 --> 02:21:20,283
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Mr. Gallagher.

1357
02:21:24,126 --> 02:21:29,870
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will bring it back to the board to see if there's any additional questions or requests.

1358
02:21:35,478 --> 02:21:38,885
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that earlier I stopped atom bearings.

1359
02:21:40,869 --> 02:21:47,811
[SPEAKER_15]: I had just a specific question just to try to understand the height of the 10 stories.

1360
02:21:47,831 --> 02:22:05,757
[SPEAKER_15]: I think in the last week's presentation, there was, I think it's slide 14, a comparison of the, you know, it's 107 feet, and the buildings drawn were like Hallowell Hall, I think, and North Hill Road.

1361
02:22:08,218 --> 02:22:18,592
[SPEAKER_15]: But just so that I can also just better understand looking at the dormitory right now behind it, that's a six-story dorm.

1362
02:22:21,932 --> 02:22:26,536
[SPEAKER_15]: It would just be helpful to understand the height relative to the immediate building behind it.

1363
02:22:26,556 --> 02:22:30,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, sort of from that baseline of the street.

1364
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:35,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, just to know, because I think the way that you presented it was.

1365
02:22:36,184 --> 02:22:38,226
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, 10 stories really isn't 10 stories.

1366
02:22:38,246 --> 02:22:41,189
[SPEAKER_15]: The 1st floor is kind of dug into the hill.

1367
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:42,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Um.

1368
02:22:43,991 --> 02:22:47,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, you know, it's hard to do the math on the exact building heights, but I just wanted to.

1369
02:22:49,496 --> 02:22:56,562
[SPEAKER_15]: to look at the concrete number of the height of the building behind the proposed building and then the proposed building height.

1370
02:23:00,085 --> 02:23:12,915
[SPEAKER_10]: We can certainly provide a section, let's see, running north-south from Boston Ave through the proposed buildings, through the hill, and through the existing buildings.

1371
02:23:13,015 --> 02:23:15,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see them relative to each other.

1372
02:23:15,757 --> 02:23:15,877
[SPEAKER_28]: OK.

1373
02:23:16,058 --> 02:23:16,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, thanks.

1374
02:23:21,863 --> 02:23:22,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Ben Lavallee.

1375
02:23:26,907 --> 02:23:27,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1376
02:23:27,708 --> 02:23:34,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the comments on the power lines and the options there and the discussion with the MBTA.

1377
02:23:35,194 --> 02:23:39,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's been a number of questions about the topic of power infrastructure.

1378
02:23:40,738 --> 02:23:50,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it may not be something that we can require, I think the public would benefit from some documentation, some comprehensive documentation on

1379
02:23:51,684 --> 02:23:57,068
[SPEAKER_02]: the electrical power needs of these buildings, how those will be supplied?

1380
02:23:57,528 --> 02:24:00,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the grid infrastructure in the neighborhood support it?

1381
02:24:00,611 --> 02:24:12,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there additional, I just think some general artifacts related to the power requirements of these large structures that will be fully electric, if I remember correctly.

1382
02:24:13,861 --> 02:24:15,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be useful information.

1383
02:24:20,025 --> 02:24:20,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1384
02:24:22,993 --> 02:24:23,913
[SPEAKER_21]: And Ari Fishman.

1385
02:24:25,894 --> 02:24:29,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and thank you to the applicants for your answers.

1386
02:24:30,115 --> 02:24:42,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to kind of share my thinking after those presentations and share some concrete questions that I would love to hear answers to, probably not today, but at our next meeting.

1387
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:47,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be certainly voting to continue to further discussion.

1388
02:24:48,285 --> 02:25:01,719
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I look forward to hearing the mayor's response to your response and urge you to continue working closely with City Hall and taking very seriously the strong advocacy of the community.

1389
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:10,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I'm interested in this half a million dollar proposal.

1390
02:25:10,344 --> 02:25:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like that is brand new to the city.

1391
02:25:12,926 --> 02:25:28,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see a lot more detail, and I'd also like to note as those discussions progress that I think if there is going to be a very concrete negative harm to neighbors in terms of losing sunlight, I like this idea about reduced

1392
02:25:29,912 --> 02:25:40,662
[SPEAKER_03]: solar costs and did hear that it was specifically only people who were eligible for solar, I think it would be worth considering everyone who's shadowed by the project.

1393
02:25:40,702 --> 02:25:51,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it shouldn't just be that opportunity cost, and I think it could also be worth talking about subsidizing other utilities that are impacted by the loss of sunlight, like heating.

1394
02:25:53,354 --> 02:26:04,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I am interested as a community member said in seeing the data and estimates of the alternative impact of an 8 to 9 floor building.

1395
02:26:04,641 --> 02:26:05,862
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could please share that and.

1396
02:26:08,964 --> 02:26:11,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Also curious about this drop-off area.

1397
02:26:12,227 --> 02:26:24,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Alicia that two spots is not enough given the size of the development and the prodigious interests of undergraduates in takeout and delivery.

1398
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:32,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also am curious if Tufts can commit to strict enforcement of parking violations for

1399
02:26:33,427 --> 02:26:38,910
[SPEAKER_03]: example, with TUPD, if they can somehow cooperate with parking enforcement.

1400
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:42,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's possible, but seems worth discussing.

1401
02:26:43,592 --> 02:26:48,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did kind of my final thing is that I would love to hear a

1402
02:26:49,895 --> 02:26:53,097
[SPEAKER_03]: a continued significant discussion of the nighttime light emissions.

1403
02:26:53,497 --> 02:26:57,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've kind of talked a lot about the daytime and evening shadow.

1404
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there should be a technical solution in terms of external window coverings that would block sunlight going out but would allow it to come in.

1405
02:27:07,946 --> 02:27:09,987
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like a thing that exists.

1406
02:27:10,807 --> 02:27:12,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not an expert in that field, but

1407
02:27:14,143 --> 02:27:15,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to love this project.

1408
02:27:15,863 --> 02:27:17,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge proponent of density.

1409
02:27:17,824 --> 02:27:19,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's near transit.

1410
02:27:19,244 --> 02:27:21,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think students should live on campus.

1411
02:27:21,465 --> 02:27:23,746
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot about this that I really want to support.

1412
02:27:24,306 --> 02:27:35,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'd love to see more from the applicant is working with the community to make this a win-win and to kind of take very seriously these concrete harms to immediate neighbors.

1413
02:27:36,709 --> 02:27:40,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to finding a mutually agreeable solution.

1414
02:27:45,978 --> 02:27:50,542
[SPEAKER_30]: Madam Chair, would it make sense for me to respond to a couple of those or would you prefer.

1415
02:27:51,122 --> 02:27:52,904
[SPEAKER_30]: No, please.

1416
02:27:53,444 --> 02:27:54,865
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1417
02:27:55,526 --> 02:27:58,208
[SPEAKER_30]: So I thank you very much for your comments we really appreciate them.

1418
02:27:59,109 --> 02:28:09,677
[SPEAKER_30]: And just want to quickly say because I know we're losing hours in the day on the proposals that we've heard talked about tonight both

1419
02:28:09,959 --> 02:28:16,381
[SPEAKER_30]: between the $500,000 fund that Tufts is committing to, as well as the discussion over community solar.

1420
02:28:17,201 --> 02:28:22,623
[SPEAKER_30]: I think I just want to recognize that a lot of this is, we're having these conversations in real time.

1421
02:28:23,603 --> 02:28:29,705
[SPEAKER_30]: As soon as we can provide more information on our thought process, we're going to share that with the neighbors.

1422
02:28:30,865 --> 02:28:35,527
[SPEAKER_30]: We hear the concerns that that's not a fund that the city could administer.

1423
02:28:36,367 --> 02:28:39,028
[SPEAKER_30]: But I certainly think that we can get to a point where

1424
02:28:39,831 --> 02:28:43,712
[SPEAKER_30]: everyone in the neighborhood will be comfortable that that is a real commitment.

1425
02:28:44,593 --> 02:28:50,314
[SPEAKER_30]: And we are standing here in a public setting telling you that we are firmly committed to that.

1426
02:28:51,575 --> 02:28:59,417
[SPEAKER_30]: I think on the question of community solar, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up that it's something we need to look at.

1427
02:29:00,637 --> 02:29:05,399
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it is a very intriguing idea.

1428
02:29:06,488 --> 02:29:07,629
[SPEAKER_30]: with a lot of complexities.

1429
02:29:08,569 --> 02:29:19,014
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I just want to put that in the category of things that we will absolutely look at and take back to our team and talk through if that's something that would be feasible.

1430
02:29:19,954 --> 02:29:29,918
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just wanted to respond to those couple of items, but thank you for your comments and we'll certainly take all of them back and follow up with the board and the community on them.

1431
02:29:32,719 --> 02:29:33,620
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1432
02:29:35,147 --> 02:29:36,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman.

1433
02:29:37,908 --> 02:29:38,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

1434
02:29:40,069 --> 02:29:44,992
[SPEAKER_20]: First, just want to say I echo the comments of Council Member Fishman.

1435
02:29:46,072 --> 02:29:55,637
[SPEAKER_20]: It was outstanding, and I think they did a really good job of kind of summarizing the community feedback and sticking within the bounds of what we can do as a community development board.

1436
02:29:55,657 --> 02:30:01,620
[SPEAKER_20]: So huge thanks, and I saw some applause from other attendees, so just want to pass that to

1437
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:18,326
[SPEAKER_20]: This might be a silly request, but in future iterations of the shadow study, would it be possible to use colors that are not so close to each other for the net new shadow and the existing shadow?

1438
02:30:19,107 --> 02:30:21,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now it's like a periwinkle and a gray.

1439
02:30:22,748 --> 02:30:38,981
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, you know, don't have the youngest eyes, but I'd like to think that, you know, there could be a better way to kind of show that difference, since shadow does seem to be such a challenging topic for this building.

1440
02:30:39,421 --> 02:30:46,326
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it would do a lot in terms of communication transparency to differentiate between those two colors.

1441
02:30:46,427 --> 02:30:50,250
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I know that a lot of those colors are industry standards, but

1442
02:30:50,970 --> 02:30:53,111
[SPEAKER_20]: just make it really clear, like, hey, what's there already?

1443
02:30:53,492 --> 02:30:54,092
[SPEAKER_20]: What's new?

1444
02:30:54,952 --> 02:30:56,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to help improve communication there.

1445
02:30:57,934 --> 02:30:58,595
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's all I have.

1446
02:30:59,335 --> 02:30:59,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Cher.

1447
02:31:00,776 --> 02:31:01,677
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

1448
02:31:04,418 --> 02:31:06,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens, did you have another comment?

1449
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:12,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I had another comment.

1450
02:31:12,103 --> 02:31:18,687
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing that would be helpful for me, and I think maybe for transparency with the community and the process,

1451
02:31:21,803 --> 02:31:43,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a way for us to get a deeper dive from our legal counsel for the city on the Dover amendment, the type of restrictions that can be placed on something like height?

1452
02:31:44,051 --> 02:31:46,732
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems like the biggest concern is around height.

1453
02:31:47,772 --> 02:31:50,213
[SPEAKER_15]: The second biggest concern is around traffic.

1454
02:31:51,944 --> 02:31:56,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Not necessarily parking, and it would just be helpful to understand.

1455
02:31:59,526 --> 02:32:23,020
[SPEAKER_15]: uh ways in which the medford in the past has applied restrictions to to dover projects and what the justification requirements are for that you know and so the biggest justification requirement it feels like in this case is you know the impact to the surrounding houses and community with with regard to shadow and light

1456
02:32:24,566 --> 02:32:36,910
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just don't know, from a precedent perspective, the extent to which we as a committee really have the flexibility to kind of put those restrictions with that justification.

1457
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:50,474
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't want to mis-assume that our hands are tied or mis-assume that we kind of have to go down a specific path without

1458
02:32:51,630 --> 02:32:55,754
[SPEAKER_15]: getting a little bit of that work done from our side.

1459
02:32:56,134 --> 02:33:06,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it would benefit the community to sort of be able to see that and just understand a little bit better just the purview that we have with the Dover project.

1460
02:33:12,184 --> 02:33:12,905
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Adam.

1461
02:33:13,025 --> 02:33:20,070
[SPEAKER_21]: And actually that sums up my actual comments because it was asked earlier exactly who would the burden be on.

1462
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:38,803
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things I wanted to make sure that we understood with the city before we did anything, before we made any decisions, even after continuing is exactly what conditions can we, are we allowed to do and what is considered reasonable regulations to mitigate these very real concerns that we're hearing from the public.

1463
02:33:39,223 --> 02:33:51,861
[SPEAKER_21]: at the same time or reaching sort of a win-win for both across the board, for the actual proponent, the community, as well as just everyone involved.

1464
02:33:52,001 --> 02:33:53,323
[SPEAKER_21]: So what does that mean?

1465
02:33:53,363 --> 02:33:54,064
[SPEAKER_21]: What does it look like?

1466
02:33:54,745 --> 02:33:58,567
[SPEAKER_21]: What are our legal parameters for enforcing this mitigation?

1467
02:33:58,587 --> 02:33:59,788
[SPEAKER_21]: What does that mitigation look like?

1468
02:34:00,548 --> 02:34:04,770
[SPEAKER_21]: How much does TUF have to do and how much are we allowed to enforce them?

1469
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:10,333
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's where I leave my comments for this evening.

1470
02:34:11,253 --> 02:34:18,017
[SPEAKER_21]: I really don't have any other questions until I pretty much, the city is able to answer that question for us and help us fill that gap.

1471
02:34:19,310 --> 02:34:29,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I don't want to be unreasonable to Tufts University, but at the same time, we don't want to be unreasonable in our responsibility to the public either.

1472
02:34:32,336 --> 02:34:41,660
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, if there's no other questions or if there's no other requests, and if we can leave on that and just ask for a motion to a date certain, which would be 12-18.

1473
02:34:44,254 --> 02:34:47,176
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll make the motion to continue without prejudice to, we said 1218.

1474
02:34:47,297 --> 02:34:50,399
[SPEAKER_20]: To 1218, we would be continuing the public hearing for 401 Boston Avenue to 1218.

1475
02:34:50,439 --> 02:34:50,499
[SPEAKER_21]: 2430 PM.

1476
02:34:50,519 --> 02:34:51,460

02:35:55,182 --> 02:35:55,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1491
02:35:59,444 --> 02:36:00,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

1492
02:36:14,832 --> 02:36:16,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Our next item, it's 914.

1493
02:36:16,393 --> 02:36:18,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

1494
02:36:20,455 --> 02:36:26,118
[SPEAKER_21]: So at this point, I'm not sure if the city has a zoning update for the next amendment coming up.

1495
02:36:26,178 --> 02:36:30,781
[SPEAKER_21]: And if it's something that is brief, or if it should be put off to the next meeting.

1496
02:36:30,801 --> 02:36:35,303
[SPEAKER_21]: I will let Danielle and Director Hunt make that decision.

1497
02:36:38,905 --> 02:36:41,446
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should go to the minutes, probably.

1498
02:36:41,926 --> 02:36:47,727
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to, the city council has referred the green zone, the green score to you.

1499
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:52,109
[SPEAKER_24]: We haven't actually scheduled it, so it won't be the December 18th meeting.

1500
02:36:52,149 --> 02:36:55,589
[SPEAKER_24]: We thought that was too full, so it'll be the first meeting in January.

1501
02:36:56,610 --> 02:37:01,891
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a big public meeting, well, there's the next city council meeting on Salem Street is next.

1502
02:37:03,892 --> 02:37:05,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Wait, I wanted to say,

1503
02:37:06,357 --> 02:37:07,638
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I have the wrong calendar up there.

1504
02:37:07,738 --> 02:37:10,539
[SPEAKER_24]: It's next Wednesday night, whatever that date is.

1505
02:37:10,719 --> 02:37:11,460
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that the 11th?

1506
02:37:12,941 --> 02:37:28,369
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I just wanted you to know that we're out there advertising that to the public to encourage people to come look, come hear about and talk about the Salem Street zoning on the 11th at the city council subcommittee meeting, in case anybody's interested.

1507
02:37:33,038 --> 02:37:33,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

02:37:34,399 --> 02:37:47,587

[SPEAKER_15]: You know, she might have dropped because of the.

1520
02:38:14,852 --> 02:38:26,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Thinking that the meeting ended, I think we may need to reach out to board members and let them know that to follow the agenda, because I think this is the 2nd week that we've lost her.

1521
02:38:26,497 --> 02:38:27,117
