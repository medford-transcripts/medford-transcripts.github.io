59
00:26:54,192 --> 00:27:21,614
Um. Oh, I got an idea for you. Nevermind. OK, it's not going to involve Chris Redfield. Actually, yes. I heart ear infections with the five gift that your band.

60
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:50,639
draw me and Chris Redfield like as a team side by side. We both got like blinkies and stuff and we're facing Albert Wesker. We're going to fight them together like a like it's a boss fight starting off. No joke like actually no joke. I think if you could get that going that that could be that could be generational. I'll be real with you. That could be that could be generational right there.

61
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:59,667
Don't y'all agree with that chat? Y'all mess with that? Throw Arthur Morgan in there too. Me, Chris Redfield, Arthur Morgan.

62
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:30,818
And we're all side by side, we got guns, we're looking out in front of us, Albert Wesker's out in front of us. And then when Albert Wesker's out in front of us, have like a little speech bubble coming out of him and having to say seven minutes, seven minutes is all I can spare to play with you. And then the speech bubble for me is gonna be like, uh-oh, Chris Redfield's speech bubble is gonna be, we got this guys. And then Arthur Morgan is just gonna be smoking a cigarette.

63
00:28:41,585 --> 00:29:02,240

Thank you Tanner no Tanner does no Tanner does not deserve to be in there. No Tanner Tanner does not deserve to be in there stop

64
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:27,957
Y'all are, I'm actually for real this time when I talk about Tanner, I'm dead serious. Y'all are legitimately giving Tanner too much aura than he literally deserves. He is not even in the same universe of aura as Chris Redfield or Arthur Morgan. I'm so serious. Like I'm actually dead serious. He's not even same, like same, like legitimately same universe as those two guys. Okay.

65
00:29:34,319 --> 00:30:03,462
Ted, unfortunately, unfortunately, Ted doesn't have nowhere near the same universe of aura as Chris Redfield and Arthur Morgan either. I would go as far as to say that Arthur Morgan has the most aura out of any character that was ever written, ever. I'm for real. Like, I'm so serious.

66
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:31,559
I'm serious. Arthur Morgan is the best character, fictional character. Arthur Morgan skid mark with the five gifted, thank you. Hey, Arthur Morgan, you know, I'm not rage baiting, I'm actually dead serious. Arthur Morgan is the best fictional character ever created. On my mama. On my mama.

And that's no rage bait, that's no nothing. There is no other fictional character that has, he's the greatest fictional character ever. I cried. I cried. I'm talking snotting. I'm talking one of them cries, you're like. I did one of those.

68
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:29,592
not only went at the very end, but like for the last entire hour of the game, I was sniveling. Like I was legitimately sniveling. Once I realized what was about to happen, I was actually like sniveling for real, like sniveling, no joke. And I'm gonna keep it a stack with y'all. I wasn't gonna tell y'all this, but like,

69
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:58,330
Like four months ago, I replayed Red Dead 2 again, and I cried again. I cried. On my mama. I didn't cry when he turned to the sunset. I cried when he was telling Sadie and who was the other girl that was with Sadie?

70
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:28,283
Who's the other girl that was with Sadie that he put him on the horse and said, get up out of here? Abigail, crying, crying. On my mom, I was crying and this was, no, it was Tilly. It was Tilly, yes. When he loaded up Tilly and Abigail onto the horse and said, get up out of here, I was crying.

71
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:56,313

72
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:23,633

I'll consider watch these for four hours. I'm not going more cupcakes The kitchen aid bowl lift stand mixer w goat action for real No joke though

81
00:36:54,588 --> 00:37:23,343
Six most disturbing things caught on home security camera footage You know what I mean in 2015 a couple in San Jose, California were the victims of a home invasion Intruders were never identified the police recommended the to invest in some home security cameras to protect against future break-ins and So they got money though. Look at this little outdoor area right here. I

82
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:48,453
They set up a total of six different cameras around their house. Then, on May 8th of that same year, these cameras would capture a second break-in. Two men wearing black clothes climb a fence into the backyard, where they're shown finding an unlocked sliding glass door. They walk inside and immediately go into the kitchen.

83
00:37:48,925 --> 00:38:10,458
One of them is seen disconnecting a phone setting on the counter. They proceed to search the kitchen, opening different cabinets and drawers. From this, they find kitchen knives, which they take with them to arm themselves. Why? Imagine getting stabbed by your own kitchen knife. Camera, their next scene running upstairs, kitchen knives in hand.

84
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:41,474
Imagine stabbing somebody in general, you know what I mean? Like, how you gonna stab somebody? As they're searching the rooms upstairs, one of the men comes across a locked door. It was the door to the master bedroom. He puts his ear to the door, and hears a baby crying. Inside the room was a family friend named Rosie and the two homeowners' child. Rosie was babysitting for them when the intruders entered the home.

85
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:52,561
Hearing the crying, the man alerted his partner that people were inside. Instead of getting spooked and leaving, the men go up to the door and aggressively start kicking it.

86
00:38:55,379 --> 00:39:20,455
They hit it with such force that they managed to kick a hole in it. They then thrust knives through the hole. Rosie took the couple's child and retreated to the bathroom, locking that door as well. She screamed out that she called the police. This would work. The men finally started running away before they could fully break into the bedroom. Police reviewed all of the footage, but were never able to identify the men.

87
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:50,543
Their true motives remain unknown. Oh, we can tell what their true... Any man... It's hard to believe they were only trying to rob the place, seeing that they disconnected the phones and felt the need to arm themselves with kitchen knives. They also didn't immediately leave upon finding people inside. Instead, they tried breaking down a door to get to them. This is the footage from a home security camera in Vacaville, California. Doc's license plate ain't blurred out.

88
00:39:51,826 --> 00:40:18,961
It was April when this footage was taken, and during that time of year, it's common to see a lot of activity in the form of kids walking home from school each afternoon. On this day, at some point, a girl with a backpack on is shown walking into frame. She was walking home from school like everyone else. However, she had been being followed for several blocks by a man in a dark-colored Pontiac. She noticed this, and so she used a large truck parked on the side of the road to hide.

89
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:52,407
Bro. Bro. She abruptly stops walking while she's out of view of the Pontiac. The driver stops, expecting her to come back into view. When she doesn't, he stalls there for a while before slowly driving off. The girl is left standing there, unsure of what to do next.

90
00:40:52,829 --> 00:41:19,728
What you doing eventually she sees the car coming back and decides to stay put behind the truck Yo w survival this dude came back around Yo w survival skills over I

91
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:53,292
The Pontiac drives by, and then reverses to try and talk to the girl, but she continually repositions herself out of view. Finally, he drives off again and the girl makes a run for it. After receiving multiple tips about the driver and his car, the police started an investigation. A 24-year-old man was identified as the driver. He was interviewed, but not arrested. He technically hadn't committed any crime, and therefore police couldn't really do anything.

92
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:35,767
run that by me again 24 year old man was identified as the driver he was interviewed but not arrested he technically hadn't committed any crime and therefore police couldn't really do anything whether or not the man was actually planning something that day is unknown

93
00:42:38,180 --> 00:43:02,311
First, we offer overnight boarding. Your pet will stay overnight in your sitter's home and not only be treated like part of the family, but treated like a king or queen honey. I am absolutely- WHAT?! He technically didn't- he- wha- Let me- let me make the laws, buddy.

94
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:17,836
Not only would have this dude been arrested, he'd have been de-headed in public. That is unbelievable!

95
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:48,582
13 years old and one three years old. On the night of February 20th, 2022, the three of them went shopping together. Their home security camera would show them returning home. They're seen walking inside and closing the door behind them. Shortly after, a man walks into frame from around their parked truck. The very first thing he does is try to open the door. Okay, so yeah, you need to start shooting. If the first thing they do is try to open the door and not knock, you gotta start blasting.

96
00:43:49,291 --> 00:44:13,878
Who are you talking to? You leave no question. Why? You shoot first, ask questions later if somebody's trying to get in your house. Why?

97
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:35,933
After knocking a few times, the man walks away. However, they later found out through a neighbor's camera that for the next five minutes he walks around the house on his phone.

98
00:44:38,785 --> 00:45:07,034
Allie further reviewed the videos and found that it appears the man had been following them in his car all the way from the store. Two seconds after they park in the driveway, his car drives a bit further and parks a few houses down. After a few more seconds, he gets out and starts walking towards them. Thankfully, they were able to get everything inside and the door locked before he got there. Allie ended by writing, I don't know what this man's intentions were, but I don't think it was to rob us.

99
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:24,517
I do believe that this was random and that we are not specifically targeted, but that he saw an opportunity when he saw a woman and two girls go into a house alone. Man... Police were alerted, and they did search the area, but the man in the video was never found. Lord have mercy!

100
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:58,891
In October of 2016, a family in Florida noticed multiple things missing from inside their home. The night before, everything was there, but when they woke up, stuff was missing. How you be caught on camera? Plain as day. Plain as day, and you wasn't never found, bruh. To figure out where it went, they reviewed their home security cameras. At 1.30 in the morning, this is what the cameras captured.

101
00:46:01,287 --> 00:46:15,226
Dude, there's literally somebody sleeping on the couch, bruh. There's somebody sleeping on the couch in the bottom right, too!

102
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:46,242
There's no way you're brave enough to do this with people literally sleeping less than a foot away from you. There's no way.

103
00:46:50,461 --> 00:47:18,743
A man walks around the house while three children are sleeping on couches only feet away from him. He walks around them looking for valuables and hands what he finds to another man standing just outside, this one armed. Dude. The family immediately called the police upon seeing the footage. Police opened an investigation, but never found the two men in the video. Police believe that had anyone in the house woken up during the break-in, they likely would have been shot. Man.

104
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:29,577
We can just assume that they was never identified every time we see one of these chats. No joke. Every time we see one of these, we might as well just assume they got away with it.

105
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:57,083
A woman in Hudson, Wisconsin opened her blinds one morning and noticed something in the snow outside her window. She went outside and realized she was looking at footprints. The prints walked right up to her bedroom window and then back the way they came. Worried someone deliberately looked inside her window, the woman set up a security camera outside pointed towards her window. A few nights later, the camera recorded the man who made the footprints coming back.

106
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:17,603
Dude, this reminds me of the Hinterkeifeck. Y'all ever heard of the Hinterkeifeck action? Where that dude found them footsteps in the snow leading to his house, and he didn't see no footsteps leading away. Next day, whole family was killed. With an axe. Or something. Not an axe, but like a big ol' like, tool.

107
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:45,346
Y'all ever heard of the Viscula, uh, the Viscula axe murder house too? Somebody just walked in their house, killed all of them with an axe, dead. Bro, how you gonna walk in somebody's house, kill everybody in there with an axe?

108
00:48:58,627 --> 00:49:18,607
Oh man, there's an axe right here. I'm gonna walk in his house and kill everybody. Like, what you mean, bruh? What you mean you about to walk in here and kill his whole family with an axe?

109
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:49,420
Like, it makes you wonder if somebody would've ran into somebody like that. Be like, hey bro, what you about to do? Oh, I'm about to walk in here and kill this whole family with this axe I just found. And if they was like, bro, you shouldn't do that. You think they'd be like, well, you know what? You right, I ain't gonna do it. Play the video. I cut the video off!

110
00:49:50,939 --> 00:50:17,753
The man is shown clearly peering in the window. Police were alerted and shown the video. After doing some digging, they were able to trace the vehicle leaving the scene to a man named Robert Cessna. Oh my goodness, they caught one. Reputable executive for the company 3M. It must not be that reputable because I ain't never heard of it. LinkedIn profile, Robert Cessna is a global key account vice president at 3M. He ain't nothing. He shows similarities to the man in the video.

111
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:46,846
Robert was contacted by police, but denied it was him. Police then interviewed several neighborhood witnesses, and along with other evidence were able to confirm that he was lying. He was the man in the video. Robert Cessna was ultimately charged with felony stalking, and later fired from his executive position. So this dude gets felony stalking, and the guy that rode by that little girl multiple times while she was walking home from school technically didn't commit a crime? Like, what you talking about, bruh?

112
00:50:50,322 --> 00:51:12,665
Oh, 3M, oh yeah, you right, nevermind. Yeah, I have heard of them, my fault. Yeah, my bad. Yeah, you right. Man, that's an old lady with a scooter! And you go, man!

113
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:42,517
A total of five had occurred, and so she finally took the advice of- THERE AIN'T NO WAY YOU TAKING THE STUFF OFF HER SCOOTER ON TOP OF IT! OH BUDDY! OH- On home security cameras. Caught on the cameras, a sixth break-in occurs around one in the morning. A man is seen silently walking around while Margaret is sleeping in her living room. HER NAME'S MARGARET DUDE! THERE AIN'T NO WAY YOU STEALING SOMETHING FROM OLD LADY MARGARET! YOU DISGUSTING!

114
00:51:43,462 --> 00:52:08,774
Oh, you, you, you, you disgusting. Did he have a moment of clarity? Are we witnessing a moment of clarity?

115
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:42,119
No, no moment of clarity, he's still looking for stuff.

116
00:52:46,017 --> 00:53:09,254
NOW YOU'RE COOKED! Unreal. OH, MARGARET'S ABOUT THAT BUSINESS, BUDDY!

117
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:43,882
Don't hurt him, Miss Margaret! Hey, you lucky you got out of there before Margaret got ahold of you. Hey, hey, she would have tied him up to the railroad tracks and ran him over with that scooter about 50 times. He's lucky Margaret didn't get ahold of him. She was about that business for real, bruh.

118
00:53:45,232 --> 00:54:00,622
No joke. Did we see that one? Yeah, that's the one we seen.

119
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:37,139
But I eat healthy, but I want to every time we watch one of these bro. It makes me lose faith in humanity, bro. I'm for real. Like I'm for real, bro. Like why? That's why you go somewhere, bro. You got to keep, if you can't carry a blicky on you, carry some pepper spray, carry a knife. You got to have something on you, bro. No joke.

120
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:52,883
keep something, you gotta keep something. If you can't do no blicky action, you keep your big old jug of pepper spray or like a little, or like not a little knife, like a knife for real. Cause you never know who's going to try to run up on you, bro.

121
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:24,710
A jug of pepper spray? Yeah, they make them big ones. The big ones with the squirt cap on it. Yeah, like that bear spray action. Somebody run up on you. Hey, how you doing? Sprayed. I ain't taking no chances.

122
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:51,203
In this first video, an avid cave explorer on YouTube known by the channel name, Exploring Abandoned Mines and Unusual Places, is exploring an abandoned mine for the simple purpose of reviewing a flashlight. During the video, you can hear as the explorer goes into detail about the flashlight, and demonstrates its use in the mine he's exploring.

123
00:55:51,676 --> 00:56:17,782
He's doing a hashtag ad for a flashlight in the middle of a cave. However, while talking to the camera about both the mine and the flashlight he's reviewing, the explorer hears what he first thinks to be wind blowing through the mine. Though many believe the audio sounds like a very disturbing whispering or talking sound. Huh? Okay, this is a review and demonstration of the Thrunite TN-12 handheld flashlight that you see here.

124
00:56:21,832 --> 00:56:50,654
Okay, that's the portal to the wall deck mine. I'm inside. The wind has kind of died down a little bit, and it's not raining, so I managed to stay dry. I think you've went far enough. The flashlight looks like it's doing a pretty good job. Of course, I'm inside this little alcove, kind of. But anyway, you come down this little incline path. You come down this little path? Are you talking about me? I know you ain't talking about me. What do you mean, you? No. And big boulders here you have to climb over, and then the tunnel's right behind me, this way.

125
00:56:51,717 --> 00:57:19,088
So let's check it out. Let's get in here. Like I said, this light has five levels. I believe it's on medium right now which is level three, so this would be high, and this would be turbo.

126
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:49,666
Yep, that's going in the cart. Medium seems to be the best one. Do you see the amount of light that little flashlight gives off? Not too bright, not too dim. And then, you can see how big these timbers are. Those are, that's about,

127
00:57:50,459 --> 00:58:20,294
Almost a foot in diameter. It's going down! I'm yelling timber! You better move! You better dance! Let's make a night! You won't remember! I'll be the one! Do you hear that? My fault. My bad. My bad. He said timber. I had to. All of this rock. You can see right here where some of these boards are bending. I did just hear some whisper action. Y'all heard that? Do you hear that?

128
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:51,445
Sounds like a. All fake video. What is that wind? Can you hear that on the camera? The moment it went through the direction of paranormal, it's fake. Now, if you see the butt naked dude run around the corner with a club, I'd be like, oh, whoa, stopped.

129
00:58:57,217 --> 00:59:09,518
Well, I don't know what that is. That doesn't sound like wind, but that's crazy. Don't know if that's a bird or I don't know what that is. It almost sounds like snakes. Wait, wait, is he for real?

130
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:44,213
Wow. I've heard some weird stuff in mines, but that is definitely creepy. I don't know what that is. There's no way. So let's get out of here and head back out to the portal. That was weird.

131
00:59:45,209 --> 01:00:14,116
These next two videos come from the same exploring YouTube channel shown earlier. This time, however, the explorer visits an abandoned, supposedly haunted mine in Nevada known as Horton Mine. The first time he visits, he claims to feel negative energy coming from the mine, and what he witnesses goes to support his claim. However, with the popularity of the first visit, the YouTuber decides to visit the abandoned mine a second time, this time hearing something very disturbing.

132
01:00:14,116 --> 01:00:43,428
Here are both of those visits to the mine. Okay, here's a lower adit at the Victorine Mine. I believe this was an older mine that once they dug the upper tunnels, this got incorporated into the same claim or whatever. Okay, we can go in here and just take a quick look. I don't think I'm going to explore this particular mine. There's a little bit too much water in here, and I know this mine is really old, but... You're old! Don't talk about that mine like that!

133
01:00:43,580 --> 01:01:10,327
I do see other footprints here in the mud, but I just don't think it's wise to go in here when there's water. I'll try to avoid this if I can. Yes, this looks pretty sketchy. I'll go a few feet further in and check it out, but I think I'm going to pass on this one. This is one of the creepiest mine tunnels I've ever been in just because of how dilapidated it is and all these chains hanging down.

134
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:39,807
from the overhead, and there's a shot looking down the tunnel. Bro! Here's a shot looking back towards the entrance. I'm a little bit further in. And uh... Bro said this is about as far as I'm gonna go. Next shot, he's 200 feet deep looking at the exit. Looking down the tunnel here. Move that chain!

135
01:01:41,798 --> 01:02:00,040
I don't know why that one chain is swinging back there. I don't know if you can see that in the video or not. This mine definitely has a very spooky vibe to it, so I'm going to head back out and check out the other stuff that's here. This is just too wet and too muddy.

136
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:21,353
You saw. Honestly, something is making the change. I like how, I like how what the, I like how the thing stopping him from going farther in here is that it's too wet and too muddy. Like, okay, bud. Swing. So time to get the hell out of here. Yo, Lid with the five and Taco with the five. Thank you.

137
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:50,851
Okay, the Horton Mine still has some water coming out of it. You can see it kind of pooled up here outside. Here's the portal. Have you ever heard of steel water? Yeah, that's them brain-eating amoebas! So, let's go check this out and see if it's any drier than it was a year ago when I was last here. Okay, I'm further in than I was a year ago.

138
01:02:51,745 --> 01:03:20,534
And that's how far I've come. Why? Okay, here's a final parting shot of the Horton Tunnel. And there's the ore pass with all the cascading water. What the heck is that?

139
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:45,087
That's a radio or something. I don't know what that was, but there was a sudden blast of cold air. See, now you're just lying. I'm getting out of here.

140
01:03:48,361 --> 01:04:16,137
I don't like liars. A man named Clem Schultz and his wife lived in Fairdale. Oh my goodness. I know this video. This is that dude. Yo, this is that dude that didn't refuse to go to the basement. He said, forget it. I'm going to sit here and film this tornado killing me. Y'all remember this video? This dude literally filmed this tornado until it got, he didn't even go to the base. He filmed it all the way until it got to his house.

141

during one of the most destructive tornadoes in the history of Fairdale. During the storm, Clem took a video from the top floor of his house as he saw the giant tornado get closer. Clem thought the tornado would miss his house, when in fact it was coming directly towards him, all while he was still recording. Unfortunately, Clem's wife would pass away because of the intensity of the tornado.

While Clem would receive a terrible spine injury, the phone he took the video on was later discovered in the rubble of his home, and this is what the video was able to capture. Like, at some point, it's gotta register, like, oh! Like, wait a minute. I'm in danger here. Maybe I need to go to the basement.

143
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:27,603
And I feel like I would be at that point right here. As soon as that light goes out, go. He's still filming.

144
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:51,802
This next video He didn't die either

01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:21,569
shows a man exploring the Paris catacombs, which is a place very well known for causing people to get lost. They are essentially the most complex series of tunnels in the world, definitely not somewhere you'd want to find yourself exploring without experience. The video shows this man getting lost and going into a full panic run as he doesn't know where to go to get out.

01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:51,893
Like some dude actually went into the Paris catacombs by himself, ran around, got lost, went crazy, and was never seen again. He was never found, but his camera later was, with no trace of the guy. It's very bizarre. These arrows point in a direction. So how'd they get the video? You just blow in from stupid town, bud? Somebody else went in later and found it.

01:06:56,045 --> 01:07:19,366
Occasionally also he stops to photograph he fell into a black hole or something. It was unrecoverable You're banned gracie with the five which means that he's very very deep inside the catacombs So basically he's filming what he's seeing very deep inside the catacombs Other than the point of view shots or pictures

catacombs for centuries. Man it's so scary. So it is possible with these paintings that we may be able to be traced back to Tinderary to some extent. After about four minutes we hear his breathing get louder and louder as though something was scaring him. He's frightened, he's frightened. Occasionally he stops perhaps to try to decide which way to run among all the many different corridors.

149
01:07:48,998 --> 01:08:17,112
He's running faster and faster and faster, deeper and deeper into the catacombs. And all of a sudden... He drops the camera. You hear his breathing get louder and louder, as though something was scaring him. He's frightened. He's frightened. He stops, perhaps, to try to decide which way to run among all the many different corridors. He's running faster and faster and faster, deeper and deeper into the catacombs. This is fake, but it's literally not fake, though. Like, it's not. And all of a sudden...

01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:48,837
Gone. You gotta think, it's completely dark down there. You literally can't see nothing. He ain't got no flashlight, no nothing. Dropped his camera, gone. R.I.P., bruh. Either he's dead or he's still down there living in them catacombs somewhere, like, surviving off, like, like cockroaches and stuff. I don't know.
