He's in a Discord call with multiple people and for some reason you're just interjecting me and everything.

If you think I'm joining a discord call with multiple people, more than one or two people in it, you have absolutely lost your mind.

119
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:25,678
And if you do not know me by now, knowing that I'm not going to do that, I don't know what you do know.

Okay, he wants some money or something?

130
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,722

131
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:01,982

134
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:21,025
Chat, if you see a big, large group of people with one of my friends in it, you are not obligated to be like, hey, go join that.

135
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,066
Hello?

136
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:31,288
Hello?

137
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:35,629

138
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:35,929

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,561
Hello?

141
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:56,802
Life may throw some bland cucumbers your way, but I know you can turn them into delicious pickles.

142
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:58,263
Again.

143
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:04,284
Your hard work and perseverance will pay off in the long run.

144
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:05,884
Again.

145
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:11,805
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

146
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,670
In a pickle, just remember you're not alone.

147
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:19,331
Again.

148
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,652
Life's journey is like a pickle.

149
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:27,036
That surprising crunch ultimately makes it more enjoyable.

150
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:30,918
Extroverted activities I'll never understand.

151
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,118
And you know what's crazy?

152
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:36,161
Me being on stream doing this every day may look like I'm an extrovert, cuh.

153
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:45,163
If you, if I was ever went to a club or something, I'd be the dude sitting in the corner, drinking some water, talking to nobody.

154
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:56,125
Yeah, I can get on here and talk to y'all every night, but if I was on a stage and all of y'all was physically in front of me, you think I'd be able to get up on that stage every night?

155
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:57,605
Absolutely not.

156
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:06,907
Now, if I know you and I got like one or two people I know real good, oh yeah, I'll do, you know, I'll do whatever.

157
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:16,592
But no No, you know chat, hey Hey, i'm not no extrovert Trust me.

158
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,072
Do y'all think i'm an extrovert?

159
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,693
Do I give extrovert vibes chat?

160
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:21,113

161
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:34,698

Yo, if one of the mods got the video, I'll straight up, I'll straight up look at that.

171
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:18,822
No joke.

172
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:21,123
There was some cheek action going.

173
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:24,125
Yo, Furious with the five, appreciate you.

174
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:28,989

177
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:37,656
You're uncomfortable in here?

178
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:38,457
What did I do?

179
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:43,199
So you mean to tell me I made you uncomfortable?

180
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,060
Big Mac with the five, thank you.

181
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,641
Wait, is that it?

182
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,102
Wait, wait a minute.

183
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,884
Day five of crocheting is- This it, this it, this it, this it, this it, this it.

184
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,666

Jumbo cake.

00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,207
That thing bigger than me for real.

190
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,588
So this is the moment everyone's been waiting for.

191
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,849
The reveal.

192
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:14,930

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,311

00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:56,975

206
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:57,535

00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,067
buns!

208
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:02,530
For those wondering about the materials that I used, I'll get into it right now.

209
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,113
So, out of the two skeins of the Hobie Honey Bunny Big Yarn that I got for this project, I used 551 grams.

210
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:10,375
SHE DID GOOD ON IT THOUGH, IT LOOKED PROFESSIONAL!

211
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:14,217
I used 181 grams of Premier Parfait XL.

212
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:18,240
For the hair, beard, and eyebrows, I used 563 grams of Bernat Brown.

213
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,302
I don't know how people even do something like this, bruh.

214
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,384
There's not an artistic bone in my body, bro.

215
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:26,065
No joke.

216
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:32,794
There is legitimately, dude, I can't, dude, the what's it called?

217
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:43,140
The masterpiece shirt with my face on it that I drew for the t-shirt, that was actually, no joke, my best work I could ever attempt to do.

218
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,243
And even then, I used like the circle drawing tool.

219
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:50,544
Yep.

220
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:53,183
Yep.

221
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:54,624
Blanket extra.

222
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:57,425
And lastly, out of the two skeins of sweet snuggles, I used 460.

223
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,486
Yeah, that, that, that emote.

224
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,446
Yeah, that emote, look.

225
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:03,547
Chapa, thank you.

226
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,448
This emote right here.

227
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,449
If you don't know, chat, I drew this right here.

228
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,150
And I'm here to tell you one thing.

229
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,031
This emote right here, I drew it.

230
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:18,493
And it is literally, I'm not kidding you at all.

231
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,181
It is the best.

232
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,482
I like how somebody just said cap like this is a masterpiece or something.

233
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,423
You saying cap is literally a compliment to me.

234
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:37,965
I'm not going to lie, but no chat this right here as horrible as it is and it's bad.

235
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:39,705
Okay.

236
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,906
It's bad, but I'm here to tell you one thing.

237
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:48,427
This is the best that I have to offer the world.

238
00:14:49,717 --> 00:15:13,914
As far as artistic vision goes As long as i've been on this earth i've been on this earth for 19 years Right i've been on this earth for 19 years And this is the best thing i've ever i've ever created On everything i love I don't know what y'all saying cap about but yeah That's that's me.

239
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,215
That's the best of me right there

240
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,021
For the stuffing, I used about 420 grams of polyfill.

241
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:23,882
The total weight of the jumbo queso is 634 pounds?

242
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,843
I'm kidding, it's actually 4.8 pounds.

243
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:34,025
Which actually, like, believe it or not- THAT THING'S FOUR POUNDS, YOU KNOW HOW- YOU KNOW HOW HEAVY FOUR POUNDS IS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

244
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:38,807
Yo, Amina with the five, thank you Amina with the five, appreciate you.

245
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:59,908

246
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,364
I think I'm retiring from streaming.

247
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,466
Because what you mean is she creating you?

248
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:21,907
I'm done.

249
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:22,987
You know what?

250
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,308
This is my retirement announcement.

251
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,328
I can't do this no more.

252
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,790
There is legitimately no way you just asked, is she creating you?

253
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:32,652
Would you?

254
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:37,794
See, I ain't even trying to be rude, right?

255
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:38,515
Like, look here.

256
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,796
I'm not even trying to be rude right now.

257
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:41,336
I'm not.

258
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:45,626
But what on this planet Earth, who else would this be right here?

259
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:56,642
Certified Gooberologist with the five gifted, that might be, that is a top 10 name in the history of this channel.

260
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,602
Yo, wait, that is a top 10 name in the history of this channel.

261
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:08,764
Certified Gooberologist.

262
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:13,607
There is no way somebody just now made that name.

263
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:14,828
Just now.

264
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:16,789

00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:27,254
and 13 inches thick, which is measured belly to the booty.

267
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:30,636
If you want to make your very own queso plushie, it doesn't have to be jumbo.

268
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,878
My pattern has been officially released today.

00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:33,779

Wait, what did you actually just say?

298
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:52,017

299
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,421

348
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,488

00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:06,961
Except you drive a taxi, but the thing is some of these patreon games that they got on here Straight up.

357
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:09,222
I'm talking like actual naked action.

358
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:14,864
I've seen before So I gotta you know what I'm downloading it.

359
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:17,966
Oh my goodness, that's a virus.

360
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:18,026

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,801

If you could see my screen right now, do you understand?

365
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:56,497
I would be in a pickle.

366
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:01,948
Wait, why is it not downloading?

367
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,670

00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:35,873
In a world of cucumbers, be the extraordinary pickle.

Absolutely.

379
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:38,475

380
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:39,276
You want another one?

381

Here you go.

382
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:45,701
It's never too late to set another goal or to dream a new dream.

383
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:47,822
Absolutely.

384
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:48,683

00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:49,664
Right here.

386
00:24:50,064 --> 00:24:54,588

Chat, where would we be?

388
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:01,354
Yo, happy birthday, Tyler.

389
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:05,276
Chat, where would we be without the pickle action?

390
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:08,917
Would y'all be in a worse place without the pickle?

391
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:10,938
We'd be in a pickle.

392
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:13,139
Dr. Twerk with the five, thank you.

393
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,980

Hold on!

396

00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:26,404
Chat, that is on the menu.

398
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:29,165

399
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:31,846
Okay, good.

00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:33,507

401
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:35,429
Yes.

402
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:42,756
We have a puppet combo game on the menu tonight.

403
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:46,440
Type one if you're crunk about that.

404
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,461
I'm kinda crunk.

405
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:50,504
We got some puppet combo action.

406
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,166
Yo, I'm not sure leviathan.

407
00:25:55,186 --> 00:26:18,177

408
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:25,363
Who just said tournament to a jalapeno popper?

409
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:28,805
I was about to say something insane.

410
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:35,409
That's horrible.

411
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:41,593
Hold on.

412
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:42,033
Let me think.

413
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:43,134
I'm thinking for a second.

414
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:45,615
No, I can't.

415
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:45,916
I can't.

416
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:46,356
I'm not saying it.

417
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,116
No, that's bad.

418
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:51,159
I have had one too many horrible things said this past week.

419
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:51,719
I can't do it.

420
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:55,053
Um.

421
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,300
Oh, I got an idea for you.

422
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:06,142
Nevermind.

423
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,066
OK, it's not going to involve Chris Redfield.

424
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:16,510
Actually, yes.

425
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:21,434
I heart ear infections with the five gift that your band.

426
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:26,850
draw me and Chris Redfield like as a team side by side.

427
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,972
We both got like blinkies and stuff and we're facing Albert Wesker.

428
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:33,873
We're going to fight them together like a like it's a boss fight starting off.

429
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,675
No joke like actually no joke.

430
00:27:39,855 --> 00:27:45,177
I think if you could get that going that that could be that could be generational.

431
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:48,398
I'll be real with you.

432
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:50,419
That could be that could be generational right there.

433
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:52,886
Don't y'all agree with that chat?

434
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:53,609
Y'all mess with that?

435
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:56,497
Throw Arthur Morgan in there too.

436
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,426
Me, Chris Redfield, Arthur Morgan.

437
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:08,486
And we're all side by side, we got guns, we're looking out in front of us, Albert Wesker's out in front of us.

438
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:18,271
And then when Albert Wesker's out in front of us, have like a little speech bubble coming out of him and having to say seven minutes, seven minutes is all I can spare to play with you.

439
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:26,156
And then the speech bubble for me is gonna be like, uh-oh, Chris Redfield's speech bubble is gonna be, we got this guys.

440
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:30,578
And then Arthur Morgan is just gonna be smoking a cigarette.

441
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:49,911
Desi dude, see I can come up with stuff, but I just can't like I could think of something like that But I just can't put it into action, right?

442
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,993
Yo, little monster with the five gifted.

443
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:58,097
Thank you Tanner no Tanner does no Tanner does not deserve to be in there.

444
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:01,740
No Tanner Tanner does not deserve to be in there stop

445
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:06,981
Y'all are, I'm actually for real this time when I talk about Tanner, I'm dead serious.

446
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:11,745
Y'all are legitimately giving Tanner too much aura than he literally deserves.

447
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:16,248
He is not even in the same universe of aura as Chris Redfield or Arthur Morgan.

448
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,229
I'm so serious.

449
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,590
Like I'm actually dead serious.

450
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:25,075
He's not even same, like same, like legitimately same universe as those two guys.

451
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:27,797
Okay.

452
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:47,209
Ted, unfortunately, unfortunately, Ted doesn't have nowhere near the same universe of aura as Chris Redfield and Arthur Morgan either.

453
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:55,896
I would go as far as to say that Arthur Morgan has the most aura out of any character that was ever written, ever.

454
00:29:59,119 --> 00:29:59,719
I'm for real.

455
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,322
Like, I'm so serious.

456
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:06,678
I'm serious.

457
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,003
Arthur Morgan is the best character, fictional character.

458
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:14,705
Arthur Morgan skid mark with the five gifted, thank you.

459
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:21,130
Hey, Arthur Morgan, you know, I'm not rage baiting, I'm actually dead serious.

460
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:26,915
Arthur Morgan is the best fictional character ever created.

461
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:28,316
On my mama.

462
00:30:30,818 --> 00:30:31,319
On my mama.

463
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:34,722
And that's no rage bait, that's no nothing.

464
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:40,264
There is no other fictional character that has, he's the greatest fictional character ever.

465
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:43,565
I cried.

466
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:46,906
I cried.

467
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,708
I'm talking snotting.

468
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,409
I'm talking one of them cries, you're like.

469
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,110
I did one of those.

470
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:09,923
not only went at the very end, but like for the last entire hour of the game, I was sniveling.

471
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:12,064
Like I was legitimately sniveling.

472
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:20,588
Once I realized what was about to happen, I was actually like sniveling for real, like sniveling, no joke.

473
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,251
And I'm gonna keep it a stack with y'all.

474
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:29,172
I wasn't gonna tell y'all this, but like,

475
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:35,354
Like four months ago, I replayed Red Dead 2 again, and I cried again.

476
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:38,476
I cried.

477
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:45,061
On my mama.

478
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:49,183
I didn't cry when he turned to the sunset.

479
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:58,050
I cried when he was telling Sadie and who was the other girl that was with Sadie?

480
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:08,238
Who's the other girl that was with Sadie that he put him on the horse and said, get up out of here?

481
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:14,160
Abigail, crying, crying.

482
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,941
On my mom, I was crying and this was, no, it was Tilly.

483
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,881
It was Tilly, yes.

484
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:27,903
When he loaded up Tilly and Abigail onto the horse and said, get up out of here, I was crying.

485
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,171
on everything I love.

486
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:30,451
I will.

487
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:34,234
I'm talking not just like I was shedding like some tear action.

488
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:37,697
What y'all talking about?

489
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,118
GC what?

490
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:43,262
What are y'all saying?

491
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:49,807
Hold on, let me call him.

492
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:50,648
He just texted me.

493
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:56,173
He just texted me.

494
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:05,004
See, when the man himself texts me, that's when I'm like, okay, you know what I mean?

495
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,825
But you got a whole bunch of people in chat talking about, go over.

496
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:08,766
I ain't listening.

497
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:14,248
K3 might get this up with the five.

498
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:14,609
Thank you.

499
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,273
Yo, what's good G.

500
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:26,272
I hope you're having a great night real quick.

501
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:29,893
Um, there's this, we're doing this charity thing.

502
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:39,837
Uh, well, mr. B set it up and he's basically just calling a bunch of streamers and a bunch of people I've donated, but it's for this clean water thing, like worldwide water action.

503
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:41,718
Uh, wait, what'd you say?

504
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:42,959
Some water action.

505
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:43,739
Yup.

506
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:43,979
Yup.

507
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,260
So just, just clean water.

508
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,843
And, uh, we, uh, a lot of people were saying to ask you if you'd be, uh, if you'd be down, what you mean like some water action.

509
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:54,732
Like, yeah, like just stuff through it.

510
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:55,812
I'm basically a donation.

511
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:56,973
It goes to team water.

512
00:33:57,433 --> 00:34:01,834
It's for this, uh, charity that basically gives people clean water, like worldwide.

513
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:09,855
Oh, so like people, so people that's like somewhere that ain't got no like clean water action and like literally exactly.

514
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:10,155
Yes.

515
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:10,895
It's a very beautiful.

516
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:11,836
It's a very beautiful thing.

517
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:12,436
Okay.

518
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:13,176
Well, how much you do?

519
00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:15,296
Um, well, okay.

520
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:15,996
So I did a 100,000.

521
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:16,277
All right.

522
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:16,897
I'll do that too.

523
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:21,222
Yeah, I got you.

524
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:21,482
Yeah.

525
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:24,864
Yeah, I'm gonna do what you did.

526
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:25,864
Huh?

527
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,965
All right, bro.

528
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:29,706
All right, Pete.

529
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:33,267
Hey, WGC.

530
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:39,270
Hey, I think people do need some clean water now.

531
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:45,833
I do think people... See, I told y'all I'd give to the charity, but as far as jumping in the car, no.

532
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:50,585
You know what I mean?

533
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:54,106
So that's what it was, chat.

534
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:56,487
See, he called me, and you see what happened?

535
00:34:56,907 --> 00:34:57,708
Things happened.

536
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:00,609
It's legit, though, right?

537
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:01,549
Expect, are you sure?

538
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:02,169
He didn't stutter?

539
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:02,629
He didn't say $100?

540
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,750
He did not stutter.

541
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,310
He donates to charities a lot.

542
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,090
Call him back.

543
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,471
Call him back.

544
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:08,151
I want to hear from him.

545
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:10,092
Well, I don't want to call him again, but I just called him.

546
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:10,612
I just called him.

547
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:12,173
It's 100 grand.

548
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:13,153
You can call the dude.

549
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,591
Alright, so he's locked in his word is good.

00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,292
Hey, tell him is good.

00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:18,352

Alright, thank you, Jinxy.

00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:36,354
You can leave.

558
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:37,635
Thank you so much.

559
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:40,598
Thank you for the $100,000 donation.

560
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:42,739
He good.

561
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:45,502
And last thing I'm gonna say is this was a beautiful stream.

00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:46,162
Yeah, he good.

563
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:47,623
It's not real?

564
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:48,524
You think I got scammed?

565
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:51,206
No way.

566
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:55,090
Nah, Jinxy wouldn't call me and get me scammed.

567
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:55,830
No.

568
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,672
Nah, he would not do that.

569
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:01,375
No, Jinxy would not get me scammed.

570
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,136
I promise you that.

571
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:06,779
Ain't no way, ain't no way my boy would get me scammed.

572
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:08,741
Okay, I trust Jinxy.

573
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:09,982
You know what I mean?

574
00:36:10,642 --> 00:36:11,783
No, no, no, no, no.

575
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:12,684
Hey, you know what I mean?

576
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,426

577
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:18,068
I done told you I ain't joining.

00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:20,950
Now I ain't gonna tell you again.

579
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:24,233
Minus 100K?

580
00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:24,954
Oh, I thought he said $100.

581
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:25,614
No, I'm playing, I got it.

582
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:32,791

586
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,276
I'll consider watch these for four hours.

587

I'm not going more cupcakes The kitchen aid bowl lift stand mixer w goat action for real No joke though

588
00:36:54,868 --> 00:37:21,142
Six most disturbing things caught on home security camera footage You know what I mean in 2015 a couple in San Jose, California were the victims of a home invasion Intruders were never identified the police recommended the to invest in some home security cameras to protect against future break-ins and So they got money though.

589
00:37:21,162 --> 00:37:23,103
Look at this little outdoor area right here.

590
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:23,143
I

591
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:27,116
They set up a total of six different cameras around their house.

592
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:32,880
Then, on May 8th of that same year, these cameras would capture a second break-in.

593
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:39,626
Two men wearing black clothes climb a fence into the backyard, where they're shown finding an unlocked sliding glass door.

594
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,853
They walk inside and immediately go into the kitchen.

595
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:51,747
One of them is seen disconnecting a phone setting on the counter.

596
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:56,169
They proceed to search the kitchen, opening different cabinets and drawers.

597
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,212
From this, they find kitchen knives, which they take with them to arm themselves.

598
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,113
Why?

599
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:05,855
Imagine getting stabbed by your own kitchen knife.

600
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:10,258
Camera, their next scene running upstairs, kitchen knives in hand.

601
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:19,428
Imagine stabbing somebody in general, you know what I mean?

602
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,528
Like, how you gonna stab somebody?

603
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:25,550
As they're searching the rooms upstairs, one of the men comes across a locked door.

604
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,070
It was the door to the master bedroom.

605
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:32,331
He puts his ear to the door, and hears a baby crying.

606
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:37,133
Inside the room was a family friend named Rosie and the two homeowners' child.

607
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:40,734
Rosie was babysitting for them when the intruders entered the home.

608
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:45,010
Hearing the crying, the man alerted his partner that people were inside.

609
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:50,178
Instead of getting spooked and leaving, the men go up to the door and aggressively start kicking it.

610
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:58,021
They hit it with such force that they managed to kick a hole in it.

611
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:00,582
They then thrust knives through the hole.

612
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:05,385
Rosie took the couple's child and retreated to the bathroom, locking that door as well.

613
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:09,648
She screamed out that she called the police.

614
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:11,609
This would work.

615
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,192
The men finally started running away before they could fully break into the bedroom.

616
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:20,115
Police reviewed all of the footage, but were never able to identify the men.

617
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,290
Their true motives remain unknown.

618
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:34,255
Oh, we can tell what their true... Any man... It's hard to believe they were only trying to rob the place, seeing that they disconnected the phones and felt the need to arm themselves with kitchen knives.

619
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:38,237
They also didn't immediately leave upon finding people inside.

620
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:41,138
Instead, they tried breaking down a door to get to them.

621
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,502
This is the footage from a home security camera in Vacaville, California.

622
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,323
Doc's license plate ain't blurred out.

623
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:59,110
It was April when this footage was taken, and during that time of year, it's common to see a lot of activity in the form of kids walking home from school each afternoon.

624
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:04,633
On this day, at some point, a girl with a backpack on is shown walking into frame.

625
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:07,775
She was walking home from school like everyone else.

626
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:13,398
However, she had been being followed for several blocks by a man in a dark-colored Pontiac.

627
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,701
She noticed this, and so she used a large truck parked on the side of the road to hide.

628
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:24,112
Bro.

629
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:37,479
Bro.

630
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,541
She abruptly stops walking while she's out of view of the Pontiac.

631
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:43,642
The driver stops, expecting her to come back into view.

632
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:48,045
When she doesn't, he stalls there for a while before slowly driving off.

633
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,987
The girl is left standing there, unsure of what to do next.

634
00:40:53,149 --> 00:41:19,488
What you doing eventually she sees the car coming back and decides to stay put behind the truck Yo w survival this dude came back around Yo w survival skills over I

635
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:31,608
The Pontiac drives by, and then reverses to try and talk to the girl, but she continually repositions herself out of view.

636
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:36,069
Finally, he drives off again and the girl makes a run for it.

637
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:41,610
After receiving multiple tips about the driver and his car, the police started an investigation.

638
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,391
A 24-year-old man was identified as the driver.

639
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,391
He was interviewed, but not arrested.

640
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:53,032
He technically hadn't committed any crime, and therefore police couldn't really do anything.

641
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:35,066
run that by me again 24 year old man was identified as the driver he was interviewed but not arrested he technically hadn't committed any crime and therefore police couldn't really do anything whether or not the man was actually planning something that day is unknown

642
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,801
First, we offer overnight boarding.

643
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:47,304
Your pet will stay overnight in your sitter's home and not only be treated like part of the family, but treated like a king or queen honey.

644
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:50,045
I am absolutely- WHAT?!

645
00:42:53,267 --> 00:43:02,051
He technically didn't- he- wha- Let me- let me make the laws, buddy.

646
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:11,290
Not only would have this dude been arrested, he'd have been de-headed in public.

647
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:15,574
That is unbelievable!

648
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,036
13 years old and one three years old.

649
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:27,277
On the night of February 20th, 2022, the three of them went shopping together.

650
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,578
Their home security camera would show them returning home.

651
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:34,139
They're seen walking inside and closing the door behind them.

652
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,920
Shortly after, a man walks into frame from around their parked truck.

653
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,701
The very first thing he does is try to open the door.

654
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:44,381
Okay, so yeah, you need to start shooting.

655
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:48,422
If the first thing they do is try to open the door and not knock, you gotta start blasting.

656
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:50,851
Who are you talking to?

657
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,572
You leave no question.

658
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:53,372
Why?

659
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:57,553
You shoot first, ask questions later if somebody's trying to get in your house.

660
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:01,314
Why?

661
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,803
After knocking a few times, the man walks away.

662
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:33,230
However, they later found out through a neighbor's camera that for the next five minutes he walks around the house on his phone.

663
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:44,387
Allie further reviewed the videos and found that it appears the man had been following them in his car all the way from the store.

664
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:50,569
Two seconds after they park in the driveway, his car drives a bit further and parks a few houses down.

665
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,870
After a few more seconds, he gets out and starts walking towards them.

666
00:44:56,331 --> 00:44:59,832
Thankfully, they were able to get everything inside and the door locked before he got there.

667
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:06,714
Allie ended by writing, I don't know what this man's intentions were, but I don't think it was to rob us.

668
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:15,353
I do believe that this was random and that we are not specifically targeted, but that he saw an opportunity when he saw a woman and two girls go into a house alone.

669
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:21,416
Man... Police were alerted, and they did search the area, but the man in the video was never found.

670
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:24,257
Lord have mercy!

671
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:33,878
In October of 2016, a family in Florida noticed multiple things missing from inside their home.

672
00:45:35,058 --> 00:45:38,720
The night before, everything was there, but when they woke up, stuff was missing.

673
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,162
How you be caught on camera?

674
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,143
Plain as day.

675
00:45:45,764 --> 00:45:48,686
Plain as day, and you wasn't never found, bruh.

676
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:54,309
To figure out where it went, they reviewed their home security cameras.

677
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:58,651
At 1.30 in the morning, this is what the cameras captured.

678
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:07,415
Dude, there's literally somebody sleeping on the couch, bruh.

679
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:14,745
There's somebody sleeping on the couch in the bottom right, too!

680
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:42,018
There's no way you're brave enough to do this with people literally sleeping less than a foot away from you.

681
00:46:42,038 --> 00:46:42,679
There's no way.

682
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:54,924
A man walks around the house while three children are sleeping on couches only feet away from him.

683
00:46:56,085 --> 00:47:01,930
He walks around them looking for valuables and hands what he finds to another man standing just outside, this one armed.

684
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:02,931
Dude.

685
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:05,953
The family immediately called the police upon seeing the footage.

686
00:47:07,114 --> 00:47:10,937
Police opened an investigation, but never found the two men in the video.

687
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:17,202
Police believe that had anyone in the house woken up during the break-in, they likely would have been shot.

688
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:18,423
Man.

689
00:47:21,112 --> 00:47:25,775
We can just assume that they was never identified every time we see one of these chats.

690
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:26,195
No joke.

691
00:47:26,475 --> 00:47:29,257
Every time we see one of these, we might as well just assume they got away with it.

692
00:47:30,752 --> 00:47:36,074
A woman in Hudson, Wisconsin opened her blinds one morning and noticed something in the snow outside her window.

693
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:40,416
She went outside and realized she was looking at footprints.

694
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:44,838
The prints walked right up to her bedroom window and then back the way they came.

695
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:51,741
Worried someone deliberately looked inside her window, the woman set up a security camera outside pointed towards her window.

696
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:56,863
A few nights later, the camera recorded the man who made the footprints coming back.

697
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,501
Dude, this reminds me of the Hinterkeifeck.

698
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,244
Y'all ever heard of the Hinterkeifeck action?

699
00:48:04,624 --> 00:48:09,712
Where that dude found them footsteps in the snow leading to his house, and he didn't see no footsteps leading away.

700
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:12,015
Next day, whole family was killed.

701
00:48:13,277 --> 00:48:14,038
With an axe.

702
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:14,939
Or something.

703
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,343
Not an axe, but like a big ol' like, tool.

704
00:48:26,348 --> 00:48:29,811
Y'all ever heard of the Viscula, uh, the Viscula axe murder house too?

705
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:33,295
Somebody just walked in their house, killed all of them with an axe, dead.

706
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:45,086
Bro, how you gonna walk in somebody's house, kill everybody in there with an axe?

707
00:48:58,687 --> 00:48:59,668
Oh man, there's an axe right here.

708
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:01,029
I'm gonna walk in his house and kill everybody.

709
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,303
Like, what you mean, bruh?

710
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:18,307
What you mean you about to walk in here and kill his whole family with an axe?

711
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:23,095
Like, it makes you wonder if somebody would've ran into somebody like that.

712
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:24,636
Be like, hey bro, what you about to do?

713
00:49:24,656 --> 00:49:28,096
Oh, I'm about to walk in here and kill this whole family with this axe I just found.

714
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:30,097
And if they was like, bro, you shouldn't do that.

715
00:49:30,157 --> 00:49:31,397
You think they'd be like, well, you know what?

716
00:49:31,437 --> 00:49:32,497
You right, I ain't gonna do it.

717
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,800
Play the video.

718
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,080
I cut the video off!

719
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:53,240
The man is shown clearly peering in the window.

720
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,142
Police were alerted and shown the video.

721
00:49:57,442 --> 00:50:02,145
After doing some digging, they were able to trace the vehicle leaving the scene to a man named Robert Cessna.

722
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:03,826
Oh my goodness, they caught one.

723
00:50:04,386 --> 00:50:06,547
Reputable executive for the company 3M.

724
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:10,149
It must not be that reputable because I ain't never heard of it.

725
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:14,691
LinkedIn profile, Robert Cessna is a global key account vice president at 3M.

726
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:15,472
He ain't nothing.

727
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:17,313
He shows similarities to the man in the video.

728
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:21,372
Robert was contacted by police, but denied it was him.

729
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:27,856
Police then interviewed several neighborhood witnesses, and along with other evidence were able to confirm that he was lying.

730
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:29,817
He was the man in the video.

731
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:36,280
Robert Cessna was ultimately charged with felony stalking, and later fired from his executive position.

732
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:45,005
So this dude gets felony stalking, and the guy that rode by that little girl multiple times while she was walking home from school technically didn't commit a crime?

733
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:46,706
Like, what you talking about, bruh?

734
00:50:50,462 --> 00:50:53,225
Oh, 3M, oh yeah, you right, nevermind.

735
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:54,686
Yeah, I have heard of them, my fault.

736
00:50:56,869 --> 00:50:57,229
Yeah, my bad.

737
00:50:57,249 --> 00:50:57,529
Yeah, you right.

738
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,391
Man, that's an old lady with a scooter!

739
00:50:59,411 --> 00:50:59,752
And you go, man!

740
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:20,648
A total of five had occurred, and so she finally took the advice of- THERE AIN'T NO WAY YOU TAKING THE STUFF OFF HER SCOOTER ON TOP OF IT!

741
00:51:21,268 --> 00:51:21,868
OH BUDDY!

742
00:51:22,368 --> 00:51:24,369
OH- On home security cameras.

743
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,851
Caught on the cameras, a sixth break-in occurs around one in the morning.

744
00:51:30,072 --> 00:51:34,053
A man is seen silently walking around while Margaret is sleeping in her living room.

745
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,354
HER NAME'S MARGARET DUDE!

746
00:51:37,215 --> 00:51:39,836
THERE AIN'T NO WAY YOU STEALING SOMETHING FROM OLD LADY MARGARET!

747
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:42,117
YOU DISGUSTING!

748
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:47,284
Oh, you, you, you, you disgusting.

749
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:04,172
Did he have a moment of clarity?

750
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,574
Are we witnessing a moment of clarity?

751
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:25,104
No, no moment of clarity, he's still looking for stuff.

752
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:47,258
NOW YOU'RE COOKED!

753
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:47,478
Unreal.

754
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:51,061
OH, MARGARET'S ABOUT THAT BUSINESS, BUDDY!

755
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,470
Don't hurt him, Miss Margaret!

756
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:22,612
Hey, you lucky you got out of there before Margaret got ahold of you.

757
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:27,054
Hey, hey, she would have tied him up to the railroad tracks and ran him over with that scooter about 50 times.

758
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:28,415
He's lucky Margaret didn't get ahold of him.

759
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:29,855
She was about that business for real, bruh.

760
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:46,073
No joke.

761
00:53:49,955 --> 00:53:50,615
Did we see that one?

762
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:52,697
Yeah, that's the one we seen.

763
00:54:09,332 --> 00:54:13,173
But I eat healthy, but I want to every time we watch one of these bro.

764
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:15,974
It makes me lose faith in humanity, bro.

765
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:16,694
I'm for real.

766
00:54:16,894 --> 00:54:18,594
Like I'm for real, bro.

767
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:23,656
Like why?

768
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:27,257
That's why you go somewhere, bro.

769
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:34,558
You got to keep, if you can't carry a blicky on you, carry some pepper spray, carry a knife.

770
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:36,339
You got to have something on you, bro.

771
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,019
No joke.

772
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:41,706
keep something, you gotta keep something.

773
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:50,339
If you can't do no blicky action, you keep your big old jug of pepper spray or like a little, or like not a little knife, like a knife for real.

774
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,763
Cause you never know who's going to try to run up on you, bro.

775
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,871
A jug of pepper spray?

776
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,193
Yeah, they make them big ones.

777
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:11,796
The big ones with the squirt cap on it.

778
00:55:11,876 --> 00:55:14,098
Yeah, like that bear spray action.

779
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:15,380
Somebody run up on you.

780
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,301
Hey, how you doing?

781
00:55:18,423 --> 00:55:19,024
Sprayed.

782
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:24,570
I ain't taking no chances.

783
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:38,419
In this first video, an avid cave explorer on YouTube known by the channel name, Exploring Abandoned Mines and Unusual Places, is exploring an abandoned mine for the simple purpose of reviewing a flashlight.

784
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:50,923
During the video, you can hear as the explorer goes into detail about the flashlight, and demonstrates its use in the mine he's exploring.

785
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:55,257
He's doing a hashtag ad for a flashlight in the middle of a cave.

786
00:55:55,657 --> 00:56:03,179
However, while talking to the camera about both the mine and the flashlight he's reviewing, the explorer hears what he first thinks to be wind blowing through the mine.

787
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:08,380
Though many believe the audio sounds like a very disturbing whispering or talking sound.

788
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:08,880
Huh?

789
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:17,422
Okay, this is a review and demonstration of the Thrunite TN-12 handheld flashlight that you see here.

790
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:24,054
Okay, that's the portal to the wall deck mine.

791
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:24,834
I'm inside.

792
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:29,178
The wind has kind of died down a little bit, and it's not raining, so I managed to stay dry.

793
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:30,679
I think you've went far enough.

794
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:32,960
The flashlight looks like it's doing a pretty good job.

795
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:36,243
Of course, I'm inside this little alcove, kind of.

796
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:39,305
But anyway, you come down this little incline path.

797
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:41,847
You come down this little path?

798
00:56:41,867 --> 00:56:42,608
Are you talking about me?

799
00:56:42,628 --> 00:56:43,669
I know you ain't talking about me.

800
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:44,369
What do you mean, you?

801
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,010
No.

802
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:50,314
And big boulders here you have to climb over, and then the tunnel's right behind me, this way.

803
00:56:51,797 --> 00:56:53,378
So let's check it out.

804
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:55,298
Let's get in here.

805
00:56:57,919 --> 00:56:59,640
Like I said, this light has five levels.

806
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:06,263
I believe it's on medium right now which is level three, so this would be high, and this would be turbo.

807
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,478
Yep, that's going in the cart.

808
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:37,102
Medium seems to be the best one.

809
00:57:37,122 --> 00:57:40,403
Do you see the amount of light that little flashlight gives off?

810
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,204
Not too bright, not too dim.

811
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:48,266
And then, you can see how big these timbers are.

812
00:57:48,306 --> 00:57:49,166
Those are, that's about,

813
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:51,540
Almost a foot in diameter.

814
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,220
It's going down!

815
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,041
I'm yelling timber!

816
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:56,542
You better move!

817
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:58,663
You better dance!

818
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,824
Let's make a night!

819
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:02,445
You won't remember!

820
00:58:02,765 --> 00:58:04,186
I'll be the one!

821
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:05,266
Do you hear that?

822
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:06,587
My fault.

823
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:07,087
My bad.

824
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:07,988
My bad.

825
00:58:08,008 --> 00:58:08,648
He said timber.

826
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:09,088
I had to.

827
00:58:10,629 --> 00:58:11,370
All of this rock.

828
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,211
You can see right here where some of these boards are bending.

829
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:18,413
I did just hear some whisper action.

830
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:18,973
Y'all heard that?

831
00:58:18,993 --> 00:58:19,834
Do you hear that?

832
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,061
Sounds like a. All fake video.

833
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:31,881
What is that wind?

834
00:58:34,402 --> 00:58:35,902
Can you hear that on the camera?

835
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,764
The moment it went through the direction of paranormal, it's fake.

836
00:58:45,904 --> 00:58:51,405
Now, if you see the butt naked dude run around the corner with a club, I'd be like, oh, whoa, stopped.

837
00:58:57,277 --> 00:58:59,361
Well, I don't know what that is.

838
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:02,666
That doesn't sound like wind, but that's crazy.

839
00:59:03,928 --> 00:59:06,994
Don't know if that's a bird or I don't know what that is.

840
00:59:07,034 --> 00:59:08,116
It almost sounds like snakes.

841
00:59:08,136 --> 00:59:09,278
Wait, wait, is he for real?

842
00:59:17,034 --> 00:59:17,214
Wow.

843
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:20,817
I've heard some weird stuff in mines, but that is definitely creepy.

844
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:21,797
I don't know what that is.

845
00:59:21,837 --> 00:59:22,718
There's no way.

846
00:59:22,878 --> 00:59:28,342
So let's get out of here and head back out to the portal.

847
00:59:28,362 --> 00:59:31,064
That was weird.

848
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:35,027
Roku ads manager puts Roku's reach within your reach.

850
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:43,192
Are you tired of uncomfortable bras that poke and just don't fit right?

851
00:59:43,573 --> 00:59:44,033
We deserve better.

852
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:49,090
These next two videos come from the same exploring YouTube channel shown earlier.

853
00:59:52,711 --> 00:59:58,652
This time, however, the explorer visits an abandoned, supposedly haunted mine in Nevada known as Horton Mine.

854
00:59:59,612 --> 01:00:05,674
The first time he visits, he claims to feel negative energy coming from the mine, and what he witnesses goes to support his claim.

855
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:13,696
However, with the popularity of the first visit, the YouTuber decides to visit the abandoned mine a second time, this time hearing something very disturbing.

856
01:00:14,296 --> 01:00:17,237
Here are both of those visits to the mine.

857
01:00:17,377 --> 01:00:22,199
Okay, here's a lower adit at the Victorine Mine.

858
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:29,222
I believe this was an older mine that once they dug the upper tunnels, this got incorporated into the same claim or whatever.

859
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:31,603
Okay, we can go in here and just take a quick look.

860
01:00:31,683 --> 01:00:33,564
I don't think I'm going to explore this particular mine.

861
01:00:33,584 --> 01:00:41,027
There's a little bit too much water in here, and I know this mine is really old, but... You're old!

862
01:00:41,067 --> 01:00:42,748
Don't talk about that mine like that!

863
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:49,802
I do see other footprints here in the mud, but I just don't think it's wise to go in here when there's water.

864
01:00:49,822 --> 01:00:51,622
I'll try to avoid this if I can.

865
01:00:52,422 --> 01:00:54,803
Yes, this looks pretty sketchy.

866
01:00:57,324 --> 01:01:00,684
I'll go a few feet further in and check it out, but I think I'm going to pass on this one.

867
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:10,187
This is one of the creepiest mine tunnels I've ever been in just because of how dilapidated it is and all these chains hanging down.

868
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:13,477
from the overhead, and there's a shot looking down the tunnel.

869
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:14,537
Bro!

870
01:01:14,657 --> 01:01:16,338
Here's a shot looking back towards the entrance.

871
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:17,278
I'm a little bit further in.

872
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:22,320
And uh... Bro said this is about as far as I'm gonna go.

873
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:25,422
Next shot, he's 200 feet deep looking at the exit.

874
01:01:28,903 --> 01:01:30,003
Looking down the tunnel here.

875
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:39,487
Move that chain!

876
01:01:41,858 --> 01:01:44,341
I don't know why that one chain is swinging back there.

877
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:50,989
I don't know if you can see that in the video or not.

878
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:56,936
This mine definitely has a very spooky vibe to it, so I'm going to head back out and check out the other stuff that's here.

879
01:01:56,976 --> 01:01:58,498
This is just too wet and too muddy.

880
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:02,003
You saw.

881
01:02:02,063 --> 01:02:04,365
Honestly, something is making the change.

882
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:12,088
I like how, I like how what the, I like how the thing stopping him from going farther in here is that it's too wet and too muddy.

883
01:02:13,149 --> 01:02:14,029
Like, okay, bud.

884
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:15,130
Swing.

885
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,011
So time to get the hell out of here.

886
01:02:18,672 --> 01:02:20,693
Yo, Lid with the five and Taco with the five.

887
01:02:20,713 --> 01:02:21,053
Thank you.

888
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:25,860
Okay, the Horton Mine still has some water coming out of it.

889
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,842
You can see it kind of pooled up here outside.

890
01:02:31,683 --> 01:02:32,663
Here's the portal.

891
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:34,024
Have you ever heard of steel water?

892
01:02:34,044 --> 01:02:35,504
Yeah, that's them brain-eating amoebas!

893
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:44,328
So, let's go check this out and see if it's any drier than it was a year ago when I was last here.

894
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:50,291
Okay, I'm further in than I was a year ago.

895
01:02:51,985 --> 01:03:00,648
And that's how far I've come.

896
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:01,408
Why?

897
01:03:02,588 --> 01:03:05,749
Okay, here's a final parting shot of the Horton Tunnel.

898
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:14,052
And there's the ore pass with all the cascading water.

899
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:20,214
What the heck is that?

900
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,051
That's a radio or something.

901
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:40,383
I don't know what that was, but there was a sudden blast of cold air.

902
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:43,206
See, now you're just lying.

903
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:44,807
I'm getting out of here.

904
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:49,282
I don't like liars.

905
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:52,403
A man named Clem Schultz and his wife lived in Fairdale.

906
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:53,664
Oh my goodness.

907
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:54,845
I know this video.

908
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:56,746
This is that dude.

909
01:03:57,386 --> 01:04:01,208
Yo, this is that dude that didn't refuse to go to the basement.

910
01:04:01,529 --> 01:04:02,409
He said, forget it.

911
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,091
I'm going to sit here and film this tornado killing me.

912
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:06,592
Y'all remember this video?

913
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:13,876
This dude literally filmed this tornado until it got, he didn't even go to the base.

914
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,777
He filmed it all the way until it got to his house.

915
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:19,915
during one of the most destructive tornadoes in the history of Fairdale.

916
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:26,480
During the storm, Clem took a video from the top floor of his house as he saw the giant tornado get closer.

917
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,906
Clem thought the tornado would miss his house, when in fact it was coming directly towards him, all while he was still recording.

918
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:37,449
Unfortunately, Clem's wife would pass away because of the intensity of the tornado.

919
01:04:39,532 --> 01:04:47,878
While Clem would receive a terrible spine injury, the phone he took the video on was later discovered in the rubble of his home, and this is what the video was able to capture.

920
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,482
Like, at some point, it's gotta register, like, oh!

921
01:04:56,444 --> 01:04:57,204
Like, wait a minute.

922
01:04:57,885 --> 01:04:58,885
I'm in danger here.

923
01:05:03,128 --> 01:05:04,269
Maybe I need to go to the basement.

924
01:05:05,891 --> 01:05:08,272
And I feel like I would be at that point right here.

925
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:10,714
As soon as that light goes out, go.

926
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:27,583
He's still filming.

927
01:05:44,518 --> 01:05:51,642
This next video He didn't die either

928
01:05:53,060 --> 01:06:00,102
shows a man exploring the Paris catacombs, which is a place very well known for causing people to get lost.

929
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:07,865
They are essentially the most complex series of tunnels in the world, definitely not somewhere you'd want to find yourself exploring without experience.

930
01:06:08,645 --> 01:06:14,027
The video shows this man getting lost and going into a full panic run as he doesn't know where to go to get out.

931
01:06:22,726 --> 01:06:30,928
Like some dude actually went into the Paris catacombs by himself, ran around, got lost, went crazy, and was never seen again.

932
01:06:30,948 --> 01:06:35,069
He was never found, but his camera later was, with no trace of the guy.

933
01:06:35,729 --> 01:06:40,310
It's very bizarre.

934
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,511
These arrows point in a direction.

935
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:43,771
So how'd they get the video?

936
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:45,692
You just blow in from stupid town, bud?

937
01:06:50,013 --> 01:06:51,753
Somebody else went in later and found it.

938
01:06:56,145 --> 01:07:00,309
Occasionally also he stops to photograph he fell into a black hole or something.

939
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:19,066
It was unrecoverable You're banned gracie with the five which means that he's very very deep inside the catacombs So basically he's filming what he's seeing very deep inside the catacombs Other than the point of view shots or pictures

940
01:07:22,002 --> 01:07:23,363
catacombs for centuries.

941
01:07:23,403 --> 01:07:24,583
Man it's so scary.

942
01:07:24,603 --> 01:07:29,686
So it is possible with these paintings that we may be able to be traced back to Tinderary to some extent.

943
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:40,691
After about four minutes we hear his breathing get louder and louder as though something was scaring him.

944
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,272
He's frightened, he's frightened.

945
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:47,215
Occasionally he stops perhaps to try to decide which way to run among all the many different corridors.

946
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:52,340
He's running faster and faster and faster, deeper and deeper into the catacombs.

947
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,701
And all of a sudden... He drops the camera.

948
01:07:55,741 --> 01:08:00,244
You hear his breathing get louder and louder, as though something was scaring him.

949
01:08:00,764 --> 01:08:01,284
He's frightened.

950
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:02,445
He's frightened.

951
01:08:02,465 --> 01:08:06,827
He stops, perhaps, to try to decide which way to run among all the many different corridors.

952
01:08:07,027 --> 01:08:11,889
He's running faster and faster and faster, deeper and deeper into the catacombs.

953
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,691
This is fake, but it's literally not fake, though.

954
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:15,271
Like, it's not.

955
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:16,932
And all of a sudden...

956
01:08:22,718 --> 01:08:23,118
Gone.

957
01:08:27,962 --> 01:08:30,263
You gotta think, it's completely dark down there.

958
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:32,665
You literally can't see nothing.

959
01:08:32,705 --> 01:08:34,346
He ain't got no flashlight, no nothing.

960
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:35,808
Dropped his camera, gone.

961
01:08:40,091 --> 01:08:40,851
R.I.P., bruh.

962
01:08:42,112 --> 01:08:48,297
Either he's dead or he's still down there living in them catacombs somewhere, like, surviving off, like, like cockroaches and stuff.

963
01:08:48,437 --> 01:08:48,777
I don't know.
