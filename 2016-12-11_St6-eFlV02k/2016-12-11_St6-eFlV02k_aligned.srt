1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:08,773
of the state legislation that would have to be adopted by the city, the school committee, in order to move this into place.

2
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:27,758
And if I could read the state chapter, general law chapter 71, section 55D, small a, upon the issuance of a musical wind instrument to a student who is permitted to use or borrow the instrument while attending any public or commonwealth charter school or pre-kindergarten to grade 12, inclusive,

3
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:44,526
The school issuing the instrument shall inform the student's parent or guardian that the musical wind instrument has been sanitized and may also be sterilized at the expense of the parent or guardian requesting sterilization to ensure that all microbial life has been eradicated from the instrument.

4
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:51,912
The parent or guardian may request that the school sterilize the instrument prior to issuance in compliance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Public Health.

5
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:56,577
The parent or guardian who makes the request shall be responsible for the entire cost of the sterilization.

6
00:00:57,217 --> 00:01:09,429
Small b, this section shall take effect in any city, town, or regional school district upon acceptance by the school committee, or in the case of a commonwealth charter school, upon acceptance by the board of trustees, respectfully submitted by myself, Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

7
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,210
Thank you.

8
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,831
We also have Solicitor Rumley here.

9
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,592
I don't know if he wanted to say a few words on this topic.

10
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:24,597
Thank you and good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee,

11
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,638
This statute is what it says.

12
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:35,542
It's a matter of notification and information to families, families whose students would be borrowing wind instruments.

13
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,242
And it's really very simple.

14
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:47,447
What it says is that if a child or a student is borrowing a wind instrument, that they shall receive information that tells them that it's been sanitized.

15
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:53,450
And the parents would also be told that they have the option at their own expense to have it sterilized.

16
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,775
And if that's done, then that would have to be done according to the standards of the Department of Public Health.

17
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:06,242
So this is a matter of information so that families can better make informed decisions relative to their children.

18
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:11,027
And as I'll speak for the mayor, I would recommend your approval on this matter.

19
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:12,989
Thank you very much.

20
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:15,591
There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

21
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:16,272
Vierne de Kloet.

22
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:17,333
Roll call vote, please.

23
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:20,993
Mr. Benedetto.

24
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:21,693
Thank you.

25
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:26,537
Um, I had a couple of questions before we incur this cost on, onto the parents.

26
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:35,804
We need to know what the cost is because I know, um, what we want to do is encourage the most amount of participation in our music programs as we can.

27
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,746
And we don't want to put an undue hardship.

28
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,966
on anyone who wants to play.

29
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:51,612
So I'd like to know how long the sanitation lasts for, like if someone borrows it and then they turn it back in, is it then re-sanitized before the next student were to borrow it?

30
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:56,895
How that works, like I really have a lot of questions before we move this forward.

31
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:02,658
I'm not a clinician, nor am I a doctor, nor am I a scientist of any nature.

32
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:16,305
But in the information that I have been reviewing in preparation for tonight, I can just tell you that the suggestion is that an instrument be sanitized once per year as it's given to a child who's borrowing it.

33
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,066
I mean, excuse me, sterilized.

34
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,988
If the family opts to do that, they need not.

35
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,728
All right, so say I'm a parent and my student wants to play.

36
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:34,174
How many wind instruments do we lend on a year?

37
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,360
Mr. Superintendent.

38
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,229
So I spoke to the music department.

39
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,053
There are currently 76 wind instruments that have been rented at this time.

40
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:51,438
Most of them at the elementary level, there are about 66, another 10 at the middle school level.

41
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:57,743
Most of the instruments beyond the middle school are either owned by the individuals, well, they are owned by the individuals.

42
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:01,206
By that time, they paid for them if they worked them up all the way up.

43
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:07,251
So we currently have about 76 instruments that are rented in the school system, mostly at the elementary level.

44
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,617
So they're not borrowed, so they wouldn't come under this ordinance.

45
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:10,857
Yes.

46
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:16,623
No, they're rented from a private company, but that's not, this wording says borrowed.

47
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,245
That's, that's very different.

48
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:23,150
Cause as a parent, I, I rented a saxophone for years and you rent it to own it.

49
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:28,776
Actually, my son still has it and I heard him playing it about a month ago when I pulled up, which I was very happy to hear.

50
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:28,836
Um,

51
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:33,598
And he rented to own this.

52
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,739
So when he got it, it was always his.

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:46,307
It actually was sterilized because in the very beginning, Dr. LaPore provided that to everybody in all the Method students when he was first bringing this program forward.

54
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,289
So it had been sterilized.

55
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,052
So Madam Mayor, if I can, the third word is issuance.

56
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:55,354
It's not borrow or loan, it's issued.

57
00:04:55,794 --> 00:05:01,236
Issued from the school department, whether it's issued on a lease purchase or issued as a pure rental.

58
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:12,260
So my understanding from reading this, Mr. Belson, was that the school department's inventory of instruments that we were lending out, and I'm like, I didn't know we lent out

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,582
wind instruments, because that's why we had a private company.

60
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:20,745
Wouldn't the private company be responsible for providing clean instruments?

61
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:23,246
But they're contracted by the school department to do that.

62
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:24,527
Right.

63
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:30,470
So as a result, the school department is issuing it through the private company on behalf of the school department.

64
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,652
At the cost to the parent to have the safe sterilization.

65
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:40,036
If I think I'm correct, I spoke to Mr. Casey, who unfortunately can't be here because he's not feeling well at this point.

66
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:50,122
But he told me that for Medford students, they are issuing it at about $100 for a wind instrument for the year, which is well below market.

67
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:53,184
So they issue to another school district.

68
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:56,425
I think he says he rents to about 127 different school districts.

69
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,266
It's $25 a month.

70
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,307
In Medford, it's $100 for the year.

71
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,188
So it's a very sharp discount for a Medford student.

72
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,589
Jack is a graduate of the high school.

73
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:09,195
and we obviously feel some obligation.

74
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:14,798
So what is the cost incurred by a parent whose child wants to rent an instrument?

75
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:24,242
The last cost I saw for a typical wind instrument, trumpet, a clarinet, something of that type, and please correct me if I'm wrong, was approximately $125 for the process.

76
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:25,842
So it would cost?

77
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:29,484
I would say that that's the neighborhood, but it is not necessarily the street.

78
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:30,865
Okay.

79
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,086
A larger instrument, for example, a typical kid wouldn't buy a tuba.

80
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,602
I mean, you know, that's something we would do and then we would have to be responsible for that.

81
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:41,083
So I understand the importance of this.

82
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:47,985
So in the health, the health piece and why it's important to have this done.

83
00:06:48,865 --> 00:07:00,068
Um, so if I had a child who went in the fifth grade and picked a wind instrument, they would pay the a hundred dollars a year to rent to own this instrument.

84
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:01,843
until they paid it off, typically.

85
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:09,986
Right, which for a saxophone back then was like $700, $800 total through the lifetime at that time.

86
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:16,489
And then another $125 for have it sanitized when they initially get it.

87
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:16,849
Sterilized.

88
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,289
Sterilized.

89
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,309
I'm sorry, sterilized.

90
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,150
If the parents chose for that option.

91
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:23,445
So what would this mean, Mr. Runley?

92
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:27,548
We have to inform them that they have the option to, or that they have to?

93
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,309
There are two elements of the information.

94
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:32,170
The first information is on the notice.

95
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:37,033
The first information that they receive is that the instrument has been sanitized.

96
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:41,636
And if the parents so choose, it may be sterilized.

97
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:46,719
And if they do choose that option, then it would be done at their expense.

98
00:07:48,369 --> 00:08:01,896
So this is entirely, the effect of this from a legal point of view, from a functional point of view, or an administrative point of view, is for the school department, that is the city, to provide notice to families.

99
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,058
That it's not been sterilized and they have that option.

100
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:13,021
And we're by no means mandating this in any way or encouraging it, it's each individual's

101
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:14,467
Choice.

102
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,508
Notification.

103
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:15,928
Right.

104
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:27,794
For example, were I a parent of a child in the school system borrowing an instrument, myself and my wife would garner the information that we could about sanitation and sterilization, and then we'd make a choice.

105
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:33,097
And that's really what families should do, make choices that benefit their children.

106
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:41,422
And that's what the government, that's what the school department should be doing to assist them to fully and functionally make that choice.

107
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,140
Ms.

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,601
Van de Kloot.

109
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,062
I just did have a question about the cost.

110
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:53,186
I thought it was significantly lower when you and I talked, Mr. Superintendent.

111
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,727
Oh, okay.

112
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,870
The Iran people here would like to address the specifics such as cost.

113
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:00,532
Thank you.

114
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,213
That's the number.

115
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:03,414
Would you like to comment now?

116
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:05,055
Did you want to wait for an answer?

117
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:08,238
Well, I think they're going to speak and someone could speak on the cost.

118
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,802
Name and address for the record, please.

119
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:14,563
Victor Gao.

120
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,183
lawyer, Medford.

121
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:20,026
I am a consultant for Dr. Lepore and his company.

122
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,949
Um, Mr. Belzer, can I ask where you got that figure of $125?

123
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,012
I got that from Jack Casey.

124
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,615
He doesn't, he doesn't sterilize instruments though.

125
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,796
No, but that's what he told me.

126
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:34,017
I asked him what the cost would be and he said, that's what it would be.

127
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:38,261
Well, he can't sterilize cause there's only, there's only one person that gets sterilized and that's his company.

128
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,722
I didn't say he could sterilize.

129
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:43,125
I asked him what he thought the cost was since he didn't, you know, I thought he would know.

130
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:44,477
Well, he's way off.

131
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,479
If I'm wrong, you know, he's way off.

132
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,100
So if I'll let me, I will answer your question.

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,740
Just one question.

134
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,604
So Mr. Belson, just to remind you, the other day when you and I talked, you may have forgotten this, but you told me it was about $40 per instrument.

135
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:55,725
I don't remember that.

136
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,006
You did.

137
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,507
But if it's, if it's less, it's less.

138
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,007
It's fine.

139
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:00,848
It's much less.

140
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:01,188
Yeah.

141
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:01,628
Okay.

142
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:09,994
The, um, you know, what's interesting, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee is that everybody knows Dr. LaPorte.

143
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:18,727
Anybody could have called up Dr. Lepore and say, how much does it cost to have an instrument sterilized?

144
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,410
Now let me explain a little bit about the term sterilization.

145
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:41,403
You will notice that in the statute itself, the state, this is not us, this is the state, is stating that if you have a sanitized wind instrument, that does not kill all the germs within the instrument.

146
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:52,060
There is only one way you can kill all microbial life, as stated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts statute, and that is by sterilization.

147
00:10:53,301 --> 00:11:04,913
So that when a parent makes the decision of, do I want to have it sterilized or not, but they have to have some information, such as, what type of germs are found within some of these instruments?

148
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:13,187
Now, there's been several tests, there have been several reports, and it seems a lot of people haven't read them.

149
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:28,419
And what it stated is this, and I want everybody that's listening on TV to understand what we're saying here, that in these instruments, one of the things that has been found by the doctors who have done these and the research people is they find mold.

150
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:39,368
I want any doctor to come up here and say that it is perfectly healthy for a child to inhale mold.

151
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:44,271
What happens in the school system, Madam Mayor, Mr. Belzin, when you find mold?

152
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,253
You shut down the school, you break down the walls, you get all that mold.

153
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,855
Mold is going into their mouths and into their system.

154
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:54,797
This is the gateway to your health or not healthy.

155
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,518
It's here through your mouth.

156
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:06,285
And so what happens is the microbial germs that are there do not get killed unless you sterilize.

157
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:17,834
And sterilization is done by ethylene oxide, which is used in 50% to 60% of all medical instruments in the United States.

158
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:27,168
Everything that is put into a person's heart, into their body, is sterilized with ethylene oxide.

159
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:34,594
And that is the only way that you can kill all microbial life in an instrument.

160
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:36,036
That's what does it.

161
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:47,165
And it's done pursuant to the EPA and the FDA, always looking at the places that do this to the instruments to make sure that it's safe.

162
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:54,298
There has never been a problem ever with the sterilization of ethylene oxide.

163
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:59,942
There's been a lot of misinformation out here that I'm very privy to.

164
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:06,087
And I will say to you that it's shocking what's happened.

165
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:10,651
That's why I'm up here speaking today because it's not going to end.

166
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:15,495
There's been something going on behind the scenes that I will get to the bottom of.

167
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,121
because I think there's some hidden agendas involved with this.

168
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,584
And I've been a lawyer for a lot of years.

169
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:25,485
So, um,

170
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:49,995
You've said a lot of things, and I need to tell you that as a school committee member, first of all, because I know many of the people who are involved in this company and have known them over years because of their professional positions in Medford and as Medford residents, that in fact, in my eyes, the way to look at this statute is to say, what does the statute say?

171
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,756
And in fact, if you would,

172
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,578
divorce myself from the people involved.

173
00:13:55,318 --> 00:14:04,221
The statute says that we should be telling parents that there is an option for sanitation.

174
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:04,901
Period.

175
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:07,582
Sorry, sterilization.

176
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:08,002
Period.

177
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:09,923
That's what the statute says.

178
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:14,225
And what I understand us to be voting on tonight is simply, are we going to accept it?

179
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:26,051
And then incumbent on us is to let parents know whose children are renting instruments, that they should be, that there is this option and it is an option.

180
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:27,872
That's what I'm voting on.

181
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:33,115
If I have some blinders on, it's purposeful because I don't want to get involved with personalities or,

182
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:34,516
whatever.

183
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:37,338
I think it's, for me, it's a clear cut.

184
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:38,359
There's a statute.

185
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,842
It says that this would be, that's what the legislature has told us.

186
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,005
I don't have any hidden agenda.

187
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,206
No, you don't.

188
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,267
That's exactly correct.

189
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:49,048
Interpretation.

190
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,951
By the way, miss Stone.

191
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:52,171
Yes.

192
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,172
Um, how are you?

193
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:59,157
So I have gone to the high school three times for my oldest three to try out instruments to see what they would like to do.

194
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:06,883
we send the audit form in, and then the instrument arrives at the Roberts Elementary School in my, well now they're eighth, sixth, and fifth.

195
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:10,725
They pick up their instrument, and I don't have to worry about picking up, dropping off.

196
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,446
It's very nicely done.

197
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:15,228
So how does the sterilization work into it?

198
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:20,732
Would the rental company bring them to your company, and then bring them back to the elementary school?

199
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:26,816
What has happened in the past, Dr. Lepore did this for three years here within the city, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

200
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:43,495
And at that time, all instruments, I believe you believe you were for that at that time, Mr. Bellson, that the instruments that all instruments from the city were done free of charge by Dr. Lepore's company, not one penny.

201
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:55,240
What was charged is to Mr. Casey, he was charged $40 per instrument approximately, and he added on $35 for his, his handling and his profit.

202
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,563
And that's done over a nine or 10 month period of time.

203
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:03,987
So it had maybe six or $7 on to the leasing agreement on a lease to buy.

204
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,809
So if you had a clarinet and you were leasing it for $30,

205
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:17,013
The parent then could be told it'll probably cost you $38 to make sure that there is no microbial life or germs within your instrument.

206
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:21,294
That would be for the, that would be up to the, to the parent to decide.

207
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,015
But as a parent, I don't have to pick it up, bring it to you.

208
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:24,595
No, no.

209
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:25,135
Okay.

210
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:29,737
Because that would be, that would be, that would be, that'd be done with Mr. Bellson and the school committee.

211
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:31,957
I mean the, the school department.

212
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:36,619
I mean, yes, the school department and the people that are there at the music part.

213
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:38,854
All set?

214
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:39,654
Thank you.

215
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:43,475
There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

216
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:45,236
Vander Kloot, Mr. Benedetto.

217
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:45,776
Thank you.

218
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:48,577
So you're saying it's $40 for this?

219
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:56,899
It would approximately- About $40, and then another 35 for the- It's probably in the vicinity of 70 to $75 for the whole thing.

220
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:57,639
Okay.

221
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,360
And it's an option for parents?

222
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,100
That is correct.

223
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,941
So for health reasons, how often should parents

224
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:09,645
get the instruments re-sterilized.

225
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:21,472
On the studies that have been done, the standard is that when it goes from one student to the next and before it's given out to the next student, it should be then sterilized.

226
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:25,675
So at the beginning of the school year, it should be sterilized for that student for the year.

227
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:33,179
So what happens when you rent to own is you keep that same instrument for seven or eight years and then you own it.

228
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,304
I'm asking.

229
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,666
Every year you should do.

230
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:44,591
I don't know if the school committee knows of this, but it's been said many times, gee, no one's got sick.

231
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:45,792
Why should we be doing this?

232
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:52,338
Well, a person just died from self-contamination of a musical wind instrument.

233
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:55,320
Died from it in England.

234
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:58,182
And what happened was the man died in 2014.

235
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:04,059
And he had spent seven or eight years in coughing and with problems.

236
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,820
He was getting weaker and weaker.

237
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,764
The doctors over in England that were treating him in the hospital couldn't figure out what was wrong.

238
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:15,268
So they were giving him all types of medications that were known to them to try to help.

239
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:16,409
It didn't.

240
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:17,589
He was dying.

241
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,812
And it was self-contamination.

242
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:24,155
It didn't go from person to student to student to student.

243
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:28,654
You can self-contaminate your own wind instrument.

244
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:40,120
So therefore, I'm telling everybody that has an instrument, if you have an instrument, you should have it sterilized once a year, because you can self-contaminate your own instrument.

245
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,223
And by the way, when people say they haven't been getting sick, let me tell you the sicknesses that it causes.

246
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:48,063
It can cause flu.

247
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:49,684
It can cause the virus.

248
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:51,105
It can cause headaches.

249
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,465
It can cause coughing.

250
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,306
It can cause diarrhea.

251
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:56,007
It can cause headaches.

252
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:57,467
It can cause asthma.

253
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:59,008
It can cause bronchitis.

254
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:01,449
It can cause feeling sick.

255
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,470
It can cause ear problems.

256
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,772
And all of these things over the years, no one has ever put the dots to say, hey, you know something?

257
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,053
This might have come from the musical instrument.

258
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:16,155
Well, now you can start thinking, I was saying, if the state,

259
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,435
And there's been several hearings on this.

260
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:27,317
The state has said that the only way to ensure that all microbial life has been eradicated within the instrument is through sterilization.

261
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:29,877
That's our Commonwealth of Massachusetts saying that.

262
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:31,538
That's not our company that's saying that.

263
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,278
That's the Commonwealth of Mass.

264
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:41,240
So therefore, what happens here is all we're saying here is give notice to the parents and let them make that decision themselves.

265
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,600
But just understand.

266
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,876
A lot of people have got sick.

267
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:46,096
One has died.

268
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:53,240
Now, the only reason why they were able to find out why he died was the following.

269
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,421
In 2014, he died.

270
00:19:55,061 --> 00:20:01,124
But there were six or seven doctors over in England at this hospital who were doing work for him.

271
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:06,307
And the medical examiner said he died of a lung condition.

272
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,765
They said, no, no, no, no, there's something more wrong with this than that.

273
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,187
We have to determine what really happened.

274
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:18,151
It took them two years, Madam Mayor, of research to find out what happened.

275
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:27,998
So what they did is they finally went into the gentleman's home with the consent of the family, and they found this bagpipe wind instrument.

276
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:35,825
And they said, you know something, let's take that for our researchers and let them go and check out what was going on and what was wrong in the instrument.

277
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,361
What they found, they couldn't believe.

278
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:45,825
There was all types of mold, fungi, and all other things that cause real serious problems.

279
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,686
The poor man died from this.

280
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:49,186
He died from it.

281
00:20:50,387 --> 00:21:04,194
So when we say this, but if these doctors didn't work for two years to figure out what was going on, it would have been another undocumented death that wouldn't be related to musical wind instruments.

282
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:13,743
I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen— Sir, getting back to my question, I just want people to be aware that the recommendation is to have it sterilized every year.

283
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:18,885
And the first year, you get your instrument from the rental company.

284
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:27,390
At that point, if you brought it yourself back to the company to have it sterilized, it would be an additional $40 each year.

285
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:33,955
But it would seem to me that this would be done through the school itself.

286
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:42,961
So then we're putting our regulations on our music department that is already working understaffed.

287
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,338
to take on this responsibility, and I'd like to hear from the superintendent about that.

288
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,739
I have no problem with this.

289
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,040
What responsibility?

290
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:56,365
Of collecting all these 75 instruments, transporting them back to Dr. Lepore's business, and having them sterilized.

291
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:57,946
No, we would be picking up, we'd be picking up.

292
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:02,409
This is not, this is not, by the way, I think there was a misstatement by Mr. Belson.

293
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:07,013
There are not 76 instruments being used in the high school by people in the band.

294
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:14,043
We're not talking, we talking about those that Mr Casey has because he is leasing instruments.

295
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:16,106
That's not what the statute is saying.

296
00:22:16,947 --> 00:22:22,874
Statute is talking about what the school, not you don't issue it through just the Casey.

297
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:34,181
It's Mr Casey's business and he has business with the city and you as the city can say, if you are giving any of these leased instruments to our people, we want you to sterilize them first.

298
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:39,167
And then you're out of all the problems because he has to handle them or the company has to handle them.

299
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:40,929
He has thousands of instruments.

300
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,153
He can put them to all the way and there's no other problems.

301
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:48,997
But if we do that, then we're taking out the option of the parents' choice to have that done.

302
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:49,798
No, they make that choice.

303
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,359
This is informational to the parents.

304
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,340
Notification to the parents.

305
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:54,842
That's what this general law is.

306
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,485
Providing notification to the parents, and then it's up to them to take action.

307
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:02,248
If they so please, they may look up research and disagree with the findings.

308
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,189
It's totally at the parents' wishes.

309
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,150
Ms.

310
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,611
Van de Kloot.

311
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:17,269
The one concern that I do have is I think that it's incumbent on us that we want to make sure that the flyer which is going out to the parents is acceptable to us.

312
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:23,177
I think it probably should have a website for the parents attached to it for more information.

313
00:23:24,057 --> 00:23:29,421
I don't want to scare every parent thinking that their kid now is going to die if they don't do this.

314
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:36,586
I think that we want to let them know that it is an option for them and consistent with the statute.

315
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,347
So I just want to make sure.

316
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:51,336
I haven't seen a flyer yet that would go out to the parent, but rather than that flyer going directly to the music company or through whatever, I want to make sure that we have administrative oversight of that flyer.

317
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,045
Mr. Superintendent.

318
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:55,706
So, let's clarify a few things.

319
00:23:56,566 --> 00:24:11,050
The statute says that when the school department issues something for a student to use or borrow, to use or borrow, not own, to use or borrow, then we have to notify parents of this option.

320
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,191
Now, it's incumbent upon us to give them

321
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:26,100
the pros, maybe some cons if there are, as to why they would or wouldn't do this, the pricing, and to tell them how it works and how to access it.

322
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:38,497
Now, as far as the school department doing it, if we set up a system where people can bring their instruments to us so we can give them to the appropriate company, that's easily done.

323
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,058
It's not difficult to do.

324
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,220
So I don't have a problem doing that.

325
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,665
The issue is really more of setting up a system, providing appropriate flyer, which I'll provide to you.

326
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:52,869
We do have one issue, and maybe an attorney can enlighten us on this one.

327
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,238
is to whether or not there's more than one company because obviously we have bid laws.

328
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,223
Is there one more than one company at this time?

329
00:24:59,243 --> 00:24:59,403
Okay.

330
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,870
So in other words, saying if we put something out, this might be a sole source.

331
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,252
And if it's a sole source, we put that out there.

332
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:11,677
But if another source were to show up, we would have to, over time, explain that to people that they have that option as well.

333
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:15,700
But in the interim, it's not a difficult thing to do.

334
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,662
It's just that we want to provide appropriate notification.

335
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:21,624
Nothing wrong with providing appropriate notification.

336
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:23,726
And people can make up their own mind.

337
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:27,608
And if they believe that this is in their best interest, then fine.

338
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:29,210
If they don't believe it's in their best interest,

339
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:31,644
then that's a choice they can make.

340
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,686
So, that's what we're involved with.

341
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:36,687
The statute is not a difficult one to accept.

342
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:41,130
It's really a question of how we have people access it.

343
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,592
I agree, Mr. Bellson.

344
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:46,234
I was going to suggest we move the question, though.

345
00:25:46,274 --> 00:25:47,474
Motion to move the question.

346
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,316
Roll call, please.

347
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:56,649
Yes.

348
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,672
Yes, six in the affirmative.

349
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,236
None of the negative one absent motion passes.

350
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:02,498
Thank you, madam.

351
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:02,999
Thank you, madam.

352
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,260
Thank you.

353
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,004
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

354
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:14,024
All those in favor?

355
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:14,665
Aye.

356
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:15,345

All those in favor?

363
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:25,714
Aye.

364
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:26,634

Motion for approval by Ms.

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,601
Disceri, seconded by Ms.

00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:35,321
DiBenedetto.

370
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:36,462
All those in favor?

371
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:37,163
Aye.

372
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:38,184
All those opposed?

373
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:40,498

Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,240
Vander Kloot.

377
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,141
All those in favor?

378
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:49,461
Aye.

379
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:50,641

00:26:51,382 --> 00:26:52,142
Motion passes.

Report of the secretary.

382
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:55,583
Are there any?

383
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:55,803
None.

384
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:57,023
There is none.

385
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,464
Report of committees.

386
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:00,767
None.

387
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,148
Community participation.

388
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,029
Madam Mayor, may I ask?

389
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:05,569
Ms.

390
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:05,969
Vander Kloof.

391
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:12,651
Does it make any sense to suspend the rules to pick up the adoption of Medford Conversations project?

392
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:18,293
We're actually waiting for one individual to come, and as soon as he arrives, I would love you to make that motion.

393
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:19,673
Oh, he's actually in the back of the room.

394
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:23,815
There's a motion for suspension of the rules to take the resolution under new business.

395
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:26,832
Resolution submitted by Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

396
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:34,356
The Medford School Committee support the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and collaboration about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond.

397
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:38,038
And there's actually a full resolution that's in your packet.

398
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,001
It was presented to the City Council last Tuesday evening and it passed seven to zero.

399
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,082
And if I could read the resolution.

400
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:54,227
Whereas the strength of our nation is derived from its history of diversity that has enriched our communities with a variety of cultures, faiths, traditions, and viewpoints.

401
00:27:55,047 --> 00:28:00,429
And whereas the City of Medford is a community that welcomes and values the varied racial and ethnic makeup of our residents.

402
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,092
And whereas the City of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups and newcomers as they pursue the American dream.

403
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:16,576
And whereas the City of Medford will work to model our city as a safe and welcoming place that equally encourages all to seek personal advancement and to reside in peaceful contentment in Medford.

404
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:27,362
Whereas the City of Medford rejects all words and acts of hate, indifference, and intolerance that undermine our neighborhoods, communities of faith, and our schools, and thwart the promise of equal justice.

405
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:36,627
And whereas our nation was founded on the fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection of law, equal opportunity, and to the enjoyment of civil and human rights.

406
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:45,972
Now, therefore, the City of Medford proudly supports the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and collaboration about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond.

407
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:53,136
And I believe we have Mr. D. O'Brien in the audience, and Reverend Wendy, would you like to speak on this resolution?

408
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:59,639
Reverend Wendy, your name and address for the record, please?

409
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:03,581
Reverend Wendy Miller-Olopade, 105 Brooks Street, Medford.

410
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:04,682
I'm the- Welcome.

411
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:05,662
Thank you.

412
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:06,583
Thank you so much.

413
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:12,006
I'm so delighted to be with you tonight on behalf of the Medford Conversations Project.

414
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:34,584
I'm the lead pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ, and I'm participating in the planning team of the Medford Conversations Project as a member of the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association and a member of Medford Health Matters, which reflects a little bit about the diversity of the bodies that are engaged in planning for that project.

415
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:40,408
So I'm here just to speak to what the project is and answer any questions.

416
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,909
We have others here if you have further questions.

417
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:52,735
Medford Conversations' mission is to include and actively engage a wide range, a multiplicity of voices in our community, and through those conversations,

418
00:29:53,215 --> 00:30:00,397
hope to encourage people to create and act on visions for a sustainable, just, and thriving Medford.

419
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:21,862
So out of a model based on the everyday democracy way of creating conversations across diverse networks in communities, we hope to bring people together to talk about what they care about, to make Medford a better place to be,

420
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:36,070
And we're actively seeking to bring people from across different cultures, races, religions, economic background, neighborhoods, generations.

421
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:45,557
So we're actively trying to get people into the room for our first conversation, which is in January, designed to discuss

422
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,811
Who Belongs?

423
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:52,174
It'll be a dialogue about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond.

424
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,276
So let me stop there and see if you have any questions.

425
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,277
I don't know if you've heard about this yet.

426
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:04,381
I have a little handout for you if you'd like to, it's just the invitation to the actual first event.

427
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:15,609
The intention is that the event, that the conversations project would be a model that we would continue to use to address different topics as time goes on.

428
00:31:17,023 --> 00:31:18,324
Thank you very much, Reverend Wendy.

429
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:23,387
Is there anyone else that would like to speak on this resolution before us this evening?

430
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:28,810
Good evening.

431
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,710
You name and address, please.

432
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,451
My name is Steve Schnapp.

433
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:34,093
The last name is spelled S-E-H-N-A-P-P.

434
00:31:34,473 --> 00:31:37,855
I live at 36 Hillside Ave, right up the street from the library.

435
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,636
I got involved in this project.

436
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:44,419
I'm retired, but I got involved in this project because I think it's particularly important

437
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:49,914
that folks across difference, as Reverend Wendy explained, engage with each other.

438
00:31:50,494 --> 00:32:06,120
And the only point I would like to add to what's been said already is, in addition to your support, we actually need your help in being able to attract folks who may not have what I would call a racial justice frame.

439
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:21,785
Folks who may be leery to participate because they don't want to get beat up or called a racist, or in some way feel bad about the particular views they may hold.

440
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:27,710
We really want to engage people across difference, and that is political difference and the way they see the world.

441
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:43,569
This conversation is an attempt to get to know people, for people to get to know each other, to build relationships, and therefore to begin to address the very important issues of race and diversity and ethnicity, et cetera, that are dividing us.

442
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,130
It's an attempt to get folks to talk to each other.

443
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,173
And we need your help to identify and help us bring those folks into these conversations.

444
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:59,448
We're asking that of all sorts of organizations across the city, individuals, political folks, but others as well.

445
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:02,955
So if there are folks that you can think of,

446
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:14,108
who may be civic-minded or not, but want to engage in conversations that may be difficult, but will be facilitated so that all voices can be heard and respected.

447
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:26,031
We really invite you to share those individuals with us or hand out literature that just tells about what this program is and this project.

448
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:26,872
Thank you.

449
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:27,832
Thank you very much, Mr. Schnepp.

450
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,132
Ms.

451
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:29,473
Stone.

452
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:32,315
Yes.

453
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:34,356
Yes.

454
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:36,858
Absolutely.

455
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:39,279
I can give you electronic versions of it.

456
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:42,702
Yes.

457
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:47,805
There is a desire for registration, but people can just show up as well to the opening thing.

458
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:57,132
I don't know how much time you want me to spend, but the design beyond the philosophy that this is a way

459
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:02,056
to help people to stay engaged in their civic connections.

460
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:21,713
It's a way to really make sure that we're still being a democracy and that people, so one of the things we didn't say specifically is that Steve and Jen Bailey actually are leading the team that is gonna do training, so our facilitators will be trained by Everyday Democracy

461
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:29,663
to be able to engage hot topics, if you will, some of those topics that we don't want to talk about over the Thanksgiving dinner table, right?

462
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:33,908
Hot topics that are hard to talk about when you have a difference of opinion.

463
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:36,391
We'll have trained facilitators who will

464
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:42,459
facilitate those conversations across difference, and it'll happen in small groups.

465
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:55,014
So there's a large opening event that will sort of set the stage and set expectations for what we hope to happen, and then there will be small groups of 10 to 12 persons who will gather together at their

466
00:34:55,466 --> 00:35:02,913
schedule with facilitators who will then dig deeper, listen to each other, and dig deeper on the topics.

467
00:35:03,814 --> 00:35:09,579
And so then we come back together for a fifth session on this particular topic.

468
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:16,345
So we're hopeful that those facilitators will allow then for the improved dialogue across difference.

469
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,875
High school age is appropriate.

470
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:22,356
We're still negotiating.

471
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:23,576
We're still in conversation.

472
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:29,958
We're learning how to do this as we're going along by the grace of the goodness of good people.

473
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,879
We are not confident yet.

474
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,480
Originally, we thought it would be

475
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,884
you know, kids and adults and elders all in one circle.

476
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:50,073
But we've just recently talked about recognizing that a room full of, you know, a couple of youth in a group with a lot of voices might be hard for them to be heard.

477
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:54,097
So we're still trying to figure out whether we might do some small groups just for them.

478
00:35:54,717 --> 00:36:01,340
My 16-year-old is here because this is a topic that we talked about at the city council meeting last week.

479
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:11,184
And I recognize that there was nobody in the room when we were talking about it, either of color or of difference or young people.

480
00:36:11,244 --> 00:36:20,168
And I asked them to come tonight to, you know, sort of just be in the room with me as we talked about this because, you know, we think that it's all okay.

481
00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:41,731
We want to believe that this is the kind of community that we are, and this is what we stand for, and yet young people, old people, people of color, people, Muslim people, we all know that we've struggled over the last year or so, and that there's an increase in fear and concern expressed by our community after the results of the election, frankly.

482
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:55,296
So yeah, I think it is appropriate for teenagers and we're trying to figure, we're working with Amie Saulnier, she's on the steering committee and she's working really hard to make sure that the kids at this school are engaged.

483
00:36:56,176 --> 00:37:00,838
I'm trying to convince Erin to be a facilitator actually, so now I'm going public with it.

484
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:09,722
That website from the home page, if you go to the bottom, there's a whole registration process there.

485
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:12,463
In fact, you can get the flyer from the website too.

486
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:13,664
medfordconversations.org.

487
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:15,184
medfordconversations.org.

488
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:16,185
Very good.

489
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:17,786
Thank you very much for being here tonight.

490
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:18,346
Thank you.

491
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:18,826
Thank you.

492
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:24,289
Is a motion on the floor for acceptance of the resolution by Ms.

493
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:24,929
Van de Kloot.

494
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,889
Is there a second?

495
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,030
Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

496
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:30,732
Mr. Benedetto.

497
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:55,738
It seems to me that our community has really, in general, in my understanding of it, meets a lot of these items listed as a resolution, whereas I think the program is wonderful, and I agree that it should be engaged by many of our community members.

498
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:03,832
so that way we can have straightforward, honest discussion about any issue that might be the topic at that time.

499
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,273
And I do encourage people to do that.

500
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:21,359
I just don't know why it goes from a method conversations to a resolution, because I really feel that our community is very open and welcoming already without putting it forward in this manner.

501
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,039
So I just didn't...

502
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:32,796
It's to provide a unified voice that we will not accept acts of hatred and inequality.

503
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:38,040
That's not who we are, that's not who we want to be, and that we all speak united on that topic.

504
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:44,945
I see that, but I feel like our community already does that in so many ways on a daily basis.

505
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:47,006
We see that a lot, but there are a lot that don't.

506
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:52,510
And to those out there, we're making a statement that it's important that we acknowledge that.

507
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,791
Mr. Superintendent?

508
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:55,231
Mr. Superintendent?

509
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:05,238
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, and Reverend, I think it's really important, given the climate that sometimes pervades our world,

510
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:12,654
that we reemphasize not only to ourselves as adults, but to the students, that this is important to us.

511
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:19,958
And when the adults make a motion of this type, you're sending a message to the young people who perhaps have not thought it through as much.

512
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:26,112
And it's important for us to be able to say this is something that the adults have taken an active stand on.

513
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:37,617
So that's another reason for doing it in a public body, and especially in a school system, where we have the care and responsibility of educating our young people about how to get along.

514
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,558
And we've talked a lot about social and emotional health.

515
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,939
We've talked a lot about some of the issues.

516
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:46,281
And I have to tell you, the academic issues will take care of themselves over the years.

517
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:49,102
The ones that won't are the social and emotional

518
00:39:50,222 --> 00:40:01,851
and the personal interactions of young people if we don't step up as role models, if we don't step up as voices to help them find voice as they grow up.

519
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:12,719
So to help them with their transition to adulthood, it's critical that we take visible stands on human issues, human rights, and human fairness.

520
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:17,023
I think we do.

521
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,443
I agree with you.

522
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:45,804
We have to be all listening along in any means that they can get.

523
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,324
So that was my concern.

524
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,106
I don't know if you could say this is something that we as a community have to do.

525
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:50,587
We as a community are responsible for each other's lives.

526
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,448
And when someone's business doesn't do well, I'm not going to be there.

527
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:09,566
This is our way of making a public statement that that is who we are.

528
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:10,506
Ms.

529
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:12,067
Van de Kloot.

530
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:21,110
And I understand, Erin, exactly what you're trying to say, that we've been a positive place and we want to keep on staying that way, and that's why we're going to go ahead and say this.

531
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:30,933
I have to tell you, and neither of these incidents happened inside or with anybody involved in Medford, but I have been shocked within the last two months of two very different incidents

532
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:39,521
that were so outrageous to me personally of discrimination and inappropriate hate.

533
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:42,985
And one was, you know, I went to a craft show.

534
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:47,830
And I don't want to go into it here, although if anybody wants to know, I'll talk to you personally about what happened.

535
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,313
and something else which happened with words that were totally inappropriate.

536
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:58,337
And somehow I feel that in the political climate that took place over the past year, it has unleashed a firestorm.

537
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:03,260
And so this is the appropriate time to go public and just to reaffirm our values.

538
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,330
Thank you, Ms.

539
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,090
Vanderpool.

540
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:09,972
And also, the superintendent and I are working on a PSA, trying to get the community involved.

541
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:12,053
So we'll probably be reaching out to Steve.

542
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:19,416
I think I sat at your table several months ago, and he did a great job facilitating that meeting.

543
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:28,579
And we'll be working probably with some in your group to try and put a PSA out that addresses some of these issues in a conversational forum of four people, maybe.

544
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,360
So we will be in touch with you in the very near future for that.

545
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:52,297
I think the other thing I want to share, I did this the other night at the council meeting and I won't go through the story again, but I think what's most important to me, particularly as a mother of a child who's not of the dominant culture, is that this model is designed to help us to listen to each other.

546
00:42:53,088 --> 00:43:00,354
And I spoke very passionately last Tuesday night at this microphone about the issue.

547
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:03,998
It was a much more heated dialogue then than it is tonight.

548
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:16,849
And I received hate mail at the church two days ago, someone calling me a demon and that I had an inappropriate agenda.

549
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,932
that I had exploited my child.

550
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:29,338
And so I share that with you to say that while we generally feel as though we're doing a really great job,

551
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:34,707
And we are doing a great job, and there's still so much work to be done.

552
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:43,509
We have so far to go as a society to really, really love one another in the way that we have in our souls.

553
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:48,350
You know, our guts feel that, and yet we are blinded by our experience.

554
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:55,892
And so we have, you know, this conversation, making a public statement is just another way.

555
00:43:56,872 --> 00:44:05,739
you know, at the Arabic club after the hijab day situation, and watch those children cry because their experience was being denied.

556
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:09,462
So we're doing a great job, and we have more work to do.

557
00:44:09,562 --> 00:44:13,825
So thank you for your time and your attention and your commitment.

558
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:14,946
Thank you very much.

559
00:44:15,907 --> 00:44:19,129
On the motion of approval by Ms.

560
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:21,771
Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry, roll call vote, please.

561
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,813
Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, one absent.

562
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:32,114
The resolution passes.

563
00:44:35,055 --> 00:44:35,235
Ms.

564
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:35,795
Van de Kloot?

565
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,576
Shout out to my friend, Aaron, over there.

566
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:40,597
All right.

567
00:44:42,377 --> 00:44:43,298
AJ, as he's known.

568
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:54,497
Yes, absolutely.

569
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:55,318
Come forward, please.

570
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:57,178
How are you?

571
00:44:57,498 --> 00:44:57,798
I'm good.

572
00:44:57,838 --> 00:44:58,238
How are you?

573
00:44:58,298 --> 00:44:58,818
Good, thanks.

574
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:00,179
Should I say my address?

575
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:00,719
Your name, please.

576
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:01,019
Yes.

577
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:01,439
All right.

578
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:02,719
So I'm Aaron J. Olopade.

579
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:03,999
I live on 105 Brook Street.

580
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:04,860
You can stand tall.

581
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,120
Oh, OK.

582
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,980
Stand tall.

583
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:12,261
So I totally understand what you're saying about how you think that Medford's a great place and how we are doing what we're supposed to be doing.

584
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:15,222
I think so, because I came from a place where I didn't really think that.

585
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:17,182
And I thought that we were very undiverse.

586
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,083
And so me coming here when I was

587
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:24,526
I think 13, it was kind of interesting because I was so surprised at how diverse I felt.

588
00:45:25,146 --> 00:45:29,329
But it isn't a matter of how much we're doing, it's a matter of how much we can do more.

589
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:33,631
So I think that because we might, let's say we're doing 80%, I think we can do 90%, 100%.

590
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:40,215
I think we can do so much more that it will be like a model for other towns.

591
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:41,496
So I think that

592
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:46,359
I don't understand exactly what's happening, meaning I don't understand what a resolute is, but I do know.

593
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,123
I kind of get it, but I do know that it is something that's really important to me.

594
00:45:50,503 --> 00:45:54,606
It's important to a lot of kids in my school, and it's important to my mom and other adults in the community.

595
00:45:55,046 --> 00:46:01,912
So I think that it might not be as important as some people will believe, but I think it's important to a lot of other people.

596
00:46:02,452 --> 00:46:03,834
Thank you very much for coming tonight.

597
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:04,834
I'm sure mom's proud.

598
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:05,255
Thank you.

599
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:05,815
Thank you.

600
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,672
We're passing along a signature sheet, if you could sign it.

601
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:14,796
It will be posted in City Hall, and we'll send a copy up to the school department as well.

602
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:15,817
Thank you very much.

603
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,961
On the motion to revert to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

604
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,242
All those opposed?

605
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:23,743
Motion passes.

606
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,545
Community participation.

607
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:27,728
I see none.

608
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:29,670
Report of superintendent.

609
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,494
Number one, update report on science program initiatives.

610
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:33,395
Mr. Superintendent.

611
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:38,421
Madam members of the committee, Baco Sierra is unable to be with us this evening.

612
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:42,547
He's not feeling well, but we have a terrific substitute, our deputy superintendent.

613
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:47,711
Just don't ask me any questions.

614
00:46:47,912 --> 00:46:54,797
Again, Rocco's home with the flu and he prepared this report for you earlier last week.

615
00:46:56,078 --> 00:47:09,449
As you can see from the report, under the leadership of Rocco Sieri, Director of Science, he's been very proactive in seeking out opportunities for our students to experience real science in a variety of ways.

616
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:18,641
And as a result of these efforts, we're pleased to report that this year there are a variety of grants and programs that will benefit the students in all grade levels.

617
00:47:19,781 --> 00:47:28,087
The report that you got outlines the different grants and programs that are currently in progress and in also planning stages.

618
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:36,912
And again, you can see we have many connections with universities, with organizations that are there to promote science.

619
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:40,314
And as a result, our students and our teachers are benefiting.

620
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:46,838
Without reading every project, you can see that a lot of these focus on real life type science activities.

621
00:47:47,818 --> 00:47:53,682
And again, I think that Mr. Ceri has done a tremendous job seeking out opportunities for our students to

622
00:47:54,551 --> 00:48:02,294
enjoy these engaging activities, and also for the teachers to obtain professional development as a result of the grants.

623
00:48:02,854 --> 00:48:07,096
So some of the projects, again, the elementary level, there's a lot going on.

624
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:08,577
There's a grant

625
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:13,673
to support river herring migration, education, and outreach.

626
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:17,994
The middle school level, there's more work being done on environmental science.

627
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:24,337
And you will note that Mr. Cieri was asked to serve on the advisory board of this project.

628
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:31,320
And he's entitled to an honorarium, which he's going to donate to support the Medford Science facilities.

629
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,342
And at the high school level, there are other activities going on through different groups.

630
00:48:38,303 --> 00:48:38,623
Again,

631
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:41,382
There are a lot of opportunities.

632
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,043
And we even have what we call vertical team projects.

633
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:50,144
And that means that teachers across grade levels, science teachers, are collaborating.

634
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:53,084
So again, a lot going on in the world of science.

635
00:48:53,124 --> 00:48:59,205
He just wanted you to know all of the different activities that it does span the grade levels.

636
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:00,306
It's not just high school.

637
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:01,146
It is K through 12.

638
00:49:01,866 --> 00:49:04,806
And students really enjoy this real life science.

639
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:08,347
So I hope he gets better soon so we can go back and do some more work.

640
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,803
Madam Mayor, thank you, Beverly.

641
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:17,925
I called Mr. Cieri today, and unfortunately, he didn't get back to me, and now I know why.

642
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:26,307
Because I wanted to let him know that also, in addition to that, the Medford Educational Foundation just approved our grants and our grant cycle.

643
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:37,811
One of them is for materials for Medford's youngest learners in the kindergarten, for owl pellets across the kindergartens, across the city of Medford in every school.

644
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:45,434
Anybody hasn't done an owl pellet, you take the pellet apart, and the kids find the things that the owl has eaten, and it's all very exciting.

645
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:50,797
And we've also approved one at the high school level, the remotely operated underwater vehicle.

646
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:57,280
So those are two things that will be added to the list, and we've actually got one more that we're going to be talking to Mr. Cieri about.

647
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,921
So he better get back here quickly, right?

648
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,221
Well, you know, let him recover.

649
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,462
No time for illness.

650
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:03,363
Mr. Cieri.

651
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:09,318
Madam Mayor, through you to Mrs. Nelson and Roy, we get a kick out of this.

652
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:11,499
It's great to see the report on the herring run.

653
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:23,226
Roy and I, in our younger days, April vacations, we would run over to the Army Navy store and get the triple hooks and bring a basket full of herring home for the family garden every year.

654
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,709
But unfortunately, it's no longer possible as they're an endangered species.

655
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:33,252
But it's great to see that our kids in the middle schools and high schools are interacting each year when they do the fish count.

656
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:36,419
at the Mystic River, at the Mystic Lakes.

657
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:44,405
And it's great, and I wish Mr. Cieri and his cohorts and kids best of luck in their counts this spring.

658
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:47,587
It may be an enjoyable and memorable experience for them.

659
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,930
And we appreciate all that he has been doing for our science department.

660
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,711
And I would hope that you would pass that along.

661
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:53,112
I will.

662
00:50:55,373 --> 00:50:55,614
Ms.

663
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:56,214
Mustone.

664
00:50:58,195 --> 00:50:59,176
Thank you for that report.

665
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,158
In October, we met

666
00:51:02,198 --> 00:51:10,443
about the MCAS results and Mr. Cieri had talked about having a committee to look into new curriculum for this coming September.

667
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:15,306
I was wondering if a committee has been formed or people have been invited about a committee meeting.

668
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:18,488
Do you know if that's in the plans?

669
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:25,252
I was hoping Mr. Cieri would be here tonight because when we met, it was October, the goal was to have the first committee meeting in January.

670
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:30,930
and then to have a curriculum picked by September, and now it's already December 5th, so I don't know if anyone's been invited.

671
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:52,637
I think what is happening first is that we have the new science frameworks, so we really have to establish what, what we do as a district is we look at the frameworks when they come out, and then we look at what we already have in place for curriculum, and then we make adjustments, so I think we're still in the process, and maybe Dr. Riccadeli, who,

672
00:51:53,197 --> 00:52:01,960
you know, works with Mr. Ceri on curriculum can, I don't know if she has anything else to add, but I believe they're probably still in that process.

673
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,701
You don't want to select materials before you really have your curriculum.

674
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:09,522
We could request as well tonight if you'd like to get a response from Mr. Ceri.

675
00:52:09,622 --> 00:52:11,462
Yes, because I'm not looking to pick the curriculum.

676
00:52:11,482 --> 00:52:17,764
I'm looking just to see if people were invited to have a committee meeting to look at curriculums that are options out there on the market for offering books.

677
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:20,885
But the, the problem is that these are brand new.

678
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:27,358
and that oftentimes when we jump very quickly into something in terms of material, we make mistakes.

679
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:31,424
We need to see what companies will start to come out with more materials.

680
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:33,146
This happened with mathematics.

681
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:34,648
It happens with English language arts.

682
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:42,934
So again, you need to really give the new curriculum frameworks time to be digested by everyone.

683
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,615
And then these companies are going to come out.

684
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:48,958
You don't want to buy something that's the first thing on the market that may not be the best.

685
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:50,679
And we don't want to get burned by that.

686
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:51,099
Right.

687
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:56,682
But I'm looking at, so I got Collins Roberts school report card today in his folder for fifth grade.

688
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:58,823
So English, we're pretty decent.

689
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,625
We're 5% off from the state average math where,

690
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:03,969
11% off from the state average.

691
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:05,189
Science, we're 14%.

692
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,691
And that's, I thought I was pretty vocal in that October meeting.

693
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:19,175
I know we're not going to jump in and buy a curriculum, but I don't even, I mean the, I just wondering if we are talking to teachers because that right people, I was told that teachers were the ones who go on the committee.

694
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:19,836
That's right.

695
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:23,697
And so they haven't even been asked to be part of this committee.

696
00:53:23,818 --> 00:53:31,201
And I thought, and I wish I took better notes that I thought we had decided on a January committee date and now it's December 5th.

697
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:34,566
And I'm just wondering if the ball got rolling.

698
00:53:34,606 --> 00:53:35,847
Let me check with him when he gets back.

699
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:36,848
That'd be great back to you.

700
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:37,108
Okay.

701
00:53:37,168 --> 00:53:40,430
Thank you.

702
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,972
So do I have to make a motion to make that happen?

703
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:45,453
Great.

704
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:46,453
That's the motion.

705
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:47,614
Second the motion.

706
00:53:47,634 --> 00:53:48,194
Thank you.

707
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:49,295
Mr. Benedetto.

708
00:53:49,315 --> 00:53:49,975
All those in favor.

709
00:53:50,215 --> 00:53:51,096
All those opposed.

710
00:53:51,116 --> 00:53:51,956
The motion is granted.

711
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:56,279
Is there a motion to receive and place on file the science program initiative?

712
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,079
Did you want to speak on it?

713
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:57,460
I guess so.

714
00:53:58,718 --> 00:54:00,580
Oh, just one comment.

715
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,945
So just want to remind you that on the 14th, you've all been invited to the science museum.

716
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:27,201
If you haven't got the thing on the, uh, the global scholars program, and that's going to intersect with the Bloomberg gift to the science museum on science innovation and innovation around the world, how our middle school students are talking to students from around the world on scientific issues like the digital environment, water,

717
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:28,569
things of that type.

718
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:35,172
So you're invited to participate and to watch and that's on the 14th and we'll reemphasize that to you.

719
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:39,914
That's another aspect of how, you know, science gets integrated into a lot of other activities as well.

720
00:54:40,854 --> 00:54:41,214
Thank you.

721
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:44,696
Mr. Cadelli.

722
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:57,381
So, so I did extend that invitation to you and I know at least one of you, uh, before I left, um, had some questions about parking and as I hope to have those questions answered for you tomorrow,

723
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,633
I do need to get the answers through the Museum of Science and also our Global Scholar Partner.

724
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:09,557
So again, this program is designed to enhance the grade seven social studies and science curricula.

725
00:55:11,598 --> 00:55:17,461
So we really hope if you're able to attend, you'll be able to participate with us on the 14th, which is next Wednesday.

726
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:18,842
Thank you very much.

727
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:22,404
On the motion to receive and place this report on file, adopted by Ms.

728
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,145
Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

729
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:24,965
All those in favor?

730
00:55:24,985 --> 00:55:25,045
Aye.

731
00:55:25,706 --> 00:55:26,346
All those opposed?

732
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:27,447
Motion is granted.

733
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,235
Item two, report on credit recovery.

734
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:34,245
Madam Mayor, making a second appearance on credit recovery.

735
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:35,989
I might come back for a third later.

736
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,584
Okay, we're kind of excited about this.

737
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:48,126
Credit recovery, as you know, for many years has been needed by our students who want to graduate on time, who want to get promoted to the next grade.

738
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:50,227
It's always been an option.

739
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:56,369
The guidance departments work very hard with students to find them places to make up lost credit.

740
00:55:56,409 --> 00:56:01,650
Now, oftentimes, a student can double up on a course if they have the time in their schedule.

741
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,491
They can retake a course that they perhaps have failed.

742
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:06,404
Oftentimes, it's not an option.

743
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,106
They just have too full a program.

744
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:14,836
So we have to have something in place so they can do this credit recovery outside of the regular school schedule.

745
00:56:15,817 --> 00:56:19,863
So to date, our students have been referred

746
00:56:20,518 --> 00:56:22,740
for credit recovery to outside sources.

747
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,542
Many of them go over to Somerville.

748
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:38,515
Somerville had a credit recovery program using an online program, online courses from Edgenuity, and others have been going to online, Brigham Young University.

749
00:56:39,236 --> 00:56:42,919
And again, this is all pretty much directed by the guidance department.

750
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:43,560
These were the two

751
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,662
viable places where they could pick up the credit.

752
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:48,943
There are some problems with that.

753
00:56:49,443 --> 00:56:55,267
We know that when they go outside and they take these courses that we're not sure the content of the courses.

754
00:56:55,347 --> 00:56:58,469
Are they really a match for what we want our students to learn?

755
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:02,491
And of course, some of these courses are very costly to students.

756
00:57:03,072 --> 00:57:04,953
So we've been working for the past few months.

757
00:57:06,242 --> 00:57:18,113
administration, Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, and Curtis Tufts, along with guidance, to work out a solution to credit recovery that we can have as our own homegrown.

758
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:29,763
And again, we feel that having this credit recovery, we'll be able to monitor our students' progress to really take a look and make sure that they are making up what they need to make up for content.

759
00:57:31,008 --> 00:57:35,632
We also know that the district, over the past few years, we're promoting online learning.

760
00:57:36,173 --> 00:57:46,582
Online learning is the wave of the future, and I think we all feel very strongly that every student should have an online course in high school, because in college, that's what they're doing.

761
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:50,745
You can do whole MBA programs and doctoral programs online today.

762
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:56,831
So it's really important that students are familiar with these particular online offerings.

763
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:05,610
This year at summer school, we piloted online science makeup courses using the product Edmentum.

764
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,871
Now, we have looked at Ingenuity.

765
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:10,912
The curriculum directors look at these products.

766
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:12,132
They look at the courses.

767
00:58:12,712 --> 00:58:14,013
They see if they're a match.

768
00:58:14,713 --> 00:58:17,714
And they felt that Ingenuity wasn't a great match.

769
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:22,676
And so they went and took a look at Edmentum, which is another online offering.

770
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:25,077
And tweaking that a little bit,

771
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:26,982
they thought that was a better product.

772
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:38,131
So this summer, again, Mr. Cieri looked at the science offerings and he tweaked them a little bit and our students at summer school took all their science makeup courses online.

773
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,052
It worked out very well.

774
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:40,753
There were a lot of benefits.

775
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:48,760
So for example, when summer school ends on a certain date, these students, if they weren't quite finished with the course, could continue on until they finished.

776
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,603
So there are a lot of positives with using the online learning.

777
00:58:53,557 --> 00:59:04,345
So what we have done over the past few months is we've developed a protocol for credit recovery, because we want our students to stay with us as they make their credits up.

778
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:09,889
And the terms of what we feel will work are on the next page of the report.

779
00:59:10,669 --> 00:59:21,457
We want all credit recovery courses taken through the Medford Public Schools, and that no outside district programs will be accepted for credit recovery.

780
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:24,304
We want to keep the cost reasonable.

781
00:59:24,344 --> 00:59:25,445
Now, we looked at the cost.

782
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:28,267
Somerville charged $125.

783
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:31,029
Brigham Young University, I think, charged up to $350.

784
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,972
So we wanted to keep it at the lower end.

785
00:59:34,452 --> 00:59:39,857
So we're going to, you know, we're thinking $125 is fair to everyone.

786
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,479
Of course, if there's some hardship, we'll consider that.

787
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,742
Students requesting recovery.

788
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:49,645
There's a form that's been actually, the guidance is used for.

789
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:53,459
several years that they have to get approval, they just can't go on their own.

790
00:59:54,479 --> 01:00:03,284
Online courses must have the endorsement of the Director of Curriculum and Instruction, Dr. Riccadeli, working with the curriculum directors, looks over all these courses.

791
01:00:03,364 --> 01:00:07,726
Now, we're not happy with all of them, so we're going to take some of them off the table for the time being.

792
01:00:08,226 --> 01:00:11,388
I know that Mrs. Joy feels Algebra I and Geometry

793
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:24,831
through Edmentum isn't quite what it should be, so we will again offer those as credit recovery in another way for students until we can modify what's online to meet our standards.

794
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:27,812
So we're not just putting this product out and saying this is it.

795
01:00:28,232 --> 01:00:34,415
Like Ingenuity in Somerville, they just put it out there and our kids were taking this and again, it wasn't a great match with the curriculum.

796
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:39,389
The student liaisons, we want the students to be carefully monitored.

797
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:48,852
And by the way, with this product in Mentum, it actually, you can see how many times a student goes online and actually engages in the learning.

798
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:53,913
So we have the assistant principals, the guidance people that are monitoring this.

799
01:00:54,393 --> 01:01:00,995
We're gonna set up some professional development for them in January so that they know what the kids are supposed to be doing.

800
01:01:01,636 --> 01:01:02,616
And that will take place.

801
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:06,388
We're currently making those deadlines, those arrangements.

802
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:15,055
And then our director of instructional technology is going to maintain all records related to the use of the online courses.

803
01:01:15,595 --> 01:01:17,697
There is a cost to the online courses.

804
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:31,067
Uh, right now we have a contract where we can have 500 courses for about $5,000, but we will recoup some of that through the tuition, both in summer school as well as the credit recovery.

805
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:32,762
So that's our plan.

806
01:01:32,802 --> 01:01:34,564
We feel that we've made a lot of progress.

807
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:36,106
We've had a number of meetings on this.

808
01:01:36,646 --> 01:01:41,332
We didn't like the fact our kids were going outside and we had no idea how that was going.

809
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:44,375
They'd just come back and they'd say, this is my credit.

810
01:01:44,936 --> 01:01:46,197
We feel this is a better way to go.

811
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:50,642
This would be just for juniors and seniors right now because we really need to work out

812
01:01:51,356 --> 01:02:00,638
the Algebra I and the Geometry, which the underclassmen tend to need, but we will have something up and running for them, probably a hybrid of this online program.

813
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:03,819
So that's where we are, and I'd be happy to take any of your questions.

814
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:06,460
Is it a pass-fail grade?

815
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,941
I believe it's a grade, but I believe there's a certain grade they have to attain in order for it to count.

816
01:02:11,381 --> 01:02:15,502
I don't know specifically what that is, but I would guess it would be maybe a C or a C minus.

817
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:17,063
But you could get an A in the class.

818
01:02:21,194 --> 01:02:27,318
So, Beverly, would these be courses that a student is doing at home or during school time?

819
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:27,838
Could be both.

820
01:02:28,419 --> 01:02:34,263
You know, the library, we have a lot of kids that go to the library during the school day if they have a study and they could be working on it there.

821
01:02:34,923 --> 01:02:37,645
And certainly, you know, a lot of it could be done on their own.

822
01:02:38,065 --> 01:02:42,008
And this is the benefit of it too, is that they can do it outside the regular school hours.

823
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:44,330
And again, we can keep track because

824
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:52,647
this particular product does allow the person overseeing this to see if that student's really doing this work.

825
01:02:54,202 --> 01:03:00,165
If I can continue, does this particular product allow for a different usage?

826
01:03:00,505 --> 01:03:13,332
Say a student didn't fail the course but they got a D and now they're a senior and they're realizing that that D is really going to hurt them or that they really need the content of that course.

827
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:19,835
Is there a way to use it as a review or possibly to improve their grade?

828
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,788
As we go along with this, I think it has a lot of uses.

829
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:38,522
One of the things we can do in that particular student's case where they may have some of the content of the course but maybe have missed certain concepts, we can pull out modules from the course of the reinforcement that they need.

830
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:43,025
By the way, this particular product has many, many different courses in it.

831
01:03:43,566 --> 01:03:47,168
Some of them are great courses that can be used at middle school, such as study skills.

832
01:03:47,749 --> 01:04:03,280
So the actual product itself—but to answer your question, yes, you could take a student who didn't pass the credit recovery course, and you could give them those portions of it to redo, to retake, to get them up to the level they need to be.

833
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,001
It has the capacity to do that.

834
01:04:06,558 --> 01:04:09,643
the option, we also could use the courses in different ways as well.

835
01:04:09,663 --> 01:04:09,923
Oh, yes.

836
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:12,367
We can mod, just like we did with the science this summer.

837
01:04:12,828 --> 01:04:15,292
You know, actually we hadn't purchased it at this point.

838
01:04:15,312 --> 01:04:16,634
They allowed us to pilot it.

839
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:27,057
And so Mr. Cieri said, OK, this is a good, solid course, but the students coming to summer school have missed more of these concepts than others.

840
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:31,381
And so he basically, of course, summer school is abbreviated to a period of time.

841
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:36,484
So he basically pulled out the modules out of the course that he felt

842
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:40,607
were most specific to what these kids needed for remediation.

843
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:41,927
Yes, you can modify.

844
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:46,529
Once you purchase the course, it's not that you can't do what you need.

845
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:47,870
And how much does it cost, too?

846
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:55,854
We had a contract of 500 courses, which will take us through September 1st for about $5,000, $5,500.

847
01:04:56,714 --> 01:05:04,138
And the other question I have, the only thing that makes me uncomfortable in the protocol you've put forth is the absolute

848
01:05:04,598 --> 01:05:08,460
no outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery.

849
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:15,763
My preference actually would be no outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by

850
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:19,270
you know, the assistant superintendent or something.

851
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,971
We could do that.

852
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:24,656
The reason for that is because I think that they're always, um, that you can't foresee everything.

853
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:27,278
And there might be a reason why it makes sense.

854
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:36,688
And, um, if we're going to adopt this as a policy, my preference is, um, for oversight and for the unexpected.

855
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,292
So I would move if it's, um,

856
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:53,812
acceptable—will be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by—and you can decide whether it's the assistant superintendent, the superintendent, the department head, whatever.

857
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:59,693
this, what we were hoping tonight is just to put the protocol in place and we can add that language to it.

858
01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:07,240
And then as we work through it, then we can see if there are any problems and we can ask the committee to vote it in as a policy.

859
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,405
But right now we were just talking about getting it going as a systematic protocol.

860
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:14,427
So we can add that to it because, um,

861
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:23,491
The benefit to it, you know, if you have a student who goes away for the summer and yet needs, wants to make a course up, you know, they couldn't do it here.

862
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:24,992
They could online.

863
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:26,753
And that's another plus with this.

864
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,134
So, Oh, I think there's lots and lots of pluses.

865
01:06:29,214 --> 01:06:30,395
I just want, we can add that in.

866
01:06:30,415 --> 01:06:31,055
We'll add that in.

867
01:06:31,275 --> 01:06:31,555
Okay.

868
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:40,639
So you want it unless approved by the, um, you pick, you can decide who did the guidance, the guidance director of guidance, director of guidance.

869
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:40,980
That's good.

870
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:41,560
That sounds good.

871
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:45,684
Motion to accept the report as amended, offered by Ms.

872
01:06:45,704 --> 01:06:46,184
Van de Kloot.

873
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:47,325
Is there a second on the floor?

874
01:06:47,345 --> 01:06:47,826
Second.

875
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,708
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

876
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:50,929
All those in favor?

877
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:51,650
Aye.

878
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:52,451
All those opposed?

879
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:53,211
Motion passes.

880
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:55,368
Comment, Ms.

881
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:56,369
DeVeneda?

882
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:58,410
I'm really happy to see this, Beverly.

883
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:02,932
I know that I've talked about this for a long time and having options for children.

884
01:07:04,213 --> 01:07:13,478
I also want to look at this for children that might be having some issues that they couldn't feel comfortable attending school and how we can help them.

885
01:07:13,918 --> 01:07:23,644
So this, I think, is the first step for helping children that are really having a difficult time walking into the building and how we can possibly build on this.

886
01:07:24,544 --> 01:07:39,279
So that way all our children have the right to still be able to, whether it's a physical or emotional, any type of issue that they can't get to school, that we could use more and more of this to make sure that we're addressing those needs.

887
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:41,274
I think this is a big step.

888
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:50,022
It's also helpful for the student who is really trying during the school day, just can't get there and needs that extra support to get there.

889
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:53,685
And so again, it has multiple pluses to it.

890
01:07:54,066 --> 01:07:54,426
I agree.

891
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:55,487
I'm really happy.

892
01:07:55,527 --> 01:07:56,508
Thank you for the work on this.

893
01:07:56,908 --> 01:07:57,329
Thank you.

894
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:03,294
Item three, report on Michigan model health education program.

895
01:08:04,709 --> 01:08:14,342
And now the members of the committee will call upon our assistant superintendent and our supervisor of physical education and health to inform you about this progress.

896
01:08:15,423 --> 01:08:15,924
Good evening.

897
01:08:16,821 --> 01:08:29,849
Medford Public Schools has adopted the nationally recognized Michigan Model for Health Curriculum, which is a comprehensive skills-based health curriculum that is research-based and aligned to national standards.

898
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:42,778
The Michigan Model Health Curriculum is recognized by the Collaborative for Academic and Social and Emotional Learning and the National Registry for Evidence-Based Programs and Practices.

899
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:54,623
This comprehensive curriculum has units of instruction focusing on social emotional health issues and other areas we have identified as high needs areas for our students.

900
01:08:56,084 --> 01:09:06,774
So the middle and the high school as you know by now have already adopted and implemented the Michigan model and so we're happy now that the elementary schools are now a part of this.

901
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:21,491
They are covering social-emotional units in grades K-5, and these units include understanding your feelings, problem-solving, decision-making, communication skills, conflict resolution, and anger management.

902
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:30,460
Adoption of the Michigan model at the elementary level provides consistency and articulation of the K-12 health curriculum.

903
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:39,187
And in addition, the Michigan Model Curriculum for Metro Public Schools also presents the DARE program for our fifth grade students.

904
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:42,510
This is something that has been in effect for many years.

905
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:51,317
In September, we had a training for our elementary teachers led by Pat Degon of Michigan Model.

906
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:54,840
Rachel Perry, our supervisor of health,

907
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,803
a physical education, I should say, has been on board since the very beginning with Michigan Model.

908
01:10:00,903 --> 01:10:06,226
She has been ordering all of our materials and our supplies and overseeing all the pre-tests.

909
01:10:06,946 --> 01:10:10,808
She's created Google Sheets for our elementary staff so that they can

910
01:10:11,447 --> 01:10:17,010
fill in their pre-test grades, and then at the end of the school year, we can look at the post-test grades.

911
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:35,300
So, just recently, all of our K-5 teachers, well, I shouldn't say K-5, it's grades two to five teachers, submitted their pre-test grades, and I'm gonna let Rachel talk to you a little bit about the average of the grades, and then how they implemented was in effect for the middle and the high school as well.

912
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:35,920
Rachel?

913
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,561
Thank you.

914
01:10:37,721 --> 01:10:40,683
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

915
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:44,332
just want to talk a little bit about the history of our health program in the city.

916
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:59,657
For years we had been using second step health curriculum throughout the district and many teachers and administrators have concluded that second step was developmentally appropriate, but it was not reaching the health issues and concerns of today's adolescents.

917
01:11:00,817 --> 01:11:07,939
So therefore we started to pilot the health curriculum, the Michigan model health curriculum in 2013 and we started that at the high school.

918
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,640
Then we moved to the middle school,

919
01:11:10,043 --> 01:11:12,103
and now finally down at the elementary school.

920
01:11:12,824 --> 01:11:14,464
At the high school, we're in our fourth year.

921
01:11:15,024 --> 01:11:16,724
In the middle school, it's our third year.

922
01:11:17,084 --> 01:11:20,625
In elementary, it's our first year after one year of piloting the program.

923
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:27,406
What we've done is we've been assessing at the elementary school.

924
01:11:27,506 --> 01:11:31,107
So the pretest numbers for the grade levels for two to five are listed.

925
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,167
For grade two, the average was 78%.

926
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:34,247
Grade three is 79%.

927
01:11:34,847 --> 01:11:35,267
Grade four,

928
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:45,120
74%, grade five 76%, with the all grade average of 77%.

929
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,402
Our hope is that we improve these scores by the end of the school year.

930
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:54,944
What I've done is I have purchased the curriculum for all of the elementary schools.

931
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:57,645
Those were brought out to the elementary schools over the summer.

932
01:11:58,065 --> 01:12:02,607
I've also shared all of the PowerPoints, all of the worksheets,

933
01:12:03,064 --> 01:12:10,616
on a Google Drive so that our teachers can actually go right onto their computers to get all of these things instead of using a disk or going to the curriculum binder.

934
01:12:10,937 --> 01:12:13,301
So they have options to use either or.

935
01:12:14,483 --> 01:12:14,904
Very good.

936
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:15,444
Thank you.

937
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,528
Are there any questions?

938
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:31,547
So as a mother of a 6th and 8th grade girl and reading a lot of Catholic mom blogs, sexting is a concern.

939
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:40,534
And out of curiosity, I went on and I couldn't find a policy on sexting at the high school or the middle schools.

940
01:12:41,015 --> 01:12:44,358
So I don't know if it's addressed in the Michigan model, if it's a chapter.

941
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,540
It is addressed in the high school portion.

942
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:47,940
Okay.

943
01:12:47,981 --> 01:12:48,641
Not middle school.

944
01:12:48,821 --> 01:12:49,641
Not in middle school.

945
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:50,201
Okay.

946
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:54,022
Is that something that you hear about at the middle school?

947
01:12:54,042 --> 01:13:01,603
I haven't heard it firsthand yet, but my daughters just might not be telling me, but is that something, a policy that we should be ahead of it?

948
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:05,423
If I mean, I read more and more incidents across the country.

949
01:13:05,443 --> 01:13:08,864
Um, if it's a policy that we should work on.

950
01:13:10,064 --> 01:13:11,445
So let me try and answer it this way.

951
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:14,145
Um, a couple of weeks ago we gave you a,

952
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,363
draft of a reasonable use policy with regard to technology.

953
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:32,673
We pulled it off the table because there was some information that came to us from the ACLU and some other people that we wanted to review to ensure that we didn't miss anything and that we had it properly looked at legally.

954
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:37,277
We can control how devices are used in the school.

955
01:13:38,098 --> 01:13:46,222
We can't control what people do on their own, you know, privately as long as it doesn't affect or harass other students or result in bullying.

956
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:52,644
But certainly the curriculum can talk about these things in the communication and the hostility.

957
01:13:53,125 --> 01:14:00,888
And also the community conversations issue, you know, really speaks to this about people saying things, whether it's about sex or it's about hate or other forms of

958
01:14:01,405 --> 01:14:02,686
inappropriate conversation.

959
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:30,121
So I think it will all come to play through the curriculum, but I think at the same token, you know, our reasonable use policy, when we reemerge it, possibly as early as next meeting, I just want to make sure that it's right, we've vetted it with enough legal, and maybe the first of the year if we want to take a little bit more time, we'll speak to the issue of use of devices in schools and, you know, suggestions as to what young people should not be doing with their devices.

960
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:37,899
Right, I guess I was thinking more if it happens at the middle school or high school, is there a protocol for teachers, right?

961
01:14:37,919 --> 01:14:47,045
If a teacher here, if a student confides in the teacher and the teacher goes to the school psychologist, like, is there a step-by-step plan?

962
01:14:47,085 --> 01:14:52,149
Well, there shouldn't be any use of that device for that purpose during the school day in the school setting.

963
01:14:52,549 --> 01:14:53,509
But it does happen.

964
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:57,352
But that in of itself would be a violation of the reasonable use policy.

965
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:01,925
So that should be forbidden for use during the day of anything like that.

966
01:15:02,566 --> 01:15:09,621
So if it happens outside, you know, it's kind of hard to police that unless it results in some form of bullying or inappropriate harassment.

967
01:15:10,188 --> 01:15:11,909
This doesn't make me feel better.

968
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,551
No, but you have to be real about it.

969
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:23,297
I mean, we don't control what people do on the street outside of us, except if we are told that it affects how one student interacts with another.

970
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:26,399
As far as the education side, we can bring that up through the curriculum.

971
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:29,721
But it would affect inside the schools if it were happening.

972
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:30,722
If it were happening.

973
01:15:30,742 --> 01:15:31,002
Correct.

974
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:33,460
Ms.

975
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,061
Van de Kloot.

976
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:45,511
I think that I disagree with you that we don't, I mean, we don't have any way to control it, but we certainly have a way or should think about how are we introducing to students

977
01:15:46,698 --> 01:15:52,660
this issue of sexting and what the long-term and short-term ramifications are.

978
01:15:53,360 --> 01:16:02,702
I believe it was in that very article that you gave us last week, that excellent article that you gave us in our last folder, which talked about the uptick.

979
01:16:03,343 --> 01:16:04,283
And it isn't

980
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:06,684
high school students.

981
01:16:07,164 --> 01:16:09,066
It is the, you know, starting at middle school.

982
01:16:09,086 --> 01:16:11,307
So I think it's a very important conversation to have.

983
01:16:12,028 --> 01:16:22,895
One of the things that I found on the internet just this past week is whatever is, you know, someone had 1 times 9 equals 7, 2 times 9 equals 18, 3 times 9 equals 27, and it went on.

984
01:16:23,596 --> 01:16:27,038
And then said, and the teacher put it on a blackboard.

985
01:16:27,638 --> 01:16:31,801
And right away the kids started going, the teacher, you made a mistake, you made a mistake.

986
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:33,783
And even though all the other ones were right,

987
01:16:34,877 --> 01:16:37,258
The only one that they talked about was the wrong one.

988
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:43,182
And when you do something wrong, I mean, it was such an easy, how that can follow you, that's the thing that people see.

989
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:49,426
And I thought it was such a concrete example that should be presented to kids about saying, you know, this is the problem.

990
01:16:49,446 --> 01:16:55,650
If you make that mistake and all of a sudden you write something out or you send a picture to somebody, it's going to follow you.

991
01:16:57,791 --> 01:17:07,759
You know, I don't think it's just, I think the policy that you presented to us, which we will need to follow up, is a piece of the puzzle, but it's not the entire puzzle.

992
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:22,671
I think that what Mia is talking about, if I may, Mia, if I think, is sort of saying is how are we making sure that within the scope of our conversations as we seek to educate our kids about social and emotional issues, that sexting becomes part of the topic.

993
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:23,351
Right.

994
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:35,500
And I don't think it's specifically covered as sexting, but we do have character development and choosing who I am, which does go through communication skills in dealing with issues and problem solving and things like that.

995
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:42,926
I think we can introduce the term sexting because that would be a common application of communication issues.

996
01:17:42,946 --> 01:17:45,147
I don't think it's a problem doing that.

997
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:49,290
I just think the education side is one side, and the technical side is the other side.

998
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:50,832
So it comes together.

999
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:52,553
It's not like we're ignoring one or the other.

1000
01:17:56,299 --> 01:17:57,000
Mr. Benedetto.

1001
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:06,469
So from what I'm hearing is that we have a program that addresses an issue at the high school, but we're seeing that issue at our middle school.

1002
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:19,203
So let's take the curriculum that we're using at the high school, check it to make sure it's developmentally appropriate for our middle schoolers, since we're hearing that middle schoolers are engaging in this, and bring that down to them.

1003
01:18:21,933 --> 01:18:23,774
I think we just need to be clear.

1004
01:18:24,434 --> 01:18:27,856
I did not hear that this is happening in the Medford Public Schools.

1005
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:31,437
We are hearing that there is a concern about it.

1006
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:37,674
you know, I'm hearing that middle school students are discussing this issue.

1007
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:51,079
So the fact that they're talking about it means that we should talk about it with them and discuss it in an open, um, caring manner so that they can talk about their concerns, even if it didn't happen to them.

1008
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,940
If they're talking about that, this is going on.

1009
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:56,859
we need to have that conversation before it happens.

1010
01:18:57,539 --> 01:19:00,560
And not wait till high school for this particular piece.

1011
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:06,803
So we're being informed by a parent that this topic is in need at an earlier time.

1012
01:19:06,903 --> 01:19:21,809
So I would like for, through you, Mr. Belson, to make a decision to bring this topic, if it's provided at the high school, to have our people, Diane or whomever, needs to look at it and make sure it's appropriate

1013
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:25,397
to start bringing that content down into our middle schools.

1014
01:19:25,897 --> 01:19:31,599
Because children are starting these more mature conversations much earlier.

1015
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:45,284
And if we're not addressing them until after they've already heard about it, talked about it with other children, we're not helping them learn open communication and how to deal with it and all of the things we need to.

1016
01:19:45,304 --> 01:19:49,606
We don't want to miss the boat and talk to them about things that they've already dealt with

1017
01:19:50,226 --> 01:19:51,127
two, three years now.

1018
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:52,387
We want to get them when they need it.

1019
01:19:52,628 --> 01:19:53,288
Just like D.A.R.E.

1020
01:19:53,328 --> 01:19:57,170
is at fifth grade level because that's the appropriate time to speak with them.

1021
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:06,796
And it might have been seventh grade level at some point and moved down because children are more mature in some topics now.

1022
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:14,180
I think we can be proactive and take a look at those lessons that are at the high school and maybe adapt them to bring them down to the middle schools.

1023
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:22,560
And maybe at our next policy meeting that we discuss a policy procedure for this.

1024
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,861
I don't know exactly when we're having any policy reviews.

1025
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:27,741
We can set that up.

1026
01:20:27,761 --> 01:20:28,321
We can set that up.

1027
01:20:28,341 --> 01:20:31,523
But Rachel, I think the assumption here is that there is nothing going on at the middle school in health.

1028
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:34,163
I think maybe you should talk a little bit about what we are doing in the middle school.

1029
01:20:34,183 --> 01:20:34,303
Sure.

1030
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:35,744
Because I think to somehow

1031
01:20:36,646 --> 01:20:40,369
that you see an elementary piece and a high school piece, but we haven't talked about the middle school piece.

1032
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:41,029
Sure.

1033
01:20:41,309 --> 01:20:50,496
And at the sixth grade level, the units that we're teaching are alcohol, drugs and tobacco, nutrition and physical activity, safety and social emotional learning unit.

1034
01:20:51,197 --> 01:20:56,020
Seventh grade is tobacco free, healthy eating and physical activity and safety.

1035
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:03,045
And at the eighth grade, it's drug free, healthy eating and physical activity and choosing who I am, which is a character development unit.

1036
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:07,895
I think one of the things that we've got to understand is a common thread that runs through everything.

1037
01:21:08,455 --> 01:21:15,441
How do young people make good decisions about anything, whether it's alcohol, sex?

1038
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,642
behavior towards others, race, things of that type.

1039
01:21:20,022 --> 01:21:25,326
The whole concept of all these curricula deals with the issue of good decision making.

1040
01:21:25,566 --> 01:21:31,291
How you are responsible to yourself and others as you move through, regardless of the content.

1041
01:21:31,871 --> 01:21:33,753
So I think that's really the common thread.

1042
01:21:33,813 --> 01:21:40,778
And maybe we just simply have to weave in some additional content is really what you're asking.

1043
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:43,720
So that we can give people at least an introduction to that

1044
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:46,729
since it seems to be a concern that may be emergent.

1045
01:21:46,749 --> 01:21:59,177
I think that when Rachel has her own meetings with her staff, she can discuss the issues that have been brought up to talk to her staff about what have you've heard in your classes and maybe it'll come up then as well.

1046
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:01,679
Thank you.

1047
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,942
I wasn't quite, I wasn't quite done.

1048
01:22:05,142 --> 01:22:12,947
Um, so at this point I'd like to, um, make a motion that we discuss putting a protocol in place for, um,

1049
01:22:14,742 --> 01:22:24,427
situations that happen outside of school that teachers hear about what they should do if this information were to come to them, like some school-wide policy.

1050
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:36,994
Like if I was a teacher of a sixth grader and someone said, oh, this student over here's picture has been put over everybody's cell phone, and I learned of that,

1051
01:22:38,258 --> 01:22:52,048
I would know, because there would be a policy in place, that I need to report it to the guidance office as well as the assistant principal, and the assistant principal would then follow up or whatever that policy would be that we think is necessary.

1052
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:55,410
So I would like the superintendent to put something together.

1053
01:22:55,430 --> 01:23:02,155
I'm making a motion that he comes up with a policy and procedures for situations like this.

1054
01:23:03,015 --> 01:23:03,716
I need a second.

1055
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:21,645
On the motion that the superintendent prepare a draft policy pertaining to things that may happen outside of the school, in the classroom, that he or she catches wind of and report back to the school committee, seconded by Ms.

1056
01:23:21,685 --> 01:23:22,165
Mustone.

1057
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:22,945
All those in favor?

1058
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:23,565
Aye.

1059
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:24,386
All those opposed?

1060
01:23:24,686 --> 01:23:25,386
Motion passes.

1061
01:23:25,886 --> 01:23:26,246
Thank you.

1062
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:27,706
Thank you.

1063
01:23:27,746 --> 01:23:28,907
Thank you very much, Mr. Perry.

1064
01:23:30,116 --> 01:23:30,916
Motion to accept the report.

1065
01:23:30,936 --> 01:23:34,417
Motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1066
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:34,877
Mustone.

1067
01:23:34,897 --> 01:23:35,558
All those in favor?

1068
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:37,378
All those opposed?

1069
01:23:38,098 --> 01:23:38,538
I'm sorry.

1070
01:23:39,499 --> 01:23:40,239
Motion accepted.

1071
01:23:40,259 --> 01:23:48,241
Item number four, report on professional development schedule.

1072
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:52,902
Deputy Superintendent will comment on that if you need additional information.

1073
01:23:52,942 --> 01:23:54,503
Do you want the date announced at least?

1074
01:23:54,683 --> 01:23:58,104
Why don't we announce the date because I think it's important that parents know so they can plan.

1075
01:23:58,794 --> 01:24:00,135
Monday, March 13th, 2017.

1076
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:04,139
This is currently not on the school calendar, correct?

1077
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:09,323
We will bring it to you first and then we'll, tomorrow actually is our administrative meeting.

1078
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:13,607
We'll announce it to the administrators so they can inform parents in multiple ways.

1079
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:16,510
We'll adjust the school calendar on the website as well.

1080
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,471
So we're just waiting for this evening first.

1081
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:19,272
Thank you.

1082
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:19,953
I have one question.

1083
01:24:19,993 --> 01:24:20,093
Ms.

1084
01:24:20,133 --> 01:24:20,553
Van de Kloot.

1085
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:22,215
I was surprised that you picked a Monday.

1086
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:24,653
Superintendent picked the Monday.

1087
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,377
I picked the Monday because

1088
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:32,388
I want the continuity of the week.

1089
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:38,614
I don't want to have it on the Wednesday, you come to school for two days and then you have day off and then you go another two days.

1090
01:24:38,654 --> 01:24:39,734
I think it breaks up the week.

1091
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:41,796
It's incumbent upon the faculty.

1092
01:24:41,836 --> 01:24:45,779
It's incumbent upon students not to use this as an excuse to extend the weekend.

1093
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:53,866
We need to make that clear to them, but I think it's important that we not lose four days consecutively and just simply have two days, break it up in the middle of the week.

1094
01:24:53,906 --> 01:24:57,629
And then it really doesn't help us in terms of keeping momentum going in classes.

1095
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:58,660
Okay.

1096
01:24:59,181 --> 01:24:59,561
Okay.

1097
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:00,201
Thank you.

1098
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:04,204
Motion to receive in place on file offered by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1099
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:04,724
Vandekloot.

1100
01:25:04,784 --> 01:25:05,545
All those in favor?

1101
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:06,806
All those opposed?

1102
01:25:06,846 --> 01:25:07,486
Motion passes.

1103
01:25:08,467 --> 01:25:12,469
Report on proposed change to educator evaluation regulations.

1104
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:13,570
Mr. Superintendent.

1105
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:18,714
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, there's a lot going on in the evaluation process at the state level.

1106
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:26,849
And it's going back and forth between the Teachers Association, the MASC, the MASS, the commissioner's office, and the like.

1107
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:30,351
And we want to keep you informed because it's a hot topic right now.

1108
01:25:30,411 --> 01:25:32,952
And I want you to understand where it's going.

1109
01:25:33,812 --> 01:25:40,415
There was a proposed change that the commissioner brought to the attention of the DESE board this past week.

1110
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:44,777
Commissioner Chester introduced a change that

1111
01:25:45,748 --> 01:25:47,869
because of the feedback he was getting from the field.

1112
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:58,873
No one was really happy with the way it was set up previously, that there would be a student impact rating that was independent of the regular rating.

1113
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:07,096
So he came up with an approach that would embed it in standard two, so it would be part of the standard two rating.

1114
01:26:07,817 --> 01:26:12,584
The Teachers Association, as you can see from what's been attached, is adamantly opposed to it.

1115
01:26:13,325 --> 01:26:17,331
The MASS and the MASC believe it's workable.

1116
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:19,374
The board has sent it out for public comment.

1117
01:26:20,355 --> 01:26:22,459
Over the next couple of months, there'll be public comment.

1118
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:25,201
And we'll see what actually takes place.

1119
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:32,166
But it's an important element of public policy, because obviously, there's got to be some form of teacher evaluation going on.

1120
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:39,052
And the question is, is that, is student learning a legitimate element of determining how effective a teacher is in the classroom?

1121
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:54,265
Now, it shouldn't be so plastic that the teacher who works with the most challenged of students is expected to have the same results as the teachers working with the gifted and talented student who self-motivates and teaches themselves in some ways.

1122
01:26:55,086 --> 01:26:58,647
Albeit, good teachers inspire anybody at any level.

1123
01:26:59,587 --> 01:27:02,367
But having said that, the debate is very sharp right now.

1124
01:27:03,028 --> 01:27:06,588
And it reflects a great deal of back and forth.

1125
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:10,329
And I'm not sure exactly how it's going to end up.

1126
01:27:11,209 --> 01:27:21,251
I will tell you that it is tying us up in terms of dealing with the Teachers Association, in terms of coming up with new ideas as to how to properly evaluate.

1127
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:28,532
It does create a back and forth between the associations in the Commonwealth.

1128
01:27:29,212 --> 01:27:32,574
And it clearly is a topic that we are going to hear more and more about.

1129
01:27:33,034 --> 01:27:34,255
So I want to keep you informed.

1130
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:47,422
I want you to know what people are saying, what happened at the board, what happened with the memo you have from the Teacher's Association, both from the MTA and the AFT, although it's on MTA stationary, as to what their objections are.

1131
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:56,265
And we'll continue to talk about this, because the way we evaluate teachers, the way we set goals for performance is very important to us.

1132
01:27:57,005 --> 01:28:00,826
And how we measure that is also very important.

1133
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,047
And it will affect personnel decisions going forward.

1134
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:08,449
So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think the rest of it is self-explanatory.

1135
01:28:09,629 --> 01:28:10,449
Thank you very much.

1136
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:12,710
There's a motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto.

1137
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:14,430
Is there a second on the floor by Ms.

1138
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:15,091
Van de Kloot?

1139
01:28:15,271 --> 01:28:15,931
All those in favor?

1140
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:18,408
All those opposed, the motion passes.

1141
01:28:20,491 --> 01:28:22,534
Report on school nutrition equipment grant.

1142
01:28:22,975 --> 01:28:23,776
Mr. Superintendent.

1143
01:28:23,796 --> 01:28:27,362
I'm going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Christine.

1144
01:28:28,448 --> 01:28:35,353
uh, Patterson is doing a great job and, uh, stepping in, uh, so quickly and, uh, we're going to report on this.

1145
01:28:35,813 --> 01:28:36,033
Great.

1146
01:28:36,654 --> 01:28:38,575
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the committee.

1147
01:28:39,195 --> 01:28:51,624
I'm happy to report, uh, under our food service program, Jewel Bradley and, uh, Bretta Smith, that we have received two large pieces of equipment for the McGlynn middle and the Columbus elementary.

1148
01:28:52,112 --> 01:29:04,700
These units are considered heat and hold, electric convection ovens, which will allow those schools to offer the hot meals more quickly, get children through the lines much more expeditiously.

1149
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,123
So we continue to look at all of our resources and try to

1150
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:14,026
maximize what we can and get additional funding for equipment and services.

1151
01:29:14,907 --> 01:29:18,009
For me personally, food services is very important.

1152
01:29:18,089 --> 01:29:30,558
I'm a member of the School Nutrition Association, so I'm working very closely with JUUL to continue to find additional resources and extend our breakfast programs free and reduced wherever we can.

1153
01:29:31,302 --> 01:29:31,722
Excellent.

1154
01:29:31,963 --> 01:29:32,603
Thank you very much.

1155
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:33,524
Congratulations.

1156
01:29:39,828 --> 01:29:39,988
Ms.

1157
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:44,091
Stone, were those the only two pieces of equipment that they applied for on the grant?

1158
01:29:44,552 --> 01:29:44,792
Yes.

1159
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:51,537
Based on the criteria that was established, um, you had to be over 50% free and reduced.

1160
01:29:52,077 --> 01:29:52,597
Thank you.

1161
01:29:52,838 --> 01:29:59,983
There's a motion to, if we can amend the paper to make it a motion to accept the grant.

1162
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:14,773
Mr. Benedetto, through you to the superintendent, I know a few years ago we went up on our school lunch prices because we needed to upgrade equipment and make sure that we were adequately.

1163
01:30:15,113 --> 01:30:23,835
I just really would ask you to look at that and to see if we're going to raise prices again.

1164
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:27,776
We want to give parents in the community enough information early.

1165
01:30:28,316 --> 01:30:32,940
rather than have a vote of a big lump sum, because it is a hardship for some families.

1166
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:40,845
And I don't want our children to show up at any level, high school or young, without enough money for school lunches.

1167
01:30:40,945 --> 01:30:53,434
And really communicate well about this and come forthright rather than at the last minute, the end of the school year for the beginning of next year and parents don't hear it.

1168
01:30:54,961 --> 01:31:12,347
Of course, one of the things, I'll just say this as a commentary on what's going on, we don't know what the federal policy is going to be going into next year with regard to USDA reimbursements to the state and to us, the supply of commodities and things of that type.

1169
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:15,168
It could change at this particular point in time.

1170
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:17,088
So there's some uncertainty on that level.

1171
01:31:18,049 --> 01:31:20,630
We've got to deal also with the fact that, you know,

1172
01:31:22,171 --> 01:31:26,195
The price of food in local markets, we have some issues with regard to that.

1173
01:31:26,496 --> 01:31:28,317
We'll go up farm to school and things like that.

1174
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:29,298
We want farm fresh.

1175
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:31,020
We want certain kinds of food.

1176
01:31:31,441 --> 01:31:32,582
So we have to be careful about that.

1177
01:31:32,602 --> 01:31:34,684
But so far, the food service program is doing fine.

1178
01:31:35,205 --> 01:31:36,406
But we'll monitor that.

1179
01:31:36,486 --> 01:31:39,629
And our goal would be not to raise prices unless we absolutely have to.

1180
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,292
And we try to give you as much advance notice as we can.

1181
01:31:42,332 --> 01:31:43,313
But I appreciate what you're saying.

1182
01:31:43,453 --> 01:31:50,280
So in history, what they do is they make due for a very long time, and then they come to us and they need a big increase.

1183
01:31:50,460 --> 01:32:05,555
And I think when we spoke to them last time that happened, we told them to come forward ahead of time for maintenance and for new machinery as we go, rather than to wait for a last minute and have a huge price increase to our parents and our students.

1184
01:32:05,956 --> 01:32:07,317
Because some of our students who work,

1185
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:12,042
and pay for their own lunches, and I know that they're hungry sometimes.

1186
01:32:12,182 --> 01:32:16,845
A lot of our students can come to school hungry, and some people, that's the only meals they get.

1187
01:32:17,285 --> 01:32:22,008
So I just want you to be very conscious of it.

1188
01:32:22,428 --> 01:32:22,789
Thank you.

1189
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:23,569
We will be.

1190
01:32:23,629 --> 01:32:29,553
But I will point out to you that more and more of our students are becoming eligible for free and reduced.

1191
01:32:30,174 --> 01:32:32,135
We have, there's two schools that received equipment.

1192
01:32:32,175 --> 01:32:37,478
They had to have at least 50% of the student body eligible in order to even apply for the grant.

1193
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:39,780
And the others aren't too far behind.

1194
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:47,784
There's only one school that's really kind of, you know, doesn't have that economic, but most of the others are starting to head towards that 50% threshold.

1195
01:32:48,244 --> 01:32:50,586
That's simply the nature of the demographic in the community.

1196
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:52,327
So we are conscious of that very much.

1197
01:32:52,547 --> 01:32:53,587
And what about our high school?

1198
01:32:53,607 --> 01:32:57,830
Are we getting those forms back from our high school students so that they qualify?

1199
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:59,671
Some kids will never tell you because they don't want to.

1200
01:33:00,111 --> 01:33:05,753
I mean, some families won't, but more and more we're paying attention to that because obviously it affects us.

1201
01:33:06,233 --> 01:33:16,037
Part of the reason that prices had to be raised, just so we can remind ourselves of this, was the fact that the USDA insisted that we charge at least as much as they were reimbursing.

1202
01:33:16,937 --> 01:33:19,918
They weren't going to reimburse us more money than we were charging ourselves.

1203
01:33:20,859 --> 01:33:24,520
So that was an important thing to bring it up, so we had to actually bring it up.

1204
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,162
But the point is well taken, and we'll follow up, and we'll try to do the best we can in giving a word out there.

1205
01:33:29,594 --> 01:33:31,016
A motion to accept the grant.

1206
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:32,839
Is there a second?

1207
01:33:36,805 --> 01:33:41,492
I just wanted to follow up from Superintendent Belson to also indicate that

1208
01:33:42,237 --> 01:33:50,203
The process has changed for the free and reduced, so we're not simply reliant on applications at this point any longer.

1209
01:33:50,523 --> 01:34:09,377
So we are trying to look at further information informing parents and families of services outside of just school nutrition, that if they are able to take advantage of those, such as Medicare, SNAP, other services, that they become eligible by virtue, and we are able to capture them through the portal.

1210
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:11,098
So it remains anonymous.

1211
01:34:11,218 --> 01:34:16,039
There's not this stigma that used to be associated with this process.

1212
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:22,901
So we are being much more active in trying to capture those as many as we can at all grade levels.

1213
01:34:23,421 --> 01:34:26,122
And also, excuse me, I hope you don't mind my comment.

1214
01:34:26,883 --> 01:34:34,625
Parents don't sometimes realize that when you qualify for free and reduced lunch, you also get a discounted

1215
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:39,499
amounts on college applications and SAT exams.

1216
01:34:39,879 --> 01:34:47,865
So it really is more than just the food program, and I don't think that that's communicated well to most parents in the community.

1217
01:34:48,146 --> 01:34:54,070
So even if they say, well, my kid's never going to get a school lunch and they're going to bring their lunch, there's no reason for me to fill out that form.

1218
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:59,855
There are children that, you know, they get vouchers for SATs and they get decreased

1219
01:35:00,587 --> 01:35:04,630
applications for colleges, and they're getting very expensive now.

1220
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:11,796
So, I mean, there's a lot of good reasons to get that out, so I hope that our high school is communicating that piece.

1221
01:35:11,856 --> 01:35:27,289
I know I've spoke to that point before, that maybe Dr. Perella, when he sends out the form, also advises parents that they qualify for those other things, as well as just lunches, in that, because a lot of people just have no idea.

1222
01:35:28,748 --> 01:35:29,348
So thank you.

1223
01:35:29,729 --> 01:35:30,209
Very good.

1224
01:35:30,529 --> 01:35:32,170
On the motion roll call vote, please.

1225
01:35:34,972 --> 01:35:35,292
Yes.

1226
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:41,976
Yes.

1227
01:35:42,056 --> 01:35:44,437
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

1228
01:35:44,457 --> 01:35:45,338
The motion passes.

1229
01:35:46,038 --> 01:35:47,339
Negotiations and legal matters.

1230
01:35:47,459 --> 01:35:47,799
Are there any?

1231
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:48,460
Nope.

1232
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,960
There are none.

1233
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:51,140
Old business.

1234
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:57,564
Recommendation to send letter to state delegation on enhanced regulation for implementation of new recreational marijuana law.

1235
01:35:57,584 --> 01:35:58,524
Mr. Superintendent.

1236
01:35:58,885 --> 01:36:03,328
So in our last meeting you asked me to draft a letter from you to our legislative delegation.

1237
01:36:03,948 --> 01:36:08,931
I have done so and you, you know, got a chance hopefully to look it over so that we can send it in.

1238
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:13,594
But I want to bring you up to date on a couple more things that have since emerged with that law.

1239
01:36:13,614 --> 01:36:14,195
I did attach

1240
01:36:14,795 --> 01:36:25,827
an advisory from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, legal counsel, which went into a great deal of depth about some of the legal challenges in implementing this law.

1241
01:36:26,287 --> 01:36:33,575
I also had the opportunity today to meet with the State Treasurer as part of the Economic Empowerment Task Force, which I serve.

1242
01:36:35,083 --> 01:36:39,964
about the implementation because the implementation comes under her jurisdiction, at least at this point in time.

1243
01:36:40,644 --> 01:36:46,445
As you may know, there's no money that's been allocated in the current budget for it and the current collections have gone down this month.

1244
01:36:46,505 --> 01:36:56,067
So it's hard to know where that new money is coming and there's no consensus to borrow from the rainy day fund from either the governor or the speaker of the house or the state treasurer.

1245
01:36:56,547 --> 01:37:03,828
So it's unlikely that this will be off and running very soon because they, they need money to set up the apparatus to do the,

1246
01:37:04,477 --> 01:37:06,581
the kinds of things that are necessary.

1247
01:37:06,941 --> 01:37:08,103
Still, we should be on record.

1248
01:37:08,624 --> 01:37:15,797
In addition, we should also note that there are some interesting federal laws that are going to intersect with this right now.

1249
01:37:16,776 --> 01:37:19,197
There is the Drug-Free Schools Act.

1250
01:37:19,578 --> 01:37:21,019
There's the Communities Act.

1251
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:27,362
There's also, you know, a discussion of states' rights versus federal supremacy clause.

1252
01:37:28,143 --> 01:37:41,911
Under the federal supremacy clause, federal laws take precedent over state laws, unless they're covered by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which reserves rights to the state that are not enumerated for the federal government.

1253
01:37:42,451 --> 01:37:43,512
But depending on the court,

1254
01:37:44,482 --> 01:37:48,485
It really depends on what the judges want to rule at any one time because it's gone both ways.

1255
01:37:49,365 --> 01:37:59,492
So it's entirely possible that the incoming Attorney General, who has been very strong in his advocacy against marijuana, recreational or medical, in his home state,

1256
01:38:00,172 --> 01:38:07,638
and in the Senate, may actually take a more aggressive stance than the current Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.

1257
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:16,526
So there's a lot going on as to how this stuff is going to play out in the national and the local scene in the upcoming months.

1258
01:38:16,566 --> 01:38:25,073
Another thing, too, that maybe people don't fully realize is that because it's a federal crime, money's collected for this revenue from the

1259
01:38:26,335 --> 01:38:30,719
from marijuana can't be deposited in a federal bank, because it's a criminal act.

1260
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:31,840
So.

1261
01:38:32,501 --> 01:38:35,123
They are allowing it now, but multiple levels.

1262
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:36,364
Multiple levels of different.

1263
01:38:36,384 --> 01:38:36,744
Reporting.

1264
01:38:36,764 --> 01:38:48,735
Yeah, all kinds of, but you know, there's going to be, it's going to be very interesting to see how they play with that, because with a new, if you will, sheriff in town, and they get to stay in the White House, it could very well be a very difficult thing that goes forward.

1265
01:38:49,196 --> 01:38:50,697
So in the interim,

1266
01:38:51,345 --> 01:38:56,286
It doesn't hurt for us to be on record with the letter that I've drafted for you or any amendments you want to make to it.

1267
01:38:57,287 --> 01:39:03,908
But I think that it's going to be a little while before we start to see this take place and where it goes.

1268
01:39:04,849 --> 01:39:05,229
Very good.

1269
01:39:06,069 --> 01:39:09,130
And actually, it's to adopt the letter.

1270
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:11,751
Last week, we asked for a draft.

1271
01:39:11,811 --> 01:39:14,831
So is there a motion to accept this letter and submit it on our behalf?

1272
01:39:15,512 --> 01:39:18,712
Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1273
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:19,373
Van de Kloot.

1274
01:39:19,413 --> 01:39:20,113
Roll call, please.

1275
01:39:22,386 --> 01:39:22,667
Yes.

1276
01:39:26,949 --> 01:39:30,552
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

1277
01:39:30,892 --> 01:39:34,074
So if you could send that letter in on our behalf, we appreciate it, Mr. Superintendent.

1278
01:39:34,094 --> 01:39:38,217
And there's just a couple of items the superintendent would like to mention.

1279
01:39:38,257 --> 01:39:39,818
Just a couple of quick things.

1280
01:39:39,838 --> 01:39:46,182
You know, again, tomorrow at 1230 is groundbreaking at the Community Access Channel.

1281
01:39:46,202 --> 01:39:47,683
It's going to be hosted in part

1282
01:39:48,243 --> 01:39:57,848
by the mayor, by Lisa Hughes from Channel 4, Courtney Cox from Nessun, and a number of other people from the media coming to see us in action.

1283
01:39:58,308 --> 01:40:01,290
It will be a good opportunity to see how this thing is progressing.

1284
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:02,911
A lot of good work is going on.

1285
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:12,516
Christina has been working real hard with city officials to ensure that the construction goes forward and that the necessary modifications are made so that things go forward.

1286
01:40:12,996 --> 01:40:20,479
but tomorrow's an opportunity to see things from the actual site and to get some reports at that opportunity.

1287
01:40:21,319 --> 01:40:27,822
I've given you two articles from Time Magazine, which was referenced by Paulette a short time ago.

1288
01:40:28,182 --> 01:40:39,866
They're worth reading because I think what's important is that we stay up on what's being said out there so we can have the dialogues necessary to guide the future directions of our resources and our curriculum.

1289
01:40:40,786 --> 01:40:42,207
It should be noted that

1290
01:40:43,112 --> 01:40:45,472
The President-elect has named an incoming U.S.

1291
01:40:45,512 --> 01:40:49,113
Secretary of Education, Elizabeth Betsy DeVos of Michigan.

1292
01:40:49,813 --> 01:40:52,694
She's an active supporter of school choice, charters, and vouchers.

1293
01:40:53,554 --> 01:40:56,614
She also has announced that she's against the Common Core.

1294
01:40:57,234 --> 01:41:05,116
We'll see where that happens, what that means, but, you know, getting back to the Supremacy Clause versus states' rights, all those kinds of things have to be worked out.

1295
01:41:06,156 --> 01:41:11,157
But it's going to be very interesting to see, especially coming off the most recent

1296
01:41:12,218 --> 01:41:22,365
initiative petition in the Commonwealth as to what kinds of incentives will be made to the communities, states, you know, to expand choice and the like.

1297
01:41:22,385 --> 01:41:25,547
The Massachusetts Constitution forbids certain types of activities.

1298
01:41:25,567 --> 01:41:26,628
Again,

1299
01:41:27,368 --> 01:41:30,851
You know, it's hard to know how it will all intersect, but it bears watching.

1300
01:41:31,512 --> 01:41:36,596
So those are just a few items to bring to your attention, and hopefully you can participate.

1301
01:41:36,636 --> 01:41:44,303
Again, on the 14th, if you intend to go, let us know so we can arrange for parking and the other things for you at the Science Museum.

1302
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:45,784
Very good.

1303
01:41:45,804 --> 01:41:47,386
Is there a motion to adjourn?

1304
01:41:47,406 --> 01:41:47,786
Motion to adjourn.

1305
01:41:48,787 --> 01:41:49,708
All those in favor?

1306
01:41:49,728 --> 01:41:51,549
All those opposed?

1307
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,191
Adjourned.

1308
01:41:53,751 --> 01:41:54,132
Thank you.
