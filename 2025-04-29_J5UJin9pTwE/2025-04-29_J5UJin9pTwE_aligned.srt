00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:08,228
If you look closely, you'll notice that there are two images in the back of the book.

2
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:09,149
There are the first one and the second one.

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:09,929
The first one is really beautiful.

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,810
The second one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,532
And the third one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

6
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:16,833
And the third one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

7
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,814
And the fourth one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

8
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:21,515
And the fourth one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

9
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,256
And the fifth one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

10
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:24,977
And the sixth one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

11
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:26,858
And the sixth one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

12
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,919
And the seventh one has a lot to do with the way that the book is set up.

13
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,980
And the eighth one has a lot to do with the way that the book is

14
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:57,237
Thank you.

15
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,449
Thank you very much.

16
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:13,956
I'm.

17
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:40,404
I don't know.

18
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:13,749
I think that's a good point.

19
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,009
I think that's a good point.

20
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:44,559
Yeah.

21
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:44,819
Yeah.

22
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,060
Yeah.

23
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,174
Yeah, yeah, I was looking at it.

24
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,300
It's huge.

25
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,001
It's enormous.

26
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:11,399
Oh, yeah.

27
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:11,699
Oh, yeah.

28
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,057
Thank you very much.

29
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,391
The YouTube broadcast has also started.

30
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:10,436
I thought everyone was saying I was the problem, and I thought you had the solution.

31
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:14,680
It also, it did not land as a criticism either, so stop worrying about it.

32
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:55,672
Eighth regular meeting Medford City Council April 2025 is called to order Mr please call the roll Council Callahan.

33
00:08:57,594 --> 00:09:01,717
Vice President Collins console is our own council lemon.

34
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:04,219
Councilor Scott Kelly is absent.

35
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,764
Councilor saying President bears present six present one absent please rise to salute the flag.

36

Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records.

37
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,341
Is there a motion to table Councilor Scarpelli's resolution until he's present?

38
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:39,764
On the motion of Councilor Seng to table 25062 to the next regular meeting, seconded by Councilor Collins.

39
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:40,524
All those in favor?

40
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:41,565
Opposed?

41
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:42,465
Motion passes.

42
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,306
We have two papers under suspension.

43
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,086
Is there a motion to take papers under suspension?

44
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:52,028
On the motion of Councilor Seng to take papers under suspension, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

45
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:52,748
All those in favor?

46
00:09:53,638 --> 00:10:08,008
Opposed motion passes 25068 offered under suspension by Vice President Collins be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Metro family network director Marie Cassidy on her retirement and extend our deepest gratitude for over 30 years of service to the community counselor Collins.

47
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,019
Thank you, President Behrs.

48
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,382
Director Marie Cassidy is a woman in Medford who truly needs no introduction.

49
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:24,705
I heard earlier this month that she was announcing her retirement.

50
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:26,126
Never thought I'd see the day.

51
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:33,911
It is hard to think of a person more dedicated and enthusiastic about a role in public service.

52
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,853
I think many people in Medford, myself included, find her genuinely inspirational.

53
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:53,425
person so just wanted to make sure this city council had a moment to publicly extend our gratitude to her for her years and years of tireless service on behalf of Medford families and children, and to wish her a very long and happy retirement.

54
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:53,966
Thank you.

55
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:58,397
Thank you.

56
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:04,082
As someone with kids, I have to say that the Bedford Family Network is truly a gem.

57
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:10,688
I think people don't realize the dearth of activities for families with young children.

58
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:12,630
And, you know,

59
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,850
everywhere else except for here in Medford.

60
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:24,892
And it is truly an amazing institution and really shows such incredible leadership from Marie Cassidy.

61
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:39,815
So just such appreciation for the work that she has done, the leadership she has shown, and the organization that she has built and the incredible value that she has provided to parents at a time in their lives, which can be quite tough.

62
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:41,575
So thank you so much.

63
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,459
Thank you, Councilor Lazaro.

64
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:46,745
Thank you.

65
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:50,707
I think I cut Councilor Seng in line, but we'll get to you.

66
00:11:51,167 --> 00:12:05,355
I also echo Councilor Callahan's thoughts about being a parent in Medford and really appreciating the programming that came out of the Medford Family Network and thanks so much to Marie Cassidy.

67
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,756
She's always an incredibly bubbly presence.

68
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,657
She gets dressed up at the events.

69
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:15,720
She is like always there, always has a huge smile on her face, always fills her tiny car up with

70
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:30,015
boxes and boxes of crafts and, you know, things for the Valentine's Day thing about the like the park things and the teddy bear picnic and everything that you can possibly attend.

71
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:39,343
But not only that, there's also things like during the pandemic when I there would be a call to help bring bags of groceries to somebody's house or

72
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:46,248
donations somewhere that somebody needed help and the Medford Family Network was an intrinsic part of that.

73
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:54,034
And Marie's dedication to that organization and making sure it was still an active part of the community during the pandemic was really critical.

74
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:59,859
And she didn't let anybody forget about the young families in town.

75
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:08,325
The Medford Family Network also has a lot of outreach for, you know, new parents, new to the

76
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:23,603
to town but also to the country who are just like getting their sea legs under them and figuring out how to be a part of our community and, you know, how to be a parent in a new place is a really hard thing to figure out how to do so.

77
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:32,890
I really appreciate all that she's given to our community and what a welcoming place she's made Medford feel for so many people.

78
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,314
So, so much gratitude to Marie and best of luck in her next endeavors.

79
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:45,218
Thank you and you did not cut I'm stage managing Medford kids are going last on this one.

80
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:48,095
Thank you.

81
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:52,636
I might not be able to speak as a parent, but I can speak as someone who was a kid.

82
00:13:54,256 --> 00:14:07,959
And to speak to really, I think the wide range of programming that Medford Family Network has given Medford families throughout the years that so many people like me benefited from.

83
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:14,120
And more than just programming, really building a community of Medford kids and Medford parents.

84
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:23,899
who, you know, can get together help each other, build a build a community here in Medford and I'm so so grateful for that work.

85
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,284
Director Cassidy is like a Medford celebrity, I feel like, with all of the you know the dozens of years that she's given to this job.

86
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:53,172
has gotten to know so many of our residents so intimately, really knowing the happy things about Medford and the not so happy things and helping make sure that, you know, with the work, especially that you did during COVID, that we were able to help out the families that really needed help.

87
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,651
And she's just a, you know, a bridge builder, a connector in that way.

88
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:05,313
And we'll really miss having Dr. Cassidy do that service for our city.

89
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:10,475
I will always really, I will always remember.

90
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:26,350
the energy that she brings to all the events, seeing her at teddy bear picnics and fundraisers and just the regular MFN events, seeing her dressed up and the energy that she brings really brings the life to the party.

91
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,212
So I want to thank Director Cassidy for all her work.

92
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:34,194
I'm so grateful and congratulations on your retirement.

93
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:50,063
Thank you for saying yeah and I'll just add director Cassidy's 30 years, pretty much coincide with how long I've been in Medford, and I know a lot I didn't move here till I was four.

94
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:51,964
Don't tell anyone.

95
00:15:55,897 --> 00:16:03,463
I know a lot of the young people who I grew up with built lifelong connections and their parents built lifelong connections in community through the MFN.

96
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:12,069
And I know parents who are still involved in supporting the MFN whose kids are 30, 35 years old, because it's so valuable to them.

97
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,352
So, you know, when I think of Maria, I think of

98
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:30,331
words like joy and wonder and community, and most importantly, just an incredible laser focus on the kids in this community having really happy experiences and moments and building community together.

99
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:35,132
And I don't think she'll ever really know how important the teddy bear picnic is.

100
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:38,433
So with that, I'll just leave it there.

101
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:38,973
Is there a motion?

102
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:46,825
on the motion to approve by Councilor said seconded by seconded by Council is our all those in favor.

103
00:16:48,166 --> 00:17:09,037
Opposed motion passes 25069 offered under suspension by Councilor Callahan, whereas the Chevrolet theater is a historic thriving cultural center used by our residents which brings people together from all over greater Boston, be it resolved that the city council invite Cindy Watson from friends and friends of the Chevrolet to attend the public works and facilities meeting to inform our community about the state of the Chevrolet theater.

104
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,611
Thank you.

105
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:17,013
I do not want to play any favoritism for our public buildings.

106
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:17,873
I love them all.

107
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:23,677
We are in one now, but I will also say the Chevalier Theater is, of course, so much more than just a building.

108
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:35,325
And, you know, what they bring to our city is truly wonderful in terms of events, as well as just, you know, economic vitality and what they bring to the square.

109
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,867
So I'm very excited to have them come again this year.

110
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:40,088
I think

111
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:44,869
you know, they they have some requests in terms of the actual physical building.

112
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,931
And I'm excited to hear what they look for, and what the city might be able to help them out with.

113
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,752
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

114
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:55,632
Any further discussion?

115
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:56,473
Councilor Lemming?

116
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:01,594
I look forward to this again, too.

117
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,915
I'd also just like to thank Cindy for

118
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,252
extending an invitation for all of us to attend the annual meeting of the Friends of the Chevalier.

119
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:13,533
I had a wonderful time there this past year.

120
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:16,334
I look forward to attending again this year.

121
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:25,257
It's just nice to see folks come together in the community to support our local institutions.

122
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:31,920
The only disappointment that I have is that I couldn't get tickets to see Ringo Starr or

123
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,337
or weird Al Yankovic.

124
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:35,958
But you know what?

125
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:36,759
You know what?

126
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,662
We all have to make sacrifices.

127
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:42,346
So I look forward to I look forward to seeing this update.

128
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:46,291
The clerk's informing me that he did see Chris Kristofferson.

Records records of the meeting of April 8th were passed to Councilor Collins.

132
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:04,567
Councilor Collins, how did you find those records?

133
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:08,750
I apologize I motioned a table to our next regular meeting as I did not review them.

134
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,312
Okay.

135
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,034

00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:16,681
This was on parking, the new parking director, also on the GLX parking zone, and a potential change the parking ordinance.

150
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,104
Councilor Collins, is there anything you'd like to add.

151
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,026
You can say no.

152
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:22,568
That's our columns.

153
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:41,865
We referred out of committee the proposed ordinance change submitted by the parking department, and we reviewed the draft first annual surveillance reporting by the parking department, which they have resubmitted with a couple minor amendments.

154
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:46,686
And so the council will review those again as part of the council paper on the topic next month.

155
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:47,766
Great.

156
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,527
Could you forward me the ordinance for our next regular meeting agenda?

157
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,024
Thank you.

158
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:59,220
Councillor Collins planning and permitting committee April 9.

159
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:02,223
Thank you.

160
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:10,706
At the Planning and Permitting Committee on April 9th, this was our 20-something meeting with the zoning consultant.

161
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:20,428
At this meeting, we were going over in greater detail a draft of the zoning proposal for West Medford Square.

162
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:25,750
This wasn't the first time we'd seen this map, but it was the first time we'd spent a whole meeting concentrating on it.

163
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,251
We had a really lively discussion between councilors, city staff, the zoning consultant.

164
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,512
There was a lot of public comment.

165
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:36,492
It was a really great meeting and we took in lots of feedback.

166
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:43,814
So this proposal will come back to the committee again before it is referred to the Community Development Board.

167
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:44,674
Motion to approve.

168
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:46,435
Thank you.

169
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:50,256
Councilor Lemming, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, April 15th.

170
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,977
We approved a very nice budget survey.

171
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:55,277
Great.

172
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:59,187
And we have community the whole April 16th.

173
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:08,232
This was the CDBG public meeting discussing the CDBG proposals for community organizations.

174
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:11,554
And we have a hearing on that in just two agenda items.

175
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:14,896
So we will be taking action on that tonight.

176
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,118
Is there a motion to approve the joint reports?

177
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,121
On the motion of councilor saying to approve, seconded by.

178
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,143
Seconded by council Lazzaro, all those in favor.

179
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,909
Opposed, motion passes.

180
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:33,052
Hearings, 25036, petition to amend the special permit 282, Mystic Ave.

181
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,115
I'm declaring this continued public hearing open.

182
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:41,537
The petitioner has requested that we further continue this to our next regular meeting.

183
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,802
With that, is there anyone who'd like to comment on this at this time in the public hearing?

184
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:52,744
It will be continued to May 13th and there will be further opportunity to comment.

185
00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,421
Seeing none, I'm declaring the public hearing this temporarily closed to be continued.

186
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:04,322
Is there a motion to continue?

187
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:09,644
On the motion to continue the public hearing to May 13th by Councilor Sang, seconded by?

188
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:12,945
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

189
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:13,986
All those in favor?

190
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:15,686
Opposed?

191
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,067
Motion passes.

192
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:23,790
25060, submitted by the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Community Development Block Grant Action Plan for Fiscal 26.

193
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,912
Notice of a public hearing the Medford City Council will conduct a public hearing.

194
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:32,053
Sorry about that.

195
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:35,495
wrong sheet.

196
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:49,521
Legal Notice City of Medford Community Development Block Grant Program five year consolidated plan program your 2025 annual action plan and citizen participation plan.

197
00:23:50,629 --> 00:24:09,155
Public hearing a public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council on Tuesday, April 29 2025 at 7pm the purpose of this public hearing will be to invite the general public and representatives of public service agencies to express comments regarding the city's five year consolidated plan and annual action plan, and on the city's housing and community development needs and development of proposed activities.

198
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:23,762
The consolidated plan includes broad goals and objectives to address priority needs with resources available from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, including a five-year strategy for use of Community Development Block Grant CDBG funding for program years 2025 to 2029.

199
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:29,487
The action plan contains the proposed use of CDBG funds for the program year, which extends from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026, program year 2025.

200
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:43,941
The hearing will also invite public comments regarding the city's updated CDBG Citizen Participation Plan, detailing opportunities for public participation, and the development of plans and reports related to its CDBG funding.

201
00:24:44,501 --> 00:25:03,535
The Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability will be requesting that the Medford City Council authorize Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern, official representative of the City of Medford, to submit the Program Year 2025 to 2029 Consolidated Plan, the Program Year 2025 Annual Action Plan, application for funds and all other assurances and certifications to HUD,

202
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:10,369
The city is applying for an estimated $1,384,050 in block grant funds for program year 2025.

203
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,851
Funds are estimated in details on the increasing or decreasing of proposed activities and budget.

204
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:20,993
Once HUD has notified, the city of its final allocation can be found within the draft annual action plan.

205
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:32,638
If you need reasonable accommodation to attend or participate in this hearing, please contact Nicholas Karinje at email nkaringe at medford-ma.gov or by phone at 781

206
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:38,121
3 9 3 2 4 3 9.

207
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:38,121
All right.

208
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:42,844
Um, is there anything that Laurel you'd like to add?

209
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:45,666
Uh, before we open the public hearing?

210
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:47,187
No.

211
00:25:47,247 --> 00:26:00,916
I mean, I think that the hearing notice pretty much covers that we're seeking approval of those three plans to cover our five year consolidated plan next year's annual action plan and the updated citizen participation plan

212
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:10,479
One thing as noted in that hearing notice, we have not yet received final notification from HUD of the amount of our funding for next year.

213
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:19,061
So the plans approved would be subject to our adjustment as detailed in the annual action plan once we have that final figure.

214
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:20,802
Great.

215
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:27,063
I'm going to open the public hearing unless Councillor Collins, do you have a question for Laurel?

216
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:41,781
I'm going to open the public hearing to anyone who'd like to speak in favor, opposition or otherwise has comment on the city's action plan, consolidated plan and any other CDBG related matter.

217
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:44,702
Public hearing is open.

218
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:50,685
You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium if you have a comment on the CDBG action plan.

219
00:26:55,685 --> 00:27:00,669
And Laurel, I'm assuming that the Office of Planning Development Sustainability is in support.

220
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,190
Yes, we are.

221
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,332
Great, thank you.

222
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:10,497
Just gonna give it a second.

223
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,543
Seeing no hands on Zoom and no one in person, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

224
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:20,225
Councilor Collins.

225
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:32,669
Thank you, President bears and thank you Laurel for being here again for folks who weren't at the committee of the whole on the CDBG block grant funding a couple weeks ago.

226
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:39,198
That was on April 16, I heard from Laurel with an overview of the annual action plan the consolidated plan.

227
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,938
the updated citizen participation plan.

228
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:56,761
We also heard from all prospective funding applicants, which is something that we do every year and speaking as one counselor, it's always a joy to hear from these direct service providers who are using this federal grant funding to do really good work in our community.

229
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:57,921
It's never glamorous stuff.

230
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:08,303
It's just the stuff that residents really need and very grateful to them for assisting our public sector in getting residents recreation and food and access.

231
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:13,208
and things like that that everybody should have access to.

232
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:28,966
So with that being said, eager to approve this, I would make the following motion to approve the city's five-year consolidated plan for HUD funding, annual action plan for CDBG program year 2025, and updated citizen participation plan

233
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:45,220
with the funding amounts outlined in the consolidated plan and the annual action plan being subject to final adjustment as set forth in the draft annual action plan once HUD has notified the city of its annual allocation of CDBG funding for program year 2025.

234
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,584
Can you submit that motion to the clerk?

235
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:50,724
Thank you.

236
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:54,968
A motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

237
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:55,749
Any further discussion?

238
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:56,910
I'm seeing Councilor Sang.

239
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,409
Thank you.

240
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:10,121
I also wanted to thank Laurel, thank everyone who's worked on this, and all the projects that we're funding for submitting their proposals.

241
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:19,812
These, you know, for a lot of Medford residents, these projects are part of their everyday lives, part of the ways that they get to their grocery stores,

242
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:24,436
the way that they put food on their dinner plate at night.

243
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:29,240
So I think it's really important that we fund this, that we pass this.

244
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:43,733
I know that something new in what we're seeing tonight is the vacant storefront initiatives, as well as generally the business development initiatives as well.

245
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:45,535
So money to

246
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:56,612
continue the vacant storefront district program to also create the second round of the project pop-up and computer program.

247
00:29:57,073 --> 00:30:03,217
I was just curious, Laurel, if, I usually ask this question for the projects.

248
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:09,982
I was wondering if you could speak to how we're measuring that success, like the effectivity of those programs.

249
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:27,387
If you're speaking as to the vacant storefront program, that program is eligible to both what are referred to as micro enterprises, which are businesses with 5 or few employees, or a small business, which is above 5 employees.

250
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:38,892
So far, we've provided 1 grant and those grants for small businesses are subject to hiring at least 1 or low or moderate income resident to a new position.

251
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:44,618
And the micro enterprises, they're qualified based on their own income.

252
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:50,142
And so it's an opportunity to elevate somebody with a low or moderate income household who's looking to establish a business.

253
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:57,626
Similarly for the pop-up program, that will be eligible to Medford residents operating a micro enterprise.

254
00:30:57,646 --> 00:31:08,493
So again, it's an opportunity to elevate a small business operated by a low or moderate income resident, and hopefully establish more retail in Medford, which we know is lacking in some of our squares.

255
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:20,458
Is the, can I just ask a follow up, is the goal to help the micro enterprises move into storefronts of their own going forward?

256
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:25,559
Is there, I know this, this is a great program in itself.

257
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:34,622
I'm just thinking about, have we thought about bridging that gap between when, you know, their time at the incubator ends and kind of their next step?

258
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:35,668
Certainly.

259
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:43,792
So this program is being done in conjunction with a consultant called UpNext, and they've done this program in a number of other communities.

260
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:53,216
And the entire package includes quite a bit of technical assistance and support to the micro enterprises to help them to basically launch their business.

261
00:31:53,256 --> 00:32:01,840
So it's a short term opportunity to have a physical space, but also to equip them with the tools to continue on and hopefully have a successful business in the future.

262
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:03,621
Thank you so much.

263
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:05,825
Thank you.

264
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,807
We'll go to Councilor Lazaro.

265
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:09,208
Thank you.

266
00:32:09,248 --> 00:32:19,835
I really appreciate how much information is in the packet on these organizations that we're potentially helping to fund with the CDBG funds here.

267
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:25,680
I was not able to attend the Committee of the Whole, so I was reviewing the minutes.

268
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,903
Something that really jumped out at me is how many of these organizations work to feed Medford residents.

269
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:44,148
there's a lot of income disparity in Medford, and sometimes it can be hard to recognize how many of our residents need help with this kind of thing, and these organizations are doing that work.

270
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:54,271
The West Medford Community Center is feeding our older residents, the Mystic Valley, YMCA, Medford Community Market.

271
00:32:54,732 --> 00:33:01,534
Somebody said, I was reading the minutes, said that 40% of Medford households experience some degree of hunger,

272
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:04,424
which I found staggering.

273
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:11,805
Medford Council on Aging feeds our seniors every day, every weekday.

274
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:20,769
Housing Families is helping with like legal aid, but this is, I mean, obviously Housing Families is like a homelessness prevention and mitigation organization.

275
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:26,052
This is, these are organizations that are helping our most vulnerable residents.

276
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:34,355
And I'm really grateful for the work that's being done and appreciative for all of these groups coming out and helping our residents so much.

277
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:37,097
And there's so much that we still need to do.

278
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:47,102
and I'm also grateful for the federal department that funds CDBG and it's safe right now.

279
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:48,443
So that's great.

280
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:51,104
And hopefully it continues to be funded.

281
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:55,847
And I appreciate Laurel for coming out and doing this for us.

282
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:56,407
Thank you.

283
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,329
Thank you.

284
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,111
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by

285
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,981
Councilor saying, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

286
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:10,382
Council Kelly.

287
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,403
Vice President Collins.

288
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:14,644
That's a little Zorro.

289
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:16,464
That's a lemming.

290
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:23,127
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, Councilor saying, President bears, yes, 60 affirmative one absent.

291
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:26,248
The motion passes Councilor Collins if you could take the chair.

292
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:59,358
Paper 25-063, offered by President Behrs, resolution to request mitigation of sound and light impacts of new West Medford commuter rail platform.

293
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:12,047
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that Keolis and the MBTA reduce the light levels and sound levels at the newly installed platform at the West Medford commuter rail station, especially at non-peak travel times.

294
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:13,048
President Behrs.

295
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,591
Thank you, Madam Chair.

296
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,379
Resolution is relatively self-explanatory.

297
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,880
I know we have some residents here tonight.

298
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,142
Also notice I'm taller than Kit.

299
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:39,675
But we were all surprised, I think it's fair to say, pretty much everyone on the city side of things and local residents by

300
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:48,331
the relatively quick construction, installation and operation of a new platform at West Medford commuter rail station.

301
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:56,374
I will say that it's a long time coming to provide accessibility for all residents to the commuter rail at the West Medford stop.

302
00:35:56,935 --> 00:36:02,397
But I certainly didn't receive any communication about it before it was put in place.

303
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:09,140
And what we're seeing is that there are negative impacts on the surrounding residents from

304
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:15,971
loud sounds on the announcement system and very bright lights at times when there are not even trains running, nevermind.

305
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:20,338
You know, it's not just peak hours it's happening.

306
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,603
These reported to be happening all night sometimes.

307
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:40,698
We have constant communication issues with Keolis and the MBTA as well as DCR and MassDOT and MWRA and all the other state agencies who have infrastructure in the city of Medford, but are not particularly responsive to residents or local government.

308
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,601
So, we have some, I know there's some residents present who

309
00:36:45,341 --> 00:37:04,015
live close by to the new platform, who are facing negative impacts, and I would move that we submit this resolution to kill us and the MBTA, as well as the mayor and director Blake, so that they can use it.

310
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:14,321
in any of their own communications with the relevant parties to push them to act to improve the conditions of the platform.

311
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:15,462
Thank you.

312
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:18,464
Thank you, President Behrs.

313
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:19,665
We'll go to Councilor Lazaro.

314
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:22,980
Thank you.

315
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,463
Um, I would just like to say that it was.

316
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:35,256
I was pleasantly surprised to see the ADA improvements being made to the West Medford commuter rail station.

317
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:39,041
That being said, I knew that it was happening because.

318
00:37:40,162 --> 00:38:00,152
a friend of a friend who I took a basket weaving class with happened to mention to me that she did ADA improvements with the MBTA and they were going to be doing West Medford and I was like oh that's so weird because I'm a city councilor and I don't know anything about that and that's an insane way to learn about a thing.

319
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:18,027
So there probably should have been some kind of mechanism where anybody in the city of Medford would have been notified about something like that, especially the people that live directly across the street who may have some kind of impact on their day-to-day lives.

320
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:21,670
That station doesn't have any kind of

321
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,007
wall.

322
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:27,572
There's no trees in between the station and the people that live on that street.

323
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:37,361
There's a lot of houses, multi-family, single-family, right on that street that the train station is on.

324
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,844
And I think it's

325
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:47,047
The least we can ask is that they turn off the announcements in the middle of the night, the lights be turned down.

326
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,908
The safety measures are important.

327
00:38:50,388 --> 00:38:54,029
I just think, you know, people who are in the neighborhood should be able to talk about it.

328
00:38:54,389 --> 00:39:03,151
I think other departments have done a lot of MassDOT is doing a lot of outreach about like changing one of the intersections in Medford and doing you know 25%

329
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:14,928
planning meeting before they even think about the possibility of changing the roadway and the fact that this just happened is very frustrating.

330
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:21,052
I don't think this sort of thing would happen in a town like Wellesley, or even in a town like Arlington necessarily.

331
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:27,577
This sort of frustration, as President Behrs mentioned, does happen a lot.

332
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:37,045
I just got an email that MassDOT decided not to lower the speed limit per our request on most of the roadways that they

333
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:46,028
I have to send it around to the council still, but decided not to lower the speed limit to 25 on most of the roadways that they control in Medford for various reasons.

334
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:54,990
So even when we do try to do something to protect our residents from literal death, sometimes they just won't do it.

335
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:05,833
So we do have a lot of work to do to increase our communication with the state agencies that control the transportation mechanisms in our town.

336
00:40:06,493 --> 00:40:07,353
I think that

337
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:15,937
we have a right to request things that make the lives of our residents better and healthier.

338
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:20,659
And having comfortable, adequate sleep is a pillar of that.

339
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:27,262
So I look forward to submitting this to the MBTA.

340
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:32,644
And if we could even make I mean, make it even more powerful, I would be in favor of that.

341
00:40:32,684 --> 00:40:33,805
But this is this is also good.

342
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:34,465
Thank you.

343
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:36,566
Thank you, Councillor.

344
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,290
Going to Councilor Seng.

345
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,471
Thank you.

346
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:44,572
I'll be brief because I think President Behrs and Councilor Zahra have covered what I think.

347
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:59,536
Something that comes up again and again here on the City Council is the unresponsiveness of the State Department, KEOLAS, the MBTA when it comes to a lot of our requests.

348
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:04,377
That's not to say they're never responsive, but there certainly is a gap there.

349
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:15,121
And even though I think there's a lot of work for us to do communicating with them, I think there's a lot of work on their end as well to communicate with us about projects.

350
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:33,127
It seems like a lot of what did happen, you know, I think the community is happy that we have ADA improvements at the station, but you know, if they had told us beforehand what was coming in and told the community beforehand, the neighbors and residents there, a lot of this, you know,

351
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,452
kerfuffle could have been mitigated.

352
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:40,435
It seems like an easy step for the state to have taken on that they chose not to take.

353
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:42,657
And so we're stuck in this situation.

354
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:50,502
I do want to especially applaud President bears and Council is our for their hard work on this issue because I know they've been working very hard on this.

355
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,957
I think when we do see that responsiveness from the state, it's when we speak together as the City Council.

356
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:05,064
And so I am very grateful for this resolution tonight, because I think if we are going to get anywhere, this has to be a part of it.

357
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:09,449
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

358
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,514
Is there any further comment from Councilors on this paper?

359
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:18,183
Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

360
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:27,890
You can raise your hand on Zoom or line up in the hallway by the microphone, and I will switch between the podium and on Zoom.

361
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:33,054
Every participant should be prepared to say their name and address for the record, and then you'll have three minutes to express yourself.

362
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:33,414
Thank you.

363
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:35,456
We'll go to the podium first.

364
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:38,910
So name and address for the record, please.

365
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,690
And you'll have three minutes.

366
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:40,151
Hi.

367
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:41,833
I'll bring my neighbors with me.

368
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:42,693
I'm Libby Brown.

369
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,275
I live at 1 Usher Road in Medford.

370
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,939
So we are a direct abutters to the station.

371
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,600
So thank you very much for bringing us up tonight.

372
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:55,727
I want to start by saying I applaud the MBTA for working to provide more equitable access to public transportation.

373
00:42:56,468 --> 00:43:13,029
But I hope that goes without saying that we are glad there are improvements being made but as a designer I know that the first thing you do at the outset of a project is engage your stakeholders and incorporate their feedback when it is cost effective to do so, and in a way that builds, builds trust within the community you're working and this was a massive failure.

374
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:18,092
with respect to talking to the community, outreach with the Butters.

375
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:24,196
There was absolutely no outreach to us, and there was no public website talking about the work.

376
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:27,259
We've made multiple requests to the MBTA to ask what's going on.

377
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:27,839
We see work.

378
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:39,467
And to reference what Councilor Lozaro mentioned, in projects in Wellesley, Winchester with upgrades to their accessibility, there are websites that talk about the work.

379
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:44,449
and Medford was ignored and multiple requests for information were unanswered.

380
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:54,112
So we find ourselves with really distressing light and noise pollution that affects sleep, enjoyment of our outdoor spaces, it's blinding lights into our rooms.

381
00:43:54,252 --> 00:44:00,595
I hear throughout my house echoing announcements literally all night, every five minutes, the announcements go.

382
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:03,618
and the lights are blinding all night.

383
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:12,210
I left, we have photos in case anyone would like to see them, and I should let my neighbors speak too, but this is affecting more than just our houses on Usher Road and Playstead.

384
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,973
This is happening, I'm sure, on Johnson as well on the other side of the tracks.

385
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:16,415
Thank you.

386
00:44:16,495 --> 00:44:17,156
Thank you so much.

387
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:17,790
Yeah.

388
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:18,851
Name and address, please.

389
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:20,372
Adam Satino, OneUsher as well.

390
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,073
Thank you.

391
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:27,279
Yeah, she mentioned every five minutes, but that was this weekend, and that was a 30-second message that was going 24 hours a day.

392
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:28,600
It was on at 2 a.m.

393
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,260
It was on at 5.30 a.m.

394
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,265
Most of the time, it is every one or two minutes, there are messages.

395
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:36,647
I had lunch outside today.

396
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:37,688
Obviously, it was nice out.

397
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,891
And every one to two minutes, it was visitmbta.com.

398
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:45,919
or some welcome to West Medford, random messages that are not needed for accessibility.

399
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:47,561
Again, we're happy that it's accessible.

400
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:49,945
We use the commuter rail to commute to work.

401
00:44:50,932 --> 00:44:51,913
And that's all good.

402
00:44:52,113 --> 00:45:00,636
But at the same time, it's making a real negative impact on and it's frankly devalued the values of our properties as well in what they've done.

403
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:05,178
Thanks, Emily spare fine 37 place dead road.

404
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:14,382
I echo what my neighbors have said and we were speaking on behalf of so many of our fellow neighbors, the

405
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:19,414
Again, we really do applaud the accessibility improvements.

406
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,796
Those were a long time coming and needed.

407
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:33,224
It's the way that they happen, the lack of communication with neighbors, the lack of engaging with community members that has been really upsetting and it happened overnight.

408
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:39,869
And subsequently, the announcements that have been going on all night, all day, again,

409
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:59,831
Seemingly unnecessary information welcoming folks to West Medford at 3am waking us up in the middle of the night unnecessary noise and light pollution thinking about the environmental impacts as well should be noted that the incredibly bright lights.

410
00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:02,794
Are really distressing and.

411
00:46:04,797 --> 00:46:13,964
The other thing that I will mention that it seems to be in the last few weeks, there have been periods of fewer announcements and then periods of more announcements.

412
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:23,752
So clearly they can adjust the volume and the frequency, and more permanent solution is really needed.

413
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:28,175
And we are really grateful to everybody here for your support on this issue.

414
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:33,580
So thank you so much in helping us elevate this issue for all of us.

415
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:41,084
Yeah, and just for context, we've provided a lot of information to all of you on what's in their own specs of what they say.

416
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:46,685
For the lighting, they recommend 5 to 10 foot candles for ramps and platforms.

417
00:46:47,345 --> 00:46:48,185
I bought a light meter.

418
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:50,966
It's 35 to 50 foot candles is the average.

419
00:46:51,486 --> 00:46:53,226
So it's obviously there's way too many lights.

420
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:55,127
I was out there today.

421
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,827
There's four speakers on each platform.

422
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,107
There's a speaker every five feet.

423
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:02,328
That's way more than necessary to hear any of these announcements on there.

424
00:47:03,835 --> 00:47:09,177
To Emily's point, they did go down for a while, and we could barely hear them, and they were much less frequent.

425
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,979
But then they come back, and it's like, is this going to be a constant battle of back and forth?

426
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:19,601
So we need some sort of guarantee that there's going to be a permanent fix for this, and also a resolution of what the lights are.

427
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:31,866
I would actually recommend if we could get them to turn the announcements off until they do sit down with us and have a discussion on what the appropriate volume is and what they're going to do about the lighting mitigation, if that's possible.

428
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:35,470
Thank you so much.

429
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,492
Thank you.

430
00:47:36,512 --> 00:47:38,517
I appreciate your testimony for putting this on the record.

431
00:47:38,537 --> 00:47:41,725
I'll go back to President Thares and then back to the podium.

432
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:45,698
Okay, great.

433
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,980
I just want to kind of add to what they were saying.

434
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,322
I'm sorry, I do have to ask your address.

435
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,805
I 315 boss now in Madrid.

436
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:55,446
Yeah.

437
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:57,568
Um, but anyways, my name is Sabrina here.

438
00:47:58,289 --> 00:47:59,890
And I use the T a lot.

439
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,831
I'm disabled.

440
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:03,993
So I do appreciate the ADA improvements.

441
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:04,253
And I do.

442
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:08,069
We do walk late at night.

443
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:13,812
And so I do appreciate the lights, but they're, even for me, it's like, they're way too bright.

444
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:20,336
And the last train is like 1230 or one or something like that.

445
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:23,237
There's no reason for another train.

446
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:24,398
Thank you so much.

447
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,279
I really appreciate that.

448
00:48:26,399 --> 00:48:30,902
There's no train, no reason for the announcements to go after the last train is gone.

449
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,243
Shut them off.

450
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:34,748
And then turn the lights dimmer.

451
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:38,609
I know you don't want to drive graffiti and such, but turn the lights dimmer.

452
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:41,950
You don't want people getting assaulted, turn the lights dimmer.

453
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:46,270
Oh my God, you could light up a stadium with these lights.

454
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,451
It's insane.

455
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:59,713
So I just wanted to add on top of what they were saying, as a non-resident of that area, I do appreciate the ADA, but I don't appreciate how bright it is.

456
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,353
Because if I had a migraine issue,

457
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:03,875
So that's it.

458
00:49:04,616 --> 00:49:05,598
Just wanted to add on.

459
00:49:06,379 --> 00:49:07,480
Thank you so much for your comments.

460
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,124
All right, we got one more hand on Zoom.

461
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:17,675
Jen, name and address for the record, please.

462
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:28,758
Okay, I think we've got it.

463
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:49,767
Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street in West Medford, and I use the commuter rail a lot too, and I was pleased to see the accessible platforms, but I certainly support the council in pushing for a more reasonable

464
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:57,059
situation as regards the lights and the announcements and involving the community.

465
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:07,791
This brings me to a related issue, which is the T stop and bus stops at the Medford Tufts Green Line station.

466
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:10,313
This has been a pet peeve of mine for a long time.

467
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,517
The bus stop, if you're arriving on the

468
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:15,458
Green line.

469
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:19,379
The bus stop for the 94 and the 80 is not visible.

470
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:20,379
It's that far away.

471
00:50:20,399 --> 00:50:23,780
And there's no signage to tell you where it is.

472
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:27,321
If you have any problem walking, you won't get there.

473
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:33,843
If you manage to get there, you will have to surmount a concrete barrier to get on the bus.

474
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:41,005
And in the other direction, when you're coming from West Medford to the train station,

475
00:50:41,894 --> 00:50:47,160
Again, the bus stop is so far away from the train station, you can barely see where it is.

476
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:52,206
And then you have to cross the street and walk to the train station.

477
00:50:52,226 --> 00:51:02,677
So if we're trying to get people to use public transportation, this is definitely not going to encourage people, especially people that have baby carriages, problems walking, walkers.

478
00:51:03,302 --> 00:51:05,084
that you just can't do it.

479
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:17,716
So I just wanted to add that when you're addressing the MBTA and Keolis that this is a really important issue in addition to what's going on in the West Medford train station.

480
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:18,977
So thank you very much.

481
00:51:18,997 --> 00:51:23,521
Great, thank you, Jennifer.

482
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:27,425
I'll go back to President Behrs and then Councilor Leving.

483
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:32,247
Thank you, Chair Collins.

484
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:44,667
Thank you to the local residents who came out tonight and who have been emailing Keolis and the city and collecting all this information and buying light meters and doing all of the

485
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:55,693
work that I think, you know, really should be on Keolis as our privatized commuter rail operator, making a profit off of our public infrastructure to do.

486
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:59,077
That's an aside that I will now stop but

487
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:04,207
You know, we have had constant issues.

488
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,189
Like, I hear the desire for a guarantee.

489
00:52:06,229 --> 00:52:07,009
I want a guarantee.

490
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:07,990
We all want a guarantee.

491
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:21,141
We spent six months with your neighbors on the other side, on the Bower Street side with the rail ties issue when they were re-putting the new rail ties in and like off-gassing.

492
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:23,923
And it's just a horrible situation.

493
00:52:23,983 --> 00:52:24,764
That was horrible too.

494
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:29,247
And it's like, we're back here right again with Keolis and the T both.

495
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,389
Um, you know, we kept on them for that.

496
00:52:32,409 --> 00:52:33,569
We're going to keep on them for this.

497
00:52:34,749 --> 00:52:36,330
It really sucks.

498
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,690
That's really mostly what I'm saying.

499
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,591
It's just, it really sucks.

500
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:42,792
And we're going to keep on them, but I don't know, um, how fast they're going to move on it.

501
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,933
I think the suggestion of like, let's shut this off until we get it.

502
00:52:45,973 --> 00:52:46,113
Right.

503
00:52:46,153 --> 00:52:50,875
But the most, most frustrating part for me of what you were saying is just the change.

504
00:52:50,915 --> 00:52:56,257
Like you can't even expect, or you, you had a change, like things got better and then they got worse again.

505
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:57,277
And that's kind of the,

506
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:08,459
You know, I'm sure it's not intentional or whatever, but it's a gaslighting right like you're now not secure in your own home about like what to expect from day to day, week to week.

507
00:53:10,113 --> 00:53:18,699
I am hopeful that we can try to communicate with them more immediately to just at least go back to the conditions that were a little bit better and then actually engage with you.

508
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:28,205
But I, you know, mostly I'm kind of just being bad news, Zack, and just saying it's really tough to engage with them.

509
00:53:28,265 --> 00:53:31,787
And we've had a lot of problems with Keolis along the line for a while.

510
00:53:31,987 --> 00:53:33,468
So we're here, we're going to keep fighting.

511
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:35,490
And it's really frustrating so many

512
00:53:37,452 --> 00:53:38,893
just so many problems coming out of them.

513
00:53:39,054 --> 00:53:45,178
So thank you for advocating on behalf of your neighbors and being here tonight, and for all the information you've given us to try to help.

514
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:59,649
And to Jen's point around Medford-Tufts, I do believe we're getting a redesign of that section of Boston Avenue because of the Tufts Dormitory project that's going to get rid of the

515
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:06,922
the concrete, the strange curb, not curb thing that blocks access to cars and buses.

516
00:54:07,602 --> 00:54:15,948
So that's still, it's going to be some time, but I think the Medford Tufts issue is going to get somewhat worked out, at least in terms of access.

517
00:54:15,988 --> 00:54:17,709
I'm not sure about the bus stop placement.

518
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,432
And just wanted to put that information out there.

519
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:21,932
Thank you.

520
00:54:23,253 --> 00:54:24,054
Great, thank you.

521
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,635
Go to Councilor Lemming.

522
00:54:27,435 --> 00:54:35,833
I was just gonna echo Council President Behr's sentiments and saying that thanking the residents for coming out here and advocating.

523
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:40,656
on behalf of this clear case of noise and light pollution.

524
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:58,859
I remember during the campaign when I was going around knocking doors, I spoke to a fellow on Circus Street, who's like right next to the commuter rail line, and he was talking about noise pollution, just keeping him up all the time.

525
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:06,221
And I think the solution to that would have been installing a sound barrier, which could have been

526
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:08,750
you know, very pricey but I

527
00:55:10,313 --> 00:55:38,052
hope that they'll be able to do that but I mean this case especially after looking at your photos just it just seems very addressable like turn down the noise at three in the morning and uh you know don't have don't don't have uh the lights as bright as they are at that time period and I think that's that's what's particularly frustrating to me is that this just doesn't seem like one of those problems that takes like a lot of money to solve it just really takes

528
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:48,318
and a position of authority actually listening to you and acceding to these very reasonable requests.

529
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:52,200
So I hope that we are able to get something out of this.

530
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,502
Yeah, this seems absurd.

531
00:55:54,522 --> 00:56:00,365
Thank you, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Lozaro.

532
00:56:02,412 --> 00:56:02,732
Thank you.

533
00:56:02,752 --> 00:56:11,861
I just wanted to offer a slightly less doom and gloom perspective, if that's possible.

534
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:14,883
I do think we can fix this.

535
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:18,326
This feels very fixable to me.

536
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:20,268
It feels like a switch.

537
00:56:21,304 --> 00:56:31,048
genuinely, like, I don't think the MBTA has genuinely like any reason to make this continue happening at all.

538
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:37,571
So if it's a matter of like, I feel passionately about turning it off.

539
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:42,113
And I think the majority of the council does.

540
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:44,854
We can achieve this, I feel strongly.

541
00:56:45,434 --> 00:56:47,235
So I think it'll be okay.

542
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:47,815
I think it's okay.

543
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:50,304
Thank you for bringing it to our attention.

544
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:52,985
If it doesn't happen soon enough, please email us again.

545
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:54,806
We got you.

546
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:01,710
Thank you, Councilor Lozano and my fellow colleagues.

547
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:04,432
And thank you again to the constituents who

548
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,210
have been spending I'm sure hours and hours of your time that you really shouldn't have to not only not sleeping at night, but also advocating to kill us in the MBTA to make this very simple fix it is.

549
00:57:18,312 --> 00:57:24,158
Like very, very obvious that there's no reason to have such bright lights and such loud noise on when the train is not even.

550
00:57:24,785 --> 00:57:29,928
running and I share your total frustration that it is so hard to get such a simple thing rectified.

551
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,589
So I'm sorry for what you're going through.

552
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:32,650
Thank you for involving us.

553
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,971
We will continue to advocate with you.

554
00:57:36,592 --> 00:57:43,616
It's nice when a seemingly simple problem comes our way, but it's frustrating when it's not as quick to fix as it should be.

555
00:57:45,638 --> 00:57:47,519
So please keep us informed.

556
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:48,239
Thank you for being here.

557
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,121
So go back to President Behrs.

558
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:59,325
I just wanted to thank Councilor Zara for her first term energy, and I hope it is always our all terms energy eventually.

559
00:58:01,665 --> 00:58:02,145
Point taken.

560
00:58:06,227 --> 00:58:07,127
Was very refreshing.

561
00:58:08,107 --> 00:58:13,769
Also had the benefit of derailing me from the anti-keyless, anti-privatization rant that I was preparing in my head.

562
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:14,450
Nobody needs that.

563
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:15,250
Not today.

564
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,830
Some other time.

565
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:31,016
On the motion of President Behrs to approve and submit to Keolis and the MBTA and the city administration, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

566
00:58:32,377 --> 00:58:33,038
All in favor?

567
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:33,138
Aye.

568
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:34,740
All opposed?

569
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:36,262
Motion passes.

570
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:36,863
Thank you.

571
00:58:51,803 --> 00:58:55,224
Communications from the Mayor, 25061.

572
00:58:56,424 --> 00:58:57,804
Submitted by Mayor Marianne Legault-Kern.

573
00:58:57,844 --> 00:59:02,226
Request for food truck permits for trolley dogs, May through July at Hormel Stadium.

575
00:59:13,908 --> 00:59:18,129

576
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:20,090

579
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:46,683
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

580
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,345
Sincerely bringing the live up here in mayor.

581
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,967
Do we have any discussion by members of the council?

582
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:58,092
And we also representative of Boston glory here, seeing no immediate questions from members of the council.

583
00:59:58,112 --> 01:00:00,293
We'll go to Peter from Boston glory, Peter.

584
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:00,634
How are you?

585
01:00:01,374 --> 01:00:02,375
I'm fantastic.

586
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:04,517
And don't need to take any of your time.

587
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,318
If, if possible, we'd just love to,

588
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:09,010
get these permits approved and have our Frisbee games.

589
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:10,830
Fantastic.

590
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:11,110
Yes.

591
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:20,252
And if there's anything else you want to add about the, the ultimate Frisbee association and what you guys do, we're happy to lend you our platform for this minute or two.

592
01:00:20,272 --> 01:00:24,874
Uh, only thing I'll say is that we have six times a year.

593
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:25,794
We play at Horned Owl.

594
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,955
We have a ton of fun and I would encourage everybody to come out.

595
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:33,576
It's, it's a great thing for kids and we have a beer garden, so it's not so bad for adults.

596
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:34,116
And, uh,

597
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:36,567
We'd really like to see you.

598
01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:41,529
And it's an amazing sport played by world-class athletes.

599
01:00:41,549 --> 01:00:43,790
So hopefully some of you will be able to come and see us.

600
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,390
And thank you for the opportunity.

601
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:48,551
Awesome.

602
01:00:48,571 --> 01:00:49,311
Thank you so much.

603
01:00:49,752 --> 01:00:50,952
I'm going to Councillor Callaghan.

604
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:52,254
Thank you.

605
01:00:52,274 --> 01:01:04,486
I have to say, I have attended one of the Boston Glory games at Hartmell Stadium with my kid, and it was amazing to see all these kids like racing back and forth down the edge of the field with these gigantic flags going by.

606
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:06,047
And of course, the Frisbee was also good.

607
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:09,751
I enjoyed it very much, and I highly recommend it to everybody.

608
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:13,294
Fantastic.

609
01:01:13,714 --> 01:01:14,035
All right.

610
01:01:14,135 --> 01:01:16,217
And the clerk enjoys it as well.

611
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:19,446
He tells me some things when we're standing up here.

612
01:01:20,787 --> 01:01:25,870
I'm never sure if he wants me to say it or not, but in this case, I know that he enjoys Frisbee.

613
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:29,712
Any further discussion by members of the council?

614
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:36,496
Any further comments by Peter or any members of the public on this matter?

615
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:44,600
Seeing none, on the motion to approve by

616
01:01:45,427 --> 01:01:47,929
Councillor Khan, seconded by Councillor Sang.

617
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:49,731
All those in favor?

618
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:51,032
Opposed?

619
01:01:51,052 --> 01:01:52,033
The motion passes.

620
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:52,993
Thank you.

621
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:53,914
Thank you all very much.

622
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:54,735
Thank you all very much.

623
01:01:54,755 --> 01:01:59,439
25064 submitted by Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

624
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:02,802
Appropriation of free cash and rescission of loan order.

625
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:12,133
One second here.

626
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:15,694
Going through all these food permits.

627
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:28,101
There we go.

628
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:52,555
Dear President bears and members of the City Council regarding free cash appropriation and loan order rescission on school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $5 million and zero cents of free cash for the purpose of replacing boilers and cooling systems with new condensing boilers and heat pumps including associated automated controls and structural and architectural work

629
01:02:53,496 --> 01:03:05,727
electrical work and weatherization at the McGlynn School and Andrews School, and the acquisition and installation of solar panels and a new roof or roof repairs at the McGlynn School, including the cost of planning, design, architecture, and engineering services, and all other costs incidental and related thereto.

630
01:03:06,308 --> 01:03:17,037
And rescind the $5,000,000.00 cent loan order under Resolution 24510, which was approved in the third reading at the City Council's January 14, 2025 meeting and closed as an original copy of the loan order.

631
01:03:17,871 --> 01:03:36,318
This appropriation of free cash will allow the city to reduce the amount to be permanently borrowed in the future to save an estimated $300,000 per year in the FY 27 budget, and for the term of the loan, the total project cost of $30,775,000 without a free cash appropriation would add to the city budget an estimated $1.834 million per year for 30 years.

632
01:03:36,918 --> 01:03:38,278
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

633
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,479
Respectfully submitted, Brian Olingo, current mayor.

634
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,280
Just gonna say two things before we move on.

635
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,881
This, number one,

636
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:56,504
We do have eligible for third reading the loan order for the rest of this tonight, so maybe we take that up right after this so that we can have the discussions together and we don't have to come back and provide the context again.

637
01:03:56,524 --> 01:04:02,789
The other thing I want to say is, when we were talking about a question six in.

638
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:04,851
last November.

639
01:04:05,572 --> 01:04:08,454
This is exactly the reason why question six was on the ballot.

640
01:04:08,935 --> 01:04:23,288
You can see that a project of this guy size about $30 million, which is what the new fire station was about expected to cost has an impact of 1.834 million on the city's annual operating budget.

641
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:25,290
So that is, you know,

642
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,821
That is what we lost with the loss of that.

643
01:04:28,941 --> 01:04:33,942
The city budget, as we discussed earlier at our committee of the whole meeting, continues to be very tight.

644
01:04:34,802 --> 01:04:41,764
If the overrides hadn't passed, we would have been talking about drastic and significant cuts across the school system and our city departments.

645
01:04:42,604 --> 01:04:54,587
And with the projects needed in our schools, the city budget, as it currently stands, is facing a nearly $2 million annual impact from a project of this size and scale.

646
01:04:56,607 --> 01:05:09,287
You know, we're going to talk about the specifics here, but that's the larger context of the essentially continuing tight budgets and significant needs of our community when it comes to capital improvements.

647
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:19,176
With that, just talking specifically about using free cash instead of the loan order to save an estimated $300,000 per year in debt repayments.

648
01:05:19,897 --> 01:05:28,402
Is there anything you'd like to add, Director Dickinson, and we also have Superintendent Cushing and Brenda Pike as well, and maybe some folks from the design team, I'm not sure.

649
01:05:30,082 --> 01:05:32,064
Oh, there you go.

650
01:05:32,104 --> 01:05:32,764
There you go.

651
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:34,085
I'm on.

652
01:05:34,325 --> 01:05:35,706
It's fairly straightforward.

653
01:05:35,946 --> 01:05:39,348
If we use some free cash here, we can

654
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:56,019
The, the, the way that this project is working is that we had, we had to have $5 million, one way or the other, before the end of the fiscal year so that we could actually

655
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,963
purchase pre-purchase the equipment necessary for the HVAC system because there's a lead time to that.

656
01:06:02,663 --> 01:06:04,324
It's going to be installed this summer.

657
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:15,949
We put together this loan with the idea that we would do a short-term loan for the five million dollars in order to get the equipment funded before the end of the year.

658
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:20,852
This would allow us to not actually get that loan

659
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:28,013
we cover the $5 million we need before the end of the year with the fiscal 2024 free cash.

660
01:06:29,837 --> 01:06:32,602
That means we're not looking at a debt payment

661
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:34,306
It gets a little weedy.

662
01:06:35,086 --> 01:06:38,367
Everything I say gets a little weedy, doesn't it?

663
01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:48,849
If we borrowed $5 million, we're looking at about 4% interest rate on a one-year short-term note.

664
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:52,310
So that's $200,000 that would be in our fiscal 2026 budget.

665
01:06:52,950 --> 01:07:00,032
If we cover this with free cash, we don't have to put that into our fiscal 2026 budget, which would be nice.

666
01:07:00,952 --> 01:07:01,112
Then,

667
01:07:02,244 --> 01:07:21,335
this summer, I'm already working with the treasurer and the contractors to figure out when exactly we would need to do the short-term note for the entire amount of the loan order that you're doing the third reading for today, probably mid-August.

668
01:07:22,396 --> 01:07:27,739
Then that would be a short-term note for a year by the time August of 2020.

669
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:38,920
six rolls around, we would know exactly how much the project actually had cost, and we would go out and get a long-term note for that amount.

670
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,621
It would be a 30-year note.

671
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:39,681
At 25,775,

672
01:07:48,403 --> 01:08:00,652
we're looking at right now they're looking at about four and a quarter percent so that's 1.5 million dollars added to our debt service budget for fiscal 2027.

673
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:14,582
It's a lot it takes up the piece of the pie that debt takes up is expanding so after going through this a lot this is really

674
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:18,976
I think the best way we could fund this project.

675
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:24,363
Thank you, Director Dickinson.

676
01:08:24,403 --> 01:08:26,045
I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

677
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:29,510
Thank you.

678
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:30,552
Let me know if I'm

679
01:08:31,255 --> 01:08:42,524
reading this correctly, that the one that we approved before, which is for a loan for $5 million with the estimated total project to be an additional $20 million, so $25 million total.

680
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:51,010
And then in this one, it says the $5 million still, but that the total project cost instead of being $25 million looks like $30,775,000.

681
01:08:53,772 --> 01:08:58,713
And because it looks more detailed, perhaps there has already been some planning or a little bit better estimation.

682
01:08:59,133 --> 01:09:07,755
Is that just the, am I correct in that that is an increase in the guesstimate on the total project cost or am I being that wrong or?

683
01:09:10,976 --> 01:09:14,477
We do have the superintendent and Brenda if you want to.

684
01:09:15,437 --> 01:09:18,218
We had a presentation when we did the loan order on April 8th.

685
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:20,567
that the total project cost was $30,775,000.

686
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:23,848
Is it just an updated number from what originally it was?

687
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:30,049
There were some factors that went into it that Peter and Brenda, Bob, obviously, if you want to go first, but there.

688
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:30,589
That's fine.

689
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:34,950
That's basically all I wanted to know, was this is a sort of updated project cost?

690
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:42,231
If we want to get into the breakdown of the project costs, I would defer to Brenda Pike for that.

691
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:46,652
Just checking in that I'm understanding that correctly.

692
01:09:46,672 --> 01:09:47,472
The total amount would be

693
01:09:48,537 --> 01:09:57,125
If this is approved and the third reading is approved, the total amount would be $5 million in free cash, $25,775 in borrowing.

694
01:09:57,145 --> 01:09:57,825
Great.

695
01:09:58,786 --> 01:09:59,026
Thanks.

696
01:09:59,567 --> 01:09:59,807
Great.

697
01:10:00,067 --> 01:10:01,989
Do we want to do a Peter and Brenda?

698
01:10:04,711 --> 01:10:11,658
If they feel that what you said is accurate, that's all I was asking was like, this is like an updated amount from that original one that we've passed back in.

699
01:10:12,522 --> 01:10:20,317
December yeah I think if you wanted to speak to it really quickly Brenda thank you when you came to us in early April there had been some escalations that required the total

700
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:21,978
I'll let you speak to it.

701
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:22,579
Go ahead.

702
01:10:22,599 --> 01:10:23,319
Yeah, absolutely.

703
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:34,083
And the majority of that increase is actually in some projections for things that we actually don't know right now, but we're holding in contingency.

704
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:40,146
So for instance, the effect of tariffs on the project, that's still very uncertain.

705
01:10:41,766 --> 01:10:50,470
And the potential for second shift work in order to meet our schedule if there are any delays.

706
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:58,560
And then there's also has been a slight increase in cost for the ADA requirements for the project.

707
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:00,701
Thank you.

708
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,203
Great, thank you.

709
01:11:06,505 --> 01:11:08,807
Any further questions for Director Dickinson?

710
01:11:14,244 --> 01:11:18,185
Seeing none, and just so I understand, oh, you want to go, Councilor Collins?

711
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:18,605
No.

712
01:11:20,786 --> 01:11:22,386
I just had one question.

713
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:32,509
So just so I understand the mechanics of it, we approved the loan order, which allowed the spending to start on procuring supplies for that $5 million pre.

714
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:33,390
Right.

715
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:39,071
There's not going to be any delay or pause in the project by moving from the loan order to the free cash is essentially what my question is.

716
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:39,591
No.

717
01:11:40,472 --> 01:11:40,692
Great.

718
01:11:41,092 --> 01:11:41,352
All right.

719
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:46,127
Seeing no further questions from the council, is there a motion on the floor?

720
01:11:46,147 --> 01:11:48,012
Vice President Collins.

721
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:55,593
Thank you, and thank you for being here, Bob, and thank you, Brenda, on Zoom for being present to answer the council's questions.

722
01:11:56,293 --> 01:12:00,315
I think that the introduction to why this paper is before us kind of speaks for itself.

723
01:12:00,355 --> 01:12:11,420
It makes a lot of, it makes, to me, all the sense in the world that we're funding this project and we've been talking about it for many months, and I know that the team kind of preparing the project has been talking about it for a lot longer than that.

724
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,803
Thank you again to PDS staff and Peter Cushing, and given that

725
01:12:19,356 --> 01:12:22,203
I'm sure that we'll talk a lot more about free cash this budget season.

726
01:12:22,263 --> 01:12:26,534
I think that this is an unambiguously good way to spend this pot of $5 million.

727
01:12:26,554 --> 01:12:26,755
It will

728
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:39,532
it will relieve a lot of pressure on our FY26 or FY27 budget and budgets going forward to not have that further increase our debt service payments.

729
01:12:40,913 --> 01:12:46,495
We are, I think, fortunate to be able to spend free cash on this very worthy and necessary project.

730
01:12:46,515 --> 01:12:56,758
And I'm glad that it will have beneficial effects on our future operating budgets as well, because we all know how we continue to be hard pressed to use those dollars elsewhere in our operating budgets.

731
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:58,218
So I would motion to approve.

732
01:12:58,867 --> 01:13:03,349
for first reading a motion to this is an appropriation for cash.

733
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:05,330
It's not doesn't require multiple readings.

734
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:13,474
So it's a motion to approve the request for appropriation from the mayor and the rescission of the loan order by Vice President Collins, seconded by Council Zorro.

735
01:13:14,294 --> 01:13:16,275
Any further discussion on that motion by members of the council?

736
01:13:18,411 --> 01:13:21,334
Seeing none, is there any discussion on the motion by members of the public?

737
01:13:21,394 --> 01:13:24,216
I see one person here in the chamber.

738
01:13:24,757 --> 01:13:30,101
If there's anyone on Zoom who'd like to speak, please raise your hand and we'll go to you next, but we'll start at the podium.

739
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:31,883
Name and address for the record.

740
01:13:33,904 --> 01:13:37,227
And you'll have three minutes plus as much time as it takes to get the timer.

741
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,162
Good evening Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

742
01:13:46,162 --> 01:13:57,850
So for the members of the public who might not be following, Mayor's asking that money be appropriated from our free cash fund, essentially over budgeted money to pay for HVAC and roof work at the McGlynn and Andrews.

743
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,572
Mayor's asking for $5 million to do that.

744
01:14:02,433 --> 01:14:06,555
Another item on the agenda tonight, there's another letter from her asking for almost $200,000

745
01:14:08,422 --> 01:14:13,905
for security upgrades across the public schools also coming from the free cash fund.

746
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:20,950
The second letter says that the balance of free cash at our disposal is over $27.5 million.

747
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:32,117
And it says in that first letter that if we don't make this appropriation using our free cash, an additional almost $2 million per year would be added to the city budget for the next 30 years.

748
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:43,629
That quote on our current free cash balance is even more than what the latest data available on the Department of Revenue's website indicates Medford has in certified free cash.

749
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:52,491
We heard repeatedly during the override campaign arguments against the use of free cash to help meet our school's financial needs.

750
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:57,291
We were told it wasn't a feasible substitute for raising taxes.

751
01:14:58,652 --> 01:15:00,372
I find it ironic that now we're

752
01:15:00,934 --> 01:15:09,557
almost half a year out from that election that we're proposing to do exactly what was said we cannot do, and that is using free cash to meet school funding needs.

753
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:13,338
So I acknowledge there's a little bit of nuance to the arguments.

754
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:19,380
Some said it was possible to use free cash, but not for long-term needs, and that's fair enough.

755
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:29,343
But when we look at things like what is being proposed here, so infrastructure improvements that are intended to last in the long-term, it's hard for me to grasp

756
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:36,800
how this wouldn't be an appropriation of free cash for long term school needs, which again we were told we could not do.

757
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,504
That is all I have to say thank you.

758
01:15:40,606 --> 01:15:41,026
Thank you.

759
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:41,787
Yeah, I think.

760
01:15:43,158 --> 01:15:58,105
you know, to the point, and I was gonna bring this up as we moved through this, the distinction that we were making, or at least that I was making, was not between long-term and short-term needs, it was between recurring expenses and one-time expenses.

761
01:15:59,026 --> 01:16:10,371
And, you know, where free cash is a fund that happens because either the city raises more money than it expected, or spends less money than expected, or in some years, maybe both,

762
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:19,382
It's not reliable recurring revenue, so it shouldn't ever be used to fund recurring expenses that need to be funded on an ongoing basis.

763
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:27,726
And what we're talking about here, and with the paper that the commenter mentioned, are one-time capital expenses.

764
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:30,588
And that's what reserve funds should be used for.

765
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:40,873
Not things like the best teachers contract that the city's ever seen that was funded by the new recurring revenue from the question seven and eight override.

766
01:16:43,602 --> 01:16:56,609
Do we have any further discussion by members of the public on the appropriation of free cash for the HVAC program at the Andrews and see none.

767
01:16:57,669 --> 01:17:08,995
We have the motion from Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazaro to approve the appropriation Mr. Please call the roll.

768
01:17:13,403 --> 01:17:21,729
Vice President Collins, Councilor Lozaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli is absent, Councilor San Buenaventura, President Behrs.

769
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,772
Yes, affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

770
01:17:26,173 --> 01:17:29,295
Vice Chair Lemming, Councilor Lemming,

771
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:39,907
Motion to- This is vice chair or something, we all- I don't remember.

772
01:17:41,027 --> 01:17:42,848
Planning and permitting committee, vice chair that.

773
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:50,350
But no, motion to suspend the rules and take 25-050 off the table.

774
01:17:50,831 --> 01:17:56,973
On the motion to take paper 25050 off the table by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang.

775
01:17:56,993 --> 01:17:57,873
All those in favor?

776
01:17:57,893 --> 01:17:57,953
Aye.

777
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:00,854
All those in favor?

778
01:18:02,454 --> 01:18:15,481
All opposed motion passes to 5050 loan order 25 million 775,000 school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds supplemental in city council April 8 2025 approved for first reading advertised April 18 2025 Boston Herald in city council April 29 2025 eligible for third reading.

779
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,807
This is the loan order we just talked about.

780
01:18:26,087 --> 01:18:28,728
Is there a motion on the floor?

781
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:30,389
Motion to approve.

782
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:36,351
On the motion to approve for third reading by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

783
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:37,731
Is there any further discussion?

784
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:39,432
Oh, by Vice President Collins.

785
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:41,733
Is there any further discussion?

786
01:18:44,174 --> 01:18:48,695
Seeing no discussion by Councilors, we will go to discussion by members of the public.

787
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:51,716
You can either come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

788
01:18:51,736 --> 01:18:52,957
I do see

789
01:18:53,923 --> 01:18:58,964
Mr. Castagnetti, Mr. Castagnetti, I will request you to unmute and you will have three minutes.

790
01:18:59,084 --> 01:19:00,805
Name and address for the record, please.

791
01:19:02,065 --> 01:19:04,326
Hello, counselor, am I on?

792
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:06,607
You are on, yes.

793
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:08,687
And this is about the HVAC loan order.

794
01:19:09,407 --> 01:19:13,228
Yes, I have my hand up for the previous one, but this all ties in.

795
01:19:14,829 --> 01:19:18,670
I wanna say the previous speaker that spoke, Nick, he made some good points.

796
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:22,571
Like before we couldn't use the free cash and now we can.

797
01:19:25,389 --> 01:19:27,431
I still think he made some great points there.

798
01:19:28,212 --> 01:19:37,581
And also, if I'm understanding this properly, we're going to spend $30 million for capital improvements for the two schools.

799
01:19:38,522 --> 01:19:40,984
Two schools, yes.

800
01:19:41,324 --> 01:19:41,645
Yes.

801
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:44,988
That seems like an eye-popping number.

802
01:19:45,749 --> 01:19:47,751
I'm sure the two new schools

803
01:19:48,693 --> 01:19:55,396
when they were new in the year 2000, didn't cost $30 million to build both of them, you know, combined.

804
01:19:56,717 --> 01:20:01,319
I guess I'm in, I'm back in the times, but this is a huge number.

805
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:03,760
I wish us luck.

806
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,360
Thank you.

807
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:06,681
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

808
01:20:06,721 --> 01:20:11,003
Definitely agree that it's a significant number and a major impact on the city budget.

809
01:20:12,804 --> 01:20:17,186
I can point you towards the, I think this is our fourth

810
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:32,747
meeting between a regular meeting and city council committee the whole maybe our fifth meeting where we've heard from Assistant Superintendent Cushing and Planner Brenda Pike and the team working on this about

811
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:43,811
why this project is necessary and what they've done, which is extensive work to mitigate the cost and be cost conscious for our residents.

812
01:20:43,891 --> 01:21:01,177
So, you know, there's a lot of stuff in the record, meeting recordings, meeting minutes and documentation on the school's website and on the council's website that I just want to point residents towards to better understand the project more than what we've talked about tonight.

813
01:21:02,243 --> 01:21:07,084
It's just it's an incredibly big number, you know, just for capital improvements.

814
01:21:07,664 --> 01:21:15,326
And as a matter of fact, I believe when Michael McGlynn was mayor, he got the state to give us that land by the Andrews and McGlynn.

815
01:21:15,946 --> 01:21:20,787
And I believe we had like half a dozen new schools built back then.

816
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:26,408
And I don't think it cost us one dime because we sold the old schools at that time.

817
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:30,109
So this is like very, very, very huge number.

818
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:30,809
I'm concerned.

819
01:21:31,478 --> 01:21:32,319
Thank you for listening.

820
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:33,780
Thank you.

821
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,483
I'll go to Councilor Lemming and then Councilor Callahan.

822
01:21:38,983 --> 01:21:39,564
Councilor Lemming.

823
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:57,477
Well, Council President Berest, I feel like this might not have been adequately explained before, but free cash is used for one-time expenses and the overrides were for ongoing expenses like salaries.

824
01:21:57,557 --> 01:21:58,658
So I know that

825
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:14,265
You know, we here have not made that point sufficiently clear in the past, but the purpose of the overrides was to pay salaries, whereas this free cash is used for a one-time capital expense.

826
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,186
So that's the distinction.

827
01:22:16,486 --> 01:22:24,849
And again, I understand that you may have not explained that just now, but I feel the need to say that myself.

828
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:27,570
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

829
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:29,473
Thanks.

830
01:22:29,834 --> 01:22:34,076
I appreciate the, you know, noticing that this is a big number.

831
01:22:34,756 --> 01:22:43,220
And I will say that when I was going over this item with some of my volunteers that helped me to go through what's on the city council agenda.

832
01:22:44,181 --> 01:22:51,004
We all noticed that this was a big number and one of my volunteers actually did a little bit of research and looked at what other cities have paid for

833
01:22:52,785 --> 01:23:00,868
you know, things like replacing roofs on schools, things like HVAC systems on schools, things like, you know, replacing air conditioning or whatever it might be.

834
01:23:01,288 --> 01:23:07,330
And while there was a fair-sized range, this number did not stand out as unusual.

835
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:08,571
It was not on the high end.

836
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:09,691
It was not on the low end.

837
01:23:09,711 --> 01:23:15,193
It kind of sat in the middle of what other school districts do spend for this kind of repair.

838
01:23:15,733 --> 01:23:36,743
So I think that's a, it's a perfectly reasonable question to answer, or to ask, and, and I, you know, we did ask and we looked around and least got sort of that sort of lay person's understanding of yes, this is what it generally costs in Massachusetts to do this kind of work.

839
01:23:37,383 --> 01:23:59,938
Um, and then the thing that I would like to say about free cash, um, and I echo other city councilors' statements that, um, you know, the Massachusetts state has, um, it has resources for city councilors to understand how to properly use, uh, their money, and it does say that it really

840
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:07,167
No city should be using free cash or stabilization funds for operating budget.

841
01:24:08,348 --> 01:24:20,559
And so this is why we had overrides was to increase our operating budget that we can spend, as people are saying, on ongoing expenses that we have to budget for every year and that if that

842
01:24:20,919 --> 01:24:23,982
If the amount of money ran out, we would be in deep trouble.

843
01:24:24,383 --> 01:24:37,977
So that's the reasoning why it is not just people sitting in the city council that think that it is the state that thinks that it is the credit agencies that think that if you spend all of your free cash if you don't have free cash the end of each year.

844
01:24:38,598 --> 01:24:43,641
then if your amount of free cash gets too low, then your credit rating goes down.

845
01:24:43,741 --> 01:24:48,283
So it is really important that we do these things correctly.

846
01:24:48,303 --> 01:24:54,447
But what I'm also excited about with free cash is I'm really happy that we are spending

847
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:58,309
$5 million of our free cash on this project.

848
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:24,349
And I really want to know from the administration, and I know that there's discussions happening between city councilors and city council leadership and the administration, but I am very excited to hear what the plans are for spending the amount of our free cash and capital stabilization funds that is above the recommended amount that we maintain in those funds.

849
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:29,552
Because I do think we have more than the recommended amount that you need to maintain.

850
01:25:29,953 --> 01:25:32,134
And we obviously have capital projects.

851
01:25:32,174 --> 01:25:38,038
Just this one capital project would wipe out all of free cash if we use free cash for this project.

852
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,301
Our roads have tens of millions of dollars of road debt.

853
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:46,925
We have many, many capital projects that need money.

854
01:25:47,205 --> 01:25:49,887
So we do not have more free cash.

855
01:25:50,587 --> 01:26:11,072
than projects, and I am excited to understand better what the priorities are that the administration has for how to spend the free cash that we have that we could be spending in the near future that will still maintain a healthy level of free cash and stabilization funds.

856
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:11,572
Thank you.

857
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:13,470
Thank you.

858
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:13,730
Yeah.

859
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:20,636
And we are, um, I'm hoping we will have that be part of our meetings on the 20th or the 21st, at least a primer.

860
01:26:21,516 --> 01:26:30,443
And just to add to that, I think the fiscal 23 to fiscal 28 CIP, the capital improvement plan or investment plan, or can I remember exactly what it is?

861
01:26:30,463 --> 01:26:35,547
I think that had a over a hundred million dollars just in over those five years.

862
01:26:35,687 --> 01:26:40,030
So, you know, and I'm adding to your point, uh,

863
01:26:40,973 --> 01:26:57,339
We could spend all free cash on this project or 30 million in that CIP and we'd still need to come up with the other 70 million through borrowing or some other means so it really just again speaks to the scope and scale of the capital need, nevermind the operating need which we're also talking about.

864
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,160
Councilor Collins.

865
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:08,483
Thank you, President Behrs, and I appreciate the way that Councilor Callahan frames this discussion I think all of that is really well put I appreciate the.

866
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:21,036
I think every time that we talk about free cash, it is really important and valuable to state what it is, because the term is so imperfect to what it is.

867
01:27:21,316 --> 01:27:37,508
And I appreciate the context that with all of these financial decisions, it is not just seven people and city staff making a decision, but rather making decisions against a backdrop of a lot of state, regional, and federal best practice.

868
01:27:38,929 --> 01:27:52,740
Another thing that I don't want to get lost in the sauce now that this project has gotten to the point where we're talking about it in the terms of bottom lines and loan orders is for folks who are not at the committees of the whole that started that started in December or the meetings, since then.

869
01:27:53,961 --> 01:28:11,380
The work that we're talking about funding is work that will allow our elementary, in the case of the current paper and and middle schools and the previous one to have functioning HVAC and roofs that do not leak so what we're talking about we're talking about $25 million, and it is a lot of money.

870
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:24,757
Absolutely, if that feels like an eye popping number that makes sense because that's a really really big number in the context especially of individual lives and small businesses and individual households in the context of a city as Councilor Gallagher pointed out.

871
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:30,759
It is still a big number and we're allowed to react to it as a big number but that is also what things cost.

872
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,380
And I think that as we're talking about it as a

873
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,281
large and intimidating number to be committing.

874
01:28:36,381 --> 01:28:52,850
We should also be talking about like, wow, if there's $30 million worth of updates that our schools need, then like the only thing worse than seeing $30 million go out the door is to not spend that money, because that's stuff that students really need and teachers really need.

875
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:59,933
And it's going to make our schools a much better learning environment, which is the whole point of communities having schools.

876
01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:03,095
So I think that this is,

877
01:29:05,523 --> 01:29:27,502
a really good use, I think it's really good when we can use a relative fraction of our amount of free cash to open the door to a project that it would be completely insensible to fund entirely through free cash and that can open the door to a project that it then makes more sense to complete with borrowing and I'm really looking forward to developing a clearer picture

878
01:29:28,274 --> 01:29:33,598
of the spending and appropriation plan for the rest of our free cash in collaboration with the city administration.

879
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:39,283
I think that is critical context for our budget season this year, and we'll continue to work on that.

880
01:29:41,325 --> 01:29:51,773
But I think that I, for myself as one councilor constituent, I'm thinking of this as a very good example of how we can use free cash to our community's best advantage.

881
01:29:52,194 --> 01:29:52,494
Thank you.

882
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:54,836
Thank you.

883
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,098
Yeah, and I think, you know, just to be brief,

884
01:29:58,646 --> 01:30:05,952
Certainly whoever came up with the term free cash didn't expect it would be interpreted the way that I think most people interpret it.

885
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:21,503
But this may be another way of getting at the point that Councilor Lemming, Councilor Callahan and Councilor Collins and every person on this council has tried to make at various points, which is free cash is cash that is, it is a reserve.

886
01:30:22,782 --> 01:30:40,606
It's a reserve fund, and it is free for us to use when we have an unexpected expense or an emergency, compared to our city budget, which is not free for us to use because it is tied up in being used for all of the things that the city does all year, all month, every month, all year, day in and day out.

887
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:53,725
Um, and whether that further elucidates the idea that you know the difference between the operating budget and a one time expense or a recurring expense and an emergency expense and, um, you know, that's the difference.

888
01:30:54,526 --> 01:31:01,629
Fundamentally, it is a reserve fund that the city has built up over time to address emergencies and one time needs.

889
01:31:02,609 --> 01:31:03,650
And, you know,

890
01:31:04,587 --> 01:31:05,788
to the point that was made, right?

891
01:31:06,168 --> 01:31:10,171
Yes, 30 million is a lot of money, but it would cost a lot more than that to build a new school.

892
01:31:10,811 --> 01:31:19,137
The new K-8 complex is in the 100 to 200 million, the new high school, 300 to 500 million, which is something the city is looking at.

893
01:31:20,218 --> 01:31:23,920
And, you know, just to round it out, there is a plan here.

894
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:30,285
This is the plan to have a healthy middle school and K-8 complex at the Andrews and McGlynn,

895
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:37,955
for a long time, and Brenda and Peter and the team and Bob have worked, and everyone else have worked really hard on that.

896
01:31:38,715 --> 01:31:50,603
We are applying for state funding for both a new high school and for similar projects at the Brooks, Roberts, and Missittuck Elementary Schools to keep those buildings healthy and teaching students for decades to come.

897
01:31:52,564 --> 01:31:54,266
And again, that's just the schools.

898
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:56,987
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

899
01:31:57,868 --> 01:32:00,069
I'm gonna go to assistant superintendent.

900
01:32:02,924 --> 01:32:03,364
One second.

901
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:04,424
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

902
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:05,165
Thank you.

903
01:32:05,205 --> 01:32:06,145
Council President beers.

904
01:32:06,205 --> 01:32:15,887
And I want to thank every member of this council as well as councilors got probably even though he's not here tonight for the 7 0 vote that was done last time around.

905
01:32:15,907 --> 01:32:25,090
Um, the fact is that I have a very good feeling about the 3 statements of interest based on initial conversations with state agencies.

906
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:28,691
We'll find out where that goes in September or October.

907
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:39,435
But you all make a very good point that these dollars are being directly spent to improve both the working and learning conditions of our staff and students.

908
01:32:40,295 --> 01:32:46,517
We have spent considerable effort and have received ARPA funds from the mayor for several projects.

909
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:55,867
for these one-time expenses, such as replacing leaking skylights at the McGlynn or replacing exterior door locks.

910
01:32:56,908 --> 01:33:02,935
Many people think of these schools, unfortunately, as if it is still 2001 or 2003 when their doors opened.

911
01:33:05,402 --> 01:33:23,798
The reality is that these schools are midlife, these five buildings housing six schools are midlife and require considerable care to make sure that they will last another 25 years or longer to continue serving the students and families of Medford.

912
01:33:23,858 --> 01:33:31,925
They are more than schools, they are really community centers and I can't stress that enough that they are used frequently for many purposes.

913
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:45,268
I again cannot thank enough the school committee and the capital planning subcommittee who has really prioritized this type of looking into what is needed for our schools to continue to be successful.

914
01:33:45,748 --> 01:33:56,591
And again, thanking this committee and the administration for both utilizing free cash and bond service to really support the repairs that are necessary.

915
01:33:57,031 --> 01:34:00,432
These are not like these are not wish list items.

916
01:34:00,492 --> 01:34:01,712
These are must haves.

917
01:34:02,612 --> 01:34:13,818
And again, I know I've said it about four times in this little speech here that was unplanned, but thank you for your support of the staff and students of Medford.

918
01:34:14,198 --> 01:34:18,720
It is critical for their success in learning and delivering learning.

919
01:34:22,642 --> 01:34:23,762
Thank you, Superintendent.

920
01:34:24,983 --> 01:34:28,665
We have a motion from Vice President Collins.

921
01:34:30,948 --> 01:34:32,429
Councilor Lemming to approve with a second.

922
01:34:32,569 --> 01:34:35,471
Councilor Lemming to approve with a second by Vice President Collins.

923
01:34:36,792 --> 01:34:38,774
Do we have any further comment by members of the public?

924
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,416
There is a hand on Zoom, but that person's already spoken.

925
01:34:41,456 --> 01:34:44,598
So if anyone who hasn't spoken yet would like to speak, I'll take you first.

926
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,321
Seeing none, we'll go back to Mr. Castaneda.

927
01:34:52,504 --> 01:34:53,845
Andy, you're gonna have one more minute.

928
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:58,969
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

929
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:07,605
I agree 100% with the people who mentioned we've got to keep the water out of the buildings.

930
01:35:08,545 --> 01:35:11,886
As a matter of fact, the McGlynn School has been leaking for many, many years.

931
01:35:12,927 --> 01:35:14,667
And it is not new, I'll agree with that.

932
01:35:15,567 --> 01:35:27,751
But maybe we should have used some free cash money many years ago to fix that roof, because we don't want the water coming in to condemn all these buildings in the city and then put it on our kids' charge cards, the $230 million each.

933
01:35:29,861 --> 01:35:33,043
not counting further inflation and tariffs, as you say.

934
01:35:33,763 --> 01:35:39,887
And second of all, in my opinion, free cash is money that was overcharged to us, the taxpayers.

935
01:35:40,988 --> 01:35:46,051
In reality, maybe they should give us back the money or at least half of it.

936
01:35:47,071 --> 01:35:47,472
Good night.

937
01:35:49,533 --> 01:35:49,993
Thank you.

938
01:35:50,013 --> 01:35:54,056
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

939
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:56,077
Councilor Callahan.

940
01:35:57,332 --> 01:36:00,834
Vice President Collins console is our console living.

941
01:36:01,754 --> 01:36:02,895
I'll describe Kelly is absent.

942
01:36:03,915 --> 01:36:05,996
I'll just saying, President bears.

943
01:36:06,316 --> 01:36:07,357
Yes, it's the affirmative.

944
01:36:07,797 --> 01:36:08,337
One absent.

945
01:36:08,938 --> 01:36:11,299
The motion passes and the loaner is approved for third reading.

946
01:36:13,863 --> 01:36:31,162
25 065 submitted by memory and I'll go current Community Preservation Committee appropriation request regarding affordable housing trust additional fiscal 25 funds, dear President bears and members of the council on behalf of the CPC I request respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the CPC.

947
01:36:32,005 --> 01:36:41,333
requesting the appropriation of $50,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund to provide additional funding to expand their fiscal 25 development awards budget.

948
01:36:41,834 --> 01:36:44,016
Project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

949
01:36:44,056 --> 01:36:46,418
The CPC recommendation letter is attached and incorporated.

950
01:36:46,998 --> 01:36:51,502
CPA manager Teresa DuPont and representatives from the Medford Affordable Housing Trust are in attendance.

951
01:36:52,103 --> 01:36:53,324
Thank you for your consideration.

952
01:36:53,424 --> 01:36:54,165
Respectfully submitted.

953
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:55,706
Brianna Lago-Kern, Mayor.

954
01:36:56,307 --> 01:36:57,688
And I will go to Teresa DuPont.

955
01:36:58,919 --> 01:37:01,420
Good evening, Mr. President and counselors.

956
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:10,023
I'm here for you asking for your support on the recommendation of the Preservation Committee to appropriate $50,000 to the Affordable Housing Trust.

957
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:14,425
I'm not sure if we still have Lisa Davidson in the room.

958
01:37:14,485 --> 01:37:16,306
I don't believe I see her on Zoom.

959
01:37:17,786 --> 01:37:21,728
But Lisa Davidson is our chairperson of the Affordable Housing Trust.

960
01:37:22,548 --> 01:37:27,250
So if she's not available, I can certainly speak to this award.

961
01:37:29,037 --> 01:37:30,958
Not seeing Lisa, so if you wanna go ahead.

962
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:32,640
Yes, my elevator pitch.

963
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:36,783
So this $50,000 will be utilized quickly by the trust.

964
01:37:37,443 --> 01:37:44,228
They've already been approached by a few different housing developers eager to build here in Medford, which is an excellent sign.

965
01:37:44,248 --> 01:37:45,009
We'd love to see it.

966
01:37:46,129 --> 01:37:48,571
You may recall that the trust is still relatively young.

967
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,474
They only had their first official meeting, I believe last August.

968
01:37:52,914 --> 01:37:55,296
So they've been working through the various,

969
01:37:57,002 --> 01:38:04,647
legal document tools needed for them to actually take action as a trust that includes their declaration of trust as well as their action plan.

970
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:10,051
I believe the declaration of trust is official and their action plan is being finalized now.

971
01:38:10,191 --> 01:38:15,395
So that's just to give some backstory that to remind this council that the trust is still young.

972
01:38:15,955 --> 01:38:18,057
So the fact that we have awarded $250,000

973
01:38:20,212 --> 01:38:25,133
Previously, you may remember a few months ago, this council helped support that award.

974
01:38:25,673 --> 01:38:29,394
They are now coming back saying, thank you very much for that $250,000.

975
01:38:29,734 --> 01:38:34,035
We are finding that the needs have increased beyond what our initial scope was.

976
01:38:34,215 --> 01:38:46,698
So this $50,000 will be utilized as they look to create their award program, similar to how the committee, we take applications, we vet them, and we vote upon them.

977
01:38:48,081 --> 01:38:53,411
So we ask for your support tonight in helping to continue fund their development actions here.

978
01:38:53,531 --> 01:38:56,878
Happy to answer any questions that we may have.

979
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:58,882
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

980
01:39:01,133 --> 01:39:03,595
This is something that I support.

981
01:39:05,557 --> 01:39:21,992
Questions I had did relate to some of the, I do wish Lisa Davidson were still here to answer them, but I just wanted to ask if the Affordable Housing Trust had any

982
01:39:22,909 --> 01:39:40,893
plans to request any additional free cash appropriations to fund the affordable housing nexus studies, or if that's something that's sort of in the AHT's timeline or agendas in the near future?

983
01:39:40,913 --> 01:39:46,294
I don't know of any immediate plans to ask for a free cash appropriation.

984
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:51,935
To explain to anybody who's following along, the nexus study will help us to identify

985
01:39:52,555 --> 01:39:56,617
and expand existing funding source that is through our linkage program.

986
01:39:56,958 --> 01:40:05,203
We currently do not have affordable housing as a linkage line item, if you will, as other municipalities have.

987
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:10,166
So the nexus study is the egg that must come for the chicken, if you will, here.

988
01:40:11,286 --> 01:40:17,570
So I don't know of any immediate plans, but I do know that it's a vital piece that the trust is exploring actively.

989
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:28,005
Yeah, I understand that previously we received a recommendation to sell off land on McCormick, which didn't pass through this body.

990
01:40:29,286 --> 01:40:38,752
But I would still like to see some communications or recommendations from the AHT on ways to fund that nexus study.

991
01:40:38,812 --> 01:40:44,995
And it does seem like it would cost something like $80,000.

992
01:40:45,055 --> 01:40:47,057
So I don't think that that's a whole lot.

993
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:51,098
to ask out a free cash for something this important.

994
01:40:51,418 --> 01:40:53,778
Again, I know that this is outside of your purview.

995
01:40:53,839 --> 01:41:01,380
I do wish Lisa were still on, but that's what's on my mind when regards to the HT these days.

996
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:06,662
But for the paper that we're actually discussing, I do support it.

997
01:41:06,762 --> 01:41:07,462
So thank you.

998
01:41:07,722 --> 01:41:08,662
Thank you for your work on this.

999
01:41:09,842 --> 01:41:10,623
Thank you, Councillor Lemming.

1000
01:41:12,603 --> 01:41:14,904
Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1001
01:41:15,664 --> 01:41:16,164
Is there a motion?

1002
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:21,513
Motion approved by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor, everyone, Councilor Lemming.

1003
01:41:23,734 --> 01:41:25,434
Is there any further discussion by members of the public?

1004
01:41:28,255 --> 01:41:30,715
Seeing none, either in person or on Zoom, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1005
01:41:31,416 --> 01:41:32,056
Councilor Callahan?

1006
01:41:32,876 --> 01:41:33,656
Vice President Collins?

1007
01:41:33,676 --> 01:41:33,756
Yes.

1008
01:41:34,316 --> 01:41:35,077
Councilor Lazaro?

1009
01:41:35,097 --> 01:41:35,197
Yes.

1010
01:41:35,817 --> 01:41:36,357
Councilor Lemming?

1011
01:41:36,377 --> 01:41:36,437
Yes.

1012
01:41:37,237 --> 01:41:38,397
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1013
01:41:38,557 --> 01:41:39,138
Councilor Sang?

1014
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:39,358
Yes.

1015
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:40,438
President Behrs?

1016
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:40,518
Yes.

1017
01:41:40,977 --> 01:41:42,758
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

1018
01:41:43,018 --> 01:41:45,419
The motion passes.

1019
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:48,220
25.066 submitted by Mayor Brianne Legault-Kern.

1020
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,360
Appropriation of free cash.

1021
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:56,863
Dear president, mayors and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following free cash appropriations in the total amount of $229,766.01 on the following items.

1022
01:41:56,883 --> 01:42:01,684
198,000 for security upgrades at MPS buildings, which will be used to increase the total down payment made on a $1,843,038

1023
01:42:10,521 --> 01:42:13,503
$38.74 project, which will be paid over five years.

1024
01:42:14,124 --> 01:42:20,349
I believe that also gets us some additional matching and grant funding or assist us on that in some way.

1025
01:42:20,889 --> 01:42:33,620
And $31,766.01 for the following claim settlements, Bay State Insurance Company, Geico Safety Insurance, Geico Arbella Insurance, these are on behalf of Etrado, Dino Popolo,

1026
01:42:34,383 --> 01:42:38,545
John Petroni, Salem Woldemariam, and Lauren Woldemariam, and Anthony Milano.

1027
01:42:38,565 --> 01:42:41,266
Balance of free cash as of the writing of this letter is $27,606,069.12.

1028
01:42:42,427 --> 01:42:48,910
Attorney Tom Lane from KP Law will be available to answer any questions on the claim.

1029
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:50,490
I see Tom is here with us on Zoom.

1030
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:52,671
Thank you for your kind attention to these matters.

1031
01:42:52,731 --> 01:42:54,432
Respectfully submitted, Brianne Olingo, current mayor.

1032
01:42:56,513 --> 01:42:58,274
Do we have any questions on

1033
01:42:59,966 --> 01:43:03,547
The security system, we still have the assistant superintendent with us.

1034
01:43:04,367 --> 01:43:06,168
Or do we have any questions on the claim settlements?

1035
01:43:06,228 --> 01:43:09,148
We do have legal counsel, Tom Lane with us.

1036
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:16,850
Seeing none, I have a question for Dr. Cushing.

1037
01:43:18,591 --> 01:43:26,373
Just if you could give us a little bit more info on the security upgrades project and how this free cash funding helps out with the down payment and all that.

1038
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:27,790
Absolutely.

1039
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:37,452
So this project is approximately a $1.8 million investment in security systems across the Medford Public Schools.

1040
01:43:38,673 --> 01:43:56,857
This will do a lot of things that I will broadly cover, but when it comes to safety and security devices, policies, procedures, deployments, that's generally something reserved for executive session of the school committee or a joint executive session if committees and councils would ever seek to have that.

1041
01:43:57,936 --> 01:44:00,998
This will increase the camera coverage of our schools.

1042
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:08,463
This will allow for key fob slash electronic access to the schools.

1043
01:44:08,923 --> 01:44:10,604
Right now, it is physical key.

1044
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:27,075
Thanks, as I mentioned earlier, to Madam Mayor's appropriation of ARPA funds, we're able to rekey all exterior doors to the Medford Public Schools and now have a very accurate and very controlled deployment of keys across the district.

1045
01:44:27,615 --> 01:44:34,097
However, key fobs will allow us the opportunity to immediately remove access to any person who has access.

1046
01:44:35,397 --> 01:44:40,118
It will also track who enters and leaves the buildings when using the key fobs.

1047
01:44:41,558 --> 01:44:44,379
We will also be installing security vestibules.

1048
01:44:45,139 --> 01:44:56,162
Every school has a vestibule, but we will be putting locking hardware on the interior doors of the schools so that when a person enters, they need a second pass through to enter the buildings.

1049
01:44:58,143 --> 01:45:21,135
And at the quote-unquote new schools, which I just said don't like using that term, but for the building the future schools of 2001 and 2003, every exterior door will be alarmed so that if a door is propped open or somebody opens a door unauthorized, an alert will be sent and this will integrate with our radio systems.

1050
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:28,969
So this is a significant upgrade to our security systems for the safety of our staff and students.

1051
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:32,954
As I said, this is a $1.8 million project.

1052
01:45:33,454 --> 01:45:41,124
Thanks to the override, we can fund the vast majority of this over the next five years, which was approved at last school committee meeting.

1053
01:45:42,164 --> 01:45:59,927
But by receiving this additional funding from the mayor, we were able to put down a $500,000 down payment on this and then move forward with reasonable payments over the next five years of approximately $300,000 in order to pay off this system.

1054
01:46:01,008 --> 01:46:07,449
We've negotiated through state contract and negotiated very hard with the providers

1055
01:46:08,389 --> 01:46:20,932
to receive significant percentage points above and beyond state contract pricing, as well as additional hardware installed at no additional cost.

1056
01:46:22,873 --> 01:46:31,175
It's really been a two-year project in the making and will significantly upgrade the safety and security of our staff and students.

1057
01:46:31,855 --> 01:46:32,995
I cannot understate that.

1058
01:46:34,926 --> 01:46:36,528
or overstate, I get those confused.

1059
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:40,371
I think you stated it well.

1060
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:44,496
And no, and I really appreciate the detail.

1061
01:46:45,076 --> 01:46:47,759
I know 198,000 seems like why are we doing it.

1062
01:46:48,419 --> 01:46:56,988
But I know there's a lot more behind a lot of the work that goes on in the city, especially when it comes here and doesn't have all the context so want to thank you.

1063
01:46:57,555 --> 01:47:11,184
Again, for this project, for the HVAC projects getting off the ground, and I can personally commit to you, the day after the new MHS debt exclusion passes, we'll start calling them the old schools.

1064
01:47:11,945 --> 01:47:16,048
And then maybe they'll get the attention and understanding that they deserve.

1065
01:47:16,068 --> 01:47:17,029
Or at least I'll call them that.

1066
01:47:17,049 --> 01:47:18,490
I hope people will follow me on it.

1067
01:47:19,971 --> 01:47:20,791
But thank you, Peter.

1068
01:47:21,011 --> 01:47:23,233
It's really, you know, always great to have you with us.

1069
01:47:23,837 --> 01:47:35,836
Thank you, and it really goes without saying, and I just said it, but the support that this council and the school committee have made on behalf of the staff and students.

1070
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:43,501
It really should serve as a model for other communities for really supporting what needs to be done.

1071
01:47:44,081 --> 01:47:54,963
And I also just want to thank the citizens of Medford for stepping up in November to really help deliver the things that are going to improve academic outcomes for our students.

1072
01:47:56,684 --> 01:47:57,644
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1073
01:47:59,784 --> 01:48:00,124
All right.

1074
01:48:01,484 --> 01:48:04,145
Any questions for Tom Lane from KP Law?

1075
01:48:06,453 --> 01:48:19,517
I just had one, Tom, if you could just quickly go through, it looks like basically you were able to negotiate payments from the city that are less than what the insurance companies paid out to their clients.

1076
01:48:20,217 --> 01:48:23,958
If you want to talk about that a little bit more, and I'll unmute you.

1077
01:48:27,895 --> 01:48:30,098
Yes, I was able to negotiate.

1078
01:48:31,179 --> 01:48:36,464
I've been doing this work for 40 years, and I've developed pretty good relationships with a lot of these attorneys.

1079
01:48:37,225 --> 01:48:42,090
A lot of these subrogation cases, you deal with a lot of the same attorneys again and again.

1080
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:49,819
So I was able to work to negotiate them, and they all reduced what they were asking for by different amounts.

1081
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:54,080
they're reporting back to their, to the insurance companies.

1082
01:48:54,520 --> 01:49:00,382
And it's a question whether the insurance company will take a burden in hand rather than continue to pursue the litigation.

1083
01:49:01,242 --> 01:49:05,404
If we continue to pursue the litigation, the costs would go up dramatically.

1084
01:49:05,984 --> 01:49:15,387
There would be discovery costs, trial costs, and frankly, all four of these, well, all four of the first, the Bay State Insurance Company, I don't know if it would reach 15,000,

1085
01:49:16,734 --> 01:49:24,699
But the other four cases, that amount of the settlements would be eaten up in attorney's fees if the cases ever went close to trial.

1086
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:33,884
And they all appear to be, frankly, clear liability cases where I think three of them involved vehicles that were parked, vehicles that were struck.

1087
01:49:34,564 --> 01:49:37,266
And again, the insurance company pays the money out.

1088
01:49:37,706 --> 01:49:39,787
So I was able to work with the attorneys involved.

1089
01:49:40,288 --> 01:49:43,910
And I feel confident that that's the lowest number that they would settle those cases for.

1090
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:47,371
because the agreement was settled for it now at that point.

1091
01:49:47,432 --> 01:49:54,795
So, and I advise them that obviously the settlements could not be finalized until it was approved by the council.

1092
01:49:54,915 --> 01:49:56,716
And that's what I'm here for tonight, so.

1093
01:49:58,348 --> 01:49:58,528
Right.

1094
01:49:59,229 --> 01:49:59,669
Thank you.

1095
01:49:59,869 --> 01:50:03,532
And, you know, if you can't speak to this I understand and we can.

1096
01:50:04,192 --> 01:50:07,055
I'll set a question myself to the administration.

1097
01:50:07,675 --> 01:50:14,220
I'm just wondering why we're paying these out of free cash and not out of the operating budget line for for settlements.

1098
01:50:16,018 --> 01:50:34,861
I am not, I don't wanna, I don't have full knowledge of that, but my understanding is that the amount available for settlements is greatly reduced and in order to settle these cases now at this point, that's why the administration wanted to move forward with free cash at that point.

1099
01:50:35,742 --> 01:50:40,462
Great, we're gonna have a law department budget hearing in a week or two, so I'll bring it up then.

1100
01:50:41,263 --> 01:50:43,403
But thank you for the answer, that's helpful to understand.

1101
01:50:44,578 --> 01:50:46,099
Any further discussion by members of the council?

1102
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,640
Any discussion by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1103
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:55,001
You can approach the podium in the chamber or raise your hand on Zoom.

1104
01:50:58,803 --> 01:51:00,363
Seeing none, Vice President Collins.

1105
01:51:03,904 --> 01:51:04,765
Thank you, President Behrs.

1106
01:51:04,925 --> 01:51:08,366
I really appreciate the overview.

1107
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:11,152
from Superintendent Cushing.

1108
01:51:11,293 --> 01:51:12,194
Thank you so much for that.

1109
01:51:12,214 --> 01:51:29,953
It is, again, never to diminish the gravity of spending our precious shared resources, but I'm so glad that we have the opportunity to do that on hardware and software that will make our schools safer for our students and teachers.

1110
01:51:31,834 --> 01:51:38,298
And it is great to hear that we were able to negotiate down the amount that we are paying out in these insurance claims.

1111
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:39,539
So thank you for that.

1112
01:51:39,799 --> 01:51:41,401
And I would motion to approve.

1113
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:46,404
On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

1114
01:51:48,165 --> 01:51:50,987
Seeing no further discussion, members of the Council, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1115
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:54,369
Councilor Kellyanne.

1116
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:56,451
Vice President Collins.

1117
01:51:57,351 --> 01:51:58,152
Councilor Lazaro.

1118
01:51:59,406 --> 01:52:02,088
Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1119
01:52:02,808 --> 01:52:04,549
Councilor Sang, President Bears.

1120
01:52:04,589 --> 01:52:07,351
Yes, affirmative one absent the motion passes.

1121
01:52:07,891 --> 01:52:10,213
Thank you, Councilor and Dr. Fisher.

1122
01:52:11,734 --> 01:52:12,094
Thank you.

1123
01:52:14,235 --> 01:52:14,716
All right.

1124
01:52:15,776 --> 01:52:18,938
Two, five, zero, six, seven, Engineer Wartella.

1125
01:52:18,978 --> 01:52:21,620
Can you tell us about the flood ordinance update?

1126
01:52:25,442 --> 01:52:27,784
I can read more if you want, or I can just let you talk about it.

1127
01:52:28,792 --> 01:52:29,192
Is this on?

1128
01:52:29,212 --> 01:52:29,792
All right, great.

1129
01:52:30,072 --> 01:52:30,232
Hi.

1130
01:52:31,292 --> 01:52:40,054
So I'm the floodplain manager for the city, and the National Flood Insurance Program is updating their bylaws with the state.

1131
01:52:40,614 --> 01:52:43,935
For us to be in compliance, we need to update our ordinance.

1132
01:52:44,655 --> 01:52:56,417
And so most of this is just upgrading the firm maps, which go into effect July 8th, and there's some definitions as well and some language, and that's the broad overview of it.

1133
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:57,857
Do you have any questions?

1134
01:52:58,481 --> 01:53:02,084
I'm just going to add that we have a letter for you from you in our packet.

1135
01:53:02,405 --> 01:53:08,810
And this was reviewed by Attorney Jeffrey Blake from KP Law, and you are available to speak to our questions.

1136
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:11,773
So I will go to Councilor Callahan and Councilor Zara.

1137
01:53:11,793 --> 01:53:13,755
Hi.

1138
01:53:14,135 --> 01:53:15,016
Thank you so much for being here.

1139
01:53:15,797 --> 01:53:16,497
Thank you for having us.

1140
01:53:16,878 --> 01:53:19,520
For waiting until this late hour, not as late as sometimes.

1141
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:23,804
So my only questions really are,

1142
01:53:25,323 --> 01:53:30,725
just sort of how, is there any way in which these changes might affect our homeowners?

1143
01:53:31,345 --> 01:53:37,468
Is there any way in which these changes might affect people's ability to get FEMA funds, their ability to get flood insurance?

1144
01:53:38,548 --> 01:53:46,912
Like, is this simply just a totally routine update and that's it, or is there gonna be some changes that might affect?

1145
01:53:47,092 --> 01:53:51,794
The last time we did a revision was in 2010, it's now 2025, they've updated their,

1146
01:53:53,335 --> 01:53:58,843
their maps in accordance with the new contours and how they image it.

1147
01:53:59,805 --> 01:54:01,787
It does affect some property owners.

1148
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:05,030
it in both ways.

1149
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:13,994
Some are being removed from the flood zone, some are being added to the flood zone, and so that would affect, yes.

1150
01:54:14,174 --> 01:54:24,098
Wonderful, and I guess the sort of overarching question is, this is a routine thing that they do every 10-15 years?

1151
01:54:24,318 --> 01:54:25,278
From my understanding, yes.

1152
01:54:25,398 --> 01:54:27,459
This is my first one that they've done, but

1153
01:54:27,779 --> 01:54:30,041
I've only been a floodplain manager for three years.

1154
01:54:30,341 --> 01:54:30,702
Wonderful.

1155
01:54:30,822 --> 01:54:40,050
Given the state of our national government, there was some question when looking at this about like, hmm, what is the meaning behind this change?

1156
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:45,575
But it sounds like this is just routine, updating the maps, updating language.

1157
01:54:45,975 --> 01:54:49,799
More accurate maps that depict what is actually there.

1158
01:54:50,199 --> 01:54:50,739
Thank you so much.

1159
01:54:52,444 --> 01:54:54,905
So just to echo, we're still doing science on this one?

1160
01:54:55,926 --> 01:54:56,266
Yes.

1161
01:54:56,286 --> 01:54:57,387
Okay, just checking.

1162
01:54:57,587 --> 01:55:00,469
Councilor Zahra.

1163
01:55:00,929 --> 01:55:01,669
Thank you for being here.

1164
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:03,170
Thank you for doing this.

1165
01:55:03,691 --> 01:55:13,396
I was wondering if there will be any kind of notification mechanism for homeowners whose situation may have shifted or if they will have to look at the maps themselves.

1166
01:55:13,516 --> 01:55:15,017
I looked at the map today.

1167
01:55:15,137 --> 01:55:21,441
It's a little hard to... The viewer link I sent you, if you uncheck all the

1168
01:55:22,361 --> 01:55:24,822
five, there's like six check marks.

1169
01:55:24,902 --> 01:55:30,104
And if you uncheck the last five, you can see there's like a yellow and a purple.

1170
01:55:30,725 --> 01:55:34,466
Yellow is being added to the floodplain, purple is being decreased from the floodplain.

1171
01:55:35,687 --> 01:55:39,208
And if your parcel is in there, then you'll be- So it's easier to see.

1172
01:55:39,228 --> 01:55:40,749
It's a little easier to see.

1173
01:55:40,829 --> 01:55:40,949
Great.

1174
01:55:40,989 --> 01:55:44,710
All the information's there when you, it's like as default, but it is there.

1175
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:47,832
So we could always front face that with

1176
01:55:48,912 --> 01:55:50,792
probably on the engineering website.

1177
01:55:50,852 --> 01:55:55,613
I was gonna wait until it goes into effect on July 8th and then probably share that information out.

1178
01:55:55,793 --> 01:55:55,953
Yeah.

1179
01:55:56,193 --> 01:55:57,014
That would be amazing.

1180
01:55:57,994 --> 01:56:06,155
Just because what could happen is that people could save money on their insurance or may need to, maybe, or may need to buy more.

1181
01:56:07,496 --> 01:56:07,676
Right.

1182
01:56:09,176 --> 01:56:09,676
Thank you.

1183
01:56:13,677 --> 01:56:14,277
Motion to approve.

1184
01:56:15,342 --> 01:56:20,326
And there's a motion to approve the first reading the ordinance amendments, and this is just ordinance amendments right.

1185
01:56:21,567 --> 01:56:25,431
Okay, by councils are seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1186
01:56:26,352 --> 01:56:27,392
I have a question or two.

1187
01:56:29,534 --> 01:56:30,035
Almost done.

1188
01:56:31,316 --> 01:56:31,876
The.

1189
01:56:33,017 --> 01:56:33,338
Is this.

1190
01:56:34,218 --> 01:56:35,640
I'm not 100% sure how this works.

1191
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:41,565
Is this about flooding, like from the river, or from a storm event or does it address like

1192
01:56:42,568 --> 01:56:47,490
flooding from our antiquated infrastructure under our roads?

1193
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:54,533
No, I believe what this is, so FEMA uses their firm maps, their flood insurance rate mapping.

1194
01:56:55,314 --> 01:56:56,854
Those maps have been updated.

1195
01:56:57,515 --> 01:57:10,860
The ordinance is in conjunction with those maps, and also there was a little bit of problematic language that the state ran into, so that was tweaked, and this is the result.

1196
01:57:11,321 --> 01:57:11,541
Okay.

1197
01:57:12,401 --> 01:57:24,206
And basic, I guess, and you may not be hydrologist or exactly whatever expertise is needed to answer this question, but when you looked at it, is the situation getting worse?

1198
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:26,607
Is more of the city floodable?

1199
01:57:26,847 --> 01:57:28,628
Is there a climate impact related to this?

1200
01:57:30,489 --> 01:57:37,632
From what I could tell, and I haven't done a whole analysis on this, but it looked more defined.

1201
01:57:38,545 --> 01:57:39,305
That's what it looked like.

1202
01:57:39,986 --> 01:57:52,990
It was following the natural contours of the land versus just arbitrarily following a contour that was depicted from 1986.

1203
01:57:53,491 --> 01:57:59,713
So it's more that the existing zones are better following topographical contours.

1204
01:57:59,893 --> 01:58:00,133
Correct.

1205
01:58:01,395 --> 01:58:01,635
All right.

1206
01:58:03,696 --> 01:58:13,362
Seeing no further questions from members of the Council, are there any questions from members of the public or comments from members of the public, either in person or on zoom, you can come to the podium, or raise your hand on zoom.

1207
01:58:18,565 --> 01:58:23,068
Seeing none, on the motion for approval for first reading, Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1208
01:58:27,902 --> 01:58:36,828
Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli is absent, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

1209
01:58:36,868 --> 01:58:39,350
Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1210
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,371
Vice President Collins.

1211
01:58:41,632 --> 01:58:52,079
President Behrs, I have a motion to take from the table and approve 25-045 and approve for third reading 25-053.

1212
01:58:52,119 --> 01:58:56,823
Five-three is not eligible to the next meeting.

1213
01:58:57,541 --> 01:58:59,282
That's right, sorry.

1214
01:58:59,322 --> 01:59:03,985
So on the motion, Vice President Collins to take paper 25045 from the table and approve.

1215
01:59:04,826 --> 01:59:09,248
This is the replacement of the sign at the car wash.

1216
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:13,051
Is there a second on that motion?

1217
01:59:13,891 --> 01:59:14,672
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1218
01:59:14,692 --> 01:59:16,033
Is there any discussion on that motion?

1219
01:59:19,154 --> 01:59:22,797
Seeing none on the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1220
01:59:23,897 --> 01:59:24,658
Sure, no worries.

1221
01:59:32,394 --> 01:59:32,815
Yep.

1222
01:59:32,976 --> 01:59:37,412
Well, we haven't gotten there yet so I'll uncall the roll Councilor Kellyanne if you have discussion.

1223
01:59:38,575 --> 01:59:45,279
Just for those listening, can we have like a one-sentence reminder of what it is that we are citing?

1224
01:59:45,559 --> 01:59:53,304
Yes, there is a sign that is a pre-existing sign that way too much legal work has gone into, in my opinion.

1225
01:59:53,504 --> 01:59:54,224
I shouldn't editorialize.

1226
01:59:54,244 --> 01:59:58,186
There's a sign at a new car wash.

1227
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:02,169
The car wash on Fulbright Street, which was once Minuteman Car Wash, was there for a very long time.

1228
02:00:03,008 --> 02:00:05,392
it has a sign that is somewhat iconic on the highway.

1229
02:00:06,153 --> 02:00:16,787
Minuteman car wash closed and they've been purchased by a new company that wants to build a new car wash there but they want to keep the sign they just want to change the name of the sign to their company instead of the old company.

1230
02:00:17,568 --> 02:00:20,730
And there has been a dispute over how long the sign was inactive.

1231
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:24,032
And does it count as a pre-existing use?

1232
02:00:24,712 --> 02:00:27,774
And apparently, I'm pretty sure this is the packet for it.

1233
02:00:28,314 --> 02:00:30,515
I was wondering if it was unreasonable.

1234
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:40,601
And the only thing that's changing is that the plastic that they put in front of the light bulb will have a new name on it.

1235
02:00:41,245 --> 02:00:46,667
But am I correct that this was one that one councillor asked for us to get a legal opinion on?

1236
02:00:46,967 --> 02:00:47,267
Yep.

1237
02:00:47,888 --> 02:00:49,008
And we got that legal opinion?

1238
02:00:49,428 --> 02:00:51,709
I am not sure whether or not we are in receipt of a legal opinion.

1239
02:00:52,710 --> 02:01:00,413
But it is ultimately up to the council as the final authority on appeals of signed permit refusals by the building department.

1240
02:01:05,094 --> 02:01:05,915
I haven't read a legal opinion.

1241
02:01:05,935 --> 02:01:06,175
That's all.

1242
02:01:10,019 --> 02:01:11,960
You can any further discussion members of the council.

1243
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:13,241
All right.

1244
02:01:14,362 --> 02:01:15,183
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1245
02:01:16,784 --> 02:01:17,424
Councilor Callahan.

1246
02:01:19,085 --> 02:01:19,946
Vice President Collins.

1247
02:01:21,147 --> 02:01:21,527
Councilor

1248
02:01:24,972 --> 02:01:26,092
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1249
02:01:26,773 --> 02:01:28,533
Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

1250
02:01:28,553 --> 02:01:35,056
Yes, it's in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes, and the appeal of the refusal of their signed permit was successful.

1251
02:01:35,076 --> 02:01:43,799
Mr. Clerk, if you could communicate that to the proponent, to Attorney Desmond, and to the building commissioner if necessary.

1252
02:01:45,151 --> 02:01:46,432
All right, public participation.

1253
02:01:46,893 --> 02:01:53,419
This is the section where we can hear from members of the public on any topic that they'd like to discuss with the council.

1254
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,322
Each person who likes to speak will have three minutes.

1255
02:01:57,823 --> 02:02:03,709
And just as a point of note, the council cannot act in this meeting on anything we hear because if it was not on the agenda.

1256
02:02:05,947 --> 02:02:16,893
And since we've disposed of everything that was on the agenda, that is true, but we could act at a future meeting if a councilor were to propose a resolution, or if some other discussion were to happen.

1257
02:02:17,793 --> 02:02:26,998
But we hear from public participation, and if there is anyone who wants to participate outside of Zoom, they can email the city clerk at ahertovsetmedford-ma.gov.

1258
02:02:27,318 --> 02:02:31,800
So if anyone would like to come to the podium or raise their hand on Zoom for public participation.

1259
02:02:34,282 --> 02:02:34,642
Welcome.

1260
02:02:36,103 --> 02:02:37,684
I would have welcomed you earlier, but I was sitting there.

1261
02:02:38,504 --> 02:02:40,285
It's quite all right.

1262
02:02:41,146 --> 02:02:43,547
Thank you all for hearing me out.

1263
02:02:43,847 --> 02:02:44,287
Thank you.

1264
02:02:44,367 --> 02:02:45,448
If we just get your name and address.

1265
02:02:45,468 --> 02:02:45,808
Oh yeah, right.

1266
02:02:46,088 --> 02:02:49,670
Sabrina Hewitt, and 315 Boston Ave, MD.

1267
02:02:52,091 --> 02:02:57,014
I've been losing my mind since November, obvious reasons, I think.

1268
02:02:59,135 --> 02:03:05,518
One of the things that scared me is I'm a trans woman, and I'm living in this state, and it's probably the only state I feel safe in.

1269
02:03:07,964 --> 02:03:13,646
I was reassured by the governor and by the senators that this was a safe place.

1270
02:03:15,927 --> 02:03:22,349
That wasn't just for trans folk, it was also for minorities, for undocumented immigrants, et cetera.

1271
02:03:23,129 --> 02:03:32,632
And yet, when it came the time he got in and he sent ICE on a rampage, 300, I wrote notes, 370 people

1272
02:03:36,137 --> 02:03:37,318
deported one month ago.

1273
02:03:41,101 --> 02:03:55,832
There's a law that says that Massachusetts court officers have no authority to arrest or hold individuals solely on the basis of federal civil immigration detainers, which is what all of these people have been taken on.

1274
02:03:57,173 --> 02:03:58,414
I did a lot of research today.

1275
02:04:01,676 --> 02:04:02,137
But yet,

1276
02:04:04,577 --> 02:04:11,563
And I know you can't do anything about the governor and the state and making it sanctuary state, but we could maybe make Medford a sanctuary city.

1277
02:04:11,923 --> 02:04:18,828
We had that woman who was a PhD taken from up the street from me where I live.

1278
02:04:19,629 --> 02:04:20,570
I live right next to Tufts.

1279
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,232
And that woman, I found out it was Somerville.

1280
02:04:23,552 --> 02:04:24,293
I did some research.

1281
02:04:25,173 --> 02:04:28,016
It was, but they'd say, they said Tufts, so I assumed it was Medford.

1282
02:04:29,937 --> 02:04:33,160
And that woman was taken and sent to,

1283
02:04:36,287 --> 02:04:42,710
Yeah, Louisiana, with no hearing, no due process, and it keeps happening.

1284
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:48,053
And they took a four-year-old, not here, but in general, with cancer.

1285
02:04:50,074 --> 02:04:53,275
It's getting out of control, and I need to feel safe again.

1286
02:04:53,936 --> 02:04:59,498
He's coming at us, at trans people, and people of color, and just et cetera.

1287
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:04,481
And I need Massachusetts to feel safe, because nowhere else does.

1288
02:05:05,898 --> 02:05:09,246
And I've been panicking, I've been freaking out.

1289
02:05:09,266 --> 02:05:15,460
I was telling you earlier when we were talking a minute ago that

1290
02:05:16,644 --> 02:05:26,828
If I see it on the streets, since they're taking somebody away, I'm gonna video it, I'm gonna put it on the socials, and I'm gonna call 911 because it's not legal.

1291
02:05:26,928 --> 02:05:36,472
And I need to hear from, and I've already made all the calls, but speaking to him on the phone earlier, and he really helped, thank you.

1292
02:05:37,853 --> 02:05:40,114
I found out you had a city council meeting tonight.

1293
02:05:40,174 --> 02:05:41,774
I'm like, I can speak, I can be heard.

1294
02:05:42,935 --> 02:05:45,636
I know you guys may not be able to do anything in particular,

1295
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:54,899
But if you could talk to the mayor, I've already left a message with the mayor, that I came out, that I spoke, that I, how much it means.

1296
02:05:54,979 --> 02:05:57,742
And I have a lot of notes here, but I'm not gonna have time to go into them.

1297
02:06:00,625 --> 02:06:02,186
But please do something.

1298
02:06:03,167 --> 02:06:03,908
I'm freaking out.

1299
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:05,690
And a lot of us are.

1300
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:12,653
Yeah, and I just want to say thank you for feeling like you could come down here and that you could have your voice heard.

1301
02:06:12,673 --> 02:06:15,554
That is one of the one of the roles of this body.

1302
02:06:16,494 --> 02:06:27,319
We've done a number of resolutions and had conversations where we've had residents who said, federal level isn't listening to me the state level isn't listening to me.

1303
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:28,999
I'm a resident here.

1304
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,120
Will you listen to me?

1305
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:32,201
And, you know,

1306
02:06:33,295 --> 02:06:38,709
That I think has had a lot of value for people who come down and a lot of value for me personally.

1307
02:06:40,402 --> 02:06:42,042
I'm gonna say a couple quick things.

1308
02:06:42,943 --> 02:06:53,746
One is, in a couple weeks, we are passing an ordinance to enshrine in city law protections around gender-affirming care, reproductive health care.

1309
02:06:55,186 --> 02:07:04,649
We had an ordinance in January championed by, I mean, I almost don't do, everyone else here is doing really hard work, and I just wanna thank my fellow councilors.

1310
02:07:05,689 --> 02:07:18,476
an ordinance enshrining what was a administrative policy into city ordinance law about non-cooperation of our police department with federal immigration authorities around civil immigration detainers.

1311
02:07:20,537 --> 02:07:28,801
We had a resolution at our last regular meeting in deep anger and opposition to the abduction of Ramesa Ozturk.

1312
02:07:31,035 --> 02:07:40,101
And you, you are here, you are certainly not the first person who has come to this podium or raised their hand online and spoken since November about these issues.

1313
02:07:41,462 --> 02:07:56,132
Many, many more people have sent emails or made phone calls or just posted online and I know there's a lot of people who are, I'm really scared right now and I'm one of them, sometimes more than I even think and

1314
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:07,700
You know, and I say all that to say that we're trying to do as much as we possibly can within the authority that we have to make Medford as safe as we can make it.

1315
02:08:09,803 --> 02:08:16,069
And that there, as you said, what is the state going to do, what is the federal government going to do?

1316
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:18,452
Those are really hard things that we think about too.

1317
02:08:18,512 --> 02:08:18,933
It's, you know,

1318
02:08:20,522 --> 02:08:24,584
what happens when that bridge is crossed, right?

1319
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:29,567
And we say our city law says this one thing and they come in and they say, well, we don't care about what that is.

1320
02:08:30,788 --> 02:08:38,292
And the danger that I fear in so many ways that there's a lot of road ahead of us here.

1321
02:08:38,312 --> 02:08:48,158
So I just wanted to just say those things and lift up the work of my colleagues and also say that I personally have

1322
02:08:49,358 --> 02:09:04,927
called on the mayor to take more action in news media and around not just making statements, making a statement around the abduction, but what are the way that we're gonna mobilize our community resources.

1323
02:09:05,688 --> 02:09:11,191
So I just wanted to say all of that, and I have, it's lighting up the board, everyone wants to say something as well.

1324
02:09:11,251 --> 02:09:17,995
So I will go to, I'm not sure who went first, so I'll go to Councilor Sang first.

1325
02:09:19,889 --> 02:09:22,312
I just want to thank you for being brave enough to come up here.

1326
02:09:23,553 --> 02:09:41,091
I know that, you know, this is a time when a lot of folks are scared to speak in public, fearful of the retribution that could happen to them, fearful that they're putting their names out there for a threat, you know, and

1327
02:09:43,035 --> 02:09:52,519
I really appreciate you coming here, and coming here is an act of bravery, particularly when you're being targeted by the federal administration.

1328
02:09:54,640 --> 02:10:08,847
I've spoken to this before, so I'll be a little brief, but I feel fearful, too, because of who I am and the work that I'm doing and my parents, their status in this country, a country that they've called home for 30 years, over 30 years.

1329
02:10:12,446 --> 02:10:15,687
a country in which they've lived more of their life than anywhere else.

1330
02:10:16,668 --> 02:10:20,870
And I'm fearful because of what I do that it's gonna impact them as well.

1331
02:10:21,610 --> 02:10:30,554
And that's why I think this council has been really on the forefront of thinking about productive and innovative ways that we can defend our residents.

1332
02:10:31,635 --> 02:10:39,058
So I think Zach spoke to basically all of the, almost all of the things that we've passed, but you know,

1333
02:10:39,825 --> 02:10:52,766
That non cooperation cooperation deal with ice, you know, we can't completely stop certain groups from operating in the city, but we can do what we can to protect our residents and that is.

1334
02:10:54,179 --> 02:10:56,980
you know, that's a huge safeguard for our residents.

1335
02:10:58,661 --> 02:11:11,347
Because I hate to, I would hate to imagine what would happen if we didn't have that enshrined in our city policy, in our laws, if we didn't have that non-cooperation policy in the first place and what it means for our residents.

1336
02:11:12,207 --> 02:11:21,752
I think the only thing that was left off was we also passed a resolution calling on the mayor to launch a Know Your Rights campaign in the city.

1337
02:11:22,826 --> 02:11:30,420
Um, and, you know, we suggested we were proactive and suggesting how that could go out to our residents where we could leave.

1338
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,862
the messages, the cards.

1339
02:11:33,682 --> 02:11:47,033
I think as President Behr has alluded to, I think we're bumping into a little bit of a barrier when it comes to the mayor's office with issues like this.

1340
02:11:47,614 --> 02:11:53,079
So I would really encourage residents who feel strongly about this to reach out to the mayor to let them

1341
02:11:55,260 --> 02:12:06,066
to keep up the pressure, really, to let the mayor know that, you know, it's not, that some things are greater than a political kind of play, right?

1342
02:12:06,526 --> 02:12:11,949
Like, I understand that the mayor's thinking about it in a very certain way.

1343
02:12:11,969 --> 02:12:14,830
I think her values are in the right place.

1344
02:12:15,951 --> 02:12:18,432
But I think the approach is where we differ.

1345
02:12:18,452 --> 02:12:19,153
I think

1346
02:12:20,073 --> 02:12:25,915
there's value in reaching out to the mayor and saying that, you know, a lot of this funding is going to go away anyways.

1347
02:12:26,355 --> 02:12:30,616
That even communities that haven't passed these laws are being targeted.

1348
02:12:31,316 --> 02:12:35,037
Communities that haven't done these things are being targeted as well.

1349
02:12:35,237 --> 02:12:36,398
It's not just Medford.

1350
02:12:37,278 --> 02:12:37,398
And

1351
02:12:39,576 --> 02:12:45,581
It does make a difference when we do those things, when we codify those laws, when we do your Know Your Rights campaign.

1352
02:12:46,041 --> 02:12:48,363
And really, the gain is much more than the risk.

1353
02:12:49,104 --> 02:12:54,888
And I think there are ways to do these campaigns, too, without putting people at risk.

1354
02:12:56,350 --> 02:13:00,393
But it requires those who can step up to step up.

1355
02:13:01,783 --> 02:13:07,766
And a lot of the people who have been traditionally at the forefront of these fights are the ones being targeted.

1356
02:13:08,286 --> 02:13:15,870
And so I think it becomes incumbent upon the rest of the city, particularly from the city government perspective to step up.

1357
02:13:16,771 --> 02:13:18,191
So that was that was a lot.

1358
02:13:18,351 --> 02:13:18,551
Uh huh.

1359
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:21,273
I know the councilors want to say more and don't want to take up too much time.

1360
02:13:23,254 --> 02:13:23,654
Thank you.

1361
02:13:23,674 --> 02:13:25,675
I'm gonna go Councilor Lemmick.

1362
02:13:28,791 --> 02:13:29,211
Thank you.

1363
02:13:30,691 --> 02:13:37,173
So just to repeat what other folks have said, you said we should make this into a sanctuary city.

1364
02:13:37,993 --> 02:13:43,354
We did a week before Trump took office.

1365
02:13:43,874 --> 02:13:45,874
We just called it a welcoming city ordinance.

1366
02:13:45,934 --> 02:13:46,775
It's the same thing.

1367
02:13:48,035 --> 02:13:57,497
So with regards to the mayor's response, I think there's sort of the two sides to this, which clearly I'm on one side, but is that

1368
02:14:01,244 --> 02:14:08,313
I think that she doesn't want to be too public or out there about this because everybody's afraid of losing federal funding.

1369
02:14:08,333 --> 02:14:17,523
I know that during Trump's first term, he attempted to revoke federal funding from sanctuary cities and it just got caught up in courts and ultimately failed.

1370
02:14:18,444 --> 02:14:20,627
I'm not nearly as concerned about that.

1371
02:14:20,667 --> 02:14:30,340
And I also just think that when you have, you know, federal government that's clearly turning into an autocracy, intimidation is a big part of it.

1372
02:14:31,181 --> 02:14:35,166
And it is important to stand up and just show that

1373
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:36,651
You're not afraid.

1374
02:14:36,671 --> 02:14:41,516
I know that's easier said for that's easier for some people to say than others.

1375
02:14:41,596 --> 02:14:47,622
So I don't think that it's necessarily wise for every single person to speak out on it.

1376
02:14:47,662 --> 02:14:52,688
But for those of us who are in a position where we can speak out on this and, you know,

1377
02:14:53,268 --> 02:14:56,891
put our voices out there to let us know that, let everybody know that that's not okay.

1378
02:14:56,931 --> 02:14:59,754
It's important to do that and not be intimidated.

1379
02:15:00,174 --> 02:15:06,440
And for those folks who feel like they might be more targets, they might be more of a target for this sort of a thing.

1380
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:09,683
There are a lot of

1381
02:15:10,827 --> 02:15:14,492
political organizing groups that are happening right now as a result of this.

1382
02:15:14,793 --> 02:15:20,721
Ice watches are a thing that are forming around the community at the moment.

1383
02:15:20,781 --> 02:15:23,625
So just people who are tracking the movements of ice officers.

1384
02:15:23,645 --> 02:15:24,446
I was

1385
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:48,588
I got a little bit of attention from the news personally because I'm the Secretary of the Democratic City Committee and we recently voted to approve 8,000 Know Your Rights red cards that we're currently in the early stages of trying to distribute out to nonprofits, churches, folks who have access to these sorts of communities.

1386
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:56,727
So, you know, I'm willing to appear on the news to show like what my opinions are as a local elected official because I don't think that I'm.

1387
02:15:57,503 --> 02:16:00,005
quite at the same risk of being deported personally.

1388
02:16:00,025 --> 02:16:03,928
Um, and it is, you know, it's important to do that.

1389
02:16:04,048 --> 02:16:13,076
And, you know, I received an unpleasant message from a right-wing nut job after I was publicly saying that I wanted to distribute these cards.

1390
02:16:13,676 --> 02:16:16,258
It's, it's important to understand these people are paper tigers.

1391
02:16:16,679 --> 02:16:19,000
Most of the time, you don't need to be scared of them.

1392
02:16:19,321 --> 02:16:19,581
Okay.

1393
02:16:19,621 --> 02:16:20,702
It's important to, um,

1394
02:16:22,543 --> 02:16:25,686
You know, it's important to be outspoken to show

1395
02:16:28,555 --> 02:16:33,758
to show that you're not intimidated by what's happening and to organize against that.

1396
02:16:34,138 --> 02:16:38,120
We are trying to do what we can at this level to stop that.

1397
02:16:39,841 --> 02:16:46,945
My colleagues I know are involved in other efforts themselves around this, including resolutions that have been passed through these chambers.

1398
02:16:46,965 --> 02:16:55,189
So, so yeah, but I'd just like to thank you for coming out here to speak tonight and

1399
02:16:57,743 --> 02:16:59,964
Yeah, I think it's a very brave move on your part.

1400
02:16:59,984 --> 02:17:00,745
So thank you.

1401
02:17:01,605 --> 02:17:02,466
Thank you, Mr. Lemang.

1402
02:17:03,306 --> 02:17:04,447
Council Vice President Collins.

1403
02:17:06,888 --> 02:17:07,248
Thank you.

1404
02:17:08,009 --> 02:17:15,853
Thank you, President Behrs and thank you to my colleagues for their words in response to this prompt so far and thank you so much for being here and speaking up.

1405
02:17:16,934 --> 02:17:21,436
I, this has been said before but I don't think it should go unmentioned that in it

1406
02:17:25,152 --> 02:17:38,731
It's not irrational, you know, in these times, depending on who you are and how you present and have a reasonable degree of thoughtfulness about how out there you put yourself and your convictions and to put your testimony on the record.

1407
02:17:38,771 --> 02:17:39,733
So really, thank you.

1408
02:17:41,054 --> 02:17:52,806
And I think for an advocate, such as yourself or somebody in your position, it probably goes without saying, but it shouldn't, which is that when you stand up for yourself and your own identity, you're standing up for everybody, you're standing up for everybody within marginalized identities.

1409
02:17:52,827 --> 02:17:58,513
So thank you for doing that for the residents of Medford and for continuing to hold leaders to account for doing the same.

1410
02:17:58,533 --> 02:17:59,714
I think

1411
02:18:04,481 --> 02:18:17,005
We're in such a unfortunately interesting period right now where it seems to me that a lot of the conversation, the central point for a lot of conversations is like, what are you going to do about it?

1412
02:18:18,185 --> 02:18:22,326
Which is the right question to be asking, because we all have to be doing as much as we possibly can.

1413
02:18:22,486 --> 02:18:26,027
And it's unfortunate that the thing that we have to be doing is

1414
02:18:30,568 --> 02:18:48,061
working to resist a government whose goals are actually to make Americans less safe and less healthy and less well, with worse futures and less safety and less happiness.

1415
02:18:48,742 --> 02:18:50,123
That's a shame.

1416
02:18:50,443 --> 02:18:51,043
That's a shonda.

1417
02:18:52,344 --> 02:18:53,005
And it is

1418
02:18:56,563 --> 02:19:08,207
thrusting in, I'm not a historian, but it feels to me like kind of an unprecedented time when we are at these various levels of government trying to negotiate what we can enforce and what we can ask of each other.

1419
02:19:08,487 --> 02:19:16,990
And for myself, as a person with a microphone and a title, it feels very shameful and insufficient to say

1420
02:19:19,618 --> 02:19:24,141
there is a limit that we can observe to official action.

1421
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:26,762
And in some ways, I think that goes without saying.

1422
02:19:26,942 --> 02:19:35,587
Like, I found out about the ICE presence, the reported ICE presence in South Medford earlier this week, where I live, through Reddit.

1423
02:19:36,328 --> 02:19:37,408
Because they just come in.

1424
02:19:38,349 --> 02:19:39,269
Because they just come in.

1425
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:41,531
And they don't want us to know.

1426
02:19:42,491 --> 02:19:44,693
They just come in, and they try to take people.

1427
02:19:45,453 --> 02:19:46,173
And there's no, obviously,

1428
02:19:49,295 --> 02:19:54,077
Obviously, there's no collaboration with local or state or regional forms of government because that's not the goal.

1429
02:19:54,097 --> 02:19:55,117
The goal is not to collaborate.

1430
02:19:55,137 --> 02:20:04,040
The goal is to displace people and divide communities and to make us enemies to one another, which is a completely false and inhumane pretense.

1431
02:20:07,221 --> 02:20:10,222
All that to say, I think that like we can all envision

1432
02:20:13,398 --> 02:20:17,241
responses that would help, that would stack on top of all what we're trying to do.

1433
02:20:17,801 --> 02:20:33,892
For example, I think it would be really great if the Medford Police Department and other local police departments in communities all over the nation felt more loyalty to their residents than they do to an antagonistic federal government.

1434
02:20:34,292 --> 02:20:42,218
I think it would be ideal if we didn't have to create this pseudo public service hotline

1435
02:20:42,798 --> 02:20:51,983
For example, the Luce hotline and other ice watches would be ideal if we didn't have to create a grassroots pseudo public service mechanism.

1436
02:20:52,023 --> 02:20:56,085
And if people could instead call the police and say, hey, there are people kidnapping my neighbors.

1437
02:20:57,446 --> 02:21:00,508
I don't think that people in Medford feel that they can do that.

1438
02:21:00,548 --> 02:21:08,012
And I have not received, I've not seen an indication that that is something that our public safety officials are willing to do.

1439
02:21:09,292 --> 02:21:15,754
I think that people should be able to call 911 and say, hey, ICE is here and we don't know that they have a warrant and please come protect us.

1440
02:21:16,275 --> 02:21:19,936
And that is what we should be asking our police to do.

1441
02:21:21,176 --> 02:21:38,122
What we'll continue to, and this council has to continue to call on the mayor's administration and the police department under her jurisdiction to do more and to have more loyalty to our residents and our neighbors than we do to a federal government, which we know is going to antagonize communities like ours, no matter what we do.

1442
02:21:41,468 --> 02:21:45,577
But in the meantime, I think it is also rational and needed for

1443
02:21:46,933 --> 02:21:53,937
You know, and this is the part where I feel a little bad because I want the whole answer to be stuff within our control, but I don't think that it is I don't think I don't think that's that that's realistic.

1444
02:21:54,898 --> 02:22:01,722
And that's, that's where I get very heartened to see people in our community who do not have official roles nonetheless.

1445
02:22:03,243 --> 02:22:07,926
Taking creative measures to keep each other safe by joining those ice watches by.

1446
02:22:09,907 --> 02:22:16,870
taking part in getting trained on the Luce hotline and being a part of that mechanism for keeping each other safe.

1447
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:34,857
And I should be clear, like other counselors have been, I think that the limits to how aggressive our local forces have been in being vocal and assertive and just doing, you know, leaving it all on the field, doing everything we could possibly think of

1448
02:22:35,517 --> 02:22:37,459
to combat ICE in our communities.

1449
02:22:37,519 --> 02:22:43,523
I don't think it is in any way attributable to people not caring or being okay with what's going on.

1450
02:22:43,543 --> 02:22:50,628
I'm not going to speculate about convictions or motives, but these people are members of our community too, and I don't think that's it.

1451
02:22:50,648 --> 02:22:52,209
I think it's the intimidation machine.

1452
02:22:53,689 --> 02:22:59,051
and a fear of making things worse because of retaliation.

1453
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:00,571
I just wanna make that clear.

1454
02:23:00,631 --> 02:23:01,871
I don't wanna point the finger at anybody.

1455
02:23:01,891 --> 02:23:07,813
I think that that's part of the goal of this is for us to be pointing our fingers at each other and that's not what we should be doing.

1456
02:23:07,833 --> 02:23:13,014
We need to be welcoming each other into extremely resilient local systems of public safety.

1457
02:23:13,335 --> 02:23:18,636
So to that, I think we need to continue to call upon

1458
02:23:19,582 --> 02:23:29,092
the mayor's administration, including the NPD and all of our public safety infrastructure to say, let's stand up taller together and if you do that we will have your backs.

1459
02:23:29,873 --> 02:23:39,263
And at the same time, I've seen wonderful examples in other communities of ways that these resistance methods that are getting distributed throughout the communities like

1460
02:23:40,343 --> 02:23:48,345
If we could have, you know, a house with a megaphone and some noisemakers on every block, you know, where we train people so that there's like a house with a megaphone and noisemakers on every block.

1461
02:23:48,385 --> 02:23:56,368
So if you know what to look for, and if you do, again, I'm not trying to be inflammatory for the sake of being inflammatory, it's just we know this is what's going on.

1462
02:23:57,288 --> 02:24:01,632
And what we need is a siren that goes off whenever ICE is there trying to kidnap people.

1463
02:24:01,672 --> 02:24:04,074
And that would be great if that could be Medford police.

1464
02:24:04,894 --> 02:24:06,616
But if it's not, it has to be the residents.

1465
02:24:06,856 --> 02:24:10,739
And then ideally, our official public safety capacity can be a part of that too.

1466
02:24:13,161 --> 02:24:15,182
So I'm sorry if I've gone on a little bit long.

1467
02:24:15,282 --> 02:24:20,687
I find it very fraught and challenging, the question of

1468
02:24:24,637 --> 02:24:28,018
As your representatives, I feel the responsibility that we should be able to fix this all on our own.

1469
02:24:28,818 --> 02:24:43,121
And we can't, and we'll keep trying, but we have to enthusiastically collaborate with each other to resist this for as long as it takes.

1470
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:44,101
Thank you.

1471
02:24:46,261 --> 02:24:49,402
Thank you, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro.

1472
02:24:52,242 --> 02:24:52,603
Thank you.

1473
02:24:53,003 --> 02:24:53,724
Thanks for coming out.

1474
02:24:57,247 --> 02:24:59,629
As everybody mentioned, we were working on it.

1475
02:25:00,189 --> 02:25:14,382
Another thing I wanted to say is that I've received a few communications from residents very similar to yourself, who have been saying, you know, like, I wish we could

1476
02:25:15,283 --> 02:25:16,083
do more together.

1477
02:25:16,183 --> 02:25:19,965
I wish there were more people who would wanna work with me on this.

1478
02:25:20,005 --> 02:25:23,526
And these are just sort of lay people or people that I know in the community.

1479
02:25:23,546 --> 02:25:31,329
And every person I say the same thing to, I'm like, there are other people like you, you guys should talk to each other and you can organize together.

1480
02:25:31,490 --> 02:25:37,672
And I would love to get your contact information after this because I can try to put something together with people that are corresponding with me.

1481
02:25:39,213 --> 02:25:43,414
And to echo what everybody says,

1482
02:25:45,391 --> 02:25:51,513
We are very aware we have limited resources, but the mayor's office has more that could potentially be done.

1483
02:25:53,893 --> 02:26:02,676
But also the strategy here that is working is trying to get people to be afraid and then do nothing.

1484
02:26:03,636 --> 02:26:09,298
And some of the departments in the city are taking that and going in that direction.

1485
02:26:09,318 --> 02:26:09,978
And I think

1486
02:26:10,743 --> 02:26:18,427
our body is not going in that direction, which is still doesn't mean it's not very scary.

1487
02:26:19,567 --> 02:26:23,529
It just means that we're resisting that impulse.

1488
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:36,176
I would also say that it seems like the communities that are resisting the administration's push to inaction,

1489
02:26:37,672 --> 02:26:39,453
are getting to the administration.

1490
02:26:39,513 --> 02:26:48,376
There were some executive orders that came out today where the president would like to crack down on sanctuary cities.

1491
02:26:48,396 --> 02:26:52,338
I think that's because it's really bothering him that there are sanctuary cities.

1492
02:26:52,358 --> 02:26:59,961
I think that means that it means that that level of resistance, local resistance is effective and that it means you keep doing it.

1493
02:27:00,982 --> 02:27:04,943
You don't stop doing something because it's having an effect.

1494
02:27:05,964 --> 02:27:06,864
You don't pull back.

1495
02:27:07,423 --> 02:27:11,486
when the thing that you're doing is achieving your goal.

1496
02:27:13,068 --> 02:27:19,152
You keep resisting, you continue to show up, you continue to say no, you continue to protect people.

1497
02:27:19,172 --> 02:27:27,639
Our job on city council, and I say this in a lot of different, about a lot of different issues, is to protect our residents first and foremost.

1498
02:27:27,739 --> 02:27:34,805
So it's very clear to me that if there is somebody who's

1499
02:27:35,312 --> 02:27:38,793
coming to try to do something that is the opposite of protecting our residents.

1500
02:27:38,913 --> 02:27:41,573
Our role is to continue to protect them.

1501
02:27:42,154 --> 02:27:44,594
So however we can do that, we're gonna continue to do that.

1502
02:27:44,794 --> 02:27:48,215
So thank you for voicing your opinion and coming to the meeting.

1503
02:27:50,115 --> 02:27:52,396
If I can grab your email, that'd be great.

1504
02:27:52,836 --> 02:27:53,136
Thank you.

1505
02:27:58,257 --> 02:27:58,617
Thank you.

1506
02:27:58,637 --> 02:28:01,778
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak in public participation?

1507
02:28:05,693 --> 02:28:06,916
Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

1508
02:28:08,539 --> 02:28:12,006
On the motion to adjourn by Councillor Zara, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

1509
02:28:12,246 --> 02:28:12,868
All those in favour?

1510
02:28:13,649 --> 02:28:13,970
Opposed?

1511
02:28:14,050 --> 02:28:15,633
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

1512
02:28:15,653 --> 02:28:15,934
Thank you.
